0,"You got a date with her..

That makes her in your league"
1,You slap his ass and make a sexual remark. 
2,"Damn, you are just skipping violence or police and going right to the nuclear option. I like you. "
3,Reread nice things he's said to me over text when I feel lonely.
4,"Currently dating a girl who has 120k+ followers on IG and 90k+ on Twitter.  Shes kinda of an ""insta-model"", and she actually gets offers from people like Pink and Starbucks to showcase their product on her IG.  

Lots of things are as to be expect: she gets a LOT of DMs from horny guys and guys in general.  Like a Huge amount. Sometimes she post pictures with me included and it seems to be the general consensus that I am not in her league, physically, by a lot.  She gets a lot of people offering something ""better"" Yada Yada Yada. I try to not let it get to me.  

I've actually been harassed by people who tracked down my IG either offering me money for her nudes (this was even while she was underage) or telling me I'm not good enough for her.  

Honestly, besides those, and the occasional person to recognize her irl, it's pretty much a normal relationship.  She's down to earth and smart and funny and really enjoys the money and exposure she's getting. She's happy, so I'm happy and supportive.  


Edit: since some people are curious, I met and dated her BEFORE she was famous. She's only become IG famous in the last year and a half.  

Edit 2: No guys, I will not be linking her profile. I most definetly do not want my reddit with all its sordid history and her IG to ever make contact.  Ever.  She doesn't even know my handle.  Stop PMing me, it's getting annoying "
5,"Yes. I have. Which was awkward, because I did like 5 minutes of leg and stomach kissing to tease her. When I took her underwear off, I instantly changed my mind and pretended I wasn't definitely about to eat her out.

edit -  Just a little more of the story, because it's gross and funny-

We'd been FWB's for a few months, and she'd never had a problem with smell before. This must've been some kind of freak occurrence, and it was brutal. Now, I get it. It's not going to smell like fresh baked cinnamon rolls down there, and that's totally cool. I generally like how it smells, actually, and this girl always smelled and tasted great.

But not this day. Something had gone horribly, terribly wrong in her vagoo. It smelled like somebody fermented a hobo's armpit in morning breath on a hot day. I'm pretty sure inhaling that took ten years off the end of my life, and five off of everybody else in the apartment building. This was curdled milk's grosser older brother who stopped taking showers because he's entered a weird phase in his life. 

After I took her underwear off, I grabbed my quickly waning boner and tried to jerk it back to some semblance of erection, while burying my face in her neck in hopes that it would stifle the smell. It permeated the room immediately. Thinking quickly, I stuffed my roughly 3/4 erect dick into the source of the smell, hoping this would provide adequate distraction while simultaneously plugging the raw sewage pipe that had apparently replaced her vagina. 

It worked. We had half-hearted sex for all of 5 more minutes filled with my silent prayer and begging for the merciful release of death, before I sort of rolled off. I'm sure she could tell my heart wasn't in it anymore. In a commendable effort to rally my failing spirit for one more go at her vagina/Waffle House grease trap, she slid down the bed to give me a blow job. She was normally amazing at this, but, moments after her tongue touched the pungent juices coating my dick and balls, she gave me a look exactly like that gif where the puppy licks a lime for the first time. It was a weird mixture of disgust, confusion, and epiphany.

She smacked her lips for a few seconds, trying to determine whether she'd just licked my cock or an old leaky battery, and slowly slid back up the bed. We sat in silence for a few minutes, before she went in for a kiss. I tried my damnest to reciprocate, I swear to God I did, but, like a kid who got bumped ahead 2 grades and hasn't had his growth spurt yet and gets bullied alot by kids with shitty parents on the playground, I flinched. The stench had made the impossible transfer from her pussy to my dick, to her mouth. There was no mistaking my recoil for anything else but pure disgust. She put her underwear on in silence, while I cracked the bedroom window. 

I still run into her at parties sometimes, but we've apparently silently agreed to avoid all eye contact. I'm okay with this. "
6,"I don't think 'being a man' has ever been more difficult or confusing than it is right now.

Today's men are expected to show traditional 'manly' traits, and at the same time are looked down on and derided when they do."
7,It makes more sense if you read the entire sentence and don't stop there. 
8,"""I hope this leaves a mark for your boyfriend."""
9,"My wife is with some dude who mods a quarter-million subbed subreddit. She hates all the time he wastes on that stupid site, but she likes the cool people he met through the work. "
10,"Can you find his family on Facebook? You could message his mom and tell her what's up, preferably with screenshots."
11,"&gt; Why do you like hanging out here?

I value learning about male perspectives on things.

&gt;What is your favorite thing about this forum?

Men."
12,"Filed a temporary restraining order against me. It showed up on my 30th birthday morning. I looked at it for a second. Read the letter she wrote for it. Acussing me of abusing her and other lies. It was the punctuation on the sentence to really end it for me. Showing the depths she would go to.

I threw it in garbage, told everyone about it so it couldn't sneak up on me in public. Went and got toasted with my friends. Everyone who knows, knows it was all bullshit as I found she had done it to a previous guy. 

Several weeks later another cop showed up handing me a piece a paper showing it got dismissed due to lack of evidence. 

However in case she sees this, go fuck yourself Madysen. Your name is spelled stupid too. "
13,"I guess I kind of dated/was sleeping with a woman who is a B list celebrity in her country for a little while. 

Funny thing was, when I met her, I had no idea. Every time we'd go out, people would come up and say hi to her, talk to her, etc. However it was always in her native language, which I didn't speak, so I had no idea what they were saying. I'm an idiot so I just thought she had a lot of friends. 

One night we were at a bar, and for whatever reason, a guy walked up to her and started off his conversation in English by saying how big of a fan he was. I was kind of taken aback. 

Afterwards, I looked at her and said ""Hey, you're kind of famous here, aren't you?""

""Yeah,"" she said, "" I guess so."" 

""Oh,"" I replied, ""I honestly had no idea at all.""

She laughed a bit and said ""I know, that's why I like you!"" 

We still talk from time to time. She's more well known in her country now, and she's a lovely person. We still hang out when I happen to be in her country/city, which is typically a few times a year. Now, however, I know why we don't have to wait in lines any any popular bars/clubs when we go out, and why she seems to be friends with everyone everywhere we go =P"

15,Not to be trusted. They take them off and they go from super babe goth chick status to wrinkly old crone with a dusty vagina. 
16,I'm convinced that women who don't let their men watch porn have some serious issues. 
17,"My girl learned that her friend's BF watches porn (and admits it) and that this would bother the shit out of her if I did.

Welp."
18,"Great advice brah.

**Q:** How do I deal with my insecurities?

**A:** Just don't have insecurities."
19,"Spank her, grab her, press her into the sheets as you stuff her, pull her arms when you enter, playfully choke her. Anything beyond that you need to get to know her better first."
20,"Only half joking, but maybe go to /r/askgaymen ?

Most of us here don't know how to suck a dick.

Edit: Thanks for all the guys that directed OP (and me I guess) to the appropriate sub for this inquiry which apparently is /r/askgaybros "
21,"Always do, and I get a little ~~offended~~ disappointed if she says she doesn't want me to. I also make it a point to make out with the girl right after she's gone down on me, just so she doesn't think I'm disgusted by where her mouth has been. I don't really take it for granted that she'll go down on me though. 

I tend to do whatever I think the girl will like the most, since her having a great time is honestly a requirement for me to have a good time. I actually am a lot more confident in my skills during foreplay than during sex. It has happened more than a few times that the girl basically says, after cumming a couple of times during foreplay, ""ok, you *need* to start fucking me now, I can't wait any longer."""
22,"Slaps, spanks, dirty words, hard thrusts, choking, holding down, etc.

I would strongly advise talking to her before trying some of these things without warning.

I never met a girl who isn't OK with spanking, but I wouldn't risk slapping a girl while calling her a ""dirty little slut"" without checking if she's fine with this kind of stuff."
23,Experience and a higher level of maturity. God I wanna date an older girl.
24,"Generally ""you don't love me""  when I refuse to do sometimes she wants. "
25,"Pretty much.

No one is above or below you, OP. Remember that.


Everyone poops."
26,"Not me, but one of my good mates is dating/fucking an apparently famous dancer atm (100k+ ig followers, from memory). 

He's wearing it as a badge of honour though. I mean he doesn't brag or anything, but he thinks it's cool that he's sleeping with someone that so many guys froth over.

All the boys can't stand her though lol. She's fairly obnoxious. "
27,"""You know you're not good enough for her.  I can give her things you can't.  My bank and dick are the same...huge. You have to admit that you can't take care of her like I can, so give me her number.  Thanks, bruh"" /s

-your inbox on ig I take it. "
28,"Id avoid actual choking, but having your hand on her throat or holding the very bottom of her jaw would have a similar effect without possibly going too far. All the others are good ideas though. Be mindful of how she reacts to any of these!"
29,Gotta make sure it smells right. Why would I stick my dick in something I wouldn't put next to my face.
30,"There is only one sure way I've found to deal with it. 

Be a two pump chump for round 1, then a bucking stallion for round 2"
31,I started to reset my sleep schedule to normal people hours and I feel so much better.
32,"i'm basically dating pornhub, does that count?"
33,"I move her shit.

Not in a malicious way, it's just that she used to never be able to find her keys or her purse or her charger, so when she gets home I take a mental note of where she puts them and later I move them all to the same place so if she finds one she's found all of them.

I haven't told her I've done it, I just started doing it one day. SShe just thinks that's where she left them.

I don't think I'll ever tell her, it's like two minutes out of my day and it's not really a big deal. Early on I thought I might use it as a way to end a tiny argument about something like the laundry but honestly it's just part of my daily routine now."
34,"Sorry that this was a negative experience for you, but it sounds *fucking hilarious*."
35,"Well, I wouldn't have even considered posting this, but reading all the other posts, I realized maybe I've got a decent story, relatively.

So for awhile, I was dating a woman who's VERY well known in my industry. It's not super impressive, it's a small industry, but literally every event we went to, she would know everybody and random people from other parts of the world would welcome her and things like that.

She's said that her previous boyfriend didn't deal with it very well, basically got super jealous that she was getting all this attention and he was basically ignored. Personally, I know enough people that I could just peace out if I got bored, but hanging around her was a good way to network anyway.

The best experience was, she had an interview for a job and I gave her a ride. The guy ended up buying us dinner, and there was a point where I realized, ""Hey, I'm kinda arm candy here. That's actually kinda cool!"" But again, I was getting something out of it: while she turned down the job, I just finished a short contract with that organization.

EDIT: A space."
36,"I think you underestimate how much young guys hate the bullshit games we deal with when trying to date younger women.

Older women generally aren't about the games any more, they're more experienced and aren't time wasters. Confidence is also attractive in women, and I can speak from personal experience when I say that confidence isn't something that I usually see in women my age these days. Rather, a lot of women seem to think that talking about their insecurities and joking about them makes them more approachable or likable, when really it's the opposite."
37,I was bending down to pick up a shopping basket and she humped me from behind so hard that I went sprawling into a rack of chips...
38,"&gt;However in case she sees this, go fuck yourself Madysen. Your name is spelled stupid too.

Hell yeah, it is. Yikes. "
39,"I'm sure this is terrible advice, but nobody would fault you for punching him in the fucking face.

It may not be a bad idea to look into a restraining order if it's a continued issue. I think the facebook message takes it from wondering if there's some kind of reasonable explanation to obvious harassment."
40,"Being ""the representative"" of your race. If you're the single/one of very few black people in a group, you're expected to serve as the ambassador of black people, or the ""symbol of diversity,"" whether you like it or not. Working as the only black male on university's orientation team and later again as a Resident Assistant in my dorm, it meant being front-and-center for official photos and sometimes being questioned by assholes as to whether I had ""earned"" my position. I was also constantly fielding issues and concerns from black parents and residents because they wanted to be sure the answers they were getting from other staff members were legitimate, leading to many an awkward conversation.

It's because of that there's also the pressure to go beyond the norm or else be seen as a failure. Growing up, you constantly get the lecture from everyone in your community (parents, elders, deacons, the janitor) that institutional racism still exists, meaning you MUST get high grades and high achievements to leave no doubts on your qualifications, because ""average"" black people are skipped over. 

I couldn't even escape this during college; when I once explained to my adviser, an older black man who had appointed himself as my mentor, that I was feeling burnt out from junior year and didn't know what to do, he just looked out the window and asked me, ""So, *you want to go to jail* then?"" After collecting my bearings and demanding what the hell that was supposed to mean, he ""explained"" that being a black male with mediocre grades would make me a statistic,  who usually ended up ""poor, prison, or perished,"" so I couldn't afford to be burnt out. I can't imagine any of my white friends receiving a lecture like this, much less from a university professor.

And after you adjust yourself do this by getting good grades, practicing good behavior, speaking diction, etc., only to then be accused by some of ""acting white?"" Damn it, I did not ask for this."
41,"Between the constant laying around, sleeping, eating and obsession with my wife's boobs I'd say quite a bit "
42,"I was at a bar right around when I turned 21, so I was a bit new to the scene. I made small talk with a girl who abruptly said ""it's my birthday!"" I naively said ""oh, then I'll buy you a drink!"" I brought her a drink and as soon as she got it, it was like a switch was flipped - she ignored me or gave one-word answers."
43,"You are the average of 5 people you hang out with. I started considering them carefully, huge change"
44,"Eh,  the most blatant is when I worked security at a casino.  A couple of women didn't look old enough for me to give me a pass,  I asked for ID,  they didn't have it,  they tried to flirt ala ""come on Mr security man, you wouldn't want to ruin out night would you *wink wink push out chest*"".

That kind of stuff was super common,  to the point where security guys just stopped responding to it. 

They went home to get their ids. "
45,"Depends on the girl tbh, the more attractive I find her the more likely I'll be heading down there "
46,"Circumcised (i am):  Wash it like anything else.  Avoid abrasive sponges.

Uncircumcised (I know from researching for my uncircumcised son):  There is a lot of dangerous misinformation out there.  Do NOT retract his foreskin.  He can retract it as much as he likes.  It will hurt before he retracts it too far.  There is a large variation in when a boy's foreskin will become fully retractable.  Some people will tell you you have to wash inside the foreskin but that's not true until it becomes retractable.  While it's still adhered to the glans, just wash the outside.  The undetached foreskin is self-sealing - there can be a little pee residue in there, but it won't smell or cause infection because air can't get to it.  Its like the inside of the urethra - you never get every single drop of pee out, but without exposure to air it remains sterile."
47,"I have a savings  account set up for us that I add some to each month, it's at about 30k now. 

I don't tell her because if she knew I made more than I tell her I do she would find things that we should spend it on, money burns a hole in her pocket. "
48,I did. Come to think of it I've never been courted or had a date initiated by a woman. Ever.
49,"Dating is expensive. Going out for coffee is vastly cheaper than going for a full dinner before you even know if you like someone. And if you don't like that person, it can be a 20 minute date instead of an hour where you have to fake an emergency call to get away from the crazy."
50,assume that she was underestimating the sorts of stuff I might want to do
51,"&gt;  I've asked her what she likes and she's been pretty vague, but she's always made clear she doesn't want me to make love to her.


Danger, Will Robinson!  Don't ask a bunch of dudes in the internet what rough sex means, ask the woman saying she wants rough sex.  **We're** not the ones the cops will be asking if this thing goes south.  If she wants to play I'm-not-dirty-cuz-I-didnt-say-the-words, let her play with someone else.  Someone who isn't comfortable enough with what she wants to put it in words is someone who could struggle with shame feelings in the morning and start looking to externalize that shame, and that's you in a mean spot of trouble boy.  "
52,"went on a couple dates with me to get to know a friend of mine that she was actually interested in.

55,"Hey op,
I'm a cop but not in your area so I'm not certain how the law translates to where you are. 
Here he would be charged with sexual assault. She needs to report this to the police asap. Don't wait a week to see if it gets better, go to the police now and report it. This shit isn't on.
"
56,"&gt;&gt;What is your favorite thing about this forum?

&gt;Men.

And there are some *mennnnn* here :-) 

Pro-tip for bored and openminded women of /r/askmen ....read the answers to the ""What's your type of girl?"" posts. You might find a man posting about an oddly specific mix of traits that you might just happen to have. 

I did this... I got stood up one night, trying to entertain myself on Reddit, and found a description of myself in one of these threads. The description was so dead-on specific it was creepy.  

So I popped off something flirty in response, he messaged me and ....two months later spent an amazing, fun, sex-filled long weekend with said redditor. He and I are still really good friends to this very day :) 

best thing to happen to me on /r/askmen  haha"

58,"Assuming she's real, most guys are going to try to show off how impressive they are so she'll like them.

Your best bet is to do the opposite. Ask her questions and get her talking. But don't turn it into an interview. Keep it a conversation.

**BAD**

""Do you like dogs?"" ""Yes."" ""Do you like cats?"" ""No."" ""Do you like to travel?"" ""Sure."" ""What's your favorite color?"" ""Blue.""

**BETTER**

""So, anything exciting happen to you today?"" ""Sadly, no. It was all meetings today. I didn't even get to eat lunch."" ""Oh, no. What were you going to have?"" ""No, it's ok. It happens sometimes. But my coworker Rachel and I were hoping to try this new cafe that opened around the corner.""

See the difference?

EDIT: God, people. I get it. The second example is not a perfect conversation. But it still illustrates the difference between simply asking lots of unrelated questions and asking questions related to her answers, which is what I was trying to get at.

63,"After my wife and I were married she became frigid in bed which meant that anything sexual had been cut down to a tenth of the before marriage frequency was. I assumed there were major problems that needed to worked out. She immediately starts demanding that we start having children. I tell her we need counselling because I didn't think either one of us was happy.

Through couples therapy it was ""discovered"" that we did have some problems but she also had some problems of her own including some sexual abuse when she was younger. As the therapy continued she started to warm up to me and very quickly became very sexy, very provocative, and just incredibly lustful all the time. Through therapy it was realised that she had gone off her birth control and indeed was trying for a baby without my knowledge.

68,"I was married to a Narcissist she presented herself as a conservative, hard working country girl. Turned out she was a narcissistic gold digger from Palm Springs, California. So shortly after meeting this girl I was badly injured including a brain hemmhorrage. By the time I had my full faculties she had moved me into an expensive house from my frugal apartment, spent all of my savings, run up $10k in debt, and rushed us into a marriage. 

She was the ""bad things happened to me in the past so my bad behavior is justified now"". Want to go on vacation? She didn't have a childhood. Everything was someone else's fault and ""they"" were always out to get her.

She systematically drove off all my friends and family. She even destroyed a career for me by making us Social Pariahs necessitating a move because she wanted to move. I make 2/3 what I made then years later and I prefer the old area to this one. 

It took a lot longer than it should have for me to figure it out. I spent years trying to help her. Then I realized she didn't want help...and I was like everyone else she mistreated. She respected no boundaries. She would wake me up to argue. She would throw embarrassing public fits. She'd scream at family members or friends with no filter. 

She was like a Harpy sent to steal my happiness and befoul any scraps left to me. 

When I finally went to family to ask for help getting a divorce people were relieved and threw money at me. I have friends and family again. I'm supporting both households now and I'm happier with more money in my pocket. I can't wait for the divorce to be final. Getting that Parasite mostly off my

Practical joker that I am, we had a bunch of small firecrackers.  I lit it and decided I'd drop it in the toilet bowl to make it a little less painfully loud.  These are really small firecrackers.  What's the worst that can happen.  It's not like...

SPLOOOOP!

73,"The story that lead to this is pretty dark for me so I'll go to the end. 

I was dating a great girl for a couple of months we walked into a restaurant and a girl I previously dated was there with some friends. I told my gf we need to go somewhere else. As we were leaving of one the friends of the old girl runs out and she screams at me saying ""Julie's pregnant and it's your kid!""  

My heart sank. I was 21 and a loser. No idea what I was going to do. I go into the restaurant to calmly talk to Julie.  She confirmed she was pregnant and she was keeping the kid and she wanted nothing to do with me blah blah. 

I did not know where Julie lived all I had was her cell phone number which she changed. I wanted to be a good man and take care of this kid if anything at least financially. Over the next few months the anxiety destroyed me. I failed school that semester, I lost my gf, lost my job and was pretty ill from not eating. 

Fast forward to about 8 months later I am at some party chatting up some girl. We have mutual friends and she's says ""oh you're that Adam! The one that dated Julie?!  I can't believe she did that to you!!"" ""Did what"" I asked. She said ""you know, faked the whole pregnancy thing to get back at you for dumping her""

I could not believe it. It was all a lie to get revenge. She was never pregnant. She just wanted to fuck with me. I immediately left the party and went home. That was the first good nights sleep I had in almost a year. 

TLDR: girl faked a pregnancy to get ""revenge"" and nearly destroyed my life in the process. "

Main appeal (to me, at least) is that I've found women who are older usually know what they want and have less time for bullshit. they're more up front. They know what's worth stressing over and what isn't. I'd happily have a serious relationship with someone older than me if the conditions were right.

My advice is to just be yourself. I mean, that's who he asked out after all, so just have fun and see where it goes."

* get kinky ideas of things to do with her from things I see around when I'm out in public"
83,"Finally i can contribute. My GF is a model who over the past year has become relatively famous. She has been in billboards in time square for high end brands. She has about 500k followers on IG.

I am not going  to go into details about her because i want this kept on the DL. She is 19 and i am a few years older. We met last year when she moved to LA. She was not famous when we first met, but after a certain photoshoot she just blew up. 

Her ego has been pretty chill, though at times she does get a little big headed. It doesn't really bother me because she has been working really hard and i sometimes tell her its ok to brag. Since she is signed to one of the biggest modeling agency she got to be friends with a lot of other models and the stories she tells me are crazy. She gets offers from guys to fly her out to sleep with her for $20,000. Prostitution in the modeling industry is apparently SUPER common. If you see any models in Ibiza, Dubai, or Miami and they don't post anything about work, then there is a good chance that they are ""escorting"". 

One of the downfalls about her being in higher demand as a model is that we can no longer get into kinky stuff. Before we would do spanking and choking and we would have a week for the bruises to heal before she had to do a photoshoots and two weeks for any extreme bruises to heal. Now i can't leave any marks on her because she is working almost every week whether it's photoshoots, meetings, or castings. The up side is that she has been thinking about letting me dom for another girl which is nice, but i really miss doing those things with her.

She is kind of my sugar mama at times since i have a pretty shitty paying job, I love my job, but it's more passion than profit.

/u/ShitFuckDickCunt hit it spot on with the harassment that i sometimes get from random dudes about me not being good enough. I am not ugly, but i am nowhere near her ""league"". She has a pretty big fan base consisting of girls ages 14-22 and she always gets art work from them. It honestly puts a huge smile on my face when i see the happiness she gets when she sees that someone spent time on a drawing of her or an edited video of her. She has scrapbooks with all of the drawings she has gotten or printed from people.

The shitty part about dating a model is the minimal amount of physical connection. She travels all the time so at max we see each other 3 times a week and sometimes not at all.

My ego has taken a HUGE boost. All my life i have been self conscious of my scars. I have acne scars and cuts on my face and scars all over my body. Being with her has definitely made me fell a lot more confident."

104,"I dated a girl who had a few thousand followers on Tumblr. It was.. weird. 

Let's start by saying she spends hours on the site. We're talking 4-5 a day. That's just posting stuff, interacting, and looking at other people's stuff.

Her specific blog was about tattoos and body modifications. So every few days she'd feel completely warranted in going out and testing a new modification. She'd take lots of pictures of herself and share them online. Some of them were a bit on the scandalous side but hey, this was her hobby and it really didn't affect us in any real way. 

She did have some body dysmorphia, depression, and in the end she cheated on me with a guy with more tattoos ( or so I've been lead to believe by my friends) but every girl is different. My takeaway from the whole experience is that usually what people do on the internet has some sort of impact on their behaviour and that it can become extreme."

106,"Another short Indian guy here, 26, but first official girlfriend (way out of my league) at 25. Also had a weird face till I grew out a beard (highly suggest growing one out in the next few hours before your date).


The best way to approach this first date is to not worry about having her to really like you, but make it so she has a natural conversation with you and feels comfortable.


Don't go all out on first date. Simple movie and dinner works fine, because you guys can discuss movie over dinner. Or go play bowling so she associates fun with you. Have a few conversation topics at hand. Maybe discuss common favorite shows, career topics, and discuss further of topics conversations you had online. Dress casual, but also dress to impress (like you're going to a house party and want to look good). And be humble of yourself, while show a great deal of interest in what her interest and opinions are.


Also, something I learned is that don't talk too much of her attractiveness. Like don't ask her ""but you're so beautiful, why are you single? I bet you can get any guy you want!"" She probably knows that, but she chose to go on this date with you so she chose you. Be happy and confident about that.


Other than that, best of luck."
107,"When I was younger, I used to buy into the idea that people that worked out a lot, in other words the typical ""meathead"", weren't smart people. Then I started getting into fitness and realized that this wasn't true. There are plenty of smart and confident people in the gym. You can be a bro and be an engineer or doctor. It's actually a little easier to be successful when you're fit. "
108,"People should get married before having kids. Kids are a lifelong commitment. That commitment should be codified.

Here's how that can manifest:

Don't do the dishes so you can tally down a favor you just did for your SO. Do the dishes because she's tired and you genuinely don't want her to have to do them. 

If you want her to trust you with other girls, don't tell your SO you're hanging out with ""friends"" if you're hanging out with Laura. Tell her you're hanging out with Laura. Text her while you're out with Laura. Get home when you say you're going to get home.

146,"Racism (I'm going to be that guy). Not the police arresting you (never happened to me) or people going out of their way to avoid you on the street (has happened a couple of times). I remember when I was little, my African immigrant mother who spent an insignificant portion of her life in America told me that white people are racist, and they'll try to bring me down. I always brushed off her words at my young age as I had plenty of white friends and they were no different than my black friends. But, after growing up, I can see where she's coming from. I don't totally agree with her though. Racism doesn't really become apparent that often when you're a little black kid. However, when you become a black male adult anywhere that isn't Africa, you would be naive not to notice that your race significantly affects your life. 

I go to a University with a white majority, which is probably around 80% white students, and 4% black. I'm really hard to offend and don't really get mad at all at anything. I'm the kind of guy who likes to make a joke out of anything. My friends will be talking about fancy internships, and tell me I'm so smart Companies will love to have me to fill their quotas. Doesn't really help when companies have a quota of one, and he's the janitor. I've carried some non black people through a whole course (did all the work in the group projects) who've gotten full time job offers from companies where I can't even get an interview for an internship. Affirmative action only really benefits Caucasian women, but hurts African American men (seen as incapable of getting a job any other way). Some friends will talk about girl troubles and tell me I have it easy because there are some girls who want me just because I'm black. I find there are more non black women who aren't interested in black men because of their skin color. 

There's more faces of racism that I don't feel like writing down because I don't want to be on Reddit for hours or end up on a racist subreddit's watch list, haha. My friends either don't get or don't care that people assume a lot of negative things about me based on my skin color."

180,"I thought it was obvious enough in the root comment, but I hammered the punchline home for those who didn't get it on the first run. "
181,"Well dicks make up pretty big part of man's masculinity, not many men are going to feel like champions about to rock a woman's world when they reveal to her for the first time their 3.5"" dick, sex isn't enjoyable or something to look forward to and get excited about in those conditions, it's nerve-wracking and embarrassing and basically like revealing their greatest shame to main person they want to think they're really cool and hot. 

And usually those guys will have a boat load of painful rejections where girls who were into them rejected them after seeing their dick, sometimes in pretty painful ways, and girls talk, a guy with a small dick knows if he tries to date a girl among his friends there's a chance she'll laugh in his face and then tell everyone they know, and then he becomes a joke. And of course porn just makes these guys feel worse, I'm doing alright myself and porn still makes you feel like you're not up to scratch, I can't imagine how bad it makes small guys feel. There's no push to get average dicks in porn, men don't make a group called #BonersAtEverySize, they just suffer in silence.

A guy with a small dick can never really be the naturally sexually confident guy who makes girls' eyes light up when he takes of his pants and has girls in awe and wanting to bone him just to see what it's like. They know that no matter how girls say it doesn't matter, it's one area where they will never be able to measure up to other guys and there's nothing they can do about it, and their partners are likely think about their ex's big dick from time to time and talk about it with their friends whenever the topic of dicks come up. He knows he'll never be the best dick she ever had, even if he does get into a relationship or married, and that's hard for a lot of men. There's nothing comparable in the female experience, boobs are a secondary sexual characteristic and most guys like pretty much all sizes and you can even get breast implants, whereas dicks pretty much determine what sex is going to feel like for the woman and how much fun it can be. No body part is judged more harshly.

I thought since the consensus on this thread was that women come here to understand things from men's perspective I'd try to comprehensively explain why men can feel that way, since you found it difficult to empathize with.

EDIT: I actually just got gold a few hours ago from a different comment, when it rains it pours. Thanks, anonymous benefactor. There's not many people talking seriously about the emotionally complex ramifications of having a small penis, maybe it's time more people did."
182,"I wouldn't assume a girl is a virgin unless she was really shy, awkward, or lacking in sexual vibes. "
183,"Communication.  I'm generally a little more frank about subjects like this than most women would probably care for, but it's how I'd want to be treated.  You could always suggest you two eating healthier together, or doing more physical activities together.  If you want to minimize brushback, don't call it fat, call it unhealthy.  


Physical attraction is a requirement in a relationship.  There's nothing to feel bad about saying that.  If you think it's the most important thing, sure, maybe you should do some thinking on that, but I suspect you just have issues with just a baseline of attraction."
184,"This happened to a good friend.  Only a different ending.  She was all warm and seductive at the beginning of the marriage, got pregnant and shut him out of any further sex for two years then got all warm and cozy again, had another baby.  How I wish he had had some therapy during those years. He couldn't bear the thought of losing his kids so he stuck it out and eventually out of desperation got a girlfriend on the side.  Wife got wind of it and threw a huge fit of course but he told her too bad, he wasn't going to live out the rest of his life sexless.  She backed down and they continued on, no divorce, she with her hobbies and friends and him with his hobbies and outside girlfriend(s).  Kids grew up, realize that dad's fooling around, get self-rightously mad at him for being disloyal to mom. The dad takes the heat because he doesn't want to disparage their mother to the kids.  Watching all this unfold made me a lot less judgmental of people who have affairs.  My friend's affairs were usually with women who were also married and in sexless relationships.  They were all trying to keep from tearing up what they had built and at the same time have some love in their lives.  I don't condone it as the best solution, but I have come to accept and understand it to a degree."

187,"&gt; There is a large variation in when a boy's foreskin will become fully retractable.

Part of why it's not retractable is that there are usually some adhesions between the inner foreskin and the glans. These should go away with time, but trying to force it is painful. It's not uncommon for them to last into the early teens. Let him know that eventually it should be retractable (not stretching it can lead to phimosis), but as rapiertwit said, let him set his own time table.

Soap - some guys have issues with soap irritating the glans or foreskin, but in general it's fine to use whatever he uses for the rest of his body. The problem women have is specific to pH. If there is irritation after washing, try a different soap, or if that's not enough then he can switch to just water."

193,"The problem with these people is that they act ""cool"" as long as they feel comfortable, but once authorities are involved they're huge bitches that play the role of an upset citizen and make up stories about how you actually attacked them for no reason. For this reason, whatever you do, involve other people. Gather 2-3 guys and have a talk with him. Also, neutral non-involved witnesses are worth their weight in gold.

As for what to do, there has to be two choices: de-escalation and escalation. The de-escalation option: Demand him to apologize and make sure he understands he's not going to do that again. He has to have the option to not escalate it himself. Act firm, people like this don't respect anyone that is not willing to assert themselves. If that doesn't work and he starts picking a fight, use sufficient force, whichever way you have chosen to act, legally or illegally. People like this feel comfortable as long as they feel they have any control. Remove that.

But don't get high on violence. By definition, punishment is something that doesn't benefit you, and you should walk away and stop it whenever it becomes possible."

196,"Some men, including me in the past, can expect romantic love to fill their entire need for emotional intimacy. Like they save a lot of ""stuff"" for confiding exclusively in the people they date. Women on the other hand tend to have a wider range of friends they are emotionally intimate with.

To me this comes from stereotypes about masculinity meaning stoic, emotionless, invulnerable and that sort of thing. I think all my relationships improved with learning to confide in friends more. "
197,"When my wife and I first started dating she would always complain she hates her legs. ""They're short and stumpy and my knees are bony"". Without realizing it I guess I took that to heart. Not being a ""leg man"" I never really gave her legs another thought. 

Fast forward several years to the birth of our second child. My sister-in-law is training to be a dula so she's in the delivery suite to help out. We're 10 hours into labor, of course she wants to do it naturally so no epidural. She wasn't dilating so the Dr. gave her pitocin (forces the cervix to open, quite painfully... remember no epidural). Finally she's fully dilated! We're finally ready to push. So I'm holding one leg up and my sis-in-law is holding the other. My sis-in-law looks down at the leg in her hand and says ""Damn girl, you have nice legs!""... I look down at the leg in my hand and it hits me like a ton of bricks. 10 years of marriage and dating and I never noticed. My wife has fantastic legs! How did I never notice this!?!?

So the moral of the story? People will believe what you tell them about yourself. Don't make up their mind for them, don't tell them everything that's ""wrong with you""... just be chill enjoy your time with this person. "

That's a very broad generalization. My wife is 7 years older than I am and is drastically less experienced or mature than many women much younger than her. Age ≠ maturity or experience.

To address a deeper issue, I think the article is crap. Going on a date with the expectation that the other person's goals should to impress you is juvenile and selfish. Sure, people should put their best foot forward and all that, but when I'm on a date, I'm not looking to be impressed, I'm looking for someone I enjoy being around and who enjoys my company. Maybe it's a getting older thing but I have little time for going out with someone who's idea of a date is for me to audition for them."

223,"There were three marked events that really changed my life.  

The first was getting involved with a twelve step program called ""Adult children of alcoholics "" I always felt weird growing up because things happened in my house that never happened to my friends or to TV families.  Suddenly I was in a group of people who experience was so much like my own.  For the first time in my life I felt almost,  but not quite,  normal.  

Second was when I realized that my wife was just as messed up as I was.  It was a real turning point because I started calling her on some of her Bullshit.  It was a big change because up until then, I felt so bad about myself that I believed that everything that was wrong in our marriage was my fault.  And I was really pissed off that she kept reminding me of that.  Then I realized that there were two people here, both from similar backgrounds.  Things started to make sense that she was contributing to the problem.  And in some cases,  causing them.  

The third moment was when I was the maintenance guy for a school.  When I walked through the kindy, the 5 and six year olds used to view with each other to see who could get my attention.  I was like a rock star to them.  They made up stories about my greatness.  

And suddenly one day it occurred to me that people say that kids are a great judge of character.  And so,  what if,  they were right about me, and I was wrong,  that in spite of my failings,  that I was,  in fact,  on the whole,  a pretty good guy.  It was a huge revelation.  "
224,"An ex attempted to use sex to end an argument over her staying out till like 4am every night, sometimes not coming home at all.

Now sex to end a small argument is healthy, the kinds of arguments that have no emotional stake like ""Just pick up your fucking socks"" or ""You're like 30 minutes late and I had a dinner cooked for you, now it's cold and it'll taste like ass reheated"" but if the argument is over something that is not trivial, something like ""Why the hell are you out so late every night when you get off work at 7?""

When I drink too much I have a hard time staying asleep, so I woke up early around 6 and started getting dressed. I was doing the usual wallet, phone, key tap when I found the receipt in my back pocket. I didn't really care about the money, but it pissed me off that those were the first drinks she ordered when we had just met.

Assuming she had been pooping, my first reaction was to jerk my head back and go ""AHHH!"" but after a few seconds it dawned on me - she'd gone in there to rub one out and thought it would get me going to let me whiff her unwashed [pussy hand](http://i.imgur.com/bccWXYF.png).

Yes. Avoid guys who don't listen to you, and the ones who get angry when contradicted. Told the same thing to my boys. 

Oh, and saggy pants. Don't bring home some dumbass in saggy pants, or I will go full Dad mode and embarrass the HELL out of both of you. 

&gt;Are you letting her figure guys out on her own?

No. I don't just let any of my kids figure out stuff completely on their own. It's my job to teach them stuff. 

Take riding a bike. I told them how it's done. I held the seat for them and helped them balance when they got started. But I ultimately let go, because there is no way for them to get that real ""feel"" for it until they are doing it themselves. 

Even then, they started off constrained. First, I constrained them to biking around in the cul-de-sac. Once they showed responsibility there, I let go again and let them ride with me up to the store. Once they showed me they knew what they were doing, I let go again and let them bike to their friend's house alone. Then to school. Then on that 150 mile mountain biking trip.... JUST BRING A DAMN HELMET, OK?

Of course, regardless of how much freedom I give them, no matter how much I let go...I stick around and patch up the inevitable boo-boos. Because that's my job, too.

Same thing with dating. It starts with talking about what makes a good friend. Then how to approach that first crush. Help them figure out how to act &amp; what to do on that first date, how to figure out if it's a good idea to keep going with the relationship, or move to the next level. 

I constrain each step, cordoning things off until I think they are ready to move on. Chaperoned dates. Home by 11. No, you can't study in your room alone. Until you show me you are responsible.

Just like with a bike, I have to let go a little at each step. That's what having kids is all about; a gradual letting go. Training them for the point where they will be ready in time.

And then, of course, hanging around to patch up the inevitable boo-boos.

And yes, you're damn straight the helmet was a metaphor.

Just get it over with.  My GF and I discussed fat and it was unpleasant for about a day.  Now we both discuss it openly whenever, and it's a subject as natural and easy to discuss as whether the car needs gas.

250,"Tell him to never try and jerk off with shampoo. It might feel like a good idea, but he will regret it."
251,"A longer answer: 

""Recognize that attractiveness, despite being seemingly codified by movies and magazines, still has a lot of subjectivity in it. Acknowledge that there are things about you that are likable, that other people will enjoy. Remember that the point of dating isn't for you to offer yourself up to others for judgment, but to get to know another person and, together, figure out if you work well together."""
252,"Me too, thanks "
253,"I guess it would depend on your definition of famous. 


I dated a girl who's been in several movies (I can't say which ones because it would absolutely give it away). Only 2 of those movies made it ""big"" and they weren't even enormous successes, but I guarantee the vast majority of you have heard of them if not seem them. I even ""played"" an extra in one of them! Woo-hoo! 


Anyway, she was cool, honestly it was like dating anyone else when we were alone. Just another person, someone I was dating, nothing unusual. 


When we were in public however, she was approached regularly. At first it was fun for me. It was like being paid attention to by proxy kind of. Then it got old, for several reasons. First, it was invasive; it was impossible at times to enjoy time with one another in public. Secondly, I know this sounds bad... but the attention I was getting was because of her, and only because of her. I'm not famous, but everyone had questions about her. It was irritating. And lastly, it was downright obnoxious. It honestly didn't take long before I wanted to punch motherfuckers in the face for intruding on our personal space. 


Edit: I'm at work and I had to send this out real fast or it'd be lost on mobile so I'm adding what I originally wanted to say. 


It gave me a small glimpse into the life of a celebrity I guess. I totally understand why some celebs turn into pricks. I've worked with celebrities from time to time but never spent any personal time with them until I dated this girl. It's seriously invasive, when you can't go out into public without being approached by people at inappropriate times. We ended up breaking up for unrelated reasons, but I brought this up to her and she thought it was funny. We're still in touch and she always jokes about it when making plans to hang out. "
254,"I would not do anything to her before I have a more in depth conversation - it does not have to be long, that can come later, can be done in a playful way.

You want to know what her fantasies are. Does she fantasize about violent sex and what happens there? What does she come to?

Does she like to be used or does she want to be ordered around? Doe she want to be forced?

Does she want to be hurt and when yes: physically, mentally or both?

257,"You can try applying sleep hygiene


* Sleep only long enough to feel rested and then get out of bed
* Go to bed and get up at the same time every day
* Do not try to force yourself to sleep. If you can't sleep, get out of bed and try again later.
* Have coffee, tea, and other foods that have caffeine only in the morning
* Avoid alcohol in the late afternoon, evening, and bedtime
* Avoid smoking, especially in the evening
* Keep your bedroom dark, cool, quiet, and free of reminders of work or other things that cause you stress
* Solve problems you have before you go to bed
* Exercise several days a week, but not right before bed
* Avoid looking at phones or reading devices (""e-books"") that give off light before bed. This can make it harder to fall asleep.


Other things that can improve sleep include:

* Relaxation therapy, in which you focus on relaxing all the muscles in your body one by one
* Working with a counselor or psychologist to deal with the problems that might be causing poor sleep

The funny thing is we got to see what all of those other IG followers didn't see; the camera angles to make herself look skinny, the obnoxious amount of time and energy she put into the account (making us not eat our food at restaurants until she had taken enough pictures of it, which could take like 15 minutes), her caring much more about the instagram than her actual health and well being, etc.

Retired as the most senior scientist in her field in the country with many publications under her name, as well as owning ~$3 million in property.

If you tell me you're naturally a brunette, I'll take your word for it. Same with if you told me you're bad at math. So why would this not apply to you telling me you're not 'in my league?'  To put it very bluntly (with no offense meant to anyone)...if you don't value yourself, why should I?

I hate being treated differently because of the circumstances of my birth, and that includes ""positive racism"" like affirmative action. It undermines my achievements, promotes a victim complex, passes incompetent idiots and blocks hard-working people unfairly.

I understand why it exists, and what the goal was. But anything that's based in race is clearly going to have negative repercussions. Jonathan Butler, the student famous for the hunger strike in Mizzou, is incredibly wealthy. He shouldn't get special privileges because he's black. He's probably had a much better life than many poor white kids living in Bumfuck, Kansas. What we should be doing is targeting the real problem: economic inequality. If we applied affirmative action for those who come from poor backgrounds regardless of race, the issue is solved. No racist policy, we give students who come from poor families the chance to get out of the cycle of poverty, and promote diversity of experiences."

364,"Not all men worry about it, but I think a lot more men worry about it than most women are aware. And I understand why! I've never (knowingly) been called a creep myself but I've seen countless cases where other guys were called creepy behind their back and it was really clear that their only ""sins"" were being awkward and/or unattractive (often while expressing interest in a woman).

It's unfortunate because it shows that many people have a tendency to react to awkwardness and unattractiveness by feeling not just uncomfortable but actually *threatened*. It's also unfortunate because it lessens the strength of the word ""creepy"", which should be used on things that are actually threatening, like someone who doesn't take ""no"" for an answer.

To illustrate the overuse of the word, here's an interesting story from a black man with a skin condition who's had the label used on him:

&gt; I’m a creep.

&gt; I know this because people — mostly but not always random strangers — tell me so. What sort of creep is significant, I think. I’m not the catcaller or the leerer, the public masturbator or the stalker. These deviants are creeps by choice; they live the creep lifestyle. Instead, I’m just a dude who looks the part, and it’s amazing how much that affects my life.

&gt; [...]

&gt; A group of teenagers who otherwise are comfortable enough sitting near me will mumble comments like “yuck” or “gross” or, significantly in this case, “creepy” — as though I’m not clearly within earshot.

&gt; [...]

&gt; I don’t mean to validate the creep label. It’s a word meant to pigeonhole someone’s existence. It is also a variation of the word freak in a world where the culture of other-ism that birthed that particular designation is no longer considered moral. While the word freak heaps sin on its user, the word creep has the advantage of allowing its wielder to blame the victim. A creep is a mugger, chat-room victimizer or necrophiliac in waiting. Evidence of such isn’t necessary. **The creep’s nature can be discerned from his (it is an overwhelmingly masculine label) appearance and mannerisms.** [emphasis added] To do so isn’t cruel or prejudiced: by labeling the creep a creep, you’re victimizing the creep before the creep can victimize you.

371,"Revenge always comes for the kids. 

My father did shitty things like that. He also managed to include telling me I would fail at life.  However, once I became an independent adult I got the upper hand. Without needing to depend on him for food or shelter, I had no reason to put up with him and that kind of abuse anymore. So I basically communicated less and less, despite his desperate calls, several of which asked ME for money..which I never gave. Eventually he got old and infirm and I let him rot in his own filth until the city put him in a shitty home. 

This isn't disneyland, happy endings are not required,  and families are not always the greatest stable source in people's lives..they are often the single biggest source of abuse and pain. 

Parents who dehumanize their kids with power trips like that need to remember that someday, those kids will be adults and in a position to help them..and they may choose not to. "

376,"Met a girl online, said she was into DIY stuff and did a bunch of small renos on her apartment.  I am a carpenter and was interested in what she did.  We got to talking, she invited me over for coffee.  We chilled.  She seemed nice.  Hung out a few more times and started seeing each other more often. 

We bumped uglies like rabbits. She was a freak.  It was awesome.  

She had a project she was working on, I helped a little and gave some advice.  I kept helping her until it was me doing 100% of the work and her smoking pot on the couch while watching me.  I don't really like pot, I don't partake but don't really care if others do as long as they don't get to [10] around me.    

She wanted the trim done in her apartment, she bought the material and I was going to teach her how to do it.

We went on a camping trip together to a friend of hers land.  This was a dude and he seemed alright.  He came back to the city with us, I had to work on the Monday so I went home.  

The next Friday, I went over to her house to help out with the trim.  We ended up getting drunk and smashing.  The next morning we get out of bed and she says (non chalantly)  ""(other dude) gave me a better orgasm"".  Now, I was all hungover and didn't comprehend it at the time.  I went out to grab something for the trim.  And it hit me.  Texted her saying I had to deal with something at work.  She responded two hours later saying it wouldn't work out between us.

Glad I didn't do the trim.  I was pissed she openingly admitted to screwing the other dude even when she said we were exclusive. 

She is now the reason I have the personal motto of ""no matter how pretty you smile, I'm not doing something for you"".  I would have ended up renovating her entire place and she probably would have still kicked me to the curb when it was done.  Fuck that bitch."

379,"Piggy backing on this. Don't just immediately stick your tongue in her mouth. You gotta build it up. A great first kiss is like a musical crescendo - you let the intensity build. 

Like /u/Solution68 said it starts with the hands, arms, and eyes. If you're feeling it and she's been receptive awesome. 

Make eye contact. Let her know your intentions:  Lean your head slowly in to hers. If she stays still (good sign) or leans in towards you (great sign) then gently kiss her lip. I usually kiss the bottom one first. If she is receptive and kisses back, kiss both lips (a closed mouth but full kiss). This should be a slow process. You want to physically make your intentions known every step. It gives her the chance to stop or proceed as you escalate, it's sensual, and it gives you both time to get comfortable with being so close to each other for the first time. Also it's very exciting so enjoy it!

Things still going well?  Great.  Perhaps wrap your arms around her or move a little closer. If I think the woman will like it I like to gently grasp her head or shoulders (not all do be careful!) as I move in for that first open mouthed kiss. Same as before, it should be slow at first ensuring everyone is comfortable. Move your tongue gently - you aren't fighting off the doctor's wooden depressor here. So explore gingerly and let her do the same. After a bit you can kiss a little harder or faster once the two of you acclimate to the feel of each other. 

Then pause, look at her, hug her, something like that that feels appropriate.  Give yourselves time to enjoy and assess your feelings. 

After that?  Totally up to the two of you. Kiss more, go further, go back to the bar and order a beer. Whatever I guess. 

Most of all make sure you both enjoy it. First kisses are amazing!"

387,"There are a few reasons for this and YMMV among individual men but most men, if they are going to adopt and invest the time, effort, and resources into a child then they want the child to have his genes.

I thought I had to impress the girls, show a lot of interest, ... I thought that ""it was up to me and what i'll do/say"" ... I was lame as fuck.

Then one day i decided to stop flirting with girl and treat them as potential friends. You know when you meet another dude and you become best friend in a party? Like you talk with him and you have things in common, he's funny, ....

Well for girls it is EXACTLY THE SAME except there is attraction involved. You have to believe it though. If you try to befriend a girl while thinking that you are going to bang her, it wont work. Girls can detect that shit.

When you become friends with a girl, either she : 

- Is attracted to you physically. In that case you dont need to put too much effort in : you just have to stay casual and you'll end up in her bed eventually. 
- Is not. In that case you have made a new friend who can introduce you to her friends (I have just met the funniest guy, you should meet him)

I never been with a girl as of last september. I decided to stop flirting because I sucked at it. Been in my first 2 relationships ever this year with 10/10 girls. 

PROTIP : Hot girls (and I mean, very very hot girls) are mostly approached by douchy or over confident dudes. 

- A guy with a killer body and a model face is intimidating, even for a super gorgeous girl. They feel that he must be drowning in pussy and feel like they cant trust him. 
- They have seen/heard it all. Every pick up line. Every flirting techniques ... So when a dude is just casually talking with them, they are amazed.

- The way to get with a super hot girl is to NEVER mention how gorgeous she looks. The only physical compliment you can use is about her hair, clothes, accesories, tatoos, ... NO COMMENTS ABOUT HER BODY/FACE/EYES/...

- Compliment her personality as much as you can. Tell her she's smart, funny, interesting to talk to, ....

- Show her that you are not intimidated by joking with her. Banter is the way to a hot girl pants. 

- Very hot girls have insecurities too. Maybe more than the average girl. Believe it or not. The last girl I've been with could have been a model (used to be a gymnast, she has the greatest body I have ever seen even in porn) but she was unconfortable having sex with the lights on. She didnt like her small boobs (wtf they were perfect), she tought her butt was too small (wrong again) and she hated her ....... forehead (wtf i know).

You should see my face and the faces (and bodies oh lawd) of the girls I've been with this year. It's amazing. I feel like I discovered magic. (I'm a pretty funny and well spoken dude too ... so that helps)"

410,"For me it's the other way round, the problem is that you basically settle for the people approaching you since it's better than nothing, but still not good (in my experience at least) "
411,"Yeah I have to agree on AskWomen. There are a lot of lovely posters there but I  think it's overly moderated, people can be afraid to dissent - and I just find AskMen to have a more relaxed attitude. That's what draws me to read here before I go to AskWomen"
412,"Many dudes in /r/smalldick are basically suicidal and don't bother with relationships anymore, it's crazy how genetic luck of the draw can destroy a perfectly healthy person's entire romantic life, sense of self and relationship with the opposite sex."
413,"To be fair, who wants to go back to the old female role model? No one. Not women, not men. Why? Because honestly it was shit. I can perfectly imagine how shitty it would be to have dreams and aspirations limited by staying and home and raising kids. 

A man is ridiculed because come on, look how shitty women had it you want to live THAT?. Let's be honest, women wanting to do things men do is not because they inherently want to be men, but because having freedom and power is fucking nice. Whoever wants to sacrifice self-determination and growth potential for mere comfort is, under the eyes of society, a loser, regardless of gender. 

"
414,"Wow! That ShitFuckDickCunt sure sounds like a level-headed, nice guy!"
415,"I'm trying to eat pussy every day of the week. new pussy, old pussy, red pussy, blue pussy.



i really like cunninglingus"
416,Post on reddit
417,"&gt; just make up your fucking mind.

I think the difficulty you're having is those are probably two separate groups of people with opposing viewpoints. The ""chivalry is dead"" crew is not the same as the ""let's split the tab"" crew. If you're trying to narrow it down to one universally-accepted female opinion, you're going to have a hard time."
418,Being an independent thinker ..... Best tool a person can have with the right guidance.
419,She's banging /u/rampagingkoala? That sucks man
420,Just think about how much you'll get back at her once she is elderly and you put her in a shitty home.
421,Obviously i'd put on my robe and wizard's hat...
422,"Let her break up, fuck her if she's too slow to get the last dumpling. "
423,And women don't have genetic codes?
424,"Smoking. The phallic imagery, the badassery, and even the faint smell of past cigarettes... Yet the cost, coughing and lung cancer. Disgusting."
425,The honor/respect dynamic with your parents. 
426,"""Be everyone's rock"" meaning , be the man everyone can count on, get advice from, and offer support. No matter how hard it is for you. 

I was 16. I'm 30 now.  Changed my outlook, now I'm everyone's go to person for anything from advice to doing a favor. 

Edit: grand dad gave me that advice before he passed away"
427,*slaps ass* You like that you fucking retard?
428,"What's there to talk about.  He doesn't want people to know his girlfriend used to cut herself.  If that is a deal-breaker for you, find a new boyfriend.

It's five fucking years too late to decide to be offended by it in my opinion though."
429,My ex would pull that line over the dumbest shit possible. The best was when she wanted to break up when I ate the last dumpling.
430,"I don't understand NOT going down on a woman first. The ladies can come multiple times and if they do it once before you even get up in that; there's not many better feelings on this earth once you do. ""I wouldn't put my face somewhere I wouldn't stick my dick"" is a very wise angle as well; I've just never run into that problem."
431,"&gt; the RPG fallacy

I've been looking for a clever name for this behavior. Thanks."
432,"This is one that gets me as well. I'm no AskWomen cheerleader by any means, but any time the sub is even mentioned on here the hate train rolls out full steam. The smugness and irony is rich. "
433,"Use manipulative and extreme angles on social media photos to hide the fact that her BMI is 40.

The weird angle poses don't make you look sexier. They make it obvious that you're fat and trying to hide it."
434,"People shouldn't just casually discuss the sordid details of their sex lives, especially when it comes to current partners and shortcomings that would cause public embarrassment.

People shouldn't publicly brag about having gotten a super-high partner count.

Infidelity is very bad."
435,"*You have more responsibilities as you advance in life so the best years of your life are the early ones.*

It's a half truth. Yes you have more responsibilities but you also get better at dealing with them and they don't necessarily feel like a chore. An absence of responsibilities doesn't mean you're super happy. Adult life allows you more freedom and independence. I'm 28 and I feel happier and more free than I was in my teens or early 20's. 



"
436,"If you're concerned about std's, don't fuck that person."
437,"Well I guess I expected my ex to stay faithful to me but apparently that was too much of a unrealistic expectation. 


Bitch.  "
438,"He wants to fight you.

So either do that or report him to the police."
439,"Being under-sexualized as a race.  

I'm half white, and can pass as white, so this wasn't much of an issue for me, but when I was younger the notion that Asian dudes are not sexually desirable did not help bolster my confidence.   "
440,"And hair pulling (never met a girl who wasn't into it). But ya, the rest I would ask. I chocked a girl once without asking her... Cue deer in headlights look. I've learned my lesson about that. "
441,"I'm only 36, but I've noticed a trend lately where younger guys are blaming society for their inability to interact with people, especially women.  I'll see questions like ""How do you hit on a woman in this PC age"" and things like that.  It has nothing to do with society plotting against them.  People are still dating and meeting each other and having lots of sex these days.  It's clearly a personal issue that they choose not to face.  That unwillingness to focus on self improvement in areas where it really matters is a huge mental barrier."
442,"Yup. One time I was fooling around with this woman and she purred ""I'll do anything you want"" in my ear, so I suggested we move along to actual sex. Oops, that wasn't included in ""anything"". "
443,this seems like a setup question for anal as the response.
444,The guy was crazy.  Taking small children into the restroom with you is the norm everywhere I've been.  Little kids regardless of gender go into bathroom with the parent.
445,"I'm adopted, want kids but not sure if I want to get married. I feel like I could relate to an adopted kid because well, I was one. So I feel like we could navigate the whole ""who am I/ curious about biology"" aspects that were a bit of a struggle to trying to relate to my parents (adoptive). I've dabbled with the idea of ""If I'm not married by 40 maybe I'll try adopting a kid"" but I still got 10 years or so"
446,You can't buy a house on one salary...
447,You're such a romantic.
448,Whenever people ask I tell them I'm not a virgin. Pretty awkward at 26.
449,I feel like Ned would call them fellatiorino.
450,"I'm kind of a shy guy as well, I've found 2 approaches that work:

If you're sitting next to her, put an arm around her. If she moves closer to you, that's a good sign. Your other hand is less important, it could go on her opposite hip/side, or gently on her face/hair. Then lean in.

If you're standing: Face her, hands on her hips/sides, make eye contact. If she holds eye contact with you for a second or two, that's a good sign. Then go for it. Immediately after a hug is a good time.

As for how long, just let it happen, don't force anything."
451,"Your mod tag appears in this comment, but it doesn't appear in the root comment. 

I don't get it. "
452,"To me, I would say ""you need to learn not to ask questions you don't want the honest answer to"". "
453,"&gt;You know we're good for more than just sex right? Gawd.

DAMN! Really?! You mean I can't view men solely as sexual objects necessary ONLY for my physical pleasure?! Well hell. Wtf am I even doing here anymore? /s

Both he and I have commented about it lots over the last couple of years! I haven't lately - just because it hasn't come up in threads I've caught, until today :) but I'll take some fist bumps any day!"
454,They consider anything they don't agree with or that uses offensive language to be a troll though. 
455,"Gender roles: men were the heads of the house, bringing the money and the support for their families. Women stayed at home, took care of their kids and their husbands. A man was a man when he could find a wife, have kids and raise a family through hard work. A woman was a woman when she could find a husband and raise a family with him. 

Today women and men share the same roles. They can both raise kids and get jobs to support the home (if there is any). 

Today being a man -different than women- is something we men are still trying to find out. We grow beards, we hit the gym, we enjoy ""manly"" hobbies -that women can also enjoy-. 

In any case, nothing has changed in the way we were, but we are not unique anymore. Women wanted to be men, and now we are all the same. 

"
456,That's so sweet! (I do this with my cats' names.)
457,"Dajbman22, I understood what you did in both your initial and follow up comment, and it was good.  You're good."
458,"Not as many as you'd think given the answer here. Reddit is not an accurate depiction of the typical male demographic.

The more I read this, the more it seems aimed at pointing out guys as being unfair and not wanting to reciprocate, when in fact there are plenty of guys who wouldn't expect any oral if they weren't willing to give it."
459,"Awww, her eyes. How sweet."
460,"Modesty. We tend to value confidence too much in our culture. Sometimes confidence is backed up by real skill/intelligence but more often it is not. Modesty however is often the trait of a fine, upstanding individual. "
461,"""There are no problems which cannot be solved with an *appropriate* application of violence."""
462,No...she knows the username he WANTS her to see
463,Hey it me ur jenifer larences bf
464,"Getting mad about things that I can't change won't help anything.  

For instance, if a guy cuts me off in traffic, I could 

A) Run him off the road

B) Get really mad about it and fantasize about running him off the road

C) Do nothing and move on with my life

Generally option C is the best option."
465,"If I go on 3 dinner dates a week, that's $100-160 down the drain on women I may not even end up liking. Who would do that?

This article is garbage. The author gets just a teaspoon full of that 'you are disposable, I'm not invested, and I can move on at any time' medicine that men get on apps like Tinder and she's halfway to Women Going There Own Way."
466,TIL dating someone with alot of subscribers on Tumblr is considering dating a celebrity.

468,"No, involve the cops!  Part of a rapist's success is that people don't report their crimes.  Report it, involve the police, and maybe the guy will get some counseling that alters their path enough that they *don't* go full-on rapist."
469,"As an Asian guy, I fit the following:

* I'm good at math.
* I eat rice a lot.
* I look younger than my age.
* I work in the STEM field.
* I am considered hardworking.
* I'm good at martial arts (especially taekwondo).
* I took piano lessons for years.

Don't fit:

* My parents are not super strict or conservative.
* I am fluent in English (it's my first language).
* My driving record is good, I practice lane discipline, and drive politely.
* Two out of my three girlfriends have been non-Asian."
