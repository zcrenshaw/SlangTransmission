She more or less threw a temper tantrum like a child and verbally broke up with you without having a sane discussion about a concern she had. Marriage is tough, tougher than anything you two have been through. Is that really the way you want to have to deal with things?

AND she's going to treat you like you're 8? Fuck that noise, dude. No matter how good she is in the sack, that's pretty psychotic behavior right there. Why would you want to legally tie yourself to her? 

To answer your question, no, none of the things you've described have ever happened to me because I don't date immature twats. You have every right to be pissed off, and every right to get out while you still can.

7,"Is this what we're doing today, jacking off again? "
8,"Yep.  This should be the top comment.  I took my then girlfriend's dog to the vet to be put down.  Heart trouble.  He'd be wandering around, and suddenly fall down, lay very still, and then get up.  He'd soon be back at it, like nothing happened, but it turns out his heart was giving out on him on occasion.  He was near the end.

My girlfriend couldn't bear to take him in, so I did.  Now, Buster and I had a rocky relationship.  He'd constantly bring his thick skull up between my legs and bag me...as a greeting.  After ""greeting"" me, he'd pay all of his attention to my girlfriend.  I knew he didn't mean to hurt me, but with all the positive reinforcement, telling him ""no"" and even a light smack on the butt when he did it, he'd still do it.

So, I took him to the vet one day.  He stumbled out of the car, and walked uneasily to the vet with me.  Slack lead (which was rare!).  Either he was getting used to sometimes falling down, or he was resigned to his fate.

The vet and the assistant gave him the first shot, and he just chilled right out.  I had my hand on his back, and was petting him and telling him he was a good boy.  Tail wagged a few times, and he laid down beside me.  The second shot was administered, and he moved his front paws towards me.  I got a little closer to him, still petting, still telling him what a good boy he was.

Then he surprised me.  He lifted his head off the floor where we were both sitting, and rested it on my leg.  This huge, cinderblock head was placed on my thigh, and he looked up at me for just a second.  It was the closest we'd ever been, even though we'd sat on the couch together countless times before.  This was different.

He had a couple of small sighs, then one big one.  It's probably just my memory playing tricks, but the last one was a long, drawn-out sigh.  It was his last breath.  The vet assistant checked his heart, and told me he had passed.

I sat there for another 15-20 minutes telling him he was a good boy.

Edit:  I didn't expect to make this many people cry, sorry about that.  I have to admit, I got a little misty typing this out again, it was like I was back in that white room saying goodbye to Buster all over again.  He really was a good boy, if a little careless with his headbutts."

When you first make new friends, it's very easy to have long conversations because you know nothing about each other, and everything you share is new. However, when you're in a long-term relationship, that person has already heard most of your go-to stories, thoughts, and dreams, so conversations tend to be about current events and hobbies, which don't often necessitate overly long and meaningful conversations.

It's possible that you and your girlfriend are incompatible and that's why you guys have nothing to talk about, or it could be that you're both in a rut and need to spice up your lives so that they two of you have new and exciting stories to share with each other."

28,"Here's a story for you.  When I was your age I was a commercial landscaper.  I worked outside in 100 degrees and 100% humidity and sweat my socks off.  I'd be on the job outside an office building and watch the folks arrive in the morning thinking ""these lucky bastards!  To sit inside in the air conditioning all day?  And dress nice for work?  I'm going to have a salaried job like this after college"". 

Fast forward 15-20 years and I'm sitting in my air-conditioned office job making my salary and I see these landscapers outside working and I think ""those guys are so lucky, to be outside in nature all day.  They get to wear jeans and t-shirts.  No stupid reports to do or micro-managing boss to harass them. They don't take work home with them. That's the life"".

But I've been there 3 times (over a 10 year period) and without a doubt it's the most soulless, cultureless, and artificial city I've been to. In my opinion, the shameless and obscene display of bling-bling only adds to this vibe. There are other cities which also have lots of skyscrapers but I count them among my favorites, such as Tokyo and Hong Kong.

Other cities in the UAE, such as Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, are slightly better in terms of fakeness, but still feel fake nevertheless. Al Ain is actually rather nice due to the relative greenery, but there are of course lots of other places around the world with far more greenery, without being in a desert oasis. As I said, many people like it, and I respect their opinion as we are all different, but for me the UAE is the only country out of the over 40 that I have been to that I genuinely did not like. It just rubbed me the wrong way.

Seriously, if you are visiting the Middle East, instead of the UAE, go to countries such as Egypt or Oman instead. They are far more culturally interesting, and feel far less fake."

43,"Moderation. 

Video-games are good entertainment, but they're still just that - entertainment. They should be used as a hobby or time-suck when you don't have anything else to do. It's an insular activity that doesn't really enrich you or make you better generally (though some games tell good stories or test your problem solving skills), so it's certainly not a bad thing to have better or more important things to do. 

I'm saying this as someone who really likes video games by the way. With work, a fiancee, my social life, and the gym, I don't get as much time to play as I used to, but the things I'm doing instead are either more important (gym, work) or more enjoyable.  "

52,"Money doesn't buy happiness but it sure helps keep you from being depressed over not paying the bills.

High school sets kids up with phrases like ""Follow your dreams"" and ""Do something you love and you'll never work a day in your life."" But some dreams aren't careers, and if you need to churn out what you love to pay the bills suddenly what you love stops being so enjoyable.. then what are you left with?

I say this as someone who quit art school to become a nurse.  Now I make great money, I have a union job with pension and benefits, I have guaranteed hours and I can do art on the side to decompress. Thank god I don't have to rely on idiot clients constantly telling me to change my artistic vision and chintzing out on paying me, all to barely pay rent in a place I can't afford. 

Choose a career based on your strengths and interests. You should also choose one based on your goals in life; you can afford to scrape by on smaller amounts of money as a young person, but can you afford that if you eventually want to own a home, or have a family, or save for retirement? There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing a job you like well enough, while doing what you love in your free time.

That said I'm not sure about wages where you live, but in my region in Canada police officers and fire fighters make great money and also have awesome benefits and pension plans. But as a current shift worker on night shift I feel it pertinent to mention that shift work is pretty gruelling and most people try to get out of it eventually. "

The one time I didn't see it coming and felt like I was swept up by a quick and effective seduction was a complete surprise. It was 4:30 and a pretty girl walked in, and sat in a dark corner near one of the smaller satellite bars. I just had gotten dressed hadn't even been on stage yet and the DJ had probably played one or two songs since we opened. I was sober (rare when dancing and hadn't taken any G which was my go to drug of choice.) She ushered me over and asked for a table dance. Fine. I begin moving and she immediately spreads her legs on the bar stool and she has a shaved and pierced pussy. I go rock hard, but keep dancing. She then tells me she is also a dancer and has a 6:00 shift at the Pink Pony. ""Was on my way to work and got horny..."" So before you could say hump and grind I was in her... We quickly finished up, thankfully no waitresses were on the floor, doormen were elsewhere getting ready for the night and my manager was probably doing lines in the office.

139,"The reason is that most guys aren't scared of approaching *you* it's that we're looking for the right moment to approach - and that is a small window we often miss. We are told from when we're young that we have to take the initiative, but noone tells us how to do that, which makes us insecure.

Are you with a large group of friends? Nope can't approach there and break the circle, many eyes will be on the guy. Out with your gay friend? We will think he's your boyfriend and won't approach. Are you looking busy or very serious? Nope wouldn't want to disturb you and send bad signals. 

If you've exchanged glances with a guy, don't just look away but smile to him instead. Have an open body language, look like you're opening up to him (in a non sexual way). And when he comes be easy to talk to. If we feel ""invited"" to talk to you then we definitely will."

My boyfriend and I don't often have super long or deep conversations. He is not a really talkative person, even with his friends he is mostly silent. Of course, we talk about things, but we rarely spend the whole evening just talking. We also speak different languages so we speak English with each other - which goes fine, but of course not so fluently and easily as speaking in your native tongue. 


With my friends, I have long conversations. I like that a lot, but it also makes me tired sometimes, and then I can come home to my boyfriend and just enjoy the silence with him. "

One night she got wasted and told myself and my girlfriend at the time that she was planning on divorcing him once she graduated the program and that she was just using him for financial support.  I mulled over telling my friend for a couple weeks and finally my girlfriend at the time told him. He brought it up to her several times while she was in school and she always brushed it off as him being silly and paranoid.

1. a liar

168,"Coffee is an excellent FIRST date. I agree with you if a connection has already been established, but if it's an initial meeting, it's great. The well-lit, public, afternoon environment makes women feel safer than a dark corner of a bar late at night, and the caffeine is great for conversation. It makes people talkative. The nature of a coffee date can be really short if the date isn't going well and there is no spark - it's not a long commitment like dinner would be; however, if it is going well, you can easily continue conversing for hours as well. A couple beers to unwind and connect on a more romantic level is definitely better once you're interested in someone, but if it's that first get-to-know-whether-there-is-chemistry meetup, coffee is just fine. You can be out of there in 30 minutes if it's bad, or you can stay for a few hours and schedule subsequent drinks if it's great. Just my two cents."
169,"Thing with LA is it's just not tourist friendly at all. Hollywood is entirely a waste of time. The places to go and the great hangouts and what make LA great is really only found by locals.

Usually, the people complaining have so much ego tied to their own tales that they lash out at being upstaged.

My suggestion is to flirt with him just a bit at work and give him your number.  If he starts texting you, consider taking the conversation to snapchat and get to sending sexy pictures.  If you're at the point of sexting with him, I assume you can take it from there."

190,"Since taking him out on an adventure is out of the plans, set him up in a bit of luxury at home. Blankets and pillows with his dog bed, tons of pets. Hand feed him his dinner/breakfast (if he's still got an appetite.) You could consider heating up his dry kibble in a bit of chicken broth in the microwave to soften it up if eating is difficult for him. 

Just being able to spend quality time with his favourite dude will make his last day special; dogs are simply creatures, they just wanna hang out with their people and if that happens every day is the best day.

Spend the last moment with your guy. It's tough to watch them go but you should be there for your dog. If your vet offers it and you can afford it, opt to get the morphine shot before the lethal injection. Your dog won't feel a huge difference but the injection can sometimes cause muscle spasms and tremors which can be unnerving for the owner. Please know that these are involuntary reactions and your dog is feeling no pain; sometimes they will tremor a bit after they've passed away, they aren't suffering, it's just an electrical impulse. 

And remember: Putting your dog down is the most compassionate thing you can do in this instance. As someone who works in health care: people who push to ""do everything"" for their human loved ones often just ends in torturing the person, making them suffer for weeks just to die anyway. Euthanasia is a compassionate choice, not an evil one. You're doing the right thing. "

Our caddies at the golf courses were pretty solid too. One of them was in his 60's and had worked the course for over 30 years. He told us some fantastic stories of the people who've played and his life as well.

* Looking out of the corner of my eye just as they pass and catch them doing a scan of my body. 
* Look at them and they quickly look away and maybe look back again. 
* Rarely they give a full scan and don't care if you see them.
* Standing inside your personal space when it really isn't required.
* Lowering their head a bit and looking up at you like you are prey.

She asked me if I would refill her drink for her. I said sure, took her empty cup, went inside for a refill, and came back out. I handed her the cup but she wouldn't take it. She leaned forward a bit and in a stage whisper said, ""I've got my finger in my ass and I'm enjoying it too much to stop."" She then leaned back to her original position and continued our conversation from earlier, as if nothing spectacular had happened."

Sometimes, especially when one of us is going through something emotionally painful, we lapse into a mix of botched words (e.g. reversed syllable sequence) and motherese and nonsense-words to comfort one another. We call it catsies-talk, ""because that's how catsies would talk if they could.""

It's pretty tough to come up with an English-language version of it, but I guess ""Catsies saa, sraaj sraaj"" = ""Little kitten is sad [and wants a hug], cry cry"" will do as an example."

He doesn't let you finish talking/interrupts you. Is kind of flippant with what you say or negates every single thing you say. ""It was dark and raining today. It put me in a shitty mood."" ""Well, it wasn't raining *all* day and actually rainy days make me happy."" Oh yeah, someone who also makes everything about themselves. Talks about themselves, their job, their problems excessively. Or like he really likes to dwell on his problems. He loves talking shit about people.

&gt;Anyways, she comes into the bathroom while I'm showering and flips her shit and says things are over between us and took my ring and threw it across the bathroom.

&gt;she requested that I never look at porn again or she would leave me

I'm not going to advocate that you break up, but she has some serious personality retooling to do if you guys are going to survive as a couple til death do you part. She sounds extremely immature, with little control over her emotions. We all find out things we don't like and get mad about it, but some of us were properly socialised as children and learned to govern ourselves so that we don't throw temper tantrums at *twenty fucking seven years old.* You know what happens to men who can't govern themselves? Mostly jail.

You need to acknowledge her emotions and be sensitive to them, but at the same time this type of behaviour is completely unacceptable, and I guarantee that if it is not corrected you will not have a happy, harmonious marriage that is able to survive the rough periods which *will* happen.

I don't know what to suggest, honestly, but I think she needs someone to help her get her emotions under control and learn to keep a lid on things until she can talk them out reasonably rationally. But this is not good OP, if you're going to marry this woman then you guys need to work through this.

This line in particular is, I think, very important. People are always talking about either following your dreams *or* chasing that high-paying high-stress job that you're gonna hate, but there is room for a middle ground. I am a pretty passionless and apathetic person, so there were never any dreams to follow in the first place.

209,"It's the attitude/mindset. From my experience there's a few different categories.

* The 'I'm here, now you do all the work'. The entitled attitude where she thinks that just showing up with a pussy is enough input from her end, it's the guys job to make sure she's aroused, he's aroused, she's satisfied and he's satisfied. Usually gets away with it because she's above average attractive.
* The 'I don't know what to do'. Coy, is afraid of doing things wrong and therefore passive, a bit tense and unable to enjoy the experience fully. This can stem from body image issues, performance anxiety, internalised 'sex shaming' from her upbringing etc etc
* The 'Internalised actor'. All her reactions are muted because she's ashamed or unable to externalise her reactions. She's enjoying herself but it's being held inside her head like they're watching a movie instead of being in one.
* The 'I don't really want to be here'. Usually has low self esteem and just uses sex to get guys to like her. Puts in minimal/no effort because effectively, she's dead inside and just wants it to be over. Has poor choice in sexual partners.

There are probably more, but these are the ones I've encountered."

It causes unnecessary stress, social isolation, unrealistic expectations, and a whole list of other shit. Biologically, we are not fit for how the world has developed. Sure, we can adapt and try to be resilient, but it's hard. And for people who really struggle, these kinds of psychiatric problems arise. And then they have kids with similar predispositions and it kind of snowballs. 

They did this huge research project where they asked people to rate their moods, locations, and activities at certain times of the day. Being at work, or being sick were some of the highest scales for unhappiness, which isn't surprising. Being with friends and loved ones was and obvious indicator of happiness. But a huge variable was where they were. We are significantly happier when we are outside.

We did not evolve to live in little boxes, and drive our boxes to other boxes and idly sit by hours a day staring at paper, or a screen in places that smelled stale and had annoying noises. We are part of the earth and we have isolated ourselves from it. And it happened so fast that we couldn't keep up evolutionarily. This creates significant problems for us psychologically. We are going against our own biological impulses and it causes us problems. "

246,"When I was about 12 or 13 a girl from my school texted me something like this:

her: ""I'm hiding in my friends hot tub right now lol"" 

me: ""oh cool, whos hot tub""

her: ""[friend's name] just got it! im completely naked btw. what would you do if you were here haha""

me: ""I don't really like hot tubs."" 

So she thought I'd rejected her advance. I didn't even realize it was one because I'm just that dense.I was thinking ""what the fuck do you do in a hot tub? sounds boring"" and didnt consider the idea she was flirting. She then accused me about a week later of being gay.

If this sounds tame, you're right. I'm a virgin."

251,"At a party at my friends' house in college. A bunch of people would always sit and crowd around on this spiral staircase in the room you enter into from the front door. While there, talking to a friend who lives at the house, this girl that's been obnoxious to everyone comes up to us two. She only gets invited because she's cousins with another guy who lives at the place and her friends are way hotter than her, but damn she was crazy. However, after this incident, she was no longer allowed to come over because this is how it went down:

Crazy cousin chick to my friend: ""Hey, you're pretty hot.""

Friend: ""Oh, uh.. thanks.""

CCC: ""What would you do if I raped you?"" *proceeds to get uncomfortably close and grabs his crotch*

Me: ""What the fuck? You can't just do that to people.""


From there, my friend and I told her to leave and got her cousin to kick her out. It became a shit show because she practically broke down."
252,"Yeah she seems rather insecure and unrealistic. Just because you are in a relationship doesn't mean you suddenly lose your basic instincts. Its ok to check people out, look up what you want to online and to not feel guilty for doing so. Its really not fair for her to be so angry especially as you say it isn't at a level where it impacts the relationship. Try talking to her about what is realistic and also maybe define the different between the duel sessions and solo sessions as one is about passion and the other more a means to an end!

My wife (W) has never met the husband of a friend (FH) before- but one day they were all getting lunch together.  The topic of me came up. 

FH: ""So what's he do?"" 

W: ""Oh, right now he's working in Joann's""

FH: ""I mean, like hobbies?""

W: ""Well, he likes to cook, and he's helping me make jewelry for a show next week.""

FH: ""Uhhhhhhhh""

It was at this point that my wife realized that this guy thought she married a gay man or something, and couldn't figure out what to think about someone so decidedly not masculine.  

W: ""He also fixes things, he's got a lot of tools, always wants to buy more.""

The skies parted, the guy looked relieved, and he started asking about what things I fixed."

Someone who can't be content with a solid and healthy relationship so they'll actively seek to undermine it?"
275,"At a party in college a friend said to me ""I kinda think of you as a big brother"" then tried to kiss me, I guess I looked confused so she said ""I'd fuck my real brother if he'd let me"" and gave me this weird I supposed it was supposed to be seductive look.

""I'm really horny.  Come home soon.  We're waiting for you. ;)""

I have never cleaned my taint in a public restroom before but let me tell you something friends.  I did on that day.  I was terrified and excited.  Had my wife actually set up a threesome in my honor out of sheer mid-day horniness?  Who the hell would it be? 

Would I object?  Of course I would.  I'm a Christian man, and that would not be my wife.  But I thought, or maybe hoped, my sinful nature would make that objection amount to a ^^no...stop....don't  as the things happened to me.

I used the local area code and first 3 digits we all had in that area (before cell phones) and made up 4 random numbers after that.  Turns out it was another girls' phone number who happened to be her best friend and who happened to be in that class.  Considering I pretty much never talked to her, creep factor of 10 for looking like I had her phone number memorized.

299,"I'm a married male. I don't wear a ring. It's safely at home. Dislike jewelry, my job requires me to constantly take off my ring to have clear digits (thus I don't want to lose mine. It has sentimental value), and my wife is ok with it. I'll wear it out to family events and anniversaries. 

More than once I've been out with friends and we meet people. I have zero intentions. If I ever find myself talking to a female for more than a few mins I'll slip that I have a wife into the conversation to make sure they aren't getting the wrong message.

But more often than not, the female gets hostile and criticizes me for not wearing a ring. Fuck off. I know I'm married. My wife knows I'm married. I don't give a shit what you think. It's none of your business if I choose to wear a ring. I get there are scum bags out there but not everyone in that situation has bad intentions. 

A friend I work with in the same situation also doesn't wear a ring.

337,"I'll leave this here 

&gt;""Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to 'death', don’t really understand this. I’ve had no desire to explain, but won’t be around forever and must.

&gt;Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say: 'No, no, not a good idea. Let's not go for a walk.' Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that's what dogs are. They walk.

&gt;It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.

&gt;However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don't teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.

&gt;When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: 'Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.'

&gt;When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it's a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)

&gt;Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.

&gt;But don’t get fooled. They are not 'dead.' There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are.

&gt;I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart. You’ve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now.""

So I play, I get home pretty late, like 1 AM. I'm fucking starving, I considered getting wings on my way home, but I was like nah, I got food waiting for me. So I get home, immediately head straight to the kitchen, and it's gone. Someone ate it. I was so upset. It looked really good and now I'll never get to eat it. "

After a few moments of confusion, I realised that she didn't want to break eye contact with her now opened beer bottle with a stranger. 

She appologised and said it was nothing personal, it actually brought on a really nice conversation about the differences in dating between men and women. But it also made me fucking furious that dickheads who spike girls drinks exist and they make night life as a women so much more difficult than it needs to be"
342,"I'm not the exact target for this question, but I'll weigh in.


Had Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Imgur, Snapchat, various other pop-ups. Always been quite 'involved' in social media, in that I'm active on it, posted a lot, interacted a lot, read a lot.


Realised over the course of a few years that it's cancerous. Creates jealousy, rifts, insecurity, is generally just an awful way to spend your time. The more I removed, the happier I felt. But there definitely was a limit. Deleting Facebook meant I didn't get invited to things. Deleting Twitter meant I looked for another site to serve as my newsfeed.


The compromise I made is that I would heavily moderate my feeds. Now, Facebook is around 20 people (the rest are friends, but hidden). I only follow 100 Twitter accounts. Instagram, Snap, deleted entirely and I think those are the two worst that can just be deleted. LinkedIn I only leave active for work but never look at it. This helps me to feel connected to the people/brands I want to be connected with, but not chained to the services."
343,"Born and raised Chicagoan here who lived in LA for a year for work...as much as I hate to admit.... I love LA. 

As a native Chicagoan, I was conditioned to hate LA. These SoCal, Avocado-topping, Laker-loving fucks with their cars, beautiful people, and amazing weather?! How dare they call themselves a city. More like suburbs by the ocean!

I wanted to hate LA with all my giardiniera soaked heart. 

But then I found the Koji beef truck.... and then went to Koreatown... and then hung out on the beach... and then had the best ramen of my life in a Japanese grocery store that was $8.... and then had the best sushi of my life in some rinky dink sushi shop that was WAY cheaper than anything we got in CHI... and then had the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life....and then I realized it was November and a pleasant 70 degrees... and then went to Santa Barbara... and then went to a house party in Newport and played beer pong on a surfboard... and then went to Santa Monica for the sun set...  

Point being is that LA has its moments for sure but there is some cool shit there to do. It's a touch expensive but, like anywhere, you gotta find the right spots. The comedy scene was amazing. On any given night, you'll find a great show. 

Yes, the traffic was bad but I'd end up half the time I'd get off the 405 and take local streets and find these amazing little short cuts that turned into detours on local streets that can get you out of the gridlock. 

Also... oddly enough... the people were so damn nice! What?! I did have a great LA moment where this OC-yuppie mom asked me where Chicago was... umm Illinois? 

And now, foot in my mouth, I love LA. It deserves a fair shake. I'll admit it's a completely different kind of vibe than a NYC or Chicago and I think that's where people find LA wanting.  

Did I mention also I ran into Nina Dobrev in an elevator and she was probably the nicest hot chick I've ever met in real life? That made my trip for sure. "

363,"Let me find it and I'll copy and paste it. 

Edit: 18 May 

So you're not free to cum in my ass tomorrow right

Wt a shame "
364,"If he's the type of guy who is driving her home and is openly being used as an emotional tampon, that wouldn't be an acceptable option."
365,"I really wish I could do this, bring him to a national park or something, but he's in a state that it would just be horrible for him (getting to the vet in my arms 5 mins away was hard on him) they gave him a special shot as well which made him sleepy."
366,"Better to just look over them and then ask, in the most baffled tone of voice you can muster, ""how?!"""
367,"Came here to say this. The whole idea that it's okay to let anger override difficult, complex emotions is something we should be addressing as a culture.

The thing is most guys seem to eventually realize they're doing this and learn to process their emotions in a healthier, more constructive way, but it takes time. And it's a hard habit to break when you don't even realize you're doing it until your mid-twenties. "
368,"In all seriousness, if a girl had that in her bio and she was reasonably cute, I'd superlike"
369,"Honestly, the biggest thing I wouldn't tolerate there is hygiene - seriously, you need to put your foot down there. Being his girlfriend does not entitle him to expect head from you, and if he has *any* expectation of pleasant company, he needs to stop being a pig and fucking wash his ballsack on at *least* a daily basis.

In short, the shit he's pulling on you is *not* cool.

I know you don't want to break up, but hygiene like that is putting you at risk as well."
370,"Sorry to interrupt, but how can someone just not do anything at all ? I mean, even if I'm not incredibly horny, I still feel things that make me react, and it would be impossible to just lay there (for me). The concept is so weird to me. Does she just stay there, not moving at all ? Waiting for it to be over ?

(I hope my questions doesn't come of as saying that it doesn't exist, I heard enough to know that it's  thing, but it's truly mind boggling to me, I can't imagine myself not at least reacting a bit. Wtf is happening in their heads, IDK, but it's weird.)"
371,[deleted]
372,"Well the truth is as I got older with more responsibility, I've had less time for games. I miss just playing for like 10 hours at a time (I have a kid so now it's just 2 hours after she goes to bed). 

Some of it is I combine social and gaming. So I have an old friend and we schedule times to play coop games. "
373,"Dear lord, if I was the guy, that would throw me off so much. I'd just instantly say no, even if I wanted to, just because of being put on the block that way. I can't see a better way honestly, but damn that one would get me. "
374,"I got off the phone yesterday with my girlfriend thinking we had been talking for 15 min tops. We had been talking for 1 hour and 5 minutes. Still after a year i have yet to spend a weekday evening with her that i didn't wake up sleep deprived because we stayed up talking and cuddling until 2am. 

I love it, and now that i've had this i can't understand how i put up with the one ex i really couldnt talk to at all, and the conversations with the other exes pale in comparison. So i'd say it affect my relationship a lot and i wouldnt go back to someone i communicated super poorly with."
375,"She doesn't look down on me because of my job. She's a great cook. She's kind and always asks about my day. She even gave me a discount the last time I saw her. 

I love you Taco Bell Drive Thru Girl 

^^^/s"
376,"Can't believe I had to scroll down this far to find this. 

Fuck Nassau.

The people act like poop as well."
377,"I was a 21 yo virgin and the girl I was dating (who I had had a crush on for years) texted me while I was at work ""you know what I wanna do tonight? ........ You!"".   I got excited and nervous. I walked out to my car after my shift and there was a condom and a little note taped to the door handle of my car. ...... it was an awesome night. "
378,My female best friend started saying she wanted to fuck our chubby awkward coworker
379,"Its every girls move and its awkward as hell, you dont quite know how to react, do I ask them out? Or are they going to do something about it? will this cause Mars to explode thus dooming the solar sytem in some long rube goldbergy kinda way that all ties back to *if* I have a relationship with this girl? You freak us out when you do this shit, please stop."
380,"my concern is *why.* if it's something she really wants, more power to her, but I see a lot of women that are insecure about their bodies. I don't want anyone getting surgery in some misguided attempt to deal with their emotional issues. "
381,"Isn't that what most relationships are? I think open relationships are the exception, not the norm."
382,"Check the name tag, if it's a girls name, chances are, it's a girl. "
383,"Forget the porn. Someone going through your phone like that is a HUGE red flag. Be very wary.

My wife does not like the idea of me looking at porn but accepts it on some level. She prefers to be unaware of it so we're happy. It's my body."
384,How about sleeping? My husband managed to fall asleep sleep on our exercise bike once. Worked better for laundry though. That's some advanced sleeping skills. 
385,"I see them as ""She was hot as fuck and I wanted her the moment I saw her and it turned out she's as awesome as she is attractive.""

"
386,"This was in high school, but still pretty messed up. 

My dad was sick, couldn't get out of bed, in pain, couldn't stay warm. Everything. I got picked up from school that day and my mum told me he was in hospital and they didn't know what was wrong, but that we couldn't visit him because he might have been contagious or whatever. Anwyway, w few days go by and my gf is over after school, then later that night we were able to visit my dad, so we dropped my gf home and went to the hospital. We stayed there about an hour and I was having a pretty tough time with the whole situation because I'd never had a sick family member. So we get out of the hospital and I check my phone and see I have a bunch of missed texts from my gf. 

She was mad at me, for not replying, when I was visiting my sick dad. Okay, what the fuck. Then I reply saying sorry, I was busy and she straight up breaks up with me over text, saying ""you haven't been caring about me at all this week""

She was that selfish. She couldn't just be supportive of the fact that my dad was really sick, instead she just got mad and broke up with me. It was so fucked up, I still can't believe it."
387,"That's actually wrong. Hangovers are caused by the buildup of acetaldehyde created during the process of alcohol processing. 

Alcohol is turned into acetaldehyde by Alcohol Dehydrogenase. This reaction falls under zero order kinetics (or is broken down at a certain amount per unit time regardless of concentration in the body).. That's why we can get drunk - alcohol can build up in our blood stream. That acetaldehyde will eventually be turned into acetate; which is much less toxic and can be used as an energy source, leaving the body as CO2 and water. The reaction that turns acetaldehyde to acetate is also zero order, allowing for acetaldehyde accumulation. It's also thought that acetate build up can lead to headaches as well.

This accumulation of acetaldehyde leads to the symptoms. The only cure is time. IV fluids may help by increasing the volume of fluid in your bloodstream, decreasing the concentration of acetaldehyde and acetate; but the true cure for a hangover is absolutely just waiting it out.

[I'm a medical student who has studied metabolism extensively in classes; but since this is the internet and I need to provide a decent source, this article by the Scientific American breaks it down pretty well.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-search-of-a-cure-for-the-dreaded-hangover/)"

389,I wasn't planning on it but I guess a threesome would work too 
390,"They can.  Attraction isn't something you can control though, it's either there or it's not.  That doesn't mean you can't be genuine friends with someone that you are also attracted to.  "
391,that's the only thing that does.
392,Damn....
393,Basically when they get together as a couple they then have no space of their own anymore and stereotypically the woman is more assertive about how the house is decorated and furnished and so the man desires a space for his interests that are not shared with his partner
394,"We domesticated wolves, and asked them to be our friends.  They said yes, because they're good boys and girls."
395,"Pretty good odds.  We Americans love you Aussies!  So, show up in a vest a'la Crocodile Dundee, one of those cool hats.  Between that and your accent you'll charm the pants off of any ol' Zoo HR person.  Good idea!  We miss Steve Irwin."
396,Bye Felicia 
397,"During the brief time I was single in college I went out to smoke weed and go bowling with my guy friends, but this girl I was trying to get with wanted to come too.  On our way back she asks if I'll walk her home because it's dark.  Of course I say yes.  She's getting a bit touchy all night, so I know things are going well.  After everyone else is out of sight she puts her hand on my cock and feels it up a bit, then goes down the pants for a better feel.  She looks me right in the eye and says ""Your as big as I hoped you would be."""
398,The shaved head undercut. 
399,I appreciate your honesty but also hot damn
400,Important caveat: she must not currently be an employee of the establishment you are patronizing. Service people are paid to smile at you.
401,"The ones that don't care if your/a woman is with someone. They keep trying to pick her up, even if they know you're with her.  

That's the quickest way for me to lose all respect for them."
402,"When I was a vet tech I'd have to help put down at least 3-4 pets a week. So much so I am very numb to the whole process, unless the owner won't be in the room. It still makes my blood boil and I resent every single owner who would not stay. The animals would look for them. They were frightened. We try our best to comfort them, burner aren't family. Family abandoned them because they were cowards. "
403,"Take a positive spin on it.

 Without the low feeling of sadness, we wouldn't cherish the soaring heights of happiness as much.

 I'm glad your meds are working (hopefully) as intended."
404,"""she's hot, good for her"""
405,"I made a joke about my D, she said I should put it in her E... I was confused, then she said... Esophagus. 😂 "
406,Begging me to go bareback the day we met. I was legit scared she was going to try and pour used condoms into herself. It freaked me out. 
407,How about Staci where you dot the i with a love heart.
408,"Sounds Cliché, but your Hometown. I've been in the military for 4years and haven't lived at home since highschool. I used to love going home for leave, or fantasize about moving back home when i'm out, and realizing there is nothing special about it. I am relocating soon somewhere with my current SO when i ETS, and can't wait. She tells me that i should just go back home sometimes when i talk about it, but then i explain about how everybody who grows up there wants out, and i finally made it. I travel a lot with road trips, i fly places every now n then. I can only take my mid western small town life for maybe a week or two at a time now being around people who havent gone and experienced life as much (nothing wrong with being a comfortable homebody), but i've outgrown it. "
409,"""What is the comfortable way for you and your parent to do this?""

WTF?"
410,No watching Rug Rats because it sounded too much like the word drug...
411,"Guys who try to enforce what it means to be ""masculine"" on other men. Don't get me wrong, encouraging men to be confident and assertive is great, but calling people faggots and pussies because they have values or interests or emotional dispositions different than the stereotypical heterosexual male ""norm"" is bullying, pure and simple. "
412,"She was riding shotgun with her hair undone in the front seat of my car.  I had a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, and the other on her heart.  She looked around, turned the radio down, and I said, ""baby, is something wrong?""  She said, ""Nothing, I was just thinking how we don't have a song"".

And I said our song is a slamming screen door, sneaking out late, tapping on her window, when we're on the phone and I talk real slow, 'cause it's late and my mama don't know."
413,"the weight should be increasing from workout to workout, not from the start of the rep to the end of the rep. "
414,"Well, he didn't whip it out at the grocery store..."
415,"I just do things I enjoy? Books, video games, cooking, tinder hoes, coding, etc"
416,This is my move!
417,"I've noticed this before, I've had some girls repeatedly initiate conversations but after that will never take the leading role in keeping it going. Guys in general are expected to be the more ""forward"" and assertive ones in regards to relationships.  "
418,The spitting.  
419,I used to be fat and got really comfortable being the fat friend of women. Now I've lost a lot of weight since middle school and whenever I talk to a new girl for prolonged periods of time they think I'm either hitting on or into them. Not all women are like that but I've lost 3friendships like that. It's odd how I went from something not even considerable as a male of the species to suddenly be viewed in this way. Thankfully none of my old female friends have acted like this with me!
420,"She's the kindest person I've ever known.

There's a lot else there, too.  She turns me on and the sex is good, she likes non-sexual touch as much as I do, she's a great conversationalist, and our values are similar most of the time.  She can make me think.

But at the end of the day, if I had to pin it down to just one thing, she's the kindest person I've ever known.  

I remember the moment I first realized it, as she was complimenting another stranger and improving their day...I just thought ""here's a better way to live, to approach each interaction positively and looking for a way to give everyone a helpful little bump in their day... I can do that, and I never want to be far away from it."""
421,"&gt; I wish I could say we were simply separated. But I'm widowed.

Everyone is expressing condolences but I noticed you would prefer to have been separated, because it would mean she was still living. That is such the definition of love."
422,"&gt; one of them came up to me to tell me none of them are single. 

After hearing that, I would say ""Oh okay."" And then proceed to ask each one of them out on a date."
423,I took mdma at a concert and I was dancing my face off. A girl I guess fancied me and started dancing with me and we made out n shit. The drugs made me fall in love with a girl I didn't know after a few minutes of knowing her.
424,"People who self-diagnose also use it to draw attention to themselves and to make themselves feel special.

It's kinda weird, because depression should be one of the last things you want."
425,"Just text her, you knob.

This isn't rocket surgery."
426,"&gt; All in all, it's just a very spread out city with nightmare traffic (see: the 405) and doesn't have much appeal beyond the tourist traps.

Exactly. I often see people on like, YouTube posting vlogs about their trips to L.A. and I can't help but wonder, ""Of all the places you could've visited during your trip to the United States you chose *Los Angeles*?????"" To me, the city has always appeared too dirty, crowded, and unkempt to deserve the reputation that it gets."
427,*....and then?*
428,"I got starfished once for four years.

My ex made masturbation fun again."
429,"There's not a single chance in hell that she would be given a second chance, fuck those people. 


Betraying someone you're supposed to love is just beyond my comprehension. I generally do not believe there's a single legitimate excuse for it, I wouldn't accept it. 

She might regret her decision, but at that point I'm out looking for someone who isn't a fucking cunt. 

Now I'm upset. "
430,"Guys make friends by doing things. They build, work, watch, and experience things together. The friendships are built side by side, as opposed to head on. "
431,"""The more girls laugh the more time they spend with their eyes closed. It's science.""

Study up ugly mugs"
432,Blink twice if she's right behind you telling you what to type. 
433,It kind of let me down to be honest.
434,"If you want to take her on a date, asking her simply to hang out may make your intentions unclear. Just like us guys shouldn't assume that any girl who's nice to us is flirting with us, women won't always assume you want a date when you're just asking to hang out. "
435,"If I find a girl attractive I assume a few things.

She's not single.

IF she is, she's getting hit on constantly, and is tired of it.

Also, I don't have any sort of depression issues or anything, but I just don't think I'm anything special. I'm just another guy drooling over her.

I just assume she'd rather go about her day without being accosted."
436,"&gt; she had a funny feeling I was cheating on her

Signs of a relationship ready for marriage would include **communicating those concerns** and working it out with your partner.

Signs of a marriage with a LOT of resentment, mistrust, lying, and cheating would include **invading your partners privacy on a hunch, screaming like a child, throwing away an engagement ring, setting rules your partner must abide by, and a disillusion to the fact that most people watch porn.**

This is much bigger than porn my friend.

I am engaged of the girl I've been with for 7 years. We get married in 2 months. Never in a million years would she do something like this. She would sit me down, tell me she thinks I'm cheating. I would be hurt. We would talk for hours. We would work it through. I would find the source of this concern. We would both come out okay.

No *rules* would be set. No *blind agreements*.

Oh, and for the record. Shortly after getting engaged we had one of the very seldom fights ever when we were a bit drunk. She threw the ring at me.

I picked it up. In the morning, we both apologized and worked it out. I kissed and hugged her and then I handed the ring back saying *""I spent 5 years learning that you are the love of my life. I took everything we've come to, the car I sold, and every ounce of me and put it into this ring. I gave it to you to say I am giving myself to you forever. This is not a bargaining chip. Throwing this around is saying that our marriage can be tossed away over a petty argument. If you ever, ever throw this at me again, I am keeping it and leaving to find someone who will appreciate what it means to be married.""*

We are deeply in love, couldn't be more excited about the wedding, we don't fight, we discuss, we trust each other. Oh, and she only takes the ring off now to shower or wash her hands.

**Not to sound cliche, but what are the chances that she has something to hide here? Clearly communication is a weak spot.**"
437,"Took me 45 minutes to get through immigration
"
438,"Doesn't help that the verb ""to be depressed,"" seems like a substitute for ""I'm temporarily sad today."" Happens quite often in my encounters. "
