2,"**This is why I say young people are annoying**.

This is a fight that should not have happened. 

&gt; ""Hypothetically if we completely stopped having sex until marriage would you stay with me?""

Is a question she should not have asked. This is just dumb immaturity. She tested you for base emotional validation and you failed by being honest. I **always** intentionally fail these because I'm absolutely allergic to them now.

What she needs to understand is that sex is a part of meaningful relationship. You probably wouldn't stay with her if ya'll didn't talk for the next three years, but she would never accuse you of sticking around just for the conversation."
3,"HEY!

I did this! 

We had sex a lot, she then said she wanted to stop for ""religious reasons"" (we were engaged at the time, but marriage was still like 2 years out). I loved her so I complied.

This is how it ended: pretty much sexless marriage and divorced with a kid.

DO NOT RECOMMEND!"

I thought about it, but then said no. I asked though, why was that the requisite? She said she found it so hot to see what guys would do to fuck her. "
14,"A few weeks ago I was bored and browsing CL personals. I came across one that said something like ""help me take sexy pictures for my boyfriend"". Not really holding out much hope, I messaged the poster. Not long after I got a response. The convo was fairly short and they wanted to come over to my place and take these pictures. I was on edge thinking that it was either a scam or an escort or really anything other than what happened. 

I went outside to smoke a cig and wait for them to pull up. When she arrived and got out of her car she was pleasantly attractive. Petite and exotic looking (think part Indian/Persian). She was really friendly and we went inside after a few minutes of talking on the porch. 

She said her man was away and her roommate wouldn't help her so she thought a stranger would be more fun. She said she used to dance at one of the local clubs too. She wasn't shy at all. She put on 3 different outfits and had me take pictures of her in various positions while she stripped the lingerie off. She gave me her iPad to take pictures and it was kinda awkward at first but after awhile I just realized the once in a lifetime moment I was in and enjoyed myself. She was only over for an hour. It flew by. 

There wasn't any flirting or anything like that. We smoked a couple bowls while she was here and that seemed to make everything more chill. I haven't heard from her since but it's one of those things that you can't really tell anyone and if you did, nobody would believe you anyways."

29,"Backpacking in Europe I met this Australian girl.  We spent an entire week together and it felt very natural, to the point where other people thought we were a long time couple.  Our last night together in Dublin we went for dinner, a nice walk -- basically had a date night.  She was flying out the next morning and at the end of the night we kissed in some beautifully lit square in town and said our goodbyes.  She had tears streaming down her face and she said how unfair it was to meet someone like me on a short trip like this.  We said our final goodbyes and walked away from each other.  I stopped and looked back and she had stopped and was looking back too.  We ran back to each other and embraced and kissed and held each other longer.  

Sadly this story doesn't end with us staying together and getting married but still, that time with her and that moment in Dublin was like a movie it was so perfect.  Vanessa.  She was beautiful."

Look at my screen name.  I'm coming from r/deadbedrooms.  **Do not apologize for taking your own sexual needs seriously.**

Now some bullet points.

- Also don't apologize for hurting her in the context of her little game.  A game like that is just her trying to manipulate you.  Her crying about it afterwards is also her trying to manipulate you.  Be above it.

- If she would be willing to go years without having sex, then her libido would be a problem in the future anyway.

- She's the one with the fucked up view of sex and love.  She suggested removing the physical expression of your love from the relationship, then got upset when you balked.

Stand your ground.  If she comes around, great.  Otherwise, consider that you just dodged a bullet."
32,"Straight married 32m here. When in high school (around junior year I think) my best friend was crashing at my place. We were chatting and sex stuff came up and some how the topic of being curious about what it was like to suck a dick came up. We both expressed equal curiosity about it and next thing we knew we were both getting aroused. We decided to give it a go with each other for a few mins each. Neither of us finished, and when we were done we took care of ourselves real quick and that was that. We both acknowledged it wasn't terrible but really didn't do anything for either of us and confirmed our sexuality. We have never spoken of it again and are still great friends to this day. 

Fast forward about two years after this happened and I ended up confessing the story to another one of my good friends who is also friends with my other buddy. Well he ends up confessing that he has had many of the same curiosities about himself but never an opportunity to find out if it's something he was truly into. He ends up convincing me to let him go down on me to see if he likes it and we did basically the same thing I did before - 5 mins each, no finish and then threw on a porn and finished ourselves real quick when we were done. He appreciated that he was able to confirm it wasn't for him either and although he moved across the country for his now wife we've still remained friends as well. 

I don't feel any sexual attraction to guys much but guys aren't repulsive to me either. My wife and I have been together almost 10 yrs, married 2.5 and are now looking into swinging. She knows all about my history and has asked if I would like to do anything with any guys if the opportunity arose, and while I don't find myself with any desire to do any of that again, I'm still not afraid to touch a guys dick but I don't really see myself doing that any more. 

Edit: my first gold! Thanks!"

34,"When whole groups of them wear matching pairs of those stupid boots with the wool inside them, I'm just like Ugg *women*"
35,"So, my girlfriend and I are currently in a bdsm relationship and at home she always wears her collar but every so often when she's doing housechores, she'll strip naked and put on her wrists and ankle cuffs because she says that it makes the work less tedious when she's in submissive mode.

One day, she's cutting up vegetables for dinner and she accidenty knicks her finger with the knife. I hear her cry out so I rush into the kitchen to see my naked girlfriend standing there holding her bleeding finger with tears in her eyes. I console her, hug her and kiss her finger all better, but now I'm packing the hardest boner in my life at the time and she can feel it poking her as I hold her close to me.

After a bit more cuddling and checking to make sure the cut isn't serious, she squats down, pulls my pants down with her teeth and gives me one of those deep blowjobs that she loves to give when she's feeling extra submissive.

So picture this, a sexy naked girl in collar and cuffs, squatting in front of me, my cock in her mouth, looking up at me with her big wet eyes...

... I think I'm going to go find my girlfriend right now."

37,"A French girl I dated some time ago would sing and play the guitar for me after we made love. She sang beautifully. It was more intimate than cuddling. She was (maybe still is, I wouldn't know) extremely shy and insecure of her singing, so no one really knew she was good at it, but she would make an exception for me... 


She was very special, everything about our brief but beautiful relationship was special and romantic.  "

39,"One time my girlfriend and I went to the park right as the sun was about to go down, and we bought some Not Your Fathers Root Beer and some ice cream and made root beer floats. We ended up staying out there for awhile and had a couple of floats a piece. Now, I had mentioned earlier in the relationship that I really liked exhibitionism, the fear of getting caught or even entertaining a passerby, but she told me she wasn't really interested in it, so I dropped it and never bought it up again. We end up making out under the moonlight on a bench and she starts to guide my hand lower and lower until it's underneath her skirt.  I slowly tease her for awhile and she starts to get really aggressive and starts growling. She then undoes my jeans in a fervor i've never seen from her, takes my cock out and immediately sits on it bareback facing away from me. She's going to fucking town for awhile until I see a silhouette starting to form several hundered feet away walking towards us. I tell her that there's someone coming and she tells me 

""Well hurry up then. I'm not stopping.""

I hurried up. All over her back, up to her head. "

Once you meet up just chill and talk about stuff like you normally would. Heres the key, if you both got on well and you like the girl, you will be looking forward to seeing her again, and dating wont feel like a chore.

Ive found that girls dont want you to go overboard on the first date, just keep it quick and easy and see if you two get on. If you get on well then on date 2 and 3 you can escalate things. 

Dont worry too much about the kiss at the end of the first date, ive made out with girls and never seen them again through my choice or theirs, ive also had a lapse in confidence and didnt get the kiss with some but ended up seeing the girls for some time after."

49,"Ranger up. Don't shit on someone uglier than you, because you're uglier than someone else, and that would be shitty of that person to shit on you. You've got a whole life to live. You can knock out a few hours with a cow in order to not deal a crippling blow to someone's self esteem. Most elaborate ruses are easy to see through, and they likely will. Most people aren't a fraction as smooth as they would lead themselves to believe. If someone is racist, or unbearably rude, sure, bounce and they deserve it. But if they're boring, or 50 lbs over their profile pick, treat them like a human, everyone wins. 

Edit: Getting out of there for something substantiated is different and more acceptable imo. To me, a grievance of substance is anything that they have control over, weight excluded, that is a massive turn off to you (racism, rudeness toward others, conceitedness, and things of the like). Something unsubstantiated, again imo, anything they don't have control over. If they're boring, dumb, heavier than their picture, suck it up, another hour or two won't kill you. If a woman sat down to a tinder date and the guy had a lisp or other speech impediment and she thought ""wow, didn't say anything about this on his profile"" and pulled the old I'm going to the bathroom and left or faked an emergency, that's fucked. Was he deceitful? Perhaps a lie of omission, but are we compelled to add any and all possible deal breakers on our profiles in the name of full disclosure? I think no. There are a great many things we hide to allow us an opportunity to be given a chance with another man or woman, and there's no harm in that. The least the other person can do, who is more than likely guilty of the same offense, is grant them enough respect and demonstrate some measure of common courtesy and see the agreed upon engagement to finish. 

Edit again(sorry): the argument is made that being deceitful warrants a wake up call, life is unfair and that person needs to learn that. I agree life is hard, and it will be for those people. I will not go out of my way to be that wake up call. I will go out of my way to be the lighter side of life. If I see an unlocked car I think to myself ""that's dumb, their belongings could be stolen"" I don't think ""it's my responsibility to break into that car, because this stranger needs to learn the error of their ways.""

51,"Here's advice I've shared before, for flirting in a party/bar/nightclub setting. For a daytime setting, I'd break the ice with a comment on our surroundings, introducing myself and taking the conversation from there.

I do this instinctively, so it was a lot of work to get it out of my head and into writing.

**Step 0** is to fix your mindset. 

* Love yourself.  You don't seek approval, validation and care; you generate it and provide it to yourself. This is 90 percent of the battle.  All the tactics and behavior will happen naturally if you love yourself first.

* Neediness kills attraction.  Independence ignites attraction. You'll have a good time with or without a girl.

* It's okay to have needs, wants and desires. Do not feel guilty for having them.

* You are married to your mission and goals, and women are your mistress.

* Do not treat women you want like you treat your mother. Doubly true for those who grew up in traditional, conservative or Asian families.  Be a gentleman to your mother but a rogue (better yet, a gentleman rogue!) to your girlfriend(s).

* Women are sexual beings.  They enjoy pleasure as much as if not more than men do. You are not doing them a favor by treating them like innocent angels. They often resent when you fall in love with a romanticized illusion, not with their real selves. You're paying her a compliment by acting like she's attractive.

* Start believing that the possibility of intimacy is always there, with every girl you talk to. Assume attraction.

* Feel nervous when a girl gets flirty and touches you? That's okay. There's a reason why it's called sexual *tension,* not sexual torpor. Flirting is the increase of pressure. Kissing and sex is the release of pressure. Don't fight it. *Embrace it.* 

* Your time, attention and most of all commitment are valuable. *You* have value. Don't waste them on girls who don't reciprocate your feelings. Don't give her boyfriend-level attention if she don't give you girlfriend-level affection.

* Rejection is better than regret. You'll forget the rejections. The regrets where you never made a move can haunt you for life. 

**Step 1** is to stop making self-deprecating jokes. Don't put yourself down.  That's one of the simplest, fastest and most effective things a guy can do appear more confident and attractive. Maybe later when you're doing it from a place of confidence, however it too easily falls into approval-seeking.

Don't fawn over girls because of their looks. Be the one guy who doesn't fall all over himself to impress her just because she's hot. 

**Step 2** is learning how to playfully tease girls. Tease your way into a girl's heart; don't teach your way into it. If you can get them to laugh at their own foibles, you're golden. I would start small, and ramp up as you get bolder. If you overshoot, you could piss her off.  

One mental shift that helped me was to think of flirting as ""verbal tickling"" or ""tickling with words."" A light poke, not a punch to the face.  This helped me a lot in coming up with clever lines on the fly. 

Always be playful. Also move on quickly to a new thing in the conversation; don't necessarily wait and watch for her reaction.

A little trick I've done is to notice something about the girl and mock another girl I know who has the same quirk (who's not present with us). It's a great way to practice, and the girl you're into doesn't take it personally and get offended.

Example:

&gt;Her: Sorry I'm late! I couldn't decide what to wear.

&gt;You: (chuckles confidently).  You're okay.  I knew one girl, she couldn't decide what to buy at a hot dog stand--that only sold one type of hot dog.

&gt;Her: Ha ha! Oh my God. 

I've found either girls act relieved they aren't as bad as the girl you're mocking, or they laugh and agree, ""Oh God, I'm so like that too!"" Either way, she doesn't feel personally attacked as long as you're playful. Make it clear you're only making fun of *one* girl though. If you speak generally or about all women, that often goes badly.

**Step 3** is speaking in a slower, lower, deeper voice, more in command. One mistake I see a lot of guys do, is they're so indecisive, even their statements sound like questions, e.g. ""I'm Ron Burgundy?"" 

Speak with more authority, not like you're trying to get approval.  More ""I'm Ron fucking Swanson."" A mind trick is to think of ""owning"" what you say. 

**Step 4** is ""I Don't Give A Fuck"" (IDGAF) level. A more concrete way to think about this is, ""Never apologize, never explain."" Obviously that's extreme.  I would experiment with not being so quick to say you're sorry, you're kidding, you're just joking unless the other party really expresses feeling offended. 

Accept that it's okay to disagree with her. It's a mistake when you say your honest opinion, a girl disagrees and you cave in or back-pedal from your statement. A lot of times, she'll respect you more for sticking to your guns. 

I can't count how many times I've hooked up with a girl after we earlier disagreed about something.  While the guys who sucked up to her and complimented everything she said were ignored.

Girls are attracted to guys who stand up for what they believe in.  Joke: what do girls think the sexiest body part of a guy is? Answer: having a spine.

**Step 5** is to touch her.  Breaking the physical barrier is tricky but absolutely essential in showing her that you're comfortable with your body and expressing interest in her.  There are tons of seduction/pickup material on what lines to say, but the most powerful communication is nonverbal, speaking through your body language.

As easy way to start off is with innocent touching, e.g. moving her out of the way when someone is trying to pass by.  If you're in a loud environment like a bar or nightclub, one of my go-to moves if I can't hear her well is to touch her lower back, tilt my head toward her and get her to talk into my ear. Feels more intimate.

If she doesn't pull away from your touch, you can escalate. Move closer, touch her arm when reacting to something funny she says, put an arm around her and if you're sitting together, press your leg against hers. Pat her knee or thigh once in a while. 

Touching progression:

Innocent &gt; Playful &gt; Flirty &gt; Sexy

Show you're not afraid of contact. If you're cool about it, often she will be too. If you're nervous and uncomfortable, she'll mirror that as well. Ideally, she should be reciprocating or accepting. If she's not and is looking freaked out, dial it down immediately. Maybe even bail out entirely. Read the situation and use your best judgment.

Here's a great blog post by a Redditor that goes into more detail:

[How Touching Gets You Laid](http://socialmasteryrb.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/how-touching-gets-you-laid.html?m=1) 

**Step 6** is to get her alone.  Go outside for a smoke break, invite her to your place for a drink/a movie/whatever.  Or just say something like, ""Hey, you wanna get out of here?"" Don't overthink it and try to come up with some clever line.

You really want to get her away from her friends (if she's in a group). Best case scenario is her friends might be overprotective. That's understandable. Nothing wrong with rescuing a girl from a guy she's clearly not interested in. 

Worse case scenario is they're jealous of her and if they don't get male attention, they don't want other girls to get any either. Those are the types that will try to sabotage you, even if the girl has shown she likes you.

Also, a girl doesn't want to risk damaging her reputation. She won't be comfortable with escalating if her friends are around. Although most girls will deny this, they care a lot about what other people think (especially friends).

You want to create a little privacy bubble where she'll be more comfortable with having fun with you, without worrying about social consequences. 

**Step 7** is to make a move.  Once you've got some privacy, here's a sequence you can try:

* Look in her eyes.

* Put your hands on her hips.

* Pull her towards you.

* If she doesn't pull away, go for the kiss.  Don't: shove your tongue down her throat. Do: gently nibble her lip and touch her neck.

The key thing is you need to have been *touching her throughout the conversation*.  If you try to ambush her with a kiss at the end of the night, she might reject out of surprise even if she's into you. The earlier touching is a preview of telling her with your body language, ""Hey, I'm into you.""  So the kiss, when it happens, will feel much more natural.  

Make out with her or go further if you're both up for it.  And if she's not feeling it right now, that's okay too. 

Try to get her number so you can ask her out later. However, I leave that as the last resort. Exchanging phone numbers is the end of an interaction, not an escalation.

Unless she rejects really hard, then there was some miscommunication: she may have acted flirty without realizing it or you misread things as signals when they weren't. Don't stress, it happens.

Generally, I've found it best to escalate as much as you can the first few times you meet her. That's when you're at your most mysterious to her. You're an attractive stranger, not a friend she sees as a brother. Girls don't want to hook up with their brother. 

You're also at your most confident because you aren't invested in her yet.  It's easier to get a date after some physical intimacy, the flake factor goes way down. The whole getting-her-number-then-dating is much more of a gamble.

The keys are to keep it light, casual and fun. *You* are the party, and she's invited to tap into your energy or not. If a girl senses you're trying to ""get"" approval, validation, affection from her, it's a big turn-off.  You love yourself; and hey, you're open to her loving you too. But you don't need her.

Try to flirt with girls who *already expressed interest in you.* For a list of hints and signals that girls like you, click on my user name and sort comments by ""Top"" ""All Time.""

58,"Last year I went for a massage that ended in a 'happy ending'. The woman was not a registered massage therapist but was very professional, and was definitely experienced in massage, among other things...

Originally I was looking for a normal massage, but when I came across the ad posted on Craigslist I thought, why not? She advertised as offering a sensual, therapeutic massage and hinted towards it involving more than just massage.

I did my research on the phone number and name of the massage provider, and saw that she had been positively reviewed by other people.  On the phone, we agreed on a 45 minute massage for $90- The phone call was probably the most awkward part, trying to determine what was included for what cost, without explicitly saying 'so that price includes you jerking me off, right?'

She hosted me in her house, which was partially turned into a studio of sorts, and situated in a pretty nice neighbourhood. She was nice, a little older, and seemed quite normal, like she was doing this because she wanted to and actually enjoyed it. The massage room was warmly lit, scented candles, soothing music, the works. When I entered I put down the money and she asked me to get naked and lie face down. The massage was a hot oil massage (involving warm stones and other things) which in itself was actually pretty decent.

About 10 minutes before the end of my time, she flipped me over and massaged my front. By this stage, the towel covering my waist was long gone and it was getting pretty obvious that I was ready for the 'main event' or *climax*, if you will. After about 30 minutes of massaging and relaxation, the happy ending was phenomenal! This wasn't some rushed tug from a greasy hooker; it was slow-building and perfectly executed like she knew exactly what to do. I've had plenty of girlfriends and plenty of sexual partners give me handjobs in my life, and none of them compare.

In the end, I left very happy. I didn't feel weird, guilty or ashamed after it. She got paid well, and I left with a shit eating grin and had a great day. Would repeat."

I waited where we had planned, and suddenly appears this.. thing, that somewhat resembled the person on tinder. Except at least twice as heavy and generally looked like princess Fiona after midnight.

I tried to play it cool and get a conversation going, but she was blank as a sheet of paper and casually racist :D

Got to a café, told her to find a table while I ordered - and then quickly texted my friend living nearby ""code red"" and where I was at. Went to the girl and dropped fake hints that I was actually bisexual and just came out of a gay relationship.

Then my friend comes in the door, finds me, and starts to make a scene where he is pissed because he didn't think me and him were over. People start looking and the barista asks us to keep it down, all the while the poor she-troll sits in awkward agony.

My friend ends up storming out the door, I apologize to my date and runs after him. Out of range from the café we stop and have a great laugh, later that day I bought him a beer.

But that is just one way to do it"
61,"&gt; She just wrote a status on Facebook saying she's a lesbian now.

I laughed at this, it's just so absurd. If she actually did that then forget her, oh man"
62,"I was once stuck in a huge blizzard in the middle of downtown, about a foot of snow had fallen in the past few hours and the roads were completely clear. The library my then-girlfriend and I were taking refuge in closed around 6 or 7 and kicked us out into the cold. Imagine the most perfect snowfall, big white fluffy clumps of snow falling, no wind, nobody in the streets except us two. We were messing around in the snow, just being happy with each other's company, walking in the middle of the frozen streets when I decided to kiss her. As soon as our lips touched, a church in the distance started ringing their bells. It was like a movie moment.

64,"Real life relationships aren't squeaky clean like Disney romances.  Regular sex is a normal requirement that most people (men and women) have for their relationships.

The fact that a sexless relationship is a deal-breaker for you doesn't mean you're using her for her body.  If she thinks it does, she's probably the sort of person whose parents warned her that men are ""only after one thing,"" and that women should keep their guards up until a rare ""good guy"" comes along...the sort of guy who's willing to wear a chastity belt for the rest of his life if that's what makes her happy.

Two things can be true at the same time:

1) There's a lot more to relationships than sex.

2) Sexless relationships really, really suck, and it's not unreasonable to actively avoid being subjected to one.

If I was in a relationship and I suddenly decided to stop fucking my girlfriend, I'd expect her to leave me.  Relationships and marriages deteriorate when one person isn't getting their sexual needs fulfilled.  That's why sex therapists exist.

Why does anyone even need to explain this????"
65,"I got jerked off by a very good female friend of mine, later in life ... I mean, later to be getting nothing except a hand job. I was 28. 

She was hot and we had a connection. But she made it clear a handy was all I was getting the first time we ever hooked up. So I gave her the, ""Don't bother/I'll pass/I don't come from handjobs"" line to send her on a mission. 

Well, she beat my meat like I used to when I first discovered it. As I was about to come, she tightened her grip and stroked downward. Something about the grip, that downward stroke, the fact I was getting jerked by a hot chick like I always dreamed of ...

Skeet!

I heard it spray out of my dick and literally could hear it move through the air above my head like Neo in The Matrix. Fucking load slapped the wall like a water balloon. 

The two of us played load and seek trying to find the rest for about five minutes. To this day, I have no idea where it all went, but that shit landed no where near us. "

We had been silently staring for a while and for the first time I randomly just said ""I love you"" really softly. She was ecstatic because she felt the same way but was too nervous to say it. We made out on her roof for like 30 minutes. Probably going to take a while to top that one. "

My suggestion would be to try to ferret out why she was concerned about it. 

On the surface you've got that she thinks you're only with her for sex. But I suspect there's something more, maybe a friend got dumped, or she thinks there's something missing leading her to think sex is all you want. 

In reality there's something deeper, just got to ferret it out. "
72,"I stopped watching porn and fapping for 4 months; did the whole /r/NoFap thing. Before I'd started, I had some pretty severe ED and I needed to watch more extreme porn to feel any arousal. When I did get hard, I didn't get *that* hard.. It was mostly just floppy.  
  
The first 2ish months, my sex drive was non-existent; I thought I'd become asexual, and it was actually kind of nice. And then my sex drive came back with a ferocity, and I was overwhelmingly turned on by pretty vanilla shit. I started getting morning wood again for the first time in years, and had a few wet dreams. When I got boners, they were now harder than oak.  
  
Gonna give it another go, starting tomorrow. It's part of my New Years resolution. I don't like /r/NoFap.. They seem weirdly cult-ish, but cutting off porn and masturbation did good things for me."

78,"The biggest one I can think of is this idea that men suck at communicating....

No, Hannah. Men suck at communicating *in the way you expect or want them to*.

There really isn't a right or wrong way to communicate, within reason. But communication is viewed through a more female-centric lens.

Communication isn't just about talking, tactfulness, saying the right thing, etc. It's also about nonverbals and actions. If you think communication is only boiled down to ""I love you"" and ""please"" or ""thank you""? Then you have a narrow view of what communication is. 

People rant so often about how men suck at communicating and listening but I know that there are also a lot of women who suck at making their male partner feel loved or desirable. 

No matter who you ask, people always suck at communication  if they don't communicate in a way that we prefer."
79,"Hard drugs and sexual frustration. After snorting amphetamine, bro suggested it, and I was like ""Eh, why not?"" Bro offered... insisted, on reciprocating. I reluctantly let him, but stopped him after about 5 seconds. Complete absence of hard-on, and zero arousal at the idea of a guy sucking my dick.

108,"A few months ago I made plans with my mates to go to a footy game (AFL) as we hadn't been all season. I organised the tickets and everything and made sure I was at the stadium 45 minutes before it started. It was getting closer to first bounce and I was texting them and calling them wondering where they were.

 I waited til the end of the first quarter before I realised they weren't coming. I went in to the ground and watched the game, It didn't help that I was surrounded with empty seats. I didn't even care my team had won, I just felt really shit. The next morning I see their snapchat stories and they had all gone out drinking and partying. "
109,"NO AND THEN!! :P

It all started because she got upset that I have weekends off to go to a mutual friends cabin and she didn't. She claimed she'd never forgive us, and when we talked right before she hung up, she expressed some thoughts of depression, and I urged her to speak with a shrink (I've done lots of therapy and she knows it). 

She was like, ""Thanks Diablo"", and hung up.

So, I was in the midst of packing for a move and I went to handle that. Checked my phone later and all the calls and voice messages were there.

Seriously, that was when I started thinking she might be mental (she was).

She also had a key to my place. So I called a few mutual friends to tell them what was happening, let the cops know that I might be calling back, and barricaded the door.

In my world, someone emotionally unhinged coming over uninvited is the prelude to an assault or them trying to burn your house down.

I'm a large black dude, she's a small white lady, so I'm not trying to catch a case or a bullet because she's in my house trashing it and I need to physically remove her, see?

Best way is to not let her in.

So she comes over, knocks on the door screaming, ""GOD FORBID SOMEONE CARES ABOUT YOU!!!""

I crack the door and calmly go, ""I'm not comfortable letting you in right now. You should go home. We should talk on the phone when everyone is calm.""

Her reply:

""YOU THINK I'M DANGEROUS??!""

Finally, she slides my key under the door, goes to her vehicle, cries for a bit, then leaves.

Next day, inchanged the locks.

113,Manspreading. Yeah I understand it's typically only men who sit with their legs spread but at least we have the excuse of having balls between our legs. I've seen just as many women try to use their purse as a buffer and you don't have any reason to do that. Plus every time I've been on the bus and someone was taking up too much space you know what I did? I asked them if I could have the spot their legs are encroaching on or where they've placed their purse and every time they've obliged. I honestly think manspreading was just started by a women who thinks her social anxiety is a legitimate excuse to not have to interact with anybody and politely ask them if you could sit there

After a night of drinking and fucking her, she 69'ed me, and her and her husband shared my cock with each other.  I couldn't see anything because her pussy was in my face, couldn't tell who was doing what.

That probably makes her think something is lacking in her relationship hence ""he only wants me for sex"" thinking.  Sometimes chicks test a guy buy sometimes they want to know where they stand too, what their value really is.

&gt;I like plenty of other stuff about her she just won't listen

That was OPs biggest mistake, trying to appeal to her ""feelings"" with logic or reason. If she ain't feeling it then it ain't real.  Replying back ""what if I didn't listen to your bullshit"" might work for some fellas but probably would have blown up in his face.

Either way he's 20 so he shouldn't even be thinking about marriage.  Him replying honestly i think is fine, if the relationship ends because of that then it should definitely end.

I had my legs half hanging off the foot of the bed.  I came and shot a load that hit the wall and headboard.

The second one was something my wife did.  She had teased me all day while visiting my parents. That night she slowly jerked me off and played with my ass while dirty talking.  When I came it actually made a spurt noise as it shot out.  I hit the ceiling with the initial shot."

173,"I thought this issue was over exaggerated until this past summer. Took my 4-year-old to a large indoor playground (FYI I am female). Not many people there. Started talking to a grandmother because her grandson was playing with my daughter. After awhile grandma actually started paying attention to her surroundings and noticed there was an older gentleman behind a half wall playing in the ball pit -- actually playing because he was throwing balls. She lost her fracking mind ""there is a MAN in here! Are the employees not paying attention? Are there no rules? He is obviously a predator, what sort of man comes to a place like this?! We better get our children and talk to employees!"" Etc.

I basically said ""he is behind a half wall, I'm sure he is playing with his grandchild. My Dad takes my daughter to things like this all the time""

Wouldn't give in, freaked out, left with the kid telling them about how they can't be too careful and that men like that touch little boys etc. Told me I was a horrible mom for sitting there and doing nothing about the horrible man.

Eventually the man and his grandson came out of the ball pit because they wanted a drink. Nice guy. Turned out his daughter gave birth to the second child the day before so they took grandson out for a treat while mom and baby were in hospital. He was oblivious to the commotion he ""caused"". I wasn't going to tell him as I didn't want to discourage him or make him feel like shite for playing with his grandson. Employees also said nothing to him. Why would they? He did nothing wrong.

Ive also been told on other occasions this summer that I shouldn't let my daughter dangle upside down in parks because of the perverts. Yes, she was wearing a skirt, but she also had shorts underneath. Even if she didn't, fuck it. She is a little girl and I refuse to cater to fear. Let her be a kid, let her dangle. Fuck everyone who is paranoid and trying to ruin her childhood."

Even in positions where it's a bit difficult to really move (like missionary) you can still wrap your legs around his waist, grab his butt/hips (which you can also do to get him to change pace), run your hands up and down his back or through his hair, kiss him on the lips/kiss or nibble on his neck or chest, bring him down closer to you so he doesn't feel like he's doing a permanent pushup, and sync your hips in motion with his.

Rub your tits, rub your clit, suggest a new position, get on top, if he's losing his erection then try to help him gain it back (bj).

208,Had an ex that would get mad at it but she also didn't want sex more than maybe once a month or so.
209,"I had my first threesome at 17. It was an incredible and overwhelming experience. But I was also obviously young and inexperienced, and full of all sorts of hormones that made new shit generally way more awesome.

Now at 31, I've had five threesomes since. And I can tell you that nothing about an adult threesome, especially with people you really don't know sexually, would ever compel me to get my dick sucked by a dude. Nothing. Not the feeling, not the general awkwardness of figuring the logistics out,  not the aftermath, nada.

The feeling of pussy averages out over time. So does a woman's touch.

But the memory of a dude sucking your dick will last forever, and the fact that you did it only for the *possibility* of sleeping with two women would probably fill you with regret. Unless, of course, you discovered some dormant homo-or-bisexuality. At which point... y'know. No regret and *chah-ching* for you I guess.

But here's what's going to happen. I'll save you the trouble.

You'll get that brojob. It won't even be a great one. Pretty average. Because the average person is, well, average. And you're not really all that psyched about it to begin with.

The girl, thoroughly impressed by your resolve--who will hide the fact that she'll tell other people that you let another man suck your dick just for the chance to sleep with her--will let the threesome happen. So game day comes around and you're ready to go. Things start off great. The emotions involved in anticipation are gearing you up and everything's progressing as you'd otherwise expect.

And then suddenly you're two minutes in. Proceedings are getting awkward because your leg needs to be there and the second girl's leg needs to be over there, but it's in the other direction because it's more comfortable for her, and you just elbowed girl number one in the side of her thigh because of all the fidgeting and apologized. But it's all good; you all have a good laugh because this threesome is a work in progress. But that work in progress infects everything you do, and the girls begin to realize that they're better coordinated and more comfortable with just the two of them. And after about five minutes you'll start to realize that you're a third wheel.

They're ignoring you more and more. And you don't just notice it, you *feeeeeel* it. It's isolating and embarrassing. And you start kneeling nearby, hovering like some creep while they're going at it, and you're jerking off. A voyeur on the outside. You're too isolated to participate meaningfully and too self-aware to leave. What's going on is little more than pornography at this point, except you can smell the pungent aroma of sweat, butthole and genitals not your own. It's bdussy. Strange bdussy.

And it will end. And at that end, all you got was a dude sucking your dick so you could watch other people fuck. And you'll walk around with the knowledge that *other* people now know you let a dude suck your dick just to have meaningless sex with a woman. They'll quietly question your sexuality forever, convention the only thing stopping them from saying it out loud. Until one day you and a buddy get drunk and he admits to having been in love with you for years. And that buddy will in turn try to suck your dick. And if you're not gay yourself at this point, you just lost a friend.

You let a man suck your dick for the privilege of losing a friend."

Work with it from there, simulate what would happen. If she started denying sex you'd try to find out why, and the  go to couples counseling. After all, maybe she was raped and was struggling emotionally, something you'd want to help with. (You're saying this all to her). 

If it was endometriosis you could still have an active and fun sex life, but no PIV. Then you guys would investigate medical options to help lessen the symptoms of it so she can enjoy life more.

Another one is lying that their friend looks good in something, when she really doesn't. I mean, I won't sit there and say, ""Holy crap, you look terrible,"" to one of my friends. But, I'll sit there and say, ""I don't think that's working on you, let's find something that makes you look hotter.""

And one of my closest friends I met from CL when I wanted a motorcycle riding partner. He's currently building me a house lol "
302,"Gay male who was friends with straight dudes and acted straight here.

It really depended on the guy. Back then in high school I was the only one who was out and had the balls to do it even though you get made fun of. But that led to many guys with obvious curiosity coming along. I only talk to one occasionally still. The others I stopped talking to, either because I screwed up because I caught feelings, or whatever they had to deal with in their brain to deal with the outcome."
303,Username checks out!
304,"When you're on top, you have to do all the work of insertion to make it go smoothly.  After that, just do what makes you feel good so long as you're not hurting your partner.  We love it when our lovers get off on us.

Also, lean down a bit so your tits are in his face.  That's double plus good for me, and he may like it too."
305,So romantic 
306,"Yup. Basically the argument is that women are ~conditioned~ by ~society~ to weave through crowds while men just walk in straight lines. Like there's a drawing with two dots slightly offset and when asked how they'd walk through, women draw a zigzag and men draw a straight line. So the tumblr feminist thing is to just shouldercheck men. What I don't get is that this whole thing implies that men constantly just bump into each other like bumper cars which is patently and obviously not true. "
307,You're really good at describing things! Have you considered writing a manual on how to tie your shoes without pictures? :)

311,"No, he wanted to be touched by another person on the dick."
312,"If she asked me at the party, it would be a ""not tonight, let's talk about this more tomorrow""

When we're not there, in the moment, we would end up having a long conversation about exactly *how* open our relationship will be from here on. Why that friend? How much fun can I have or does she want this agreement to be one sided? (That I wouldn't be ok with.) It would be a very serious conversation and possibly visited several times before anything actually happens. Basically I would treat the entire thing like we're opening the relationship. If she's not comfortable with that, then my answer for her is ""I'm not comfortable with that. If you want to make out with her, then you will do it as a single woman"""
313,Blow into her mouth when she goes in for a kiss. It's the worst.

317,"My favorite first date has been live trivia night at the local pub.  

Pros:

* It's a set length of time (about 2 hours).
* It gives you something to discuss that doesn't feel like an interview.  
* The questions give you bouncing-off points for conversation.
* You get to have fun playing a game.
* You get to show off your intelligence and maybe see if she has any.
* It's very social, in that there are a lot of people nearby talking with each other, but no one is going to bug you or your date.
* Even if she sucks, you will probably have fun anyway.  
* If she doesn't show up, you get to have fun anyway.

Cons:  

* If you are not very smart, trivia is probably going to make you look bad."
318,"Yeah, really as long as you move your hips enough that I move inside you at all its great. "
319,"You weren't naked, you were clothed in uterus."

326,"It's just another one of those lines people use to try to soften the blow of a rejection, it's not rooted in any actual reason or logic.

""It's not you, it's me"" generally means ""It's you.""

""I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" generally means ""I just don't want a relationship with *you.*"" 

Not everyone has the confidence to reject someone with specific reasons. She's giving you soft excuses to avoid possible uncomfortable confrontation, and because hurting your feelings would make her feel bad. "
327,Haha what an eyeroll inducing comment. OP do you really want an immature drama queen for a girlfriend? Or do you want one that understands that wiskey dick is a thing?
328,Continue to shit while wondering aloud why this sort of thing keeps happening to me
329,"Bring your chin down to protect your neck while continuing to stare into ~~his~~ her eyes. Bring up your hands and say ""I don't want no trouble"". Flex your traps and core while slightly bending your knees. Here comes the important part. In a low voice begin to say ""wolowolowolowolowolo"" slowly increasing in volume, ~~he~~ she should be surprised by now. Begin to sway side to side and loosen all facial muscles and your anal sphincter and your kegal muscle. By now you should be pretty loud and your ~~opponent~~ date will have stepped back and will appear visibly shaken. Begin to piss and shit yourself and let your eyes roll into the back of your head. By now you are chanting ""WOLOWOLOWOLOWOLO"" at the top of your lungs. ~~He~~ She will run away. Everyone within a one mile radius will feel a terrifying presence within their soul. Marvel as you ascend into your planar form."
330,"I quit watching porn about a month and a half ago. Still masturbate on the regular. No particular effects noticed, but there's been a lot of other changes in my life lately so it's hard to know which variable is causing which change.

333,"It's the age old, ""does this make me look fat,"" question. "
334,My college ex and I were in a bad state of being mostly but not quite broken up after dating for four years. She got me a wall calendar right before the point where she knew she intended to go no contact. Because clearly what I needed at that point was a daily reminder of her.
335,Wow that mature as fuck for someone straight out of high school. Good on you.
336,"Exact same for me.  I was always a little 'meh' about bj's.  I mean, it felt good but it wasn't anything close to PIV.  Then I dated this one woman and omg-holy-crap-wtf.  And she just loved giving them.  I was pretty sad about that after the break-up and now I'm in a LTR with someone that doesn't like to give them.  Sigh."
337,"Any woman willing to withhold sex before marriage, is going to withhold it after."
338,"That, I just... Wow. I think I need to find better friends. I can't think of anyone I know who could pull off something like that."
339,"Disappointed, tbh. Barring some sort of extraordinary extenuating circumstances... but generally, if I was a father, I would think.... like... that's all she can offer? I really fucked up as a dad.

There isn't much formal dedication, education, intelligence, or things like that required of being in front of a camera.

It's not really an ""oh that's trashy"" thing so much as I would be disappointed that she didn't pursue something that required a greater application of knowledge, practice, passion, or brain power, etc.

I mean, that's just how I would see it and my opinion. Not saying it's right or that it's a universal truth. (There are definitely intelligent sex workers.) It's just that it isn't a pursuit that requires that much of it."
340,"I don't mean this to be inflammatory in any way, but I've never been ""desperate"", in your terms before. But when I read something like this, I wonder if that level of desperation is possible for me. And will I ever get there? The only thing I have going in my favor is that I hate karaoke."
341,Very risky. She could have jumped off the roof to avoid saying it back. Or at least that's what my socially anxious mind says is logical.

347,That's the thing that bothers me the most is because she did say those things afterwards. But now today she isn't answering my calls or texts. She just wrote a status on Facebook saying she's a lesbian now.
348,Bet that fag likes girls that are *cute* and smell *nice* and are  *sweet*.
349,"The term itself has a purpose, it's just a really shitty purpose. I made a comment about this about a month ago that I thought was rather apt, here you go;

&gt; 'Mansplaining' has turned into this catch all term whenever a guys tries to give his understanding, experience or perspective on a particular topic, usually used to outright dismiss, shame and belittle him for expressing his thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; It's the same thing when people say a woman is 'crazy'; it's an inherently dismissive, dehumanising term that removes all individuality from the person it's directed it, and shows a complete unwillingness to try to understand or even listen to the other persons perspective.
&gt; 
&gt; There's far far too many of these words with such shitty connotations that just get thrown about. They have no use except to shame and belittle others.
"
350,Eventually everything just goes pretty numb and then you're golden.
351,"I had a short relationship with a woman once..typical situation where the flirting and courting were more thrilling than when it became official. The passion dropped out after that. We were together perhaps 4 months. She never *seemed* crazy during that time. 

But after we broke up, unbeknownst to me at first, she stalked me. She rented an apartment directly across the street from mine. Odd things happened where the phone would ring *just* as I came in the door, and she would hang up. It all came to light as I was walking down the street one day after leaving my place and saw her going into the building across the street. It was like my blood ran cold. 

That feeling got even worse when I realized her unit was directly across from mine and that she could see in the window. One night I deliberately left my lights off and saw her sitting in front of her window, staring at my place for 2 fucking hours. 

I ended up moving out under the cover of night. But I had to put up with it for 30 days to give my landlord proper notice, and god knows how long she was living there before I realized it. Had to be at least 2 months. "
352,"The actual posters used had manspreading as *one* example of inappropriate subway behavior, and included women placing their bag on the seat as another example. It's wasn't really a gendered thing at all. The internet only focused on manspreading because controversy generates clicks. "
353,"Oh, I would have turned around and asked how she could call the most intimate physical aspect of your relationship shallow.  It's something (I assume) you only do with her, and you've promised to only share with her, and she calls that intimacy, and your enjoyment of that shallow?

Yeah, 2 can play at that game."
354,I stopped telling them that I hate to be tickled because it always resulted in them wanting to tickle me. I can't even begin to describe how uncomfortable being tickled makes me. 
355,It's not really manipulation if she's up front about it 
356,"When I first met my wife, I found out she knew how to sign (sign language). A few months later, on one of our mini anniversaries she sits me down on our bed and plays ""John legend - All of me"" through her phone. It was our ""song"" but I was still puzzled as to why she started playing it. Moments later when the lyrics began, she starts signing the entire song to me. I literally sat there through a rollercoaster of amazing emotions, just mesmerized by her. It was the single most amazing thing anyone has ever done for me. I still think about that day and how much it moved me. That might have been the moment I realized this is the woman id like to marry one day.  "

364,"My wife definitely isn't what most of my friends would consider my ""type."" She's quiet, introverted, a bit shy, not into partying, nor sports. I'm loud, extroverted, not shy, love a good party, and been a jock since I was in Kindergarten. 

But 11 years and 2 kids later we're still going strong. "
365,Right? There is no way my ankles could ever end up behind my ears.
366,"Curiosity and some sort of quality that has her up front and forward. A girl that doesn't ask any questions is boring as all hell. It doesn't have to be about me specifically, but about the world and everything regarding anything. 

Someone that values knowledge and wants to learn. Wanting to learn is also a sign of intelligence. A drive to become better and understand. There is something oddly sexy about learning. Especially science. "
367,"It's likely just a kink/fetish. Imo nothing wrong with it as long as she's up front. If you don't like it, you don't have to fuck her"
368,"My first sexual highpoint was with a woman from craigslist.

I was 19, in college, and i put up an ad. A 40 sonething year old woman answered. And over the next couple semesters she came to my dorm room many many times. Lets call her betty.

I had sex before betty, but just shy akward teenage sex. 

With betty, there wasnt anything i couldnt do to her. I tried to think of different things to do to her, and i just ran out of things to try. And she loved it all. 

She even made a rib dinner for me and my roomates one night, and i was the weird guy with the nympho cougar girlfriend for a while."
369,"&gt; If your sexually active girlfriend randomly said ""No sex before marriage."" What would you do?

Appreciate her honesty and give her hug. By the end of that hug, break up with her so she can find a man willing to wait till marriage for her."

377,"Going to piggyback off this comment because I have the answer.

I guess I'm the only one who's visited the MoMA Design Store in this sub? Use [this](https://store.moma.org/wcsstore/MOMASTORE1/images/products/110454_A2_Butterup_Knife.jpg), OP. As you collect from the stick, it sections up the butter into thin extrusions with greater surface area, and more susceptible to be warmed much quicker, and spread more easily due to the size.

No heating required, which is exactly the point."

383,"&gt;""A real man would ____""

Please, a *real* man does whatever the fuck he wants."
384,"The obvious solution here is to just ask the guy out.  There's obviously no point in beating around the bush and playing weird mind games. Chances are he hasnt brought up you being into him because nothing has become of it so far.  If I heard a girl was into me, but seemed disinterested or avoided me let alone wouldn't ask me out I'd just assume she isn't in a position to date for whatever reason and there's no point in pushing it. 
Just ask the dude out, seriously. Worse case scenario you know his thoughts on the matter."
385,"And probably fake.

If you're willing to make a scene to get out of it then why not just walk out on her?"
386,[deleted]
387,"This is really a tough question. My daughter turns 18 in March so it's a little easier to imagine than if she were 3 or if I wasn't a father. I honestly can't say how I'd react without actually being confronted with it, but it also really depends on the circumstances.

There are a lot of stories of abuse and exploitation in the porn industry. Things like getting girls addicted to drugs and then using that addiction to keep them performing or make them do things they're not comfortable with. Or just cutting them off from friends and family and using manipulation to convince them they have no other options. In this case, I'd be disappointed, sad, frustrated and very pissed off. I'd also likely end up in jail for the things I'd do to anyone responsible for abusing and/or exploiting her.

There are also examples of porn stars who really love what they do. Dani Daniels is a good example of this. She did an AMA awhile back and she really genuinely seemed to enjoy her work. There were a few people asking things like, ""what was your worst experience?"" or ""what is something you've had to do for a scene that you hated?"" Her answer was that she only does things she's comfortable with and only works with people she's comfortable with. Basically, it sounded like she was very much in control of what she did and did not do, and with whom. She said she's always been a sexual and extroverted person, so it seemed like a natural career choice. She also said she has a good relationship with her family and they are generally supportive. If my daughter had a similar situation, I can't say I'd be *happy* about it, but as long as she's happy and making a comfortable living, I think I could respect her choice.

Either way, I would need to know any and all screen names she used so I could do everything in my power to avoid seeing her pics/vids. That's not something I need to see."
388,Having to move back in with my parents.
389,"A fwb actually taught me the trick that playfully annoys her! She leaned in for a kiss and I was ready to receive it but then she moved and LICKED THE ENTIRE SIDE OF MY FACE kinda like something Jabba the Hutt would do! The first time she did it I was like ""EW! WTF?!"" as she laughed her butt off at me. Well, payback being the bitch that it is, I started mimicking this move on her, sometimes with a firm hug so that she cannot escape and some tickling thrown in for good measure. Other days I can get downright creepy with it when I move (float) in for a lick and she sees me coming. I do NOT have a cute, small, dry kitten tongue. I rank right up there with Smaug, Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities and leave a slime trail on the side of her face of which any specter would be jealous! If ya can't stand the heat, don't teach THIS old dog any new tricks!!"

395,"What a petty thing for her to say, though :/"
396,"Women that do that type of thing (no all do) are generally ""testing"" men.  Some do that type of thing all the time, as a form of manipulation.  Some get the idea from their female friends.

No matter what the motivation, it's a no-win question.  In those cases, I either opt for complete honesty or call the woman out on manipulation.  The two women who tried to pull that stuff with me learned very quickly that I wouldn't tolerate it."
397,"I was at a bar once and hit it off with a really cute chick. She was really into me. We even made out a little bit. During the two hours we were hanging out a Persian guy offered his sister to me if I would ""introduce"" her. She was really hot, sounded smart snd was funny. 

What happened was that a friend of mine recently broke up with his girlfriend and mentioned to another mutual friend that he thought she was cute. Suddenly, I'm an asshole because she's into me. This mutual ""friend"" shit talks about me to her friends for at least an hour. I have never been so actively cock blocked in my life. Her friends and mine decide to switch bars and suddenly I get a wall of people dividing me and this chick. 

Her friends think I a dick and my ""friends"" are like, ""come on Jack, Steve really needs this right now.""

Mind you, she's into me. I'm not a bad guy. When I find out what happened, I'm confused because my friend at least had a girlfriend a week ago and I had been lonely for almost three years at that point. Most chicks usually aren't into me right away. 

I was gullible because I thought I had friends. :-("

and she said, forget i even asked.

403,"That's just mean. This is less of you being an idiot and her being a jerk, it really irritates me when people abuse the trust of others."
404,I'm normally attracted to blonde women who typically have blue eyes and bigger breasts. I recently started dating a brunet with brown eyes. She is just such a nice smart girl and I am just happy to be with her. At the end of the day I feel a girl who fits your personality is better than looks because eventually those looks will fade where as the personality stays forever.

423,why did you two broke up? 
424,"When we dated the first time we were in our 30's. She was in the middle of a messy divorce that took up a lot of her time and head space.   I did love her, but wasn't sure if I was just the rebound guy. 

I then had to relocate for my job.  Since she couldn't move with me we lost touch and we both moved on. 

We reconnected through Facebook after a few years but we both were in other relationships by then.  Fast forward a couple of years and now we are both single. I had the extra concert ticket and when she responded that she wanted to go, I was shocked and pleasantly surprised.  Neither of us knew what to expect, but that night it was clear that the spark was still there. 

We still lived in different cities, so we did the long distance thing for awhile. Then I took the plunge and moved back. So here we are, married and currently on our honeymoon in San Francisco. "
