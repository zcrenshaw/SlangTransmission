1,When I was 14 I didn't have internet nor access to porn. I once watched the music video of Hansen - MmmBop with my eyes squinted so they looked like blonde chicks and fapped to that.
2,I would like to see something replace it in terms of community. Not sure what exactly. I think church serves this purpose for a lot of people who don't have time or money to get involved in other group activities. Plenty of non-believers go for this reason. There's so much social insulation in todays society already. Everywhere you go bored and anxious people looking at their phones instead of interacting. It's​ depressing but I can't help but do it too. 
3,"Out of all the women I've dated, only one has ever broken up with me. She listed about half a dozen reasons why, but the one that struck me the most was when she said ""...and I can't stand how many idioms you use in normal conversation"". 


I just looked at her, completely dumbfounded, and said ""Do you feel better now that you got that off of your chest""? She screamed and slammed her dorm room door on her way out. Only about a minute later did I realize what I had just said. Still makes me laugh to this day.

5,"She's unapproachable.

I've probably convinced myself that she's unapproachable because:

* She's out with her platonic guy friend( and I have no idea if it's actually platonic or not)

* She's out with her catty friends [and I'm not looking to get roasted today](http://i.imgur.com/ncklsiE.jpg)

* She has a look on her face like someone shitted on her breakfast this morning.

* She has her headphones in.

* We work together.

* She hasn't given any indicators of interest.

* She's a friend and indicating non-platonic interest would threaten the integrity of my (or someone close to me)'s social circle.

* We're not at a place where it's appropriate to approach(Gym, on the street, A coffee shop

I mean that literally. Throw her on the bed and fuck her like you've been in prison for a year.

Unless she objects for some reason. We don't want to rape anyone..

She is pregnant and she may not feel as desirable and this may affect her self esteem and eventually it will affect how she feels about you. If you love her, get over yourself and do it. Let her know you still desire her and love her.

Because I guarantee you won't be doing it for a while after she gives birth."

15,"At some point in my mid twenties I woke up. It's that simple. I just looked at my life, at the things I wanted to achieve (not even career or money stuff, just regular old self improvement and hobbies), and how I'd always half assed my way through things because I was smart.

I figured out that intelligence without discipline was useless. The dozen projects I had half finished because I just didn't feel like it were a joke.

So I got pissed at myself.

I set daily goals and didn't stop into they were complete. Then I st weekly ones. Then monthly. By expanding what I had decided to achieve in any given short period of time I figured out how to motivate myself not just on the small scale (which is easy), but how to maintain focus.

Would have worked much better if I'd started sooner though. If I'd gotten wise younger, I'd have had better grades. I graduated high school with just over a 2.8 gpa despite never doing any homework because it was easy stuff. I just coasted. 

The first time I went to college (community) I began the same way, just coasting. I had to quit because I couldn't afford it because I was having to work my ass off. I wss working my ass off because I didn't have the grades to get scholarships, and had to pay my own way (luckily I did have enough sense to avoid student loans). Got most of the way to my associates in nursing before I ran out of cash, never missed taking top grade in any class on tests, but still has a 3.1 gpa because I was lazy.

The second time when I went for my psych degree (still had to quit because I was out of funds) I had figured out self discipline. Instead of coasting, I busted my ass. The first two years I impressed my professor enough that the third year he got most of my tuition covered despite being over 30 (much, much older than anyone else there lol). When I had to quit again, I was still carrying a 4.0 despite having missed a butt load of classes trying to work full time, cover medical bills for a family member, and doing full time at school.

It's about deciding, every day, what's really important. Do I want to have fun that day, just chill and play games or whatever? Do I want to move forward on a goal? It's pretty rare to be able to do both.

There's nothing wrong with relaxing, having fun, just being. But when it comes time to do something, you have to decide to do it right, and doing anything right takes discipline.

Now that I'm busted up, worn out and disabled that choices are different, but the principle is the same. To cook a meal I have to decide that it's worth the pain. It'll take me two hours to do the prep that used to take twenty minutes. But it's either that, whee I get to eventually eat a really delicious meal that's filling, nutritious, and makes me happy; or I take the lazy way and just pop in some frozen shit that fills the belly but leaves me empty.

That's the thing about being lazy. You end up with nothing for your effort. But if you apply yourself to the same task, you end up enjoying not only the result, but the process so much more"

24,"Depends on how *strict* a definition on ""know""... 
   
- Guys that I *know* are straight that I want to have sex with: pretty close to 0% (straight dudes are pretty unappealing, there has to be a mutual attraction) 
   
- Guys that I've *met*/in passing that I want to have sex with: 30%-40% maybe more, I dunno. I *only* notice the hot ones. Largely because I don't really know if they are gay, so I ""fill in the blanks"" and imagine whatever's appealing to me in them being magnified (i.e., if I got to know them more, they'd probably lose their appeal) 
  
All that said, there is this **one** guy, whom I believe to be straight (or bi), and have quietly made an offer to in the past (that was politely, if obliquely, declined), if he brought it back up for consideration, I'd take him up on it and do my level best to *give him the absolute* ***best blowjob of his life***. For openers. He'd never look at guys the same way again! But that's just a one-off, specific to that one dude.

34,"Recently I was in the hospital. I had a 75 year old roommate (I'm 29). He and his wife were only several feet from the bathroom but I figured I'd be fast, they'd never know. It had been over a week since the last time.

What I forgot was that my heart rate monitor was still transmitting. There's someone in a room looking at a bunch of screens so they'll know if a patient has a problem. 

I was going for it and getting close to coming and my nurse ran into the room like ""spongue are you OK??"" I was thinking, yeah I'm fine, what do you mean? Why would ... Oh.

I came out of the bathroom and she was in the hall so I sheepishly told her what happened. She laughed and was like ""actually that's good to hear."" We went back into the room and she covered for me, like ""you must have been straining pretty hard in there!"" ""Yeah, definitely..."" took my blood pressure which was obviously high, ""hmm let's try the other arm..."" so it would have time to come down a bit. That nurse was rad."

&gt; This was not an isolated incident. I've noticed more men watching me, or smiling at me.   

Sounds like you might be attractive lol. I know on Reddit it's a cardinal sin to approach women at the gym, and I don't personally do it myself cause I'm usually focused on my workout... but it sounds like some dude who doesn't spend all his time on /r/askmen overthinking where it's okay to approach women was interested in you and was trying to find a way to start conversation."

I like ESL girls, because it takes them longer to figure out that I'm fuckin retarded. "
54,"I've been needing a setup for this rant for a while!  Apparently, in the midwest, at the age of 25 all my smaller town friends are married.  Most for 3-5 years.  Anyway, being the last remaining single guy in a group of about ~10 (5 couples), they want to set me up.  That's actually pretty cool of them, I keep busy with work so I don't interact with as many women as I'd like - such is life.  But I swear to god, stop setting me up with incompatible women! 

I love my friends, but they must think I'm totally desperate.  That sounds egotistical, like I'm writing off these women.  But when I ask about 'her' and the only positive thing you can say is ""She's really nice! And she's single!""...then come on.  What do you say about me? ""He's really sweet!"" God I hope that's not my only quality.

I'm a hardcore athlete and take it very seriously, yet they keep pushing me towards couch potatoes.  No judgement, just no compatibility.  They probably think I'd be a good influence, which I like to think I would be, but unless there's a strong spark I don't want to 'slow down' for someone so to speak.  Also, I want to be with an equal.  I've put in a lot of long hours at work and will continue to because I value my career, they know I don't want kids or to 'settle down' too quickly.  Yet they keep pushing women who want to have 3 kids before 28.

Sorry, I needed to vent that.  I probably sounded really entitled there and that's fine, I probably am a bit."

We went to get pizza and they made it to order. Well, the order was pretty complicated and the really cute girl who was making the pizza went along with it. With the context out of the way, the hottest thing she did was somehow following that order to a t but the way she was putting on the sauce and the toppings was just so artful and the pizza came out perfect. I was just entranced watching her make that pizza. There was something about it that turned me on quite a bit. After we got the pizza and was walking out, my buddy asked me if I, too, got a little turned on by the pizza making. "

59,"Sex during her pregnancy was normal; she seemed to have a higher libido during the pregnancy. After the baby it dipped, because she just had a baby and needed recovery time, but also the new baby schedule takes time to adjust. It was about 2-3 months before we had the time and energy. 

As time progressed we moved from once a week to once a month, then maybe once a month to never. 

My partner said she lost most, if not all her feeling down there after having the baby. She can't even get herself off anymore and there is basically no pleasure there. I've read that this can happen to some women and it can last a few years at the most, but sex drive does come back eventually. In my case our child is six and she still has the same problem with feeling. :("

I'll dip my finger in the bag and eat a little of the spicy Old Bay seasoning to hold me over at red lights.   

Once I get home I put on a ratty t-shirt,  line the coffee table with newspaper, and put two cold Natty Bohs within reach.  Pop on a movie and start smacking dem babies.

When it comes to *what* I fapped to, I have too much to chose from. Maybe the most shameful is a porn video simulating the repeated rape of a teen girl by her father. Or the one where two Japanese girls who were of age but looked like they were a few years younger than that, acted like they were forced to have sex with an old dude, pretending they were crying. (Not that I'm *really* ashamed; it's all acted and consensual, after all.)

I have a huge hesitation when it comes to getting involved with women who have kids. It's not a knock on you. It's due to my own experiences when I was a kid and my parents pursued romantic interests after their divorce. 

If things were to get serious, then I would have to accept the responsibility of being a father figure to those kids. I know I don't have to literally be their father, but there's still a responsibility there. 

Not accepting that responsibility wouldn't be fair to you, or the kids. It's not something I take lightly because I know what happens when it goes bad. I lived it. Maybe I'm just being over paranoid, but I don't feel like I'm ready to be that father figure and I'm terrified of becoming the kind person I hated when I was a kid. "

""Prosperity theology"" is a cancer and it's one of those things that can pretty much only exist in the United States, where capitalism and Christianity intersect. It's a disgusting perversion of the religion, used by swindlers who view believers as easily-duped sheep. I want that aspect of Christianity to disappear and to be replaced with something better. 

The bummer to me is that in the Bible, there's a lot of stuff that is just ridiculous on its face, and people would rather internalize the stuff that's not really about *belief*, and then skip the morals that are hard. Like, believing that there was a biblical flood that carved out *the grand canyon* is an article of faith, but then the part where Jesus says ""only lend money to people that you know won't be able to pay you back"" gets responded to like ""uhh, does it really say that?

I don't just mean because a lot of them are broke (student loans, no jobs, etc), I mean like... in the past, gender roles were very strict and well-defined. I don't think that was a good thing and I'm glad it's going away, but this generation is kinda fucked because they're still being told, and many still believe, that they're supposed to get married, buy a house, have kids, a car, etc. in order to be a ""man"", or an adult or whatever. But they can't do it, because this isn't the world that their parents grew up in, and I think that on some level they feel emasculated, or maybe infantilized, because they can't ""grow up"" since they can't do these things that they're ""supposed to do"". The whole idea of ""being a man"" is kind of twisted and broken now, there's no clear definition of what a man is supposed to do or be like. 

And then they have to deal with the older generation telling them that they're lazy or too soft and other shit like that. It must be tough.

The rest of the trip was epic as well, at the end of it when we were back at the bus, my best friend back then said to me ''You know, at the end of every day in my life I feel like I had one day less, but today it felt like I gained a day.'' "

142,"I posted this a few months ago, but here I go again...

&gt;Pizza dough.

&gt;Hear me out; I worked in a restaurant for a few years, and we had to make pizza dough and cut it into small 250g portions and rolling them into balls of dough. After a while, being a horny 16-17yo, I noticed the pizza dough had a really similar feeling as boobs, and even a similar shape. So at the end of one of my shifts, I left with 3 of these dough balls and went back home.

&gt;Once alone at home, I got them out, started feeling them like they were boobs, but it didn't get me hot like I thought it would. So I made a incision in one of them, put a condom on, and started fucking that little dough ball like crazy, while groping/sucking on the others(let these titties ones in ziplock bags, I didn't really want to suck on raw dough...).

&gt;It did the job, but then I was so ashamed, I had a bit of trouble cutting / rolling pizza dough without laughing at myself for how much of a loser I was, having sex with pizza dough."

150,"There's no risk of harming the baby, and sex can actually help stimulate the onset of labour, once she's near-term (relief!)

I wish we were rich enough to have more kids! LOL But, seriously, sex with my pregnant wife was some of the best I've ever had with her! Great memories. "
151,"Fishing for compliments from the general public (like on social media) is definitely annoying, but I think if a girl (or guy) is fishing for compliments from their SO, it should maybe be a sign to their SO that maybe they should...compliment them more? 

Like with the whole love languages thing, people like to express/receive love in different ways. Some use gifts, or physical touch, or *words of affirmation*, etc. Maybe someone fishing for compliments is just not feeling loved?

Idk, I don't think that's always the case with every person who's fishing for compliments, just an idea to consider. "

Next thing you know she's firing off a machine gun in there, all embarrassed, but sorta hoping that since the bed is on the farthest wall away I didn't hear.

See places and mountains and buildings and people you'll see again every time you close your eyes got the rest of your days. Learn that most people are good and how to spot and deal with those who aren't. Learn what you really like and what really matters. Learn what you truly need and how to let what doesn't matter truly slide.

One of my most erotic memories is when she was full term and we were having cowgirl sex; her orgasm triggered her breasts to let down and she sprayed me with milk.  

I'm glad we enjoyed ourselves during pregnancy because parenthood was like setting a bomb off in our relationship.  It was about two years before our sex life came close to recovery.  "

Trust is the most important thing you want in a partner. Without it you're just two people spending time together. I'm surprised women don't realise how much guys value it, and how bad it makes them look when they share private information like this.

&gt; her friends would make snide comments about it in a ""joking way"", 

This is even worse. Ask guys what they look for in a partner and its almost always someone kind and nurturing. These girl are advertising themselves as mean and judgemental. Not someone you want to have as a partner. No doubt they wonder why guys keep pumping and dumping them. Perhaps behaving like this lets them feel like they're getting revenge or something."

189,"I wouldn't say I'm afraid. Fatigued, perhaps.

Relationships these days are just too difficult. You can't count on anything to be predictable or sure. The standards are constantly being redefined and the relationships lines of do/don't are always moving, when everything is under scrutiny for offense or relationship power dynamics.

191,"Personally I think most people's outward emotional reactions are just for show.  I've never really shown much emotion, and people have commented on this since I was 12 or so.

I think and feel things pretty strongly, but I just never have the urge to show it.  I just see no reason to, it never pops into my mind.  Especially when it happens to strangers.

I show real emotion every couple months.  I'm outwardly pretty mellow but my mind is a strange place."
192,100% yes. This has happened to me so many times.
193,"The scenario he's referring to is when he's fighting with his girlfriend over text and she says something, he responds immediately, then she suddenly doesn't respond for a few minutes because she's sending screenshots to at least one of her friends for support/advice. "
194,"To be fair to the guy, he was offering a compliment. And it was more about progress than it was about how attractive you look. I definitely respect progress a lot at the gym; results are what we want, but progress is what I respect.

If you don't want to talk to anyone at the gym, you don't have to. Just thank them about the compliment and keep working out. If they won't leave you alone, just say ""Hey, I'm really trying to focus on my work out right now."" They should leave you alone. As for looks/stares/glances, you're working out in a public place; people will look."
195,"Pushing boundaries when it comes to ""guy friends"" or ex-boyfriends. I know a lot of girls who will flirt with other guys or stay way too close with exes, under the guise that ""it's not technically cheating!"" But in reality, they enjoy getting the attention of multiple men while still being in the comfort of a relationship. Hell, one of my close girl friends is dating a guy, and whenever she brings him along to go out with me and my friends, she spends the entire time talking with other guys. The guy she's dating is basically third-wheeled -- I try and keep him company because I feel bad for him. 

Overall this kind of behavior is just plain disrespectful and no self-respecting guy would put up with it. "
196,"This will probably get buried.

It's not mine *per se* but I totally remember this &amp; it was horrifying &amp; pathetic. My friends &amp; I were having a sleep over. Like 6 of us in middle-school. Just hanging doing guy stuff. This was around the time when 3-D graphics were getting really big. Friends &amp; mine were doing a lot of stuff all night. Driving out for food. Fucking off in our Suburban neighborhood. Going in town. &amp; playing video games. 

Friend bought the new Tekken with Christie the female version of Eddie Gordo. We stayed most of the night &amp;I then crashed until the morning. Then all of us woke up &amp; decided to get some breakfast. 

They sent me downstairs to get one of our friends who was ""still sleeping"" I walk down casually; he's *fapping* to Christie from tekken. He turned on the bounce graphics &amp; was *werking* to her beautifully rendered/modeled 3-D tits.

I ran up stairs in a heartbeat.

200,"As a female, I have never understood that. That's never an appropriate response to someone, especially one who is essentially paying you a compliment by showing interest. 

If a guy is legitimately creepy, it makes zero sense to provoke them with insults, it would be rational only to politely distance yourself. If a guy is exhibiting signs like that, you wouldn't aggravate the situation. 

It seems girls who do this are insecure and/or vain, and when someone they feel doesn't meet their standard of worthiness approaches them, they are offended. Always seems to me that these girls think, ""How dare HE think I'm in his league!?"" 

It really makes me sad because it's not at all reflective of the guy's character, it's reflective of hers, shallow and generally kind of terrible. But I'm sure it doesn't feel that way to the guy, it just hurts :("
201,"No; because one girl's subtle hint is another girl's friendliness.   

Men aren't mind readers. We only know what you say, and your explicit is our subtle, your subtle is our invisible. If you know any lesbians ask them this same question and they'll say the same thing, women are impossible to make heads or tails of even if you are one.   "
202,If WW3 breaks out we will all die in a nuclear holocaust and no one will need to be drafted.
203,"For a single guy, dating a single mother is almost always a no go. Here's why:

Yes, most men want to put their time and resources into raising kids. *Their own kids*. Not another man's. 

No matter how much you say they won't be raising your kids, if they stay a while they will. And it gets worse: if you're saying the kids biological father will be the father figure, that means your boyfriend has to deal with an ex who will always be there, will never go away and who shares a specific bond with you which the boyfriend never can. 

Either the ex is a bastard, in which case having him around is a nightmare, or he's a good guy and you're the reason for the split. Either way it's toxic.

And your boyfriend can only ever be third place in your life at the very, *very* best. Maybe not even that. Because your kids will come first, their dad and you will come second and your boyfriend a very very distant third. 

I'm sure you're hot. And smart. And funny. But so are thousands of women who *don't* have kids and a toxic relationship with a permanent ex. And they can put their SO first in their lives.

If you're as great as you say you should be able to get laid pretty easily because one thing that's excellent about single mothers is that it's really easy to avoid emotional entanglements because a boyfriend will pretty much never be their emotional priority. But long term relationships? Best try and find a single dad.  "

You can ignore your emotions and over time it seems like you're ""turning them off"". You're just not looking at them, ignoring them. They're still there, waiting to flow out (possibly in indirect ways). You can turn off the light but the roaches are still scurrying around."

246,"Yeah. I understand what she meant. I took my no like a champ. But what sort of terrible person opines that I'm the type of person they are looking for after turning me down for any reason.  I don't blame her for the no, I blame her for throwing it in my face soon after. "
247,"I had a really bad head cold, and had to breath out of my mouth.  This upset her.

263,"Did your wife have a traumatic delivery/episiotomy/tearing? I can't speak from experience due to the fact I haven't given birth, but nerve damage so extensive that she ""can't feel anything"" isn't exactly common. Her clitoris shouldn't have been affected since it kinda hangs out in its own cave up at the top, and tears almost *always* occur down towards the anus. 

If she indeed has no feeling down there then she should be probably be having urination/urinary retention issues. At the very least this needs to be brought up to the Doctor. I'm not trying to discount your wife's experience necessarily, but is it possible this is an excuse?

ETA: Of course sex drops off when you bring child birth and babies into the mix! And if you've read about this from scholarly sources then you've already done more research than me. But it's something her Gynaecologist should be aware of since it signifies nerve damage, especially if it's been going on for more than a year. "

Second trimester... holy shit.  More sex than I could handle.  Just crazy.  Every second we were alone she was pawing at me.  Pretty awesome.

Third trimester.  The beginning of the long dry season.  Don't expect anything for six months, at least.

Cheers, good luck, and remember - your babies happened because of your love for each other.  And your love for each other will still be there when they're grown and gone.  Nurture that love at all costs.  Yes, there will be times where the kids MUST come first, but those times are far less frequent than you would think.  And the kids will be better off for seeing a loving relationship between their parents."

2) They're not paying attention. Their eyes aren't really seeing because in their head they're focused on the conversation or on some internal conflict between Godzilla and a Megazord.  

3) You have something in your teeth or on your face. 

4) They're trying to intimidate you because they want to have sex with the guy you just met and now you're competition

5) They're not staring. A whopping 37% of males have lost one or both eyes during their lifetime. The guys who you think are ""staring"" are likely to just have 2 glass eyes. 

6) They're optometrists and are testing a new keep-your-eyes-open-for-hours-without-blinking-but-still-keep-them-hydrated drug.

280,"The answer to that, as a man with 2 kids, is no, btw. Men have it a little better in my experience, but neither men nor women want to date someone with kids. 

The funny part is it's still true, to a lesser extent, if they have their own kids. Let that sink in. 

It's still possible to find someone, but people are reluctant. "
281,"She meant ""like you but better looking."" it's not unfair to be shallow. If she was 600 lbs but otherwise amazing.... You just wouldn't be in to her (usually). You can't really ask that somebody finds you attractive you just have to keep taking the shot until you find a match. "
282,"Nah, she actually cared. I was on my high school baseball team. After we lost to another team, I walked out to the parking lot to find my girlfriend of two years sucking off a guy on the other team while wearing his jersey. Huge dick, way taller than me, way better looking. 

Haven't been in a relationship since.

Whenever my girlfriend has been bothered by something. She will drag that shit for eons if I do not address the problem myself. She often speaks her problems but sometimes she does not want to talk about anything that will conflict with me under the assumption I will react negatively so she just bites her tongue where it would be more beneficial for her to actually talk it out with me. She's gotten better about it and even now we rarely clash, but she isn't the first either to say that. Whenever a girl is ""just fine"" she is far from it, and when I was naïve I believed it and man it brought me problems."

304,"In all honesty, the only thing you can do is to bang him so much that his dick gets sore. He's not going to get over it by you being empathetic because once you say ""Oh it's fine,"" then he knows how bad the situation really is. Just keep demanding sex from him and get him to a point where he knows you're enjoying it because you keep wanting it. "

311,"Without a doubt, being snarky and sarcastic. Not to the point of being malicious, but a girl with good banter is a definite plus for me."
312,"Honestly compliments would feel cheap as fuck after that. Imagine he said you had a smelly pussy or a loose pussy, then once he saw you were upset, followed it with ""No but honestly your pussy is amazing. It's like the greatest pussy ever, honest!"" 

It would feel forced right? 

I can only speak for myself, but I'm a really logical/cerebral dude, and I'd want an honest, frank discussion about it. Why did you laugh at my dick? What were you thinking, in that situation? Etc etc. A complete and total excavation of the issue so that it never gets brought up again. 

Needless to say, I'm also expecting a huge apology for it as well. An admission of guilt, with no caveat. No ""I'm sorry...but in my defense...""

No ""Okay I'm sorry but can I just say one thing...""

None of that. Just a straight up, heartfelt apology. 

"
313,"This is my only concern too. We have used religion for social reasons for basically as long as we have had society on Earth. Now it seems to be fading away and being replaced with social media which doesn't actually fulfil the need for legitimate social interaction. 

I feel like this generation is going to be riddled with suicide, depression, and mental illness because no one knows how to interact with other people, causing minor social issues that build into mental health problems resulting in death eventually.

For many of us, it's too late I think. It's been a skill that has been cultivated in children for all of society until now, and now that a significant portion of society grows up without it, it's very rare to get into it when you are older. I work for a First Unitarian Society but was raised without religion. All I care about is going in, doing my job, and getting my paycheck. If I have to stay for services, it just feels uncomfortable to me. They try their best to make it comfortable, but it feels wrong to me deep down and I tend to avoid it. I'm sure a lot of people feel this way, which means it will just become harder and harder to bring back into society because they won't let their kids get into it.

Long story short, I'm not sure what the consequences will be down the road, but it's a major societal change that doesn't seem to get much attention."
314,"Dating is a little tricky since it seems like most of the girls I meet around my age are looking to settle down and have kids at some point. People often say that I may change my mind, and I agree. I might very well change my mind in a few years. But today, right now, in this moment, I absolutely am not interested in kids nor am I planning for it."

316,"Brief, curt, infrequent responses.

If you don't text, she doesn't text you to ask what's up.

She's unavailable to hang out, and never suggests alternatives.

In short - women who like you will make time for you. If she can't go to the movies on Thursday, she'll say, ""Oh, I have time off on Saturday between 2 and 5. Want to go then?"" If she doesn't like you, she'll just say ""I'm really busy, sorry."""

It *should* mean work to overcome surmountable issues, and negotiate mutually beneficial arrangements whenever possible.

&gt;Often times I've heard this in film either by the woman saying ""I've never had a guy fight for me"" or something along those lines.

They mean ""chase me, pander to my nonsense, treat me in such a way that I don't have to generate my own self-esteem, or change themselves/make themselves compatible with me."""

As for the boring part, bring a Bluetooth speaker with you in public and try to start random dance parties, try to be drunk for 24 hours straight, take her to the seedy parts of town and show them your moves. That'll show her a good time "
342,And then just wait for them to tell you that women are the ones who *truly* have it hard when it comes to dating because they have to do things like laugh at your jokes on the first date.
343,"I'd say that's 100% true, for my experiences though it was more so never once considering what I thought about something or felt. I realized the only times I saw her was because I did all the work and set everything up and planned it all. She never acknowledged when I had problems or anything. "
344,"I've been there.  It starts with the initial attraction, you spend time together and you enjoy her company, there's chemistry, there's probably some infatuation and lust involved, but you also genuinely her. So you get together. 

At first it's new and exciting and then at some point you realize that you're not ""in love"". It starts with the occasional nagging doubt so you give it some more time, but after a while you're sure, you realize that this is not someone that you could see yourself wanting to spend the rest of your life with.  She hasn't done 'anything wrong'.  It's not like there's anything you can ask her to change or fix, there's just enough little things about who that person is that make her not ""it"".  

But at the same time you still enjoy her company, you still find her attractive, you still have fun together, you could stay together another day, or week, or month, or longer. Then on the other hand, some part of your brain acknowledges it's already over, and that part now starts to actively think about what's (who's) next.  

So now you have a dilemma.  What do you do? Do you just keep rolling with it?  Avoid the difficult conversations, avoid making her cry, avoid going back to be single and not having anyone to see movies with and take to family events, avoid potentially splitting up your social circle, after all you still like her.  Or do you sack up, tell her that it's over, deal with the tears and the ""why's"", and go back to sleeping alone, and not having someone to take to weddings or bitch about your day to?  

Eventually you decide that the only fair thing to do, for yourself and for her, is to allow the both of you to move on with your lives so you can both hopefully find someone that you are in love with and that feels that same about you."

349,I jogged home from my vasectomy.  
350,"I'm way smaller than the average, likely one of the smallest a women will encounter. I was in this position after I hooked up with a chick in my dorm. 

It definitely helped that a) I got over caring about my size a long time ago, and b) I've since learned how to take advantage of my size/angle because she told another girl in the dorm that I was small - and insanely good in bed. Which directly led to other girl and I hooking up. So I was more than fine with the conversation when they were talking about it (which happened in front of me a couple times, though I think that was mostly for my benefit).

The odd thing is that after I hooked up with the second girl, she started telling everyone that I was incredibly well hung. I...wasn't quite sure how to feel about that just because it was so blatantly untrue."
351,That's not an open relationship. That's her being a cunt.

356,"DO NOT tell her!!!!!! 

My ex told me he loved my stutter. He thought it was the cutest thing ever. 

It made me so god damn self conscious and I became so more self aware of my speech that any time I would make the ""Th"" (where my stutter comes out the most. Native Russian speaker and we don't have that sound) sound, it would make me concentrate even harder on trying to say the word right. "
357,"Honestly, we've had more sex since she got pregnant and after giving birth than we ever had before. During pregnancy it's cool because her body is changing and everything is different: size, shape, feel, smell, taste. Boobs and butt get bigger, softer, better to grab. We even had to do different positions to make sure she was comfortable, which added to the experience. When it's over, you're going to think to yourself ""I wish I had tried it when it was available to me"". Yes, the kid in there does make things a bit weird, but I the positives outweigh the negatives. And, so long as you aren't putting all your weight on her belly you aren't going to do any damage.

Doctor made us stop during the third trimester, which was a bummer because we were both still in the mood big time. Then we had to wait 3 months after the birth for her to heal up. But when that 3rd month was over...we were clawing at each other like wild animals. And despite some of the things I had heard about the state of the va-jay after childbirth, she was all back to normal with no complaints.

Having the kid changed things to, but it became almost like a game trying to sneak it in whenever we could. Send the kid to the grandparents so we can stay home and bang, or do it while the kid is napping. Or drop the kid off at school and come home to do it before we went to work. On more than a few occasions we even did it while the kid was asleep on the other side of the bed. You just need to understand, ""I focus on you, you focus on me, and let's make it happen together and not succumb to distraction"".

We got into a habit of doing it any night that we could get the kid to sleep in the crib. Then the kid started sleeping there every night so we were having sex every night. Like, every. single. night. A lot of that is from my effort, I come home and help out a lot with the kids and the house, and make sure to compliment her and show that I'm still very much interested. When it's time for bed, and she has energy left over and she feels desireable and she wants to do something adult without having to think about kids, it's very easy to just make the magic happen."
358,"Depends. If I'm sad and wanna be alone it's gonna be some kind of good soup.

I was in college, and went to go get my haircut at one of these chain places in walmart. This cute kind of alternative girl with pink hair was my hairstylist. I talked to her for a bit, and in order to keep talking to her I asked her to dye my dark brown hair jet black. I've never dyed my hair before, but I figured it would give me an extra hour or so to talk to her. And it did. And it worked. We went on a date that night after her shift. Went on a few more dates after that and then were in a relationship. It's been 7+ years together now, the last two we've been married. "

As for talking to anyone, girl or guy, it's always encouraging telling someone to keep up the good work.  Not a super common thing, but I like being told I'm rocking out and pay it forward.  "
370,Ok well for one don't be blunt about this to her. I think probably the worst thing is realizing your husband views you as a baby maker only and not his wife who he's sexually attracted to. Probs will do some damage if you mention it. So um yea just don't do that. 
371,"My most recent breakup was because she used too many ultimatums. She didn't talk it out, just basically pouted until I had to probe her for whats going on. She'd then say and then ""well I'm not like that so either deal with it or find somebody who will"". I eventually had it when I was saying she needed to put more work into it because I've not been seeing her much because she was so busy. Her response? ""Well I'm a work a holic and well that's not changing so if you want somebody who'll spend more time then you find somebody else then"" to which I just got fed up and said fine I will. And things were over."

Got out of there pretty fast after that."
373,"Well here's the difference. This girl did this to both my friend and I. We both, at different times, have asked and gone out with this girl. But she won't date either of us.

Gay man here. I just want to point out that in gay porn there's a huge fetish for watching ""straight"" guys get off. It often involves bad acting and watching a gay guy try to seduce the ""straight"" guy.

I understand this fetish, but in real life I have common sense and believe people if they say they're straight. Well, except for this one ""straight"" guy who kept touching me irl and I was too stupid to notice he was trying to make advances, but that's another story."
390,I like doing this too. Sometimes I'll keep sucking even after it's gone soft. My ex used to love it but the guy I dated most recently didn't. As soon as he would cum he would make me stop. He said it hurt and was sensitive. I was disappointed

403,"To expand on this, it also applies to the early stages of dating.

I see lots of women who approach dating as a one-sided ""what can he do for me"" relationship.  They make no effort to put their best foot forward (except in appearance) and wonder why they get no callback for a second date.  Unfortunately, those types of women rarely have the insight to suggest that maybe their dates didn't like such a shitty personality, and usually chalk it up to him being ""just another asshole looking for an easy lay.""

By no means am I suggesting that this selfishness is inherently a women's problem, but it is one that I see a *lot*."

There's a friend I've had for years. There was a mutual attraction for a while, and when the both of us were single at the same time, we'd end up fooling around a bit occasionally. It never got more serious because we have waaay different personalities. She's more wild ass than I am. I'm low key. She likes to party and drink to excess regularly, and that's just not me. She's super into music, and I'm not. She's that incense loving type... you know the type... and I'm not at all a fan of that at all in terms of a relationship, The reality is we just didn't have anything to talk about when we were one on one.

413,"I sometimes wonder whether we have more problems today or whether it's simply because social media makes us see it more clearly. Drugs and alcohol and absent parents are hardly new precedents, nor are weak job markets. It's also nothing new that many men struggle with dating and social engagements.

418,"Hey. Sorry to hear about your situation. I hope you and the kids are doing ok. I've thought a bit about this so here are my 2 cents, born of being a child of divorced parents and now being about your age and seeing some friends try to date single mothers. Some of this will hopefully apply. I'll start with the big obstacles from my (31 yo guy) POV.

First up, the kids come first. In everything. And they really should. I doubt you would deny this but for a single guy who hasn't been married and has no kids but would maybe like those things, think of the implications. I know guys who have been forced out of relationships because the kids were jealous for their mothers attention. You have to remember that the kids also may not want you to date if they have issues over the divorce and this can have residual issues affecting any relationship.

Second, most guys will look down the road to see what the future looks like. With you that probably involves a sizeable financial commitment just to help you out, whether directly for the kids or indirectly with bills etc, for things that they wouldn't have to pay in a relationship with no children. Beyond the financial, you also have the potential expectations to be like a father figure to the children.

Third, men like sex. Having kids who aren't older teens is like living with your parents. Even if you can make time for him you might struggle to get time for intimacy, even if you have a really strong support network.

Four, having the ex around really makes things weird. My father and step dad would probably get on well but they step around each other really carefully a bit like dogs sizing each other up for the fight. This might be a consideration if the dad has any custody and gets to come to birthday's or other special occasions.

Five, the age of your kids will make a big difference. Younger mums are, I'm sorry to say, a bit of a mess. They don't get enough sleep, are often significantly overweight, smell of baby, their hair clothes often get messed up with taking care of the kids. It's just the way of things and I'd expect a father to ride this out but for a new prospect it just forms part of the picture up front. Mothers of all ages also talk about their kids constantly IME, which can be a barrier to building a rapport.

Now the positives for you are that single mums aren't uncommon. It also turns out that being good looking, intelligent and funny are still attractive qualities if you have kids or not. At 30 you are crossing into the zone where the dating pool is single mums or unattractive women (for some reason, not necessarily physical). An attractive single mum who puts in the effort is eminently dateable, especially for single fathers - doubly so if they like kids. The numbers are probably in your favour already here.

I think you'll find a casual relationship easily enough. A one nighter or short term fling obviates most of the issues above. I think a lot of guys will be more of a 'eh let's give it a go!' mindset than working everything through and looking for deal breakers so this could turn into a longer term thing. You just have to be aware that you come with a different set of considerations than non-mothers.

So don't give up! Happiness is out there for everyone. My own mother is happier now than she ever was when I was growing up. She remarried when I was 18 to a single father. Hopefully you will have guys lining up when you are ready to date again and I wish you all the luck in the world.

Sorry for rambling, I'm really tired. If that doesn't make sense I'll try and clarify!"

423,"I mean this was YEARS ago but when I was like 13 there was this super nerdy, awkward girl that I was friends with. She'd come over, we'd awkwardly spoon while watching movies. I denied that shit to ANYONE that asked (that we were friends).

One day we went a bit too far, got an awkward HJ and fingered her (first girl ever). 

I must've jacked off to her and that memory exclusively for like a year. Every time I came, I was DEEPLY ashamed because she was this awkward nerdy girl and my friends would've made fun of me.

Then after about a year of that I brought it up to my best guy friend, and he admitted he had jerked it to this other awkward nerdy girl. We like high fived and died laughing. We were both so relieved we had shameful jerk off sessions.

437,"""You don't spontaneously invite yourself to my house"". We dated for a year and she was 23 years old, yet this is something a teenager would do. 


Edit: Some people in the comments are thinking that she was mad  because I came without warning. That was not it: she wanted to hear me ""Baby, i'm comming to your house"". Since I wasn't that intimate of her family (because I rarely went to her house because she didn't invite me), I would not invite myself to her house because it's just that unreasonable and disconfortable. She thought that I didn't like her family even though I said countless times to her that the problem of me not coming enough would be easily solved if she just said ""Can you come over and watch neflix?"". 

When I asked why she didn't just invite me, she initially said that it was too hard for her to invite me and that, as a boyfriend, it should be expected of me to do things that make her happy without asking. However, if I didn't INSIST on coming, she would not be satisfied (so suggesting ""maybe we should go to your house"" was not good enough). At the end, she said that even if I insisted, that would not be enough, because she would think that I would be going there against my wishes, since, supposedly, me not going there spontaneously equals me not liking her family. 

It was probably an unsalvageable snowball situation. Members of her family continuously told her that she was right and didn't ask me once what was my point of view. However, her sister's boyfriend told me he gave her a verbal beatdown and said that if she was expecting that every person she has a relationship with does things she wants without asking, then she would die an old single lady."

She can feel little down there, but it's not a very pleasurable sensation and even sooner than before, she would say she starts to feel 'raw' after a short time during sex. She also described it as a numb feeling or more numb than what it was before a child. "
441,"The hard part is sexual attraction is quick.  Generally speaking, girls know quite fast whether or not they would want to date a guy.  If a girl is friends with you for a while, odds are it's because that's the way she wanted it.  The only real advice is ask girls out soon, and ask them out often.  Show your intent as soon as possible.  Let them know where you stand.  Make the dynamic flirty not friendly."

I kept my mouth shut, bided my time and let the investigators do their jobs. I presented her with the evidence and told her that if she asked for alimony and/or tried to keep my children from me her entire family and the court (not that it would do much good with no fault divorce) would be presented with the evidence in the form of investigators reports and audio and video.

The rise of social media has made a lot of it's users more shallow. Because of this, it's harder to connect with people on a personal level. Especially when their on their damn phones checking their status/tweets to make sure that it's popular when they're in the middle of a date. 

Plus, with traditional gender roles beginning to disappear, we're beginning to see a new power dynamic going on, and I'm starting to wonder if that has an effect on men in general. 

Another reason why is because I think men are beginning to realize how bad the court system is stacked against them in cases of divorce (even worse if they have kids), so why risk settling down with a woman when you know you're finances are at stake.  "

502,"&gt;""Just open up your eyes, there are ton of girls interested in you.""

You sure she didn't mean herself?"
503,Yeah but with more polygamy and subtler pedophilia. 
504,"I seriously have a speech/check list prepared for my own kids or when my young siblings become teenagers (because my parents won't discuss anything about sex).

The list includes: don't download anything, don't pay for anything, use incognito mode, don't search for anything illegal, if it seems too good to be true, it is. 

Edit - since I've posted this, my boyfriend has been insisting that once we are older, technology will have advanced to the point that my advice will no longer be relevant. Thoughts?"

515,Clearly you get laid. 
516,This only happens if you have friends.

519,"Had to give the ""we need to talk"" to my daughter. When it was determined that her mother's cancer was terminal, and she had less than six months to live. My daughter was thirteen. Hardest conversation I've ever had to have. "
520,"I see your point but ghosting is only an inconvenience and a little rude, hardly the same as systemic racism. Better safe than sorry is a pretty universal slogan, especially if the only recourse is one random guy's (one who you aren't even interested in) feelings. "
