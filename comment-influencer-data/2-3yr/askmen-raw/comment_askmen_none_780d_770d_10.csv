0,"Post-partum depression....mentally prepare yourself for that.
Getting no sleep and how it can cause frustration.
Master the art of the kick-and-roll.

The number 1 advice I give new fathers is....

No matter what get your child on the family sleep schedule at night. The three hour interval feedings are fine in the beginning but sooner than later move towards an 8hour+ nightly sleep schedule. This is better for everyone in the family. Let a baby cry it out if need be (if they are not wet or hungry, their cries are different). Even babies start learning manipulation skills very early. If you cater to every fuss and every noise then you will pay the price for a long time. Don't let baby sleep in a quiet house. Play TV, run the vacuum, have conversations, play music. If you allow your house to be the halls of the dead when baby is sleeping then you will pay the price for a long time.

Babies adjust to the environment that they are in and the family rather quickly. This new member of your family is joining your family. Baby needs to adapt to y'all and not y'all adapting to baby. Helicopter parenting, overbearing parents, overly protective parents, and parents that solve every problem in their children's lives made the conscious decision to parent that way from day one because their lives revolved around baby.

The outcome of that is dysfunctional people that need attention and cannot deal with difficult situations and have terrible problem solving skills.

Giving them space to be their own person starts early.

4,"It's ok to give your newborn to a grandparent for you and your wife t9 have a night off. I was pretty fried at the relentless needs of baby and balancing work (architect) and needed a break. I was heading to lunch with a coworker and he suggest we have a date and take a night off. I asked him when he thought that was appropriate and his response was ""whenever you need it"". Sage advice and certainly helped me.

6,"I haven't really ""decided"" to be single. I am pretty happy as is and if you're not adding to my happiness, then I don't really think I need to make an investment of time into a relationship. That sounds super pretentious I suppose, but I feel like unless I really enjoy hanging with the other person, it's not worth the effort. Would I like to be in a relationship just to be in a relationship to fulfill human interaction needs? No. Would I like to be in a relationship because I value the other person and they enhance my day to day life in ways I can't alone? Ab-so-fucking-loutely."

I took a chance, got burned, then figured there's nowhere to go but up.

I enjoyed the game.

It sucks (or rather, it doesn't)"

24,"I'm guilty of a little clutter around. My wife is a complete disaster in this area, though. So basically things I would just throw out, she would say ""no let me look at it later"" or ""I can recycle that at a specific location..."" and it would just sit there. So basically managing the endless objects all over the house is tiring. "
25,"- Pretending to be (or being) completely helpless. Wanting me to do something for them, because it makes them feel appreciated is lovely though!

- Sending mixed signals in order to get me to ''pursue'' her or to make her ''hard to get''. If you want to spend time with me, clearly say it out loud. If you wish to have your own space, clearly say it out loud. Just....communicate and don't play games. I grow tired of them very quickly."

Not like in a bad boy way just like day to day try to be nice to everyone- not just women and especially not just women you want to sleep with- and it helped me change my whole perspective and mindstate.  I had a few girls at work flirting with me (excessive arm touching, telling me it was hot when i did x, had another coworker tell me XX likes me etc) and I wasn't trying to impress anyone- I was just trying to have fun at work.  If youre talking about cold approach at a bar I have no idea- I dont like that and from other threads I've seen its usually unsuccessful unless you have low standards and find a woman with low standards"
32,"That there are no gender roles in parenting. Granted my son was born in 96 so times were different. Don't divide who does what - jump in and do all you can. Time is fleeting and moves quickly. 

Don't let anyone tell you the type of father you should be - be the sort of father your child needs you to be and deserves. 

You will officially be on a pedestal and under scrutiny of tiny eyes for many years - do right by them.

You will make mistakes. It's okay.

Don't helicopter. Children need to breath and even make mistakes. Tiny humans are more resilient than we give them credit for."
33,"Well neither of these is weird on their own, but comparing them is. I dated someone who always wanted to shower together after having sex, like, without fail. Makes sense, you get to clean off nicely, maybe you got sweaty or got fluids on you.

I dated someone else though that wanted to shower together before anytime we had sex. Not when it was spontaneous but almost every other time. Also makes sense, you get to looking and smelling your best and you get some nice foreplay.

I just found it interesting how those two were so firm in their habits but that their habits are opposites."

45,"Trust your instincts.

 If you think/feel something is amiss with your kiddo then you damn well make sure that you get him/her to be seen.

 My daughter was acting off, crying more than usual. She wailed for 24-36 hours. I mean hard, wracking crying.

 My wife was exhausted, obviously, and everyone was saying ""Oh, she's colicy"" or ""babies cry"". I felt something was wrong, I knew it in the depth of my bones and I pushed and pushed and pushed to get her seen by a doctor, something.

 Finally, I had enough and, after sobbing while rocking my crying daughter, I gathered her up and told everyone to fuck off and that I was taking her to the ER, I'd walk her there if I had to.

 Turns out she was plugged up from the formula and had super bad gas and needed to have a shit.

 We switched her to a non-lactose formula and she was fine in no time flat. She slept so peacefully and soundly for the first time in I don't know how long. I wept to see her feeling better after going through that.

 Just because you're not a female and don't have a ""mother's instinct"" doesn't mean you won't know stuff about them that others may not see.

I have to cut the hair from the roller in the vacuum after every use. The roller just locks up.

"
50,"People who get small details wrong, or change them a lot. 

For example when they tell you something unimportant like how they went and got the coffee they'll say the server's name was Julie and she smiled at them. Later in the day they talk about the same thing to someone else, but the server's name is different and this time she was unhappy with him. Constantly chaning stuff like that. 

Once or twice is not a big deal and might just be due to memory. But certain people have a really loose relationship with the truth and feel words are just something to get the reaction they want from people. So they'll just say whatever they need to say. They'll usually be correct on the big things, but they'll change small details all the time. Its not because they're trying to lie, the just *don't care whether their words are true*.

You need to be careful of them because they'll tell you the truth, as long as they know you can verify it. So they won't lie to you if they know you'll be able to find out its a lie. But they'll lie when they know you can't verify it. They know *other people* care about truth, so they mimic that most of the time. But they'll eagerly lie to you when they know they can't be caught.

The reason the lies about small details matter is because they assume no-one will check them or remember, so they don't bother telling that accurately. But its a flag you can pick up on if you're paying attention.

If you meet someone like this don't confront them or let them know you know. They find that very threatening and will often use their abilities to secretly retaliate against you. Just keep the information in your head and keep it in mind when dealing with them.

People like that have a

edit:  ... need to control those around them in order to feel safe. If you expose their tools of control they get very very angry/afraid (although they will try to hide that) and see you as a threat to their survival (as crazy as that seems). They will respond in ways that are completely out of proprortion to simply being exposed as a liar because it feels like their very survival is at stake.

It's not he boyfriend who should be concerned, it's me. "
58,"Also had a fling with a woman who was into being choked. Like choked to the point where she was ready to pass out. She claimed it gave her the best orgasms. It made me really uncomfortable, not because I thought it was weird or freaky or anything but because I was scared of hurting her. She said she wanted me to hurt her. I miss that sexy freak..."

72,"My ex had a rape fantasy. Like she would want me to be downstairs then randomly come upstairs where she would be ""sleeping"", tie her to the bed and do what I wanted while she tried to escape.

At first I was scared of hurting her so wouldn't tie too tight, but by the end I would really tighten the knits and she would have big bruises in her wrists.

God I miss that kinky chick."
73,"On a related note, don't be afraid to ask for your newborn to sleep in the nursery (if you're delivering at a hospital) one of those first nights.

When my first was born, my wife experienced a lot of emotions due to *sooo* many hormones exiting her body and a lot of family all around. The first night, everything went OK but the second night she was miserable. With how often the nurses come in to check on baby and mom, it was nice to have a few hours to get some good sleep for ourselves.

Bottom line, don't be afraid to ask for help!

5. There probably won't be magic perfect boner right from the beginning that stays the exact same for half an hour or longer.

6. People have cellulite, hair, bad skin, no make-up, messed up hair, sweat, and all kinds of other human things going on.

7. Anal, especially a rim job, requires preparation. Nobody's rim-jobbing the stranger they just met unless drugs are involved.

8. Most sex happens in a bed, and it's probably kind of cold because you're naked, so at least some sheets might be part of the equation. Won't see a porn of two people under a sheet.

To some degree I already kept her on my mind when planning before we moved in together, since if you're serious enough to share a living space, you should already be taking each other into consideration when planning stuff, but it's a very different situation when your ""home"" space is shared and you are thus seeing each other every single day. I'm not saying I check in with her directly for everything I do (nor have I at any point since we started living together), but there is that extra layer of considering what she may be doing/expecting/planning before making that final decision on what I'm going to do/where I am going to go. While my wife and I both enjoy having our share of me-time and freedom to do some solo activities (or group activities without the other), it's not quite as easy or second-nature as it was when we each had our own separate place.

She was raised in a family where the cook doesn't do the dishes.  I was raised to clean up my mess as I go when cooking, on top of the fact that I'm not really prone to making much mess to clean up in the first place.

So inevitably I'm deep cleaning the kitchen every other day or so which is honestly really frustrating because I was also raised in a household where you clean up after yourself, no matter who you are, out of respect for everyone else sharing the space.

I'm learning to let it go though.

3. Party as much as possible. "
134,"So, you must be new here...

I broke up with a girl once (my first girlfriend was... wild) and then she asked to have break up sex afterwards. It was a total ""this is a trap"" moment but I was young and making bad decisions all around so I went for it.

I remember I made her orgasm twice in ways that usually never happen and we had a good 30 minutes of really really good banging. Like probably our best bang to date.

We then keep seeing each other off and on for the next year and a half and I was an emotional wreck the entire time. "

Then when I'm ready for bed at 830 (I wake up at 350am) she decides it's time to shower and gets pissed off if I goto sleep before she gets out and ready for sex. When I don't goto sleep in said fashion... she lays and expects at least 15 mins of kissing and smooching before any foreplay or any clothes are removed. I get told to ""slow down babe geez"" and I just wanna get to sleep. So yes it's a chore unless I'm horny. Which isn't often. Exhaustion overcomes sex drive in summertime.

138,"I don't think this sounds pretentious at all, I think it's actually a really healthy way of looking at things.

I've posted before about this lecture my mum gave me a few months ago - I'd gone through a rough break-up in January, around the time the Christmas and New Years engagements were being announced, and I casually mentioned that I was a bit weirded out because I was going to turn 30 soon and blah blah blah.

My mum went on this big long rant, which boiled down to *""please respect yourself enough to wait for the right person, who makes you happy rather than rush into something with the wrong person just for the sake of it""*

There's so much pressure on people to find someone and settle down and ""oh my God, how are you still single? Are you not worried you'll never find someone?"" - Maybe if I had an unfulfilling life I'd be concerned, but I'm perfectly happy doing my own thing, doing my hobbies, have a good job etc, anyone I meet should just be a bonus to that, rather than the end goal."

But if I wanted a compliment I had to ask for it. I never felt more unattractive and undesirable in my life. It got so bad I actually avoided sex. You can't change his feelings about his looks, but you can show him that your more attracted to him than anyone else. Don't go on and on about how hot other guys are. Just focus on him. And remember, actions speak louder than words. Let him catch you staring at him, but not other guys. Initiate sex, don't make him always be the one to do it. Get handsy with him. Show him that he's irresistible to you. Let him overhear you bragging to your friends how much he turns you on. For someone with deep rooted insecurities, words can often come across as empty. Like you're just saying it cause you feel like you have to. Just make sure your words and actions match. And if he wants to start exercising, join him! Working out is a fantastic couples activity that can improve both people's self esteem and improve a relationship. I envy him for having someone that cares enough to want to help. But don't get frustrated if it takes a while to notice a difference. It's not a quick fix for anyone. "

While mine was only emotional, seeing her cry and about to leave me flipped a switch to how my actions affected her and made me realize I had a partner that I let down. It was rocky for the first couple months, but it has made me try harder in general. More dates planned than before, more trying to do things together, more housework getting done by me. While I wish I could take it back, it had taught me a valuable lesson in relationships. Also oddly enough, I have found that it has actually made me the insecure one in the relationship. I no longer trust myself to be alone around girls for extended periods of time, so trusting her to take a trip with her two best guy friends for a month made me recognize a lot of my issues I had with myself, but she wouldn't bat an eye if I had went with two girls.

177,"So much this.  When I am asked to give one piece of advice to new parents, it's ""PUT THE BABY DOWN"".

We made the mistakes you speak of.  If our daughter so much as sighed, we'd be there to hold her.  If she cried, we'd pick her up.  If she fussed when trying to sleep, we'd hold her until she fell asleep. 

This backfired bigtime.  Our daughter learned that mom or dad was just a whimper away, and she ended up NEVER using her crib, because she ended up sleeping on mom every night.  This lasted way too long, well into age 7 or 8 she was still sleeping with mom all night long (my wife and I had separate bedrooms -- a discussion for another thread).

At around age two, I saw this pattern for what it was, but my pleads for my wife to get on board and change things, went unheard.  She could not allow herself to ""let the baby cry"", she could not find peace in the living room while the baby was crying (just for attention) in the other room.

I won't go into the relationship problems that probably stemmed from this.  Or the emotional growth problems for our daughter that stemmed from this.  

If you can learn to PUT THE BABY DOWN, I think it's a very good developmental step for the baby AND FOR YOU."
178,You are not being unreasonable. Actually he is.

183,Whatever you do don't fucking let the kid sleep on the same bed with you!!!!!!!!!!!!! It will be fucking hard to kick them out of the bed afterwards.  Sex will become horrible if you let them as trying to get out of bed will result in the kid waking up and crying trying to find you.   Get him/her a cradle and either have it next to the bed or in a room with a device you can see and hear the baby from your room.

185,"2 years ago, my girlfriend of 2+ years cheated on me with another guy and left me for him. Considering I thought I was gonna spend my life with this girl, I was absolutely crushed. My life and everything I thought I knew turned upside down and it was a long way to somewhat of a recovery. 

Now, last week one of my good friends confessed her feelings to me while we were both drunk. However, she's been with her boyfriend for a few years but was saying that she'd rather be with me because she's had feelings for me since we first met, and asked me to spend the night with her. I talked through it with her and took an Uber home straight away, not going for it. In essence, I was presented with the opportunity to do the one thing that had obliterated me the most in my life, and I turned it down because I can't be the guy who does something like that after having it done to him. 

I guess I'm ranting because part of me knows I made the right decision not acquiescing but part of me was incredibly tempted to go for it and I still am. She's a brilliant, smart, beautiful girl that any guy would be lucky to have and sometimes I find myself question why I didn't go for it. Makes it hard to know for sure that I made the right decision."

199,"Guys who have low self-esteem base their sense of self-worth on how ""needed"" or ""useful"" they feel to other people.  A girl who is defenseless and constantly needs to be taken care of feeds perfectly into their need to feel needed and useful.

Once of those solid metal water bottles or a coffee mug work well.  Same with sushi the next day for lunch.  They have missed these things and want them

used clothes are fine.  In fact used everything except for a car seat (and a used crib needs to be manufactured after 2009) is fine.

Family is needed to do chores, not hold the baby.  Holding the baby is the reward for doing chores.  If parents, siblings, friends come over - give them chores to complete prior to getting to hold the baby.  Stuff like laundry, vacuuming, cooking.  You need help running the house, not holding the kid.

Don't try to play host/hostess to friends.  If they want to visit - it's on your terms, when it works for you, and they will make do or no harm loss.

GET OUTSIDE! Seriously, go look at the sun, take a walk.  Too many new parents lock themselves inside all day with no adult contact and go insane.

If anyone offers to babysit, set it up for that night ASAP.  You don't even have to leave the house, just go to sleep.  Or just go get a coffee without a baby.  It helps with sanity.

Penis points down, always.  always.  Seriously - penis points down.  

Make sure you and the wife have a plan, then be ready to trash that about 30 seconds later.  Understand that outside of dropping the kid from a high height, you likely won't cause any real long term damage.  They are kind of bouncy.  

After a couple of days, convince the wife to put on makeup and take baby photos.  She won't want to, but will love them in a few months, bonus points for you.

nothing is more sacred then sleep.  If possible, try to get on a sleep plan with the wife.  you watch kid from 8p-3a, then she has kid from 3a-10a.  That way you each get a good block of sleep.  Let her pick whatever time she wants to sleep and only wake her up for breastfeeding.  "

I used to work at this huge industrial bakery. Shitty job with great pay and benefits but the hours sucked. Anyways,we had some engineers there to design a few machines. I ended up talking to one of these guys for a while and he told me he goes to different towns for usually about 2 weeks at a time and is always bored as hell.

He had never been to Mississippi so I asked him if he wanted to go fishing. It was a fucking blast man. I took him out into this off road pond. We had to go through a bunch of mud to get there and he had never been mud riding. Never been fishing in the south. We didn't catch shit but we had a lot of fun and then went and got bbq afterwards. Its not gay man. Its two bros becoming friends and broing down. If he thinks you are hitting on him just tell him you're not. He seemed cool and you wanted to make new friends. "
220,That third point though. Currently seeing someone a (fair) bit older than myself and the lack of BS and drama is heavenly. So different (better) from dating girls my age and younger.

223,"Here are the types of responses you will get to a question like this on this sub:

* I thought girls didn't like me, but one day I started trying/stopped giving a fuck and asked some girls out. Turns out girls did like me and I started dating/hooking up like a normal person. It was all in my head! Just be confident!

* I was ugly because of weight/hair/clothes/skin so I started dieting/working out/got a haircut/new clothes/washing my face, and then suddenly girls started to like me! What a simple fix!

So if those are your only obstacles to success with women, OP - then you know what you have to do. 

But if your face is ugly or you're short or not white, then it might not be such a simple fix. "

228,"When my dad met my boyfriend he didn't let me introduce him. He walked to the back door where my boyfriend was coming into MY house and took him outside and talked to him. Threatened him and made some tough guy remarks. I was 20. My dad is a Sargent and quite scary looking. He stood out there and gave my boyfriend a talk before I could ever introduce them. 

I'm very resentful of this. I love my dad but I never dated in high school because my parents made it weird. They were controlling. 

When he did that he took away my ability to introduce him to my partner. A person I deemed worthy of calling my partner. My dad does not get to decide who is good enough. He's supposed to raise me and then trust that I do that. He has tried to institute small controlling behavior in my relationship afterwards. Like banning my boyfriend from the house because he found out I slept in a bed with him at my grandparents house with their permission while visiting. I am an adult. I do not live at home. 

When I get engaged I know my dad will be waiting for a talk from my boyfriend asking for permission. He won't get it. I've made that very clear to my boyfriend. For the last five years I've kept my family at a distance because they refuse to recognize that I am a level headed successful person and their opinions on my love life are worthless to me. And that's their own fault. I make healthy choices for my life and my partner respects me, I wish I could say the same for my parents. 

My only advice is recognize that your daughter gets to make these choices. She's not property to you or to her boyfriend. You don't need to decide if it's a fair trade that you're getting. You can give her advice and the best advice is to find someone who respects her and treats her well. If it is obvious that her boyfriend doesn't then maybe it's time to act but before then you should be supportive. Because it becomes easier to recognize the toxic people in your life and cut them out the more they try to control you, even if they are your parents"

240,"Are we being brigaded or something? All the responses saying ""Yeah that's totally fine, good on her for being empowered! In fact I'd invite my buddies over and we would all watch"" are being upvoted and all the negative responses are being downvoted.

I'll just say it: Yes this would be an absolute dealbreaker for me, do not pass go, do not collect $200. To me, sex is something you do intimately with a person you care about, a special act of immense trust and affection. Commercializing it is or treating it like junk food is against all of my values. For the same reason I would be turned off by a woman who's had a lot of casual sex."
241,"She likes to be choked, it helps her orgasm. We were together for a couple of years before she ""asked"" for it. I was fondling and brushed past her neck when she took my hand and just sort of laid it there. I got the picture and obliged but was kind of weirded out. I eventually got used to it and it's something we do maybe half the time now. We've recently started experimenting with paddles and restraints too after being together 11 years. I wasn't a believer that sex got better with age when I was younger but I am now."
242,"My husband cheated on me. He blacked out drunk at a party and we hadn't been serious for very long.

He made out with a girl/got really touchy and had no idea until she approached him a few days later saying it was a mistake. He was so upset when he found out he knocked at my door at 3 in the morning, started crying saying he was sorry, he'll never drink again and that he'd understand if I wanted nothing more to do with him. 

I was angry at first but forgave him. Its been 9 years now and I've never had a reason to distrust him again."

244,"She was - in my opinion - financially spoiled and had strange opinions on work and money. She was of the opinion that having a professional carreer is a bad/wrong way to live life. She had blatantly stated that she has no respect for people that want to achieve a succesfull carreer. I disagree strongly with the above, but i was of mind that you don't need to share every opinion.

She also said that she didn't want to work later in life, either be a housewife or have her own charity organisation. Which combined with the previously mentioned, set off a bright red flag for me. She didn't grasp the notion that people work because they need money to survive/live/enjoy luxuries.

She also loved to travel and ""needed"" to travel atleast 3 times a year to somewhere far away like Canada, Thailand or Jordan (we lived in Belgium). The netto monthly starting wage someone with a masters in our field would get, would probably be around 1550 euros. With current cost of living and us both wanting kids later, I didn't see how the lifestyle she wanted would be viable. We simply wouldn't earn enough.

When I'd try to voice my concern that I/we wouldn't earn enough money to fulfill her planned lifestyle, she'd become agitated and tell me that i was a bad person for breaking her dreams. Another big red flag.

The gravity in these opinions only came to light 3-4 months into the relationship, by then I was already too in love to heed all these red flags. We were both 20, she was my first serious relationship. The silver lining in having a flawed relationship is that when it's all said and done there's a lot to learn from. 

Not sure if this is the type of answer you were looking for, kinda went on a little storytime rant.

There's nothing really *wrong* with this, I just see it as someone who avoids the real world and want's to just stay partying, even though we're adults.

Always be positive - don't say things like maybe the baby isn't eating enough or maybe you're not feeding it enough? This implies something is wrong with baby momma. They need encouragement, not negativity. Good luck man! I've got a 13mo boy and it's been a wild fucking ride so far. Best thing I've ever done is created life.

318,"The hardest adjustment right away was how we spent our weekends. Left to my own devices, my weekends would involve one or two social events (a movie, a DnD game) and a lot of rest/down time. For my girlfriend, it involved/involves a lot of travel, visiting family and friends, and all the while groaning that there's not enough money, time, and energy for these activities. 

Last Saturday morning she was going to leave at 6 AM to make the 4-hour trip to visit friends and family in the next state over. She actually woke up at 7, got out of bed at 8, and swore up and down that she'd do all the chores she forbade me from doing before she left. She began bawling as she cleaned the cat litter, but fifteen minutes later was heading down the road. 

Mandatory fun!

The biggest adjustment right now is how we handle chores. I like to do all my errands and all of my chores and then relax. Once I sit on the couch, I don't want to get up except for the bathroom and for food. My girlfriend likes to do chores and errands as her time and energy allow. In reality this means that her chores and errands don't get done quickly, if at all. And more often than not, I just end up doing them. 

The problem is always that the world just moves too quickly for my girlfriend. While the desire to do things is present, she wants to do them on her own time, which is much slower than the rest of the world would like. "
319,"Right. Sometimes I think children are meant to be raised by a ""tribe"" rather than just two parents. It's the hardest (but most rewarding!) job on the planet.

He didn't read it. His kids were hellions. (There's other stuff that contributed to that, too.) Part of it was because THEY set their sleep schedule and my brother-in-law and sister-in-law let them.

First, it's WAY easier to clean up fresh kitchen messes; as soon as things have a chance to dry or absorb, it can easily take 10 times as long or more and require scrubbing pads or more powerful cleaning agents. Second, the feedback loop is essential to improving the way you cook. I make a lot of different decisions when I'm cooking specifically to make things easier to clean because I know from experience what is going to be a headache. She has no incentive to not be a slob if she doesn't have to clean up her mess. Lastly, the cook knows the most about the history of the things they are cleaning and can save a lot of time that way. Some things were used to scoop salt and others were used to cut raw meat. Knowing which is which allows you to put the minimal effort into cleaning each thing to the safe standard."

353,"A baby who learns it needs to fight for attention, will resort to extreme behavioural tactics to do so. 

It's highly recommended that ""cry-it-out"" only last a couple of minutes and that the parent returns to reassure the child.

This builds trust, security, and confidence in the child that in turn results in fewer extreme attention-grabbing manipulation tactics down the road.

So basically by definition the true implementation of cry-it-out serves to propograte the behavior it aims to prevent. The modern implementation requires active parenting to teach the child confidence and security when it is separated from the parent.

And my personal opinion here on the old school neglect-it-out-of-them method; it's a lazy circlejerk of parents trying not to feel guilty neglecting their child.  The antithesis of  cry-it-out is to actually take the time to healthily ease the seperation anxiety children get when away from caregivers for periods of time like bedtime or naps. 

I'm going to get a lot of flack for saying this, so please for those who are going to disagree please come up with studies and hard facts that prove the classical implementation of cry-it-out is beneficial to a child's wellbeing both physically and psychologically. I will not address ""I turned out just fine"" as that can be use for a variety of cop-outs such as justifying child abuse etc.

Edit: An article citing the efficacy of cry-it-out studies in the past, and why they never *actually* measured human well-being. What they told was a different story. One where the baby is more dependent, and less secure: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out

Here's a quote: *With neuroscience, we can confirm what our ancestors took for granted---that letting babies get distressed is a practice that can damage children and their relational capacities in many ways for the long term. We know now that leaving babies to cry is a good way to make a less intelligent, less healthy but more anxious, uncooperative and alienated persons who can pass the same or worse traits on to the next generation.*"

366,"Get in shape, don't be afraid to initiate things (study groups, parties, etc), and join some social groups.  My alma mater was huge, so maybe it's a bad example but there were something like 200+ active clubs.  From parkour to fencing to anime to Quiddich, ski club, etc.  Make friends quick in class.  Cliques form pretty quick.  I wouldn't even focus on a relationship, or even girls.  If you're social in general you'll probably do a little better.

I would not recommend getting into a relationship in college, but it works for some people.  For me it was 4 years of trying new things before I had to settle down (eventually).

368,"There will always be a bigger fish mate, and even if they are not a good man then you can't stop women from making mistakes with them. She probably saw your warning as thinly veiled jealousy which is extremely unattractive, even if you were just trying to help. Work on yourself so that maybe next time you can escalate successfully with the next woman you like. Make yourself more complete for its own sake, and that will translate into much more predictable and easy to navigate courtships - assuming you aren't aiming out of your league.

Just a pro tip: when a woman says to you that she likes you more than a friend but isn't willing to date you; *run.* She may not be a bad person, but she will happily take from you all the things that you are offering her and would not offer to other people, despite not having any romantic intention for you. It's fine to go from friends to dating, that's healthy, but it's not healthy to be ""super friends."" That is an inherently parasitic dynamic where one person is giving far more than they will every receive, which can only lead to harm.

Even if you're swayed by this gesture, he's lost his job and he's going to jail right after this, idiot.

Ultimatums.  I see this one in media a lot too.  ""If you don't ____, I'm leaving.""  ""No baby pls I'll do anything to keep you.""  It's ""romantic"" in media because it shows how devoted he is to her and that he'll do anything to keep her.  In real life it's a sign of garbage communication in a garbage relationship, and it only works under the idea that he *has* to pick you.  Sadly, I've seen this situation show up IRL when women assumed that ""not her"" wasn't a viable choice.

375,"Fuck, this has been bothering me for a long time. Everything I'm interested in is so male dominated. Boxing, Powerlifting, Automotive, Motorcycles and I study Elec Eng. I kid you not, sometimes weeks can go by where I don't even speak to a girl at all. I'm not about to become someone I'm not just to meet someone though, don't expect me to take up dancing."

380,"Our bodies don't care that we're having sex, if it's time to fart, it's time to fart."
381,"Death.

When you put death into perspective, you realize that you're more worried about living life than death itself. This is where you realize that you worried way too much about failing, when failure is nothing compared to death. Death is essentially the end of the road for you. Not that stupid little bump on the road, so called ""failure"". 

I realized that I can talk to hundreds of people and fail every single time in trying to connect with them. Back then, I would feel depressed about it, which I'm not going to lie, I still feel it, but it's more manageable now that I remind myself that I really have nothing to lose but a small moment of my time. I realized that it wasn't a big deal.

Recently, a few months back, I tried to surround myself with women, be that guy who is loved and adored by beautiful women. Online and offline. 

But, frankly, I realized how futile that effort was. None of those women connected to me on a personal level, most of them made me think ""god, she's so fuckin immature.."" I just stop giving a fuck, I stopped talking to them. I gave myself more of a realistic goal, ""socialize more"" not ""get more women to like me"". And frankly, I became more satisfied talking to various of people from different sexes. 

Compassion, respect, and empathy is something I am recently learning and I'm trying really hard to integrate it into my life. Not going to lie, it's hard but at least I'm making the effort and conviction. Once you become confident, secure and comfortable in talking to people. People will see that, women will see that. "

386,"I lost 70 lbs

I Realized I am better looking than I originally thought and started dressing nicer

Told the girl I was in love with for two years how I felt and it wasn't returned, stopped caring about rejection after that having wasted all my time and decided to take control

Also stopped caring whether or not I hooked up with someone, my plan every time I go out is to simply have fun and socialize. If that ends with someone in my bed then good for me, if not then I can still say it was a fun night now can't I? 

I think something you'll notice from all of us that stopped caring is that we had large boosts in confidence as a result and thus also resulted in us having large boosts in success and failure too but far more success than previously.

387,This actually seems like the perfect analogy. I've never thought about it like that.
388,"And you'll tell them ""hey, we're probably gonna walk at least a mile total today, you're gonna feel terrible if you wear those, "" and they go ""omg but they're so cute, "" and you say ""yea we had this exact same conversation last time and then you were complaining about being uncomfortable all day, "" and they brush you off because who the fuck knows why

394,"&gt; I never see women anywhere other than bars. Every other place on the planet is a real sausage fest.

It's not that women don't exist in places other than bars it's that most women don't like to be hit on when they're, say, shopping, relaxing at the park, studying in the library etc.  Being a non-drinker myself I totally sympathize with how hard it is to meet women outside of that context."

""Babe, did I ever tell you how handsome you are?"" 

Cue a stupid face or a laugh from him for the first few weeks, but eventually, he just smiled at me. It's like he accepted it, and I did feel like he was more confident. I mean, what do the opinions of others matter when the person you love thinks you're the most beautiful guy or gal in the world? 

I didn't overdo it, I didn't try to *convince* him of anything. I just gave him my honest to heart opinion every day and it was like planting a seed that grew beautifully in his mind :) "

""Bummer. I can give you a couple smokes if you want?""

""Buy me a full pack and I'll suck your dick...""

""... Um, no thanks. How about I just give you five bucks and you can pay me back whenever. With money.""

We had never flirted with each other before, no sexual tension (as far as I was aware of), it came totally out of left field. And we never spoke about it again."
418,"Nah, you can bet hot and still turn me off by doing certain things: forced dirty talk, baby voice, habitually whining or pouting, etc.

Want to try something new in bed? Sure. Think you need to work in every ""romantic"" trick you just read about in this month's Cosmo? Pass.

You probably get the picture.  If not, check out the scene in Community where Annie is trying to seduce Jeff with a sexy song and dance.  It's a pretty perfect illustration.

422,"Things that I've (26f) done that I thought were romantic that were not well received:

- brought some groceries over for because his bachelor pad is depressing and has nothing that a human could sustain themselves on. He didn't appreciate this and I guess I'll just go fuck myself :)

- bought him flowers. Why not? ...he did not love that haha

- re painted a wall that he said he hated (his ex chose the colour of the feature wall). On second thought this was a liberty I maaaybe shouldn't have taken haha but he was nice about it and just also didn't like the colour I chose....

- when I was a teen, in really immature relationships I felt everything SO strongly, I would tell (whichever) boyfriend every time a song reminded me of them, was so dramatic when I would describe my feelings for them, try so hard to integrate myself into their life and be a ""wife"" which was so dumb because I was like 18 haha. It's cringey even for me to look back on. But I wasn't doing those things to TRY to be romantic, I just really felt that way and it was pretty cringey and overbearing for basically every guy i dated when I was between 17 and 21 years old haha

Things I've done that have been well received as romantic:

- really meaningful gifts. For example: last boyfriend was really into hockey, so I found out where he scored his first hockey goal. It turned out to be a rink that had been demolished so I went to the location it used to be at; there was a ton of debris. I chose a piece of concrete which I assumed used to be part of the locker room cause it was painted white on one side.  He loved that. Current boyfriend is really into writing but isn't always able to type because his job doesn't allow him to carry a computer/iPad everywhere. So I bought him a fancy notebook and wrote a sweet note about believing in him as an author. He taped the note to the inside cover of the book and he clearly really loved it. 

- anything to make their day a bit easier; pack a lunch once in a while, suggest that they go for a beer with friends after work instead of rushing home, hand him the towel when he gets out of the shower so he doesn't have to reach for it from inside the shower. Leave notes next to a full coffee pot... things like that

- send boob pictures at any given time of day just to be like ""hey hope your day is good, and if not, have this boob!""

- actually literally say what you appreciated that they did. ""Thanks for taking out the garbage, I really appreciate that"" or ""thank you for folding my laundry that I left in the hamper for six days because I'm a garbage human being, I really appreciate it""

This thread as well as the r/askwomen thread I commented on is showing me that romance is more about genuinely caring about someone and much less about what anyone says is romantic. Romance is wherever you look for it, and if you get the warm and fuzzies from someone showing you that they care about you, and want your day to be better because you're in their life, then that's where you'll find it. "
423,"Just jerk off to their facebook pics like the rest of us. 

Seriously though, sounds like you're self-diagnosing much. Nothing bad about being attracted to someone, might as well try your luck.

I don't really know what to tell you, I have a lot of attractive friends but it's my own decision if I try to make something happen or just see them as friends, same goes for everyone I guess. 

Edit: If you listen very closely you can hear the clicking sounds of women deleting their facebook pictures"
424,"Men generally have to ""earn"" their worth. Society has deemed they must do things to be worth consideration, often without proper guidance, mostly without complaint. Failure to do so is worth contempt on its own, regardless of any personality or character virtues that person may possess. Men are generally seen and judged and valued by the outcomes they produce, not by their intent. Their inner world means nothing save for how it affects their outer world.

We're running headlong into an age of automation and the demonization of maleness. Both will, to some extent, strip traditional avenues for men to determine or demonstrate their worth to themselves and society and secure esteem. Currently, virtually no one - and I say virtually as a hedge because I've seen nothing substantial - is seeking to carve out any new paths to do so with that male perspective in mind. What we are seeing instead are groups who want to specify what men are based upon traditional values, or what men should not be (those very same traditional values, mostly). Rarely explored is what men ought to be in any real world terms and even rarer is the concept that men should no longer be required to earn a basic level of regard in society: that they have intrinsic worth and value.

Men, as a whole, will have an identity crisis if not underway already - and surely enough, it's likely they'll be blamed for it."
425,"Can confirm, I shed. Also, hair got wrapped around the tip of my bf's dick once. Found it when I was giving him a bj. So it came back to haunt me I guess."

430,"&gt; Don't let baby sleep in a quiet house. Play TV, run the vacuum, have conversations, play music. If you allow your house to be the halls of the dead when baby is sleeping then you will pay the price for a long time.

Yes. This. My kids will sleep anywhere and through anything. My son has fallen asleep on a dance floor at a wedding, a lazy river at a water park, and many other odd places. Most people I know have kids that need complete silence to sleep and we always have to tip toe around b/c so and so is asleep. Fuck that. My kids go out, and they stay out."

433,"i moved countless things for shit like that. one time she decided she just had to have a lemon tree in the back yard, so we went and bought a lemon tree (not a huge one, but taller than me), and guess who dug a hole and planted it?

then she decided she didn't like the spot it was in. after i said ""you're *sure* this is where you want it?"" guess who dug it back up and replanted it 5 feet to the left?

i'm not bitter at all. have fun with that, new bf LOL!"

3) Ironically the guys who take shirtless gym flexing selfies are not even that big. and then they walk around the gym with their chest puffed out on leg day.....stop it. No one cares and you're getting in people's way. You wanna take shirtless selfies go into the bathroom or go home and do it. "
436,"At my age, I'm not certain many exist. Many would say I'm not old, and 30 isn't beyond hope but good god do I NEVER see single women in the real world.

437,"I was texting with this girl for a few weeks, and we would meet up on the weekends, but after she got drunk she would go out and talk to a bunch of other guys at the bars and basically ignore me.  I mean, I get it, we weren't exclusive or anything, but if you text with someone all day every day, wouldn't you want to hang out with them when you're drunk too?  And hook up with the person you're talking to all the time, not other random guy you meet at the bar?  I just couldn't get around that (and a few other smaller red flags), so I cut things off with her.  

Now she's saying she cared so much about me and basically making me feel bad about breaking things off....I'm not crazy right?  Like this is weird and shouldn't be tolerated in the early stages of a relationship?  It's just not at all how I'd treat someone if I cared about them."

449,"Put yourself out there and socialize HARD those first few weeks - you won't remain friends with everyone, and that's ok. But groups start to tighten up and bonds are harder to make further down the line once people start getting comfortable - by the end of the first term even. Those first months most people are out of their element and ready for a fresh start, they will be open to new friendships with different kind of people. Join clubs, go to events, push yourself to be friendly and enter conversations. Be a 'yes' kind of person for that first few months - even just taking a walk to the store together when you both forgot to buy something for class can be the founding moments of real friendships. "
