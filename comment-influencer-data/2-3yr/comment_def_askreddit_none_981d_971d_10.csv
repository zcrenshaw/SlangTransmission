"A picture of my daughter giving some kid head on her bed. Hand drawn at that.


Edit: Holy shit, I should check this account more often. It was a stick figure drawing, with names drawn by a friend of hers. I assume she was in the room at the time, but I've never really given it a lot of thought. It may have been drawn after the fact and no, I'm not going to share it, sorry. Def a kid from her school was the recipient, but it was a long long time ago, and in another state so whooping some ass is no longer feasible."
"&gt; It's not a matter of won't. We don't have it.

Semi-related, I've def had to explain to a few friends that I'm not going on student exchange to Europe because even if I get one of those full-ride scholarships, they don't pay them until *after* you've been accepted, and before I have to pay for visa, passport, lots of paperwork, get a credit card (which in itself requires having money), and more stuff that there's simply no way I can afford. Most of the people who go are either upper-middle class or whose parents work in the oil industry, so money is an afterthought for them. It legit took me some work to convince my best friend that I couldn't just ""save up"" and go on holiday with her family to the UK, no matter how much I would've loved it. Some people really don't understand the concept of ""I don't have the money""."
