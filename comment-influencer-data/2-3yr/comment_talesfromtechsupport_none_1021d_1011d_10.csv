I couldn't help but read your story at a frantic pace.
"Congrats, you managed to solve the problem before the client even picked up the phone!"
"rubber duck debugging:

have a rubber duck on your desk  
if you experience a complex problem try to explain it to the rubber duck - in simple words that a rubber duck can understand. During this process you actually may find the solution.

"Yeahhhh, we're gonna have to talk about your SLA. It says you spent 20 minutes on the phone and well, we played back the recording and it doesn't look good. Your supervisor might have authorized something he shouldn't have and you delved into personal details with a customer a little too much. We're going to write you up for unprofessionalism and one week conversation remediation, unpaid.

Sincerely,
The Cynic Bastard in me"
"""I can't remember the login details of my personal stuff, which is stopping your from being able to fix the issue, but I don't care because you guys can't fix it so even though it's my fault it must be YOUR fault!!!"""
"""Sorry, sir. I'm already in... oh, let's say Canada."""
"On the my high school robotics team, whenever we had a programming problem, we would grab a freshman mechanical student and explain the problem to them. They have the same programming skill as a rubber duck, plus they learn in the process. Its a win-win!"
"Nice job! Removing money from the doubters is always fun. Although the ""send an alert over email that your power is off"" thing wasn't the smartest idea"
"You're a taxi company, you need a higher level SLA."
I'll type slower next time. Didn't realize it got so out-of-hand. LOL
"Should have told her that there's a $50 surcharge that must be paid before COD can be enabled for her account, and that unfortunately, that must be paid with PayPal.  "
"&gt; I brought it with me today as the office supplied is getting sticky.

I spilt too much lunch over the office supplied one, but am afraid you'll yell at me if I ask for a new one."
Clippy now runs the updates.
"Yeah.. 14 years on and still not married to this absolute treasure of a catch? Wtf is wrong with you, OP???"
"hey who am I to judge, i was only a temp ;P"
"I don't think I've read or scrolled so fast on reddit before. The whole story is BAM BAM BAM. But it's good. 

"
"Years upon years ago, the company I worked for went whole hog on an executive board-room style conference room.  It had a video wall, fine mahogany table, italian leather chairs, the works.  The other thing that it had was an insulated glass wall peering into our proposed cutting-edge test lab, a place where we would be experimenting with all of the latest toys and gadgets that were applicable to our field work.

The problem was that they spent so much money on the conference room that they ran out of budget to buy the equipment for the test lab before the proposed first-use of the room.  They had planned a ""grand opening"" with some of our more prominent customers, but they had nothing to put in the server racks or on the shielded workbenches.

So the powers that be came down to the lowly deskside group and said ""we need to fill those racks with blinkenlights, what do you have?""  We had just finished our Windows 2000 upgrade, so the only boxes we had in stock were some old 486/Pentium/Pentium Pro desktops, the remainder of our Win95 machines that had not yet been sent to the scrapyard.  

What happened after that was pure technological horrorshow.  We had one guy stripping off faceplates and side panels to give everything a more tech/industrial feel.  We had another guy arranging everything into the racks to make the devices seem more high-tech than they were.  My job, beyond the heavy lifting, was to configure each box with script that would spin things up at random intervals, causing the CPU/Disk lights to flash on and off like the machines were processing heavy duty stuff.

The end of it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 hours worth of discretionary work so that none of the executives noticed the empty racks in the next room.  No one liked my suggestion that a curtain across the glass wall would have been cheaper and easier."
Hopefully you still have a job when you get back. $HH sounds like the type who would fire you for this.
"I have a feeling that, had he/she filled in the poll, it'd be something like ""I solved the problem myself, your tech support didn't even help me""."
"It looks like you are trying to update your server. Would you like me to:

1.) Replace all of your custom drivers with windows defaults?

2.) Run an in-place upgrade to the most recent version of windows, accepting all defaults?

3.) Reboot your system during a critical and time sensitive system task?

4.) Format your system disk?"
"Bro, the internet requirements! Seriously, why does IT not read the internet requirements handbook anymore? RTFM"
:-) Iâ€™m just that good
This is madness.
"I'm pretty sure if he did get fired for this, he could easily win a wrongful termination suit. Does depend where he lives though."
"&gt; SLA

They do, but the terms are not imposed by SLA, they're legal. Law in Argentina makes no distintions between people and business for this. [ISP] prioritizes businesses but the only lines that actually get special treatment are emergency lines like 911 and electric risk lines."
"
Meanwhile, coffee is no longer free in the cafeteria, because it's not in the work contract and the company sees no reason why they shouldn't charge employees for it. At this point I just laugh at it all, our management is all over the place and if you can't laugh at it, you're going to cry. 

It's been awhile since I last posted here, thanks to everyone who wrote to me these last few months about how they enjoyed and/or missed the tales :)"
"Don't show them the server. Monkey see, monkey gefingerpoken und mittengraben."
"I mean, if they tried to hold the pole *hostage* that'd make some minimal sense, but you don't *start* a hostage situation by offing the hostage."
I just read that in Mallory Archer's voice. 
"Maybe the bleach she uses for her hair is leaking into her head, stop the dyeing and maybe she will be able to think for herself."
"&gt;maximum effort shall be delivered

I immediately thought of Deadpool doing tech support."
"Who the heck was on the other end of that phone call?

Also, the previous Dave story made me spit coffee. "
"So, you now have TV prop experience."
Tech/retail in one sentence 
"""And if you answer with anything other than quack, I swear to god..."""
"This is an excellent story, and written in a manner that just makes you keep going. Thank you so much for sharing it. I loved it!"
"Its probably worth mentioning that the previous developer was a freaking badass and was fired due to being ""incompetent"" a.k.a his eye-candy skills on the webpages was bad."
"You shoulda told $ST that you, in fact, were the first idiot. I can only I imagine what would've gone through $ST's head if that happened."
"""The internet's requirements""

"This cannot be real. I. I can't. 

&gt;If it's broken, break it more. Then it'll get fixed faster, right?"
"Fun fact:

Press the roll-back button for a driver and it'll get marked as manually installed, meaning WU won't touch it.

This ends your fun windows admin fact for the day."
"Lol, thankfully it won't be that bad here... "
"This is usually the cause of missing keys, with the user trying to clean it themself"
That person shouldn't have any devices capable of going online.
"I kept waiting for the part where someone doubts her abilities, or where her looking good in a bikini becomes relevant. The title is clickbatey as fuck, but I guess it's still a nice story."
Liar. You can totally attach a USB hand crank and produce 10x CPU foot pounds per square inch.
HOW DARE YOU MAKE MY DEPARTMENT LOOK GOOD.
"""That's inconvenient""

Probably the nicest user reply I've ever heard in my life."
"I work at a gas station, and I've convinced myself that I should have compassion above all else. 

I honestly probably spend 30$ a week on 5$ gas for people. Everytime they say they'll pay me back, and everytime they don't. 

It's hard, but I still somehow convince myself that everyone needs help sometime, and I'd rather help a little and get taken advantage of, than not.

EDIT: To clarify, I -never- give out cash, and I've never had people come in more than once, other than this one old guy who lives out of his van. (But I only helped him out once, cause tbh he's a bit suspicious.) "
I consider it a good day whenever I can get someone to repeat the word dongle back to me more than 3 times in a conversation.  
We just call it Windows 10 now
"&gt; $Tech 3 - pfft i bet you cant tell your Hard drive from the disk drive!

I'm glad you took that guy's money. That's the dumbest possible insult he could have uttered."
"We have an acronym for this, PICNIC - problem in chair, not in computer."
I'm sorry - you didn't respond fast enough. Proceeding to Reformat and reinstall Windows with extra malware. 
"Where I come from, everything is ""the system"". The system is down, the system won't load, the system isn't working, I can't log into the system, the system won't connect, the system is on fire, the system killed my dog, the system is sentient, the system has launched all of the nukes, the system is taking over, the system has gained control, all hail the system, the system is supreme, the system is infallible, the system is perfect, I love the system"
At least tech 2 was smart enough to realize that you were going to be right
Oh that's genius. They probably either loved it or hated it. 
"&gt;I hang up, turn my mobile off and turn teh ""work"" filter on my landline on (beautiful thing I whipped up with arduido) 

What wizardry is this?

On second thought, I don't have a landline....."
"Yeah the pacing is more ""24"" or action movie than Tech Support, but it works!"
"&gt;&gt; $Me: You really don't want to know. Stay safe out there.

That line made me chuckle

That's actually...ingenious.

"&gt; A City Cop closed the door as I went through. And locked it. And stood guard.

Wow.  This is an example of how crazy people go on Christmas.  FedEx needs a city cop to hold their doors closed on the deadline.  Sheesh!"

"It's okay, show them the server and all the green blinky lights you set for Christmas :D"
"That's a good point, I should update my linkedin."
"But why do I have to remember anything, it just should, right? what about all the photos of a vacation 4 years ago that suddenly are the most important thing ever because my father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate is in them and we haven't seen him since!!"
"""FROSH!  C'mere, I got a problem I need to talk to you about..."""
"I am going to have to agree with you on this, get your ass in gear OP!"
"Just reading the title of this post elicited my upvote.

How many orders of magnitude larger are we expecting Norman's fuck-up to be this time? I get the impression $USER's been carrying out a spot of corporate espionage using that laptop and Norman's assistance."
"No reason to marry her. We've only had one kid together so far in 15 years. Not like it's serious or anything.

She did buy me a nice new house three years ago. With a pool. (**Bikini**)"
"Everything is a main server until proven otherwise. You should have responded saying ""Oh dear! Sounds serious, let me put you on hold whilst I get the magic main server wand."
"&gt; Luckily, the bartender saw what happened and poured me another beer on the house.

My favorite part of the story hands down... I was about to moron over the loss of a half-finished beer QwQ

EDIT: For the record I didn't mean mourn I literally use ""to moron"" normally... "
"Oh, god. I hate when someone accuses me of not being a 'professional'. Literally, I'm sitting here, getting paid to do this. This is my job. You're the person who doesn't know how an email address works, you're insulting me, and you're calling me unprofessional.

Thanks for the tale!"
Also known as PEBKAC - problem exists between keyboard and chair ðŸ˜‰
"Wow, real life NPCs!"
Would have just repeated that everyone working there is an idiot and no one knows how to help anyone. And then called back for help later on.
"Sounds like a ""perfect"" application."
"No, just a normal tech aura. We all develop that over time."
The cynic bastard in me was hoping the guy isn't a grifter making up sad stories for free stuff. I'm so jaded. 
"I have to say throughout the whole story, I never expected Norman to go to jail. Wow."
"They do pay more. For preferential treatment, among other things. If it's possible, we offer to redirect calls to another number, but this client didn't accept that."
"Leave a .txt file for her to find that says ""I told you so."""
