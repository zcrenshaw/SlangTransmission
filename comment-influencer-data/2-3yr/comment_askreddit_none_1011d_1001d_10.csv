"Except excessive use of the pepe meme for racist/sexist commentary by *certain subreddits that like to take over /r/all with botvoting* was a well known thing before hillary referenced it.

"Everything they do is annoying. Men are pretty much an afterthought, until they need something."
"Right, cause the stereotype was created in a vacuum and there has never been a shred of truth to it. Not, gangs or cartels, or people smugglers, or illegal immigrants. No. All Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are law abiding, peace-loving, educated people and well adjusted people. You know, I am just jumping on the *generalized lie* bandwagon here. "
"I really want to rip your heart out right now, but I will just try to resist the urge. Stupid liberals."
Religion... All of it.
"How is it ""institutionally racist""? You mean how so many institutions prefer to hire non-white men? Yeah, I agree, that is pretty racist. Or maybe the earnings gap between whites and Asians where Asians make more? Must be thanks to institutional racism!"

Ain't nobody got time fo yo lame ass knitting. "
You seem like a real cunt

They literally kill people of color in cold blood for existing as people of color. 
This is under voted
"Good, that's what they should do."
Are you fucking serious??? So basically you are saying there are people out there whose position is that poor people suck and shouldn't exist???
"Wow, people with Down's don't deserve to live...  Sounds a lot like Nazi Germany... Ever met anyone with Down's? They are pretty happy people; most the Down's kids I work with seem pretty happy to not be dead. But, I guess ita up to you to determine what a subjective quality of life is for others."
Find out who your local members of the electoral college are and bribe them not to vote for Trump. 
And most don't
"&gt;I'm not claiming that murdering children is ok.

You say abortion should be legal.  That implies that you do not find killing a fetus immoral.  I do fully acknowledge that morality and legality are not analogs, but based upon your response it's not a stretch to assume you do not find abortion abhorrent if you feel it should be legal.

&gt;You're assuming a fetus is the same as a human.

Not assuming, asserting a scientific fact.  Perhaps you mean person?

"youre way off here, reread the post and try to understand the other viewpoint better"
russia wins. Say goodbye to democracy. All awesome peeps died because they are spared the horrors to come.
"A mild heart attack.   I would take one for the team.

Edit:   Maybe not then we would be left with Pense... That might be worse. "
Because Trump definitely said that's something he wanted to do.
"So I have to specifically pick my words to make people feel better? Pretty messed up that I can't just say something outright without people jumping down my throat. I wasn't bragging, that's their own insecurity making them feel like I was, when I was just talking about it without a second thought."
"Preach, at least he didn't start a nuclear war with Russia for the lols. "
"Gross. You use the jacuzzi after showering, not as a shower."
"Yes, because him believing something is a hoax is going to cause the end of the world.

Whether we're ""past the point of no return"" or not, it's not like him not believing in it is going to change anything.

""Well, if he actually believed in it, then he could do something to make a difference!""

Yes, because all business men's first priority is to save the environment.

He wants power, money, and fame. I don't think him believing in something or not is going to alter the fate of the Earth and humanity as we know it."
"I was pointing out the obvious hypocrisy in /u/LadyFoxfire 's comment. She went on a huge ramble about how woman have to legitimately fear about being raped on the dating scene (which is very much a real thing). But then she undermines the male equivalence that was pointed out by /u/Geminii27. 

Both of the things they pointed out are very real issues with very real stats to them, but /u/LadyFoxfire was being a hypocrite about the whole ordeal because one has a lesser % of happening. "
"Soo.. usually someone who is automatically repulsed by the thought of a woman's smell, is more gay than they think. You might want to reevaluate where you're putting your nose, if it needs a clothespin for you to keep your boner. 

I'm assuming your gender is dude. If you're a girl and you don't like the smell of a clean frisky vagina -- well.. you've let down Gloria Steinem for one.... Go ahead and deal with that in the afterlife"
"If he is going to his wife's haircut appointment with her and she repays him by publically embarrassing him, then I am sure his life is full of cringe."
"Me too. I literally hate all the new ones. Including melee. They changed it up too much with melee and then never changed anything really. And everyone is obsessed with using the GC controller. It always seemed clunky to me. Once you figure out the nuances of the original I honestly think it's the better game, but I'm way biased."

"I had to go back and check who you were.  I thought this was u/CommaHorror.  Instead, just a preview of what we'll get from a Trump education system."
"girls want a guy they can fix.   they actually want a good guy.   Just not at first,  he has to have enough problems to be saved and molded in to the perfect guy. "
"A hang glider, a crotchless Uncle Sam costume, Christina Hendricks, a stadium filled with men who resemble my dad cheering me on."
"&gt; near universally disliked person as President.

Thats why he got elected? Keep your stupid political bias out of this topic. "
You sure bout that?
"But...you are judging them. And I never suggested that 'everyone leave the medical field who doesn't want to hurt herself blah blah'. Strawman.
Not going to get into too many personal details but I've worked in paediatric health for many years. I get that nursing is a tough gig. "
Ugh fucking nsfw

I think the real resentment was because multiple celebrities and media outlets equated looking at the pictures with actual rape. But it's been a while so it's gotten distilled down to that.
Had to scroll too far to find this. 
There is nothing to say. He will still make more money. 
"Only delusional redditors can downvote the harsh truth :/ 

I spent countless hours in front the screen when I was growing up. And its not like I regret it but you could hardly oppose the fact that all that time and effort should really be put into learning a craft, a language, a useful skill or anything really... Just living your life instead of consuming mindlessly.

*I liked Sims 4 though.

"Dude thats nasty, your parents did it on 911"
Seeing this shit post
And fuck OP's mom on countertop
"Get a lawyer.

Sue for royalties.

I'm being serious."
"&gt; The mother's mental health should be considered as well. 

Fuck no it should not. 


&gt;But my mental health is absolutely more important than a fetus,


No its absolutely not.  




If the fetus is old enough to be viable your mental health is the least of anyone's concern. If the fetus is old enough to be viable there should NEVER be an abortion allowed unless immediate danger to the mother.... if you dont want to carry the child to term give birth..... 


We're not talking about 6 week old clumps of sells, we're talking about a baby that has a better than 50.50 chance of surviving  outside of the whom and you want to kill it for your mental health? How incredibly selfish can you be?
