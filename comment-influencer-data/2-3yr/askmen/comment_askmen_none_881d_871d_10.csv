"Maybe the idealized romance part of it. I had an ex who, while we were going out, complained that we didn't meet ""by locking eyes from across a crowded room and knowing we were meant for one another"" or something. (We worked together and basically got together via a few drunken makeout sessions.)"
"When someone questions the manliness of any clothing or accessories I'm wearing, I simply ask them ""And how manly would you say it is to be critiquing another man's outfit?"" And then if they still try to act shitty about it, I'll jump into a bit of a joke about whether they must have gotten their opinion about my fashion choices from watching The View, did Cosmo say X was out of style, etc."

"* The sink must be free of dirty dishes when she comes home from work. The rest of the house can be a pig sty, but the sink *must* be clean.

* Send her flowers at work on Valentine's day and one or two other days throughout the year.

* Give her ass a good smack every now and then.

* Cook

* Put some serious thought into a birthday or Xmas gift. By that I mean pay attention to her stuff for a while; find a thing that she uses constantly and has become worn with age, and get her a new one of those. Something she hasn't already complained about; if she has, it negates your effort because (in her mind) she gave you a hint.

"""Girly drinks"" at bars.  So I like drinks that are sweet, that doesn't mean I'm gay or unmanly.  It's not my fault they're colorful and come in a wide-rimmed glass with an umbrella and a swirly straw.  And I'll happily drink scotch or whiskey straight up when I'm in the mood for it - but again, this doesn't make me any more manly than a guy who doesn't.

The swirly straw is cool though."
"About 65%.

A college boyfriend once picked me up and tossed me onto his bed (playfully) except he threw me OVER the bed and into the wall on the other side. 
"Met a girl online, she was super into me and couldn't wait for our date. I stood up to greet her at the table I got us, and she had a cringed look on her face. I was like, ""hey, what's wrong?""

She replied, ""I'm really sorry, but you're just too short for me.. "" and dashed out of the bar. 

I'm 5'8 and she was probably 5'5. Easily the ""shortest"" date of my life.. ha.

This morning I found one under my undershirt because it kept brushing my skin and was annoying as shit. Speaking of, pulling a random long hair out of your ass crack is a really odd sensation."

"As a woman on the receiving end of a 7 year relationship: 

* Verbal affirmations. Words are one of my main love languages, I need to hear that I am appreciated. We are very good about thanking each other every day for the little things (tidying up, making dinner, taking the dog out.) Just because it's an every day task doesn't mean it shouldn't be appreciated 

* Doing every day tasks. I do the bulk of the housework in our relationship because I work less hours than my partner. However we still split the bills 50/50 because our income is comparable, so that means I'm not a house wife. When he pitches in to help with the chores of the week it shows me he's not taking advantage of me and appreciates what I do around the house. 

* Compliments. Little ones, I don't need a written list. Unsolicited ""You look nice!"" goes really far. Same with random butt slaps. I assume he finds me sexually attractive when we have sex, but showing that he finds me sexually attractive all the time and can't keep his hands off me goes really far. Spontaneous sex would be even better. 

* Sex; satisfying and frequent sex makes even the shittiest relationship stay alive. I disagree with the notion that long term relationships need to ""spice it up"" or get freaky to stay satisfying... I mean if it ain't broke don't fix it. Our sex life was always relatively kinky anyway, and while I'm game to kink it up more I don't need it as a bandaid to some other sexual issue.

* Dates. But not super frequently. We go on maybe one date night a month because we're frugal people. There's no need to spend tons of money going out to eat because I like cooking and we eat well at home. But because we don't go on lots of dates I really appreciate when he plans something himself like saying ""Hey let's head down to blank restaurant"" this weekend.""

It's largely not about *what* you're doing, just that you're putting in effort and not simply idly riding the relationship wave."
Picking hairs out of your mouth
"That being away from her didn't  bother me. I went to college two hours away from her, and didn't  feel a thing. It wasn't really out of the blue, but it definitely played a big role in my decision."
"I've told this story on here a couple times. 

I dated one girl who had diagnosed clinical depression, but was not medicated for it because she didn't like how the meds made her feel. I encouraged her to seek more help and/or try different meds, but she didn't want to. This obviously put a strain on us, but I loved her so I stuck with her. 

I won't get into all the little details, but ultimately this is what lead to our downfall. We had some amazing times together that I wouldn't trade for the world, but eventually her depression began to drag me down too. It just became a constant cycle of us feeding each others depression and both of us getting worse and worse. I hid my problems from her because I wanted to be strong for her, but I was cracking under the strain. In a rare moment of clarity, I realized that if I didn't get out and get help I was going to end up dead. 

Breaking up with her was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do. I had been her rock for so long and I was terrified of what would happen to her if I left, but I just couldn't handle it anymore. She took her own life a few weeks later. I hate myself every day for what happened to her, but that's something I'll have to live with.  

**Edit:** Since a few people have asked... Immediately after the break up I didn't deal with things well. I was still battling my own depression and her death put me in a full on tailspin, a lot of drinking and very destructive things. The spiral downward culminated with me sitting at home drunk off my ass with a pistol to my temple, trying to talk myself into pulling the trigger. Obviously I didn't go through with it. The realization that I was too chickenshit to actually do it was kind of a wake up call for me that started me on my way to getting better. 

It's been a few years now, but these days I'm doing pretty great. I'm with a fantastic woman who I love very much and I plan on one day marrying. I still have some issues with depression, but it's well under control now. "
"The guy generally has to go first, be more, and better to appear to be worthy. 

I'm somehow supposed to be in wholeheartedly with them while they project that they're on the fence about me. Willing to throw my money at them while they are projecting they might not even give me the time of day. Be witty while they listen, rock a party while they observe, make suggestions while they're indecisive, be directed while they flounder, and be capable while they're clueless.

Come the fuck on, can I live?

They're disproportionately concerned about what the guy's bringing to the table but not at all about what they do. There's an assumption of worthiness on their end, sight unseen of what they're actually capable of. But God help you if you're a little short, a little boring, a little inexperienced, or what have you."
"Slowing down. I can jackhammer, to be sure, but 20 mins of just jackhammer is boring and exhausting. "
"Fatality 

College boyfriend wins. "
"When I was in my mid 20s it was really hard for me to find girls in their young 20s that would date/sleep with me.

Now Im in my mid 30s and its really easy for me to find girls in their young 20s that would date/sleep with me."
"Saying ""I love you"" or something else that is romantic. You can get a great rush of feelings as a reaction, and it results in an even more intimate moment.

Sex can also feel way more intimate than porn often portrays."

"Absolutely.  We'd have to communicate with writing things to each other until I learned ASL, but I'd have no problems with dating a deaf girl if I was still single.  

Hell, I bet my wife wishes she was deaf sometimes, as much as I talk and how bad my singing is. "
They're just people. The do people things. They're not scary beasts. They have hair. They have morning breath. They poop. They do cute little dances when they think you're not watching. Some of them snore. Some of them talk in their sleep. They can't decide what they want for dinner. Sometimes they have BO. 
Well being gay apparently makes me something other than a man....I always found that stupid.
"Putting on and taking off a condom.

Getting up to go to the bathroom and clean up. 

Also the idea of having intercourse and then at the last minute pulling out and jerking off. I get the concept of ""the money shot"" but it's far more satisfying to bust your nut while inside. "
"Don't just say ""You need to put in more effort."" What is effort anyway? It's a vague term that could mean anything. A friend of mine used to have the ""more effort"" argument with her boyfriend all the time, with both of them accusing the other of not putting in enough. The arguments never lead to any resolution, it was basically just a big ""Everything is your fault and not my fault!"" bonanza.

Figure out what it is you're actually missing from the relationship so you can actually spell it out for her. Otherwise all you're doing is plopping ""I'm not happy, you figure it out"" in her lap and waiting for her to make everything magically better.


What are you unhappy about? Is it sexual frequency? Differing libidos is a *super* hard issue to tackle, and I'll let you know from experience: you typically end up having the amount of sex the lower libido partner wants, instead of the other way around. It's really hard to just suddenly want sex when you don't want sex, so compromise is difficult. Plus pressuring someone for sex typically does the opposite of turn them on; tread lightly.

Is it communication? Tell her how often you need to hear from her and why. Say you enjoy talking about your days with her before bed and that it helps you feel connected to her when you're apart. 

Is it romance? Tell her you'd like to start going on more dates, say you'd like to commit to a once a week date night or make Sunday evening a dedicated Netflix n' chill night. 


Is it doing housework? Tell her that you feel unappreciated when the housework is unevenly taken care of. Ask her if she's noticed that you do blank and blank and blank chore all the time. Ask her if there's any chores she does that she feels you don't notice either. Make a plan to share certain chores or be more vocally appreciative of each other's 


Whatever it is: Tell her what you'd like to see change, and tell her why you feel you need to see that change. And then open the conversation up for her: Are there any areas of the relationship she feels you could improve on? Remember that just because you're feeling unhappy doesn't necessarily mean she's happy as a pig in shit. Always end a disagreement or serious discussion with an invitation for the other to express concerns as well.

I've had these conversation with my partner a few times very successfully because we are both calm rational people and I'm very diplomatic.  I make a point of using this tactic: Issue at hand + What I'd like to see change + acknowledgement of the good things the other already does + acknowledgement of how I may have added to the problem + invitation for the other to bring up concerns. 

As with all relationship issues: I highly recommend you both google ""the five love languages"" and give it a quick read. "
"Not being able to talk about mental health at all. There's such a stigma against it. Men can barely talk about feelings, let alone mental issues. Also on this note, being sad. Men can be sad damnit. Being a man is about working with your sadness to overcome it. Sometimes that means therapy and medication. So what? The only un-manly thing is giving in, and not trying to get help. Take care of yourself bros. "
"I keep getting older and they stay the same age.

"In the midst of my father beginning to succumb to cancer, my wife who worked for my dad sat me down in private and said we needed to talk. She started slowly, searching for her words, my dad's health and life racing through my mind.

She starts to explain that she thinks our 13 year old son is viewing porn online. I was relieved, bordering ecstatic, my father was not dieing (at that moment). Big argument concerning my ""joy"" of our son's porn habit."
"6'2"" guy with money here. There's no way I'd even be remotely interested in a woman who doesn't* have her own career (and she also better plan to keep it). Relationships are a two-way street. Who the hell would want a partner that just mooches off of them? "

"&gt;How can I talk to someone without ruining her night? 

Don't be an asshole.

If her night is ""ruined"" because someone she wasn't interested in flirts with her and she rejects him and he moves on with his life without any fuss, then fuck her feelings, she's the asshole.

&gt;subways

Now, that said, you really ought not to be cornering women on subways.  That kinda sends the wrong impression even before you've said anything and in some cases even if you take the rejection and leave.

&gt;one of them comes home upset because a guy was creepy or aggressively hitting on them. 

Sounds like you should probably increase your understanding of what being too aggressive or being creepy actually entails."

"I work in a diesel shop, and its loud. Very loud. Backup alarms, truck gates slamming, people beating steel with sledgehammers.

"My ideal is that a potential SO is active in their own way. It doesn't have to be lifting weights or running (in fact, my gym time is valued alone time) - but I'd want them to be into something active; dance, gymnastics, hockey, hiking, fun runs, anything really. 

This, admittedly, is an ideal - not a requirement. It isn't so much that they need to be physically fit, but more that it'd make dating easier. It'd align our values and habits. They'd be more understanding why I don't drink much, eat a ton, enjoy early nights, and why I prefer to hike all day rather than go clubbing all night. 

That's just me though. I've never actually dated someone who was all that into fitness, and equally, I'm still attracted to those who aren't. So I wouldn't dwell on it. "
"It's been almost 16 years together, 11 married.

Her nudity is sometimes sexual, often not.

Nobody's body is the same at 40 as at 24.

She's had six procedures and a baby.

I still look at her with stars in my eyes.

Giving her a hug when we're both clothed makes me happy.

Imagine unclothed and more than hugging.

She walked down the aisle and I had two thoughts: the other being ""Christ, I hope she doesn't change her mind.""

All the girls before her were just books.

She's the whole library."
"I'm a software developer who a) stays in shape and b) believes a man should dress well. 

Sometimes at the office another developer will make a teasing comment about how I dress​. I always laugh it off, it's almost always good natured, but if they keep going I'll just look em in the eye and say ""Do you really think the fashion opinion of a programmer means much to me?""

Usually that shuts em up, but if they keep going I'll just look them up and down (programmers usually not being the most fit individuals) and say ""If my options are to look like you or look like me, I'll take me any day"".

Done, sir, done. 

edit: note that I'm not talking about when someone makes the classic, lighthearted ""you got an interview today?!"" joke, I'm talking about the handful of times that someone wouldn't let up and it clearly skirted into mocking territory."
I hear the gays use it to practice suckling on each other. 
They can get really upset and offended when you turn down sex (regardless of reasons). 
"Anytime I hit on/approach a girl, I am very aware of how they react.  If they are cold or standoffish, I take that as they are not interested and I move along.  If they are friendly and welcoming, then I just try to make them laugh the whole night.  If they laugh at all your shit then they probably like you, and if you're on the cusp of her liking you that humor will most likely push you over the edge.  Just be aware of how she reacts to you and try to make her laugh/have a good time and you won't be considered a creep."
"Temporarily going limp or her drying up.

Also if there's smells in porn the actors often times ignore it, keep performing or edit it out. In real life may kill the mood.

EDIT: haha, I meant editing out a stink face or stop in the action because there's some BO or a fart a-la-mode."

"Not a father, but when I was a teacher in China, we would trick the kids into napping by having sleeping contests. Whoever could sleep the longest would get a big prize (ice cream). Little shits wanted to win so badly that they'd just pretend they were asleep, and laying down and closing their eyes while pretending usually caused them to actually fall asleep. Was basically a guaranteed thirty minutes of quiet for me at the small cost of like 5 RMB (about $0.55 back then)"

"I have two daughters, 14 and 20, and I'll let you in on a few secrets.

Be nice to all the boys.

You'll want to fall back on that whole, ""she's not dating until she's 25"" mentality, and that thing about cleaning your shotgun whenever the boys come around, but that doesn't work.  The only one's you'll scare away are the nice ones, and the ones that stick around will be the douche bags who say, ""fuck your old man, baby, we got love.  Now go make me a sammich.""

Seems counter intuitive, but you'll thank me for it later.

And be the type of man you want her to marry.  She'll judge all future boyfriends against the measure of her father, so you want them to have to aspire to greatness.  It's not too hard to be better than her dick of a father, so don't be that guy that's easy to top.

Be prepared for tears, both hers and yours, even if you've never cried in your life.  Like, fountains of tears falling from your eyes.  Those cheesy YouTube videos of little girls seeing their dads returning from a tour in the military?  Yeah, forget it brother, you're done.  Get the tissues.  The blind love of a daughter will reduce the most powerful and proud man to a sobbing little boy.

She'll play you.  Maybe not hard, but she'll play you, and your wife will be pissed because she knows the tricks.  Deal with it, and love her even more.  You'd be surprised what you're willing to let her get away with because she's your daugher, goddammit.

Many times I couldn't believe I actually wanted to have daughters; they're just as gross as boys, smell just as bad, are just as lazy, and need as many lessons as your sons would.  Just different ones, and you won't understand them one bit, never having been a teenage girl yourself.  So go with what your wife/girlfriend suggests, maybe ignore it if you dare.

Snuggle.  Watch Disney movies.  Have a tea party.  Wear the makeup she puts on you.  You won't believe the amount of pain and frustration you experience, and the fact that you wouldn't trade it for anything."
That you'll be a set piece in their instagram life. The millennial women's obsession with instagram as their vanity mirror is a little off putting to me. 
Not as odd as pulling one out from behind your foreskin.
"Basically. It's mostly guys who tell me, ""You have it so easy, no guy would ever say no to sex with you. If he does, break up with him immediately!"" 

My bf has turned me down before and the only reason I didn't get upset was because, if the genders were reversed here, I'd be cheesed if *he* was annoyed *I* didn't want sex! Nobody really teaches women that they'll get rejected as well, or how to handle it; it kind of fosters a sense of entitlement. I wish somebody did because I have been less than graceful in the past when I've gotten rejected."
"Yeah. 

I'm a security officer at a hospital, and a lot of the time I escort lost visitors to the patient rooms. 

One girl's grandfather was in the ICU for 1 day before he was transferred to another facility. 

But, I saw her, made some stupid joke about her being lost. It was about a 5 minute walk from where we were to the ICU. We talked the whole walk down there (it's how I found out her grandpa was the one she was visiting). I made her laugh, she made me laugh. She mentioned how she was a bartender at a bar WHOSE NAME I FUCKING FORGOT BECAUSE I'M A FUCKING CANTALOUPE. I told her the only drink I know how to make has ""and"" in the name because it's 2 ingredients so I can't fuck it up that bad, and she laughed her beautiful ass off. 

Literally as I showed her the room, I got paged on the radio for a violent patient elsewhere that I had to deal with, so I had to bail real quick. 

I went back during a routine tour about an hour later, but he'd already been transferred and she was gone. 

YOU'LL FOREVER BE IN MY HEART"
"A lot of girls think that if a hot guy out of her league is willing to have casual sex with them, he's also willing to date them. So after they spend a drunken one night stand with a stud, the girls think that they deserve nothing less than guys on his level. 

Most guys I know who are good looking and sleep around have pretty low standards for casual sex, but they always end up dating girls around their level of attractiveness. "
"Times are changing bro, my gay neighbor helped me fix my motorcycle last week, I just stood around asking questions and would hand him the tools he needed."
Waited for the admission after reading her online post thanking a guy for spending time with her early morning...around 2AM...despite her suddenly not having time for me after a school break.
"&gt;  complained that we didn't meet ""by locking eyes from across a crowded room and knowing we were meant for one another"" or something

I'm not romantic at all but actually sort of met my bf this way, and it really adds nothing to our relationship. I can't even assign a deeper meaning to it because honestly it just meant we wanted to fuck each other."
"Never use an umbrella? That's extremely stupid and I hear it exclusively from women (usually young and stupid). But I've even had mid-30yo ex-coworker say ""ew why do you need an umbrella? It's such a turn off"".

This is basically the reverse gender ""you look better without makeup"" idiot argument."
"That a guy is just supposed to know what's important to you and if he doesn't he's not the guy for you. I got into a huge fight once because I didn't do little ""gestures"" to show I cared. It wasn't that I didn't do gestures... because I did. I didn't do the RIGHT gestures. I didn't randomly buy flowers. I didn't randomly buy cards to show I cared. I didn't call her in the middle of the day to have a meaningful conversation.

I did:

* Hang the curtains you bought in our bedroom without being asked and surprised you when you came home.
* Buy you a coffee maker for my apartment so that you could have your daily routine when you started your day. 
* Stock your favorite breakfast foods at my place as well
* Try to make dinners you'd like
* Bought those plane tickets to see your family without asking for money
* Text you during the day while I am in important meetings to let you know I was thinking of you
* Change my schedule DRASTICALLY to spend more time with you
* Didn't make a big deal out of your little dog pissing all over my place when you stayed over even though you should have him trained better
* DOZENS of other examples 

But again, because it wasn't the gestures you wanted, they didn't count. "
"Yeah they can be really insecure about that shit, I guess cuz they're told all men want it all the time, so they figure if they don't it must be something wrong with them."
"What the fuck it sounds like a lot of guys here have never actually been to uni / college and lived in mixed dorms.

Yes there may be a chance of some kind of sexual activity, there's 21 year old drunk guys and girls but every night they won't be predatory on you!

These comments make out like guys are pigs, ""don't touch any socks without gloves""... what!? None of my housemates have ever done that, men are just as hygienic as women.

If you know these guys and trust them just go for it - some of these comments are so stereotypical and sensationalist "
"Years ago, I was long distance dating a girl who liked to talk on the phone for half an hour to an hour a day. One day, we had a long conversation over Instant Messenger, and I thought that fulfilled my daily obligation. Nope, that conversation didn't count, still had to call. Threatened to hang herself in the ensuing argument."
"Dont be seduced into thinking just because you get oodles of attention and constant offers for dick that you have ultimate power, that you dont need to try just as hard as the guy, that you also dont need to try your 'best' in dating.

The guys that fawn over you and put up with 'your bullshit' are doing it for a reason.  If the dating game is like a job hunt, then these men are the ""inside sales job"" of men. The better ones are more competitive, you need to bring your A game, your youth and nice tits wont be enough for them just on their own.  I've known a lot of girls that got so used to essentially being assholes in their youth that they have issues snapping out of it now... a female friend of mine was recently baffled that a guy called her rude and walked out on her when she made him wait for close to an hour.  Most of the times I've ghosted girls, if I really told them the stuff they did that turned me off/was inconsiderate, Im sure they would be baffled because to them its just how they've always acted/what they usually get away with/they honestly dont see anything wrong with their behavior.  I know when I go out that I am scheduling the date and paying and I'm happy to do that... but if I dont get some sort of non-obligatory 'thanks' or some heartfelt token that this effort was appreciated and my time is just as valuable, she's done.  The only guy who would put up with that is one with no options, because hes pathetic (or 
 super horny willing to honey dick, hence all the ""guys only want sex!"" girls running around completely oblivious they have created their own reality).

And just to proactively reply to the  ""lol /r/niceguys"" comment... I'm not saying ""women only like assholes"" or are unnatracted to nice guys/good guys/whatever.  I am saying that I think guys who have ""game-ified"" dating are the only ones increasingly likely to put up with the chronic 'small rudeness'/disregard/just plain 'not trying' I see a lot of girls in their late 20s exhibiting while lamenting the dating treadmill/how dudes never pan out.   I  think a lot of pretty girls get psychologically whipsawed by all the attention they get early on and dont realize that they are just queen nothing over shit-guy-pile.  


If you want a ""great guy"", however you define that, you will very likely need to treat him as an equal from day 1.

"My (stay-at-home) mother had a ""quiet hour"" policy. Immediately prior to, we could gather *any* craft items we wanted: construction paper, glue sticks, markers, etc. and we were given **a whole hour** to do *whatever we wanted* with them as long as we were quiet.

We never caught on because she would take this privilege away if we misbehaved. It had to be torture pretending that she was taking something away from us by not leaving us alone for an hour, but she pulled it off and we guarded that hour preciously.

Consequently, I feel like it was a major driver of my creative abilities later in life. My siblings and I are all rather different, but we are all relatively creative, and this is (IMO) the probable cause."
"Two games for the lazy dad.

First: Zombie Tag.  A great game to play at the park.  Dad shuffles after the kids, occasionally raising his arms saying ""BRAINSZZ.""  Kids shriek in delight and run away and climb and taunt the zombie, but are rarely caught.  When caught, their brains are devoured and they too turn into zombies shuffling after the other kids.

Second: Jump on Dad.  Dad is so tired on a Saturday morning that he lies on the floor and sleeps while the kids take turns jumping on his back.  This game ends when the oldest gets too heavy and lands heel-first on the kidneys."
"Told this story before on here but basically cutey mcbooty and I had gone on a movie date that went well the week before. She decided we should hit up this park by her place to experience nature and all that bs. We get there and first thing we see it a steep ass hill, I'm talking so steep it has a stair case. What does cutey mcbooty do? Takes off running down the hill and my dumbass is left to rescue her. On her way down she falls and smacks her head on the ground, basically knocking herself unconscious. Now I'm trying to wake her up and nothing is working but lo and behold she starts seizing. At this point it's fuck it 911 come through. But before I hit dial she wakes up and goes,""woah that was a crazy dream."" Shook my head and took her ass home, never to be seen again. Entire date was roughly 10 minutes. "
"That really depends on what the guys in question are like. Sit down with all of them and just talk things out. Some good topics: 

- How often should the rooms used by everyone be cleaned, and will there be a set schedule?
- Does everyone wash their own dishes as soon as they are done or will there also be a schedule for it?
- What about having SO's or flings over? Any rules?

To make it more productive, you could make one meeting where you just figure out the important topics and then meet up again one week later so that everyone can think about whats important to them. "

"Be there for him.

Offer your condolences and a hug, and tell him that no matter how much it hurts, however much pain he is going through, that you will be there for him, and that he can always rely on you for support.

Give him his space. He's going to go through a whirlwind of emotions- sadness, heartbreak, desolation, rage, denial, confusion, torture, release and finally acceptance. You have to be patient with him, because whatever he throws towards you isn't him at his best. If anyone gives him harsh judgement for crying about it *(you know, because we're men and we're not allowed to express our emotions and other shit that women say)*, defend him fiercely. Right now, he needs a voice of assurance to let him know that whatever he will feel, it is never unjustified. He needs someone to rely on and feel comfortable with. If he feels uncomfortable in a crowded room, offer to take him aside to clear his mind, look after him and ensure that he is as stable as can be in times of distress like this. The little things. 

This is a moment in your life where you get to show him how much your friendship means to him. On a day when his world falls apart, stand by his side as you help him pick up the pieces again, to build something new. Good luck OP, my sincerest condolences to him. "

"Got in a relationship.


As soon as I got in a relationship, I stopped caring at all about what other women thought since my girlfriend's thoughts are all that mattered and suddenly women all around have begun to flock around me. I talk to them the same way I talk to bros, ignore them for the most part like I ignore your average guy and if I look at them just to see who is around me, I just quickly glance over and look away since I've got no reason to kind of observe them up and down and see if they look good or not. Suddenly that I've lost all interest in other women, they have all gained interest in me."

"How stinky her farts are. 

What baffles me, is that we lived together a full year before I heard her fart for the first time. I just thought she never farted. I was doing homework one night, and I heard a faint poot behind me. I turned, in disbelief. ""Did you fart?"". She giggled embarrassingly, nodding  her head. ""I never heard you do that before"". I don't know why, but I felt like our relationship had just reached a new stage, and I was delighted. I pulled out a bottle of sambuca, and pour up two shots for us. 

""What the fuck are you doing?""

""This calls for celebration..."" and I hand her a shot. I chink my glass against hers. ""...Here's to the gas in your ass. May your wind catch my sail, and propel us to ever lasting love..."". And I downed my shot. 

""..."" 

I ended up finishing off the rest of the beer in my fridge, much to her dismay that it was because she farted.

Anyways, that night opened up pandora's asshole, cause it's been virtually non stop since then. It slowly picked up, until one night watching tv, I picked up the scent. The smell was horrid. I couldn't even stay, I had to leave the room. I almost puked, and she was crying from laughter. For 10 minutes straight, long after the smell was gone, she was still laughing. 

I've come to learn the warning signs. Most times I don't hear it, but for absolutely no reason, she just starts laughing. I have approximately 3 seconds to run before the smell hits. 

A few times she's even tricked me. ""Andrew, can you come here, I need your help."" And I'll fall for it, walking right into the cloud of stink. 

Occasionally I have stinky farts, but nothing compared to hers, and not a frequent."

"My wife and I have a recurring argument about me cooking. 

Growing up, everything in my life pointed to the lesson ""learning to cook well is really impressive to women."" And I found it to be true. When cooking for girlfriends they would swoon over it and brag to their friends, etc. 

My wife never cooks, and had a similar attitude at first about how good my cooking is. 

Then we had a baby. I kept up my goal of cooking healthy food each night. But every once in awhile, my wife has come home with the baby while I'm in the height of cooking (boiling, sauteeing, etc) and *insisting* I must help her with the kid *immediately*. Often there's a much easier solution, like putting the toddler on the floor so I can watch her while still cooking, but my wife will insist that the only solution is me stopping what I'm doing to hold the kid. 

Over many discussions we've reached an impasse where I do my best to be done with cooking before she's home or make sure she's ok with me cooking before starting. But it still happens every once in awhile."
This is not because women *love* shoes. It's because women's fashion dictates certain shoes only go with certain outfits. It's necessity more than anything.
"Some things, other than that intrinsic connection, that contributed to me getting more serious with my current girlfriend:

- She'd leave loving tokens for me to find.  She'd sneak cute notes into my jacket pockets and things like that. 

- Whenever I left her alone in my apartment (say, if I left for work and she wanted to sleep in until she had to go to work), she'd clean and straighten up around the place without my asking.  She insists on doing this. I often come home to clean dishes, to clean litter boxes. 

- If she sees little things she thinks I'd like while she's out and about, she'll get them for me. 

- No matter how crazy a dream of mine is that I've mentioned, she's been supportive without a hint of doubt that I could accomplish it.  

- She passes no judgement.  Even little things like, I had a day off the other day and talked a big game about getting up early and catching up on all these errands I needed to run. She texted me to ask how my productive day went, and I kind of sheepishly responded that I slept until noon and watched an entire season of a TV show, and her response was something like: ""that's amazing! No day has ever been better spent. I'm sure you needed it after working so hard this week!"" Without mentioning anything like ""well, when are you going to get to XYZ.""  She trusts me to adult with having to act like a mom. 

- She comes through when I need her.  I make a little more money than her, so I like to take care of her when we're together.  She often insists on doing something for the both of us, but mostly lets me pay for her because she knows that I like to.  Well, a couple months back I had some unexpected hospital bills I had to pay and I had to dip through my savings.  After paying rent, I literally had like $250 to last me a full two weeks until my next paycheck.  When I told her we'd have to have some quiet nights in the apartment until I got paid, her first response was ""nonsense! Now I can finally be sugar momma for a change, it'll be fun!"" And she insisted on taking us out. 

- She cares about her friends and family deeply. She'll travel three hours to visit a friend she heard is having surgery.  She'll get up at 3 in the morning to get her brother who's lost downtown.  She visits with her grandparents. That sort of thing.  She takes interpersonal relationships really seriously. 

- She's just moved in, and even though I make more than she does, she's insisting on paying half of the rent/expenses.  I tried to argue (for a while) that we should do it proportionally to our income, but she maintained that her half of the expenses were well within her means to still have spending money and save, and it was important to her to contribute 50%.  She said if we ever move somewhere outside of her means, we can do proportional payment, but since she can afford it, she insists on contributing it.  

She's a wonderful woman.  I think when someone has strong values and principles, it will shine through in all manners of their behavior and interaction.  These are just a few of the first examples that come to mind, but she is constantly making me smile and mutter to myself ""I love this woman!"" She keeps surprising me with how kind and thoughtful she is.  "

I later found out she wanted me to convince her to stay with me instead of me just dropping her off at home, even though she said she wanted to go home multiple times. What???

"Just supporting him in his pursuit of some male bonding time, which it sounds like you are doing, is all yoh need to do to be a great partner.

I guarantee you theyve been emailing for weeks geeking out over the preparations.

And take the time to do what *you* want to do - hang with friends, or just enjoy some alone time.  Coming home to a happy wife who enjoyed the time apart as much as he did, so you can both feel pleased about it and just enjoy being together again, is the best way to come home.  He knows full well some of his buddies will be coming home to women who are seething with resentment, who sat around stewing about being abandoned instead of taking advantage of the time to do some things for themselves, ready to pick a fight.  Don't think he won't be aware of what he's got coming home to someone who is glad that he can have something fun outside of the relationship, and can do the same for herself."

"Being friends with vs. actually living with people are two entirely different things, regardless of gender.

(this is all from personal experience so take it with a grain of salt.)  

As for living with guys, be prepared for them to get really comfortable around you, walking around in boxers and possibly smelling a little more... natural. A few comments on here will probably talk about sexual advances and thats a fair point to make, but you shouldnt bring it up until you feel uncomfortable about it. To go along with my first point, starting off on a 'hostile foot' can put a wedge between you and them, that may not need to be there in the first place.

I do however like sweet drinks, like Palm Bay - especially when fishing/golfing. Vodka mixed with juice and a slight carbonation in a can.

She though I was avoiding and distancing myself from her, which was strange. She then told me to leave for a few days. I packed up and left, after that I broke the lease of our apartment without her knowledge.

I happily broke up with her afterwards and immediately started dating another woman. She was in utter shock with my decision.

"A.  Engage her on *neutral ground*.  This is a place where both of you have the ability to walk away whenever you want, and neither of you has the home field advantage.

Good:  Bar, club, event, coffee shop.  You can approach and back away without making anyone feel unsafe or pressured to perform for others.

Bad:  Bus, work, a room with only your friends in it, a room with only her friends in it.  If she (or you) can't walk away without consequence.  If she (or you) are under pressure from others to respond in a certain way. 

B.  Engage with confidence and with a way for either of you to graciously opt out.   I frequent a pub that usually gets crowded around 10 pm.  Group of cute girls walk in and all the tables are full?  Hey girls, pretty crowded in here, you are welcome to share this table with my group/ Hey girls, is anyone using this chair, mind if I borrow it?  Easy thing for anyone to decline.

C.  Know when to quit. Is she constantly turning her body away from you, refusing to make eye contact, running to the bathroom with friends a lot?  ""Hey, it's been nice meeting you, I hope you have a great night."""

"My fitness has varied a lot over the years between 60lbs overweight to a noticably good body. I'm older and have dated chubby women, and quite fit women.

I actually have no problem with larger body as I really like curves. The appearance was not a problem. I'm just as attracted to the bodies of curvy larger girls as I am to athletic ones. I don't acutally like athletic bodies on women all that much to be honest.


But despite that when I was at my fittest I found that an unfit women was not much fun to be with. They could not keep up with all the outdoor stuff I'd like to do. 

When you have a fit body its like owning a sports car. Sure it looks great, but the real fun is taking it for a fast drive. You want to go running, and play sports, and do generally do lots of physical things because you have a strong fast body and its lot of fun to use it. An unfit partner just can't keep up. They literally cannot go running with you or do the same rock climbing things you do.

So when you're with an unfit partner it creates a big mismatch of lifestyles. They want to go out to eat all the time. They want to do indoor things. It can get a little boring if you're used to *doing* stuff rather than just socialising, watching stuff and eating.

Also many guys who got fit had to work hard for it. That means watching what you eat and eating a pretty carefully chosen diet. That does not mean your food is boring or that you're eating celery all day. But when your partner want to go the this dessert cafe or eat pizza for the second time this week it forces you to use up will power hanging around junk food and not eating it. You'd rather just be around a healthy lifestyle and healthy food 24/7 so you don't have to think about it. Watching someone eat pizza and ice cream while you do the opposite is not fun. Over time it just wears you down and you get fat yourself.

When I dated a girl who was really into health and well being it was really great. We'd both eat healthy all the time and food was just something we did not turn into a big part of what we cared about. I could take her for a strenuous hike up in the mountains and she'd be having fun the whole time, keeping up with no effort at all. She would not be pretending she was into it, then runing the hike for both of us by not being able to keep up and needing to rest all the time. We could go for a run to the park together. She'd give me all these tips on keeping healthy that I'd never even looked at because it was from a more feminine perspective but they were super helpful. We could just go out the door for an activity any time and she'd be up for it. She was never too tired to do something. And when I was doing my gym time she kind of knew what I was trying to acheive and I could talk to her about it. Being fit is a big part of your life so its nice to be able to talk to your partner about it.

If I was really fit again **I'd probably look for a partner that could comfortably run a 10k. And I do mean run**. I wouldn't be out there with a stop watch or anything, but I feel that's a good indication of a good level of fitness. Someone who could do just about any activity and would always have plenty of energy for stuff. That might sound like a high bar but once you start getting fit you realise its not that hard actually. Anyone who is serious about fitness and has gotten down to a reasonable weight and is injury free could build up to running a 10K in three months fairly easily.

I also would not be intersted in dating a girl who is starting on the path of losing weight and getting fit. A lot of partners when they start dating someone fit make a 'committment' to get fit themselves but it just does not work that way. If you cared about enough to really do it, you'd have done it on your own regardless of what partner you're with. I don't want to be your life coach helping you lose weight and become fit so you can feel we're a better match. Its a *really long* and difficult path getting fit and healthy, and everyone has to do it their own way and for their own personal reasons. Doing it for a guy you've been dating a couple of months is not really a great way to go about it.

I don't judge anyone who is fat and unfit. I've spent more time that way myself than healthy. I know how hard it is to change and I know its not a moral failing or anything like that. But because its so hard to change, and its so different being fit I'd have trouble being in a relationshp with an unfit girl while being very fit myself. It just does not work."

"That a relationship will solve all of your problems.

Bro, you could date the hottest chick on the planet. You're still gonna wake up tomorrow and have to go to class or work or whatever.

I feel like young guys vastly overestimate the ""magic"" of women. And sex. And they focus on all that because it's far more daunting to look inward at our flaws and acknowledge our fears and vulnerability.

It's easier to place a fantasy world where dating just solves everything on a pedestal because it allows you to focus on some sort of goal or preoccupation or objective.

But what happens after that? You're still you. Your life might be marginally better in some ways. But poon tang don't cure cancer or get you a 6 figure job rolling joints and playing video games.

Relationships are great, yes. But they aren't perfect. And the most important thing to realize is that they aren't a direct substitute for self-improvement. They can be a supplement and helpful towards it. But no woman (or man) is going to wave a magic wand and solve all of your life's problems."

"Way back in the day a cop once told me ""you need to man up and  tell us where your friend is back there""

They thought my buddy was hiding from them in the woods behind the high school and wanted to know who he was, why he ran, etc. They had drove up to my car sitting in the empty HS lot during the summer and seen someone nearby book it into the woods.

I had no idea who that person was. We (me and my actual friend in the passenger's seat) just happened to be the in the same parking lot but they detained us and grilled me for an hour. It was doubly insulting. Calling me a liar in the first place but also implying I was not a man because I wouldn't squeal on my ""friend"". Like somehow manhood is connected to willingness to rat out friends under pressure. I don't think I've ever broken a non-traffic law in my life but telling me to ""man up"" repeatedly is never going to accomplish anything. How pathetic do you have to be for that to work? Fuck those guys."
Your gf kind of sounds like a selfish shitty person tbh
"That she had no real control over her anxious impulses and overall mental health. I was about to drive down an visit her, a 90 minute drive, and I told her ""My goal is 10am, but maybe as late as noon if [unlikely thing that I anticipated might happen] happens."" And she couldn't handle the uncertainty in the slightest. She kept asking me when exactly I was arriving. When I repeated my answer she seemed to accept it, but then asked when exactly I was arriving in different terms, or said she was asking because someone else needed to know when exactly I was arriving. She brought it up over and over, at least 5 times over  a the course of what should have been a Skype date; She really couldn't accept that I had a general idea of my arrival time, but couldn't say for certain. 

I was a really small thing, but spoke volumes about where she was with her mental health; right then was the moment where I knew I couldn't date her any longer. "
This one drives me fucking nuts. Everyone seems to want equality until it inconveniences them.
"Do the laundry while taking a shower because you don't live near a laundromat, let alone afford to buy a washer and dryer.

Have to explain to people that without a car or access to public transport or other services big cities have that your small town doesn't, your options are much more limited than people realize.

Get tired of ""buy in bulk"" tips for poor people because it doesn't work if you have no way of fitting it in a mini freezer that serves as your entire fridge, you can't walk home with super heavy/large objects, and there's nowhere to buy in bulk from that isn't half an hour of driving away in the next city.

Put aside 10% of your &lt;$11k annual income to save for college.

Scoff at DIY posts that ""only cost a small fraction of what buying the finished result costs"" and include specialized tools you can't afford, can't access, and/or don't know how to use.

Get pissed off when you see those ""I'm so poor because I keep spending my large paychecks on dumb shit"" posts because you always spend your money wisely and yet you're still struggling financially.

Repeatedly have to explain to the guys who keep calling from your phone company that yes, you understand the plan they're offering includes more features for a better value; you literally cannot afford to spend that extra $10 a month for it.

Feel guilty and humiliated for not being able to donate to your school's canned food drives for the food bank because you use the food bank.

Sigh whenever someone suggests cutting bills like cable or a gym membership or whatever other extra expenses you've never had in the first place. 

Get even more pissed off seeing people complain about not being able to afford the newest iPhone because they'd rather spend it on alcohol/weed/other drugs, when you've been wearing shoes that are literally falling apart because buying a decent quality $100 pair to last you another few years means no grocery money for an entire month.

Have a difficult time finding a shelter or transitional housing to stay in that will accept a man, because the first thing that comes up in internet searches are shelters for women.

I bowled a couple of games to warm up and pass the time. 8pm rolls around, she walks in.

Do yourself a favor and watch someone who is amazing at interviewing people. Terry Gross, Barbara Walters, Howard Stern. Look at how they carry on a conversation. They ask questions about people, and then they use the answer to ask more questions. They don't ask questions that can get yes or no answers. They focus entirely on the person and their responses. They listen and hear them, they aren't just waiting for their chance to speak. If they don't know what to ask, they shut up and let the silence goad the person into more talking.

Ask her about herself. Ask questions about things that make her happy. Keep trying to direct the conversation towards things she enjoys or are important to her.

Don't talk about yourself. Focus on learning about her - that means listen. Actively."

Not only do I look better and get more attention from women, but I *feel* better as well. My overall mood improves when I straighten up, I feel more confident, I have less back and neck pain, and even my clothes fit better.

Seriously dudes, straighten your backs *right now*, and be aware of your posture. That shit can change your life."

"Poor socialization would be the lion's share, I'd say, at least for incels.  People who grow up ostracized by their peers never have the opportunity to properly develop their social skills, and taking the effort to rectify this can be logistically difficult in addition to the difficulties of trying to learn how to be properly social and play catch-up.

For him: military. He wanted to be more invested in it, to do and teach more courses, and to generally just move up that ladder.

My dream can only be pursued in the heart of a larger city, and I need to stay in one place to get established. His would require him to live near a military base, and relocating is common. 

We tried the long distance thing at first, but 6+ months of the year apart isn't ideal; I was functionally single because he was absent so often. He tried scaling back his job, but he was miserable. I knew if I gave mine up, I'd deeply resent him and our relationship would turn very bitter. I didn't want to end up hating him, that would have hurt both of us unnecessarily.

So...we realized our careers weren't compatibile. It was a tough choice because I still loved him, but I think leaving him was the best decision for both of us. He's with a new woman who she supports his military job. I've also met someone new who supports my goals, and I just accepted an articling position which will give me the leverage I need to get hired in an ideal position in the next few years.

"I ended up at a house party in Ann Arbor, MI one evening years ago and while there, I met an incredibly attractive, charming girl early in the night. The two of us found ourselves deep in conversation and enjoying the undeniable vibe developing quickly between us. While on the couch with my new friend, the music shifted from party music to an album by Pink Floyd called The Final Cut (one of my favorite albums of all time). As soon as Roger Waters sings the first line in the first song, ""Tell me true, tell me why"" she pulls me in close and whispers, ""this is my all-time favorite album."" All I can think to say is, ""will you marry me?"" She laughs and pulls me in closer as we listen to each song on the album. 

The moment that will forever be vividly etched into my mind is when a song called The Gunner's Dream came on and at the moment the lyric ""You take her frail hand"" is sung, I slide her hand into mine and then she squeezes it tight when he sings ""and hold onto the dream."" Anyone that knows this part of the song knows not only how incredible this moment of the song is, but also how much more incredible it is to have a beautiful woman react to the song in this way. 

Well, that's it. That's my story. No hook up. No number exchange. I can't even remember her name. Whatever. Who knows if that night would be as memorable as it is if the two of us had sustained our connection. 

tl;dr - Don't ignore The Final Cut.

She was like ok... :( and we went to bed but then she tried to get me horny by doing stuff to me and I was just like no, Im serious, I need to sleep. She then got all pouty and shit and wouldnt let me hold her while we slept. 

Shes turned me down plenty of times but the most memorable was after I had gotten her off, I was like ok my turn now, gimme a blowie. She starts but then like a minute into it she was like eh, actually Im not in the mood, lets not have sex. Im just like....wat, you are just gonna stop half way through? Shes like yeah sorry lol. I didnt like that very much..."

"That's getting so broad I'd probably have to sit down with a bit of paper and diagram things out in order to just remember everyone and sort them into their appropriate column.

Pulling a number out of my butt, I'd say something like 60% of the women whose names and/or faces that I know well enough to recognize are attractive enough that if some set of circumstances led to a good opportunity, I'd likely take it.

I'd hazard a guess, though, that the less attractive women don't stick out in my mind as much as the ones I find attractive, unless they're notably hideous or someone who I'd actively make a note to never have sex with or something."
This is quite common in America actually. 
"This may not be related to keeping the spark alive, so to speak, but when she talks, listen. When you argue, apologize. When there's important decisions to be made, include her. Just the little things that make all the difference, in my relationship at least. It's amazing how much those simple little things can make a woman love you that much more. 

Hope this answered your questions! "
"In general, ""I don't have time"" is bullshit. Most people have an abundance of free time that they waste on bullshit like TV, driving, working too much, etc. It's all a matter of priorities. If he/she says they don't have time for you, it usually just means they'd rather spend their time doing something else. It might not be personal but it's still true in my experience."

But when they're together, he just seems... tired and beaten down. She doesn't like when he talks about video games or politics or anything, seemingly, so she does this laborious ""sighhhhh"" thing anytime he joins the group's discussion. It's pretty depressing when you see relationships like that unfold - with a better match, they'd *both* be super vibrant and interesting, but hold each other back in a big way"

It's going to depend on the severity of your disability. 

If you just have to wear hearing aids but can speak normally (low severity) then I'd have no issue. I've actually dated a woman like this... the only oddity was when one of her hearing aids would act up, I'd hear the static buzzing and she wouldn't. It was just like any other relationship and I don't see any issue entering into it again. 

If you have hearing aids but really can't hear even with their help and you primarily communicate via sign language and can't speak orally (clearly), I'm kinda not interested. It may sound shallow, but it's not about the disability, it's about my laziness to not have to learn a new language to communicate with you. How would we talk? How would I get to know you? I know maybe 10 sign words and the alphabet. Kinda hard to flirt and be charming when I'm struggling to understand what you're saying and also make myself understood. I'll pass. "

"Not OP, but i think the message of the comment is that prior to engaging with women, many give a lot of emphasis to try to be as appealing as they can, which leads to a lack of trust in oneself and try to hide these mundane things -- so we just have to remind ourselves that girls go through the exact same things as we do and there really isn't much to be ashamed of; we're just people.

I want to add thinking ahead of and anticipating something she needs or likes and then getting if for her. I'm talking about some thing as simple as a 4$ bouquet of flowers you saw when you went to the grocery store or you remember that nerdy saying mugs make her laugh so you buy one randomly for her when you see it. Nothing terribly expensive just a small thing here and there that says hey you were on my mind when I saw these and  thought you would like them.

"I read r/deadbedrooms.

I realized that I wasn't alone and that this was complete bullshit. 

I started doing my own thing, I was through trying to fix things and getting absolutely nowhere. I got fit, I concentrated on the things I enjoyed doing, she was so extremely far down my list of priorities, she became barely visible. I'd already mentally checked out of the relationship in other words.

It took me years to realise I was in a very abusive relationship. What started as little jibes turned into name calling, turned into public, turned into little bits of physical stuff, turned in to slaps on the head, turned into proper punches, turned into black eyes all because she knew I would never hit a girl. 

Despite being damn near suicidal, I was still concentrating on my own thing. My main motivation was I didn't want to be home.

The final death knell for me was when I'd gotten fitter, people outside of her and our friend group were calling on me for things and I would go to see them alone, she somehow got more respectful and interested in me. She wanted to reinitate our sex life and generally wanted things back. 

It fucking disgusted me. I know it sounds weird, but it did. I had to get as far away from her as possible. However much I was not home previous to that, triple it. When that blow came out of nowhere, I couldn't be under the same roof. 

That turned into a massive physical altrication one night where I was almost arrested despite her being drunk, shouting, screaming, even threatening the police officers who attended and me being covered in blood. I was told in no uncertain terms to leave the house or face arrest. I knew after that while the officer couldn't directly threaten this, this is what he was basically saying.

Luckily I'd already set so many wheels in motion to sell the property and she seemed compliant. We sold, parted ways, never seen nor heard from her - or a good many of my former close friends - again.

Good riddance. "
"90% of the time these girls have boyfriends already. Most likely scenario is homeboy discovering this when showing up at her work uninvited.

Maybe I'm overly cynical though. "
Or you fall out and she has to fumble to put it back in. 
"With 50 bucks you can buy a ton of pizzas and cases of beer to share with your buddies. 


edit: I definitely exaggerated on the **ton** of pizzas and beer. But nevertheless, a chill night with pizza and beer beats going out and striking out at bars."
"Gotcha.  That definitely broadens it up some.

Now we need to define women one knows in this context.

Acquaintances and friends only?  Friends of friends who aren't acquaintances but whose face one knows and maybe their name, too?  A particular cashier at one's usual grocery store or a waitress at a restaurant one goes to often?"

"I'm at that point right now. She's too clingy, so I'm used to being constantly obliged to be there for her. The second she goes to work, it's like a giant sigh of relief. I can actually talk to my friends without her being jealous, I can do what I want without someone making me feel bad for it. She's toxic. I told her I'm doing what I want from this point on and I'm leaving her if she can't grow up and be okay with giving me space."
"Ah yes, who is gonna sleep in the cuddle puddle?"
"Agreed on not starting out preemptively mentioning sexual advances. In my experience, adult guys generally will see a woman in their home environment  as falling under ""bro"" or some sort of neutral category. Though it depends on the emotional maturity of these guys, some young guys can delude themselves quite easily. 

I would say being prepared for the dudes not seeing her as sexual, and being very ""comfortable"" around her as such. Boxers, general immodest behavior, maybe stinking more in the summer then you'd be accustomed to with guys in professional settings. 

Ground rules for cleaning common rooms, kitchen and bathroom is critical. ADDRESSING DIRTY DISH CLEANING IS A MUST! Many live in friendships have unraveled over that."
"If you're just casually dating and not in a relationship, I wouldn't think too much of it. 

That being said, everyone has different independent/needy levels - with previous women you've dated, when you were in the flirting stages did you miss them if you didn't see them for a week? Or would that not be a big deal to you minus the travel?"
and they are also already in a relationship

"Don't worry, you don't want those girls.  My sister is genuinely the cream of the crop. Gorgeous, has always had guys chasing her, smart, funny, hard working, well-educated. Basically the whole package. She married a guy 1 inch shorter than her. Why?
Because if she genuinely is the cream of the crop, she is smart enough to know that you don't grow old with someone's height, you grow old with their personality."

"They post things like this on Facebook:

Instead, they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground that aren't as good, but easy. So the apples at the top think there is something wrong with them, when, in reality, they are amazing. They just have to wait for the right boy to come along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree."
"Yeah, a couple years ago I went to my doctor after more than a decade of struggling with depression and anxiety (both diagnosed).  I told my doctor I was having too much difficulty with feeling anything but miserable.  He just told me to wait it out and I didn't need a referral to a counselor or psychiatrist.  I was so upset, I felt betrayed, I felt like my doctor sent me a death sentence by suicide.  

Luckily I happened to have to go to the hospital for a week for exasperated symptoms from my stomach disease.  I told the doctor there about my mental and emotional well being and was able to get help during the remainder of my stay, and for a few weeks after I was discharged."
"The girl I'm dating Right now leaves left over food on her living room table for days. Or she'll leave it in the fridge and not eat it, then order the exact same thing again.

"Public transit is a necessity, most don't see it as social hour."
"Went to a bar that was essentially an old fashioned speakeasy. It was a really neat atmosphere, like a library but with drinking. The drink list was hidden in old encyclopedias and all the drinks were named after fictional characters. Anyhow, I went with a group of friends and ordered a drink, not being fully aware of what it was I had asked for. 

When they were finished it was one of the girliest looking drinks I'd ever seen. It was light pink, slightly frothy, and came in a champagne saucer. One of the girls, believing I had made a mistake, offered to switch with me for what looked like a generic whiskey-based cocktail. I gave her the most confident look I could muster and said, ""No thanks, this is what I ordered."" and sipped down that pink, alcoholic smoothie. It was really good and I still get it every now and again, but their ""Drizzt"" absinthe cocktail is still my favorite."
You do not want to see naked Texans. Its like a mass whale beaching but more tragic. 
"The idea that there really isn't that much support for you out there when you're in a rough spot in life. Men are expected to just be strong, pick ourselves up and carry on without complaint. However, it's far harder to do that than women think and there will come a time when you could really use someone to talk to or a service to help you out but there is nothing available for men in your area."
"My wife has been my roommate since 2002.

"""Mulan the fuck up"" is a hilarious way to say man up for girls lmao"
"I agree with all of these, and would like to add

Buy a white board (or whatever easy to read, to write on, and in the common space) on which the schedule is written. If you schedule cleaning, try that everyone does a different thing each time, so people won't have the idea that they are doing the worst part.

Talk a lot with them about the things that matter to you. The problem I had the first time I had roommates was not talking enough to them to what should be done and when."
"Being totally and completely unwanted in the dating world, in every possible way.

Yes I'm aware some women are ugly and get little attention. But little attention is different than no attention. There are lots of bottom tier dudes who experience:

- never having a girl reciprocate their interest in real life. Literally no girl at the bar or club or wherever even bothering to say hi back, let alone show interest

- 0, and I mean 0, matches on dating sites. Swiping right on Tinder blindly out of desperation and checking in 12 hours to see that the only person who swiped right on you is a bot. Day after day after day after day.

- seeing your friends get sex and relationship experience while you don't even know what a vagina *looks* like, except in porn.

It stops being just about sex after a while. The existential despair begins to kick in. You start to feel less human. You start to feel literally invisible to half the world's population. You start to feel like if you're missing out on something considered to be one of the most profound experiences in life (romance), then what is even the fucking point of existing."
Nevermind. I think I was wrong. Sorry. 
"I don't understand it and wouldn't want to be involved in one.

However what consenting adults do with their personal lives is none of my business."
"I also live in New York and would almost never appreciate being hit on in the subway. If you're going to try, since obviously not all women feel the same about this as I do, I would suggest making it really casual, like making a general comment and seeing if she's interested in being talked to in the first place. It's not like a bar where you could open with something a little more forward. "
"i had a girl try to get me to chase her recently. i work at a gym and trained her occasionally, and she wanted to hang out with me and made it very obvious that she wanted me, but when i pursued she backed away immediately. so i stopped. same thing happened a couple weeks later. then i just was like lol fuck that. eventually she stopped training but she would come in to my work only during hours i was there and always wearing skimpy clothes and making eye contact with me. she did this 5 or 6 time and it was so obvious and i just flat out ignored her. so immature. 

now i'm with someone who i never have had to chase, and it's just so great"

"A lot of young guys either think that with the right line and approach, any woman will be into them, or they think no matter what, the right gal will eventually see how great they are. 

Both are damned lies.

A lot of men think the responsibility is 100% on them to make it happen once interest is known and if something doesn't happen with a gal they desire, they did something wrong like the gal was preordained to be with them and they dropped the ball. Because of that, they don't know how to set proper boundaries and let go of women they're attracted to and move on - which behind upgrading your money are the best ways of keeping your appeal.

A lot of young guys also don't get how to respectfully engage their sexuality. I'm talking about being interested in whatever type of relation they want, but not being a dick about it.

Sadly, many guys don't get that sex won't completely fill that need for validation, but it sure will pass the time."
"Some of them are but those are the ones with hobbies, friends and opinions of their own. They also communicate and compromise like adults. "
"For me it's when I start to get frustrated about small things. I'm not really the type of person who gets frustrated about anything, things either have solutions and you deal with them or they don't and you move on from them. When the frustration starts to show I know I need to take a couple of days and just unwind. If I don't the frustrations just turn to anger and I'm not a fan of being angry about stuff. "

"Around age 18 I started to really want to lose weight.  Got into running, ate well.  Didn't know what I wanted to do in life, so I said ""fuck it"" and took some cheap engineering classes at the community college.  I was, for once, working towards something I was actually proud of even though I thought I would probably eventually fail out.  I ended up finishing that and transferring to a 4-year and later finishing that too.  But when I went from a pudgy kid with no real direction in life to a fit kid working on an engineering degree, I liked me better.  At the university, women started hitting on *me*, which was a 180 from basically being a hermit in high school.  At one point a mutual friend who I never even thought about dating since she was so ""out of my league"" basically threw herself at me.

One was that noone is allowed to wake mommy up on the weekend until the clock says ""one zero zero zero"".

If ""one zero zero zero"" came by and mom still wanted some more time in bed, the kids would want to play The Pillow Game!  This game was played by lining up against the wall and having mom throw pillows at you from the bed and see if she could knock you over.

It was actually pretty fun, and it gave Aunt Ellen lots of bed time on Saturday and Sunday mornings if she had too much fun the night before."

"Late 20's checking in. I wish early 20's women found me as attractive back when I was their age as they seem to find me now. Funny thing is, I ended up taking a step back financially recently, so I was much more stable (money wise at least) back then, but I got a few gray hairs I can tell them stories about myspace and the thong song...so I guess that makes them wanna fuck me?"
