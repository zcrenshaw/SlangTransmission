"I use to live downtown in a condo.  I got on the elevator one day, mindlessly, thinking of nothing but going up to my place and relaxing after a very hard week.  Suddenly, the doors to the elevator open, and inside stands a very good looking blond.

Without thinking, I made some stupid statement like 'thank god it's friday, right?'

She responds, rolling her eyes some and says ""you have no idea""

I then ask ""got any good plans for the weekend?""

I can still see the next few seconds in slow motion.  She pauses, turns to face me, looks me up and down, and says ""No, I don't have any plans at all for the entire weekend.  God what I'd give to have something fun to do"".

The doors then open to my floor of the building.  I'm sure I stood there like a deer in headlights.  I started desperately grasping for things to say, but was all out of small talk.  I opened my mouth, but the only words that came out were ""well, that sucks, I hope you end up making plans!""

I then got off the elevator and walked to my unit.  I'm retarded sometimes.

"I can't even imagine the pain you must be going through right now and my sincere internet hugs to you.

To answer your question, reddit is not the place where you'll find help with how to cope with this. Look for professional help, a good therapist will be able to help you get your life back on track. For now, just remember it's fine to feel terrible, she was a huge part of your life and don't let anyone decide when you're ""over her death"", you're the only one who can decide that."

"In France, there's an april's fool tradition for children to stealthily stick paper fish on people's backs.

"When I was set to graduate, I discovered they had changed the requirements and I had a missing credit. It was a simple class I had already taken the advanced one.

They just gave me the class credit so I could graduate."

"When me and my brother were around 7(?) we lived in an apartment complex and had gotten bikes for Xmas.

We were out riding and at one point gone inside for a minute leaving our bikes out front.

Go back out and my brothers bike is gone. We knew who it was as there was this one shit kid always pulling crap.

Go over to his apartment and both he and his mother answer the door and we say that he took our bike.

His fucking mother looked to us, said it was his bike, looked to him and congratulated him on ""His new bike.""

Needless to say, my father went over and immediately got my brothers' bike back .

Now, I'd rather hit the gym in the morning, or get all my errands done before noon so I can enjoy the rest of the day without being miserable from the night before.
This may be a little drastic, but I've also distanced myself from the group of friends that go out every weekend. Find something you just love doing, and stick to it. I love playing video games and hitting the gym, so I do it everyday. If you don't like drinking every weekend, then don't; you're not obligated to. I'm not saying completely cut your friends off, but just let them know you'd feel better doing something else. If they're really your friends, they'd understand. "

On the one hand I see the need for a place to be able to do the stuff you want to do without having to deal with flirting and ogling guys.

So I've decided the subject is too nuanced for me to actually care that much because women having their own place doesn't hurt anyone and it pretty much devolves into a non-issue the more I think about it."

I was an active participant in every class, turned in all homework, stopped by his office 5 days a week to get help, and did any and all extra work that I could. I generally worked my fucking ass off in that class, but I still had a really hard time with the material. My professor recognized the work I was putting in and did me a solid by giving me a good grade. Never really liked him as a professor (didn't like his teaching style and I found him incredibly arrogant), but I still appreciate the hell out of him for that. "

"https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/

&gt; Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

&gt; I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

&gt; As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

&gt; In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

&gt; Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

&gt; Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.

Truth is there is no immediate advice to give you. You need to go through the process of grieving. The sense of profound loss will follow you around. Ten years is a long time. That's ten years of cherished memories."

"I am a 29/F who has yet to still finish her Nursing BA. Three times, while in college, I've gotten cancer. The first time when I first started and the second 2 semester into re-starting and a 3rd time the end of my 1st semester back. It's come to the point where I'm terrified of going back to school because I'm scared I'll get cancer again. I know it's a silly belief but I just...feel that way. So to answer your question, if I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to not be scared and to keep on pushing.

edit: I just realized that this is on AskMen...I am NOT a man. FML"
"Leadership builds lust. Neediness kills lust.

You can get further with her in one night of flirting than one year of being her friend. 

An ounce of having the balls to make a move is worth more than a ton of listening to her talk (complain?) about guys she's dating.

If she keeps flirting, texting and contacting you but *always* flakes out of meeting up: she's using you for her attention and you should move on. Double-time if she's in a relationship with someone else.

Don't give her boyfriend-level attention if she doesn't give you girlfriend-level affection.

Don't act like a faithful husband if she just wants a fun boyfriend. Or if you do want that, find a girl who is also serious.

Girls make rules for guys they don't want. Girls break their own rules for guys they want.

If she always seems to be near you or she always seems to linger and never leave, ask her out. She might like you.

If you ask her out, treat anything she says that's not ""Yes"" as a ""No."" Don't get stuck in a rejection loop with one girl.

Touch her throughout the date if she's receptive. For example, put your hand on her lower back as you enter and exit the restaurant. Makes it easier to go for the kiss later.

If she says it, it's on her mind. If it's on her mind, it's on the table. Example: ""I'm not the kind of girl who does [blank]."" There's a high probability if it goes well, she'll do [blank] with you later that night.

The biggest erogenous zone is in her mind. Symbols, metaphors, innuendo and the right kind of dirty talk can do more for her in bed than your size.

The secret to sex is more tension, not more comfort. Sexual *tension*, not sexual torpor. Why you shouldn't do it is exactly what makes it hotter. 

Don't shy away from talking about political difference, racial difference, age gap, etc. Those are often the very things that will turn her on. If you can joke about it, even better. 

Dare her to prove you wrong. What women find irresistible: the chance to prove a guy wrong, especially the one she likes.

If she shows last-minute hesitation:

* Be confident

* Take the burden of responsibility off of her

* Indicate you're not judging her (this is a *huge* deal for girls)

* Escalate normally as if she hadn't said anything. Sometimes that's enough and you don't need the previous bullet points.

* And of course back off and bail if she doesn't want to go further.

Sample things to say (confident delivery matters more than the words):

""That's okay, I'm naughty enough for both of us."" 

""It's okay to let yourself go sometimes.""

""Tonight doesn't count."" Let her mind fill in why: we were drinking, you're from out of town, she's on vacation, whatever.

If it's a new relationship and you've hooked up with her a few times: when you're out of bed, remind her of a specific detail. Something she would associate with sexy times. A special naughty secret only you two would know. Make it a secret game for only the two of you. Remind her of it through spoken words, written words, pictures and text. Never let her forget how naughty she can be when she's with you.

Look at how her mother treats her father. It could be a preview of how your relationship with her is going to go.

If she wants to take a ""break,"" see other people, open the relationship, etc. 90 percent of the time, she's already cheating or she at least already has a specific guy in mind. The relationship is already over, but she wants to make an attempt on the other guy and for you to be the safety net if she fails. Respect yourself and don't be someone's Plan B. Be her first choice or nothing.

Don't let anyone try to isolate you from family and friends.

Don't try to save a damsel who secretly loves her distress. Try to be a knight and you'll fall on your sword and the damsel will run back to her dragon (bad ex-boyfriend).

If you broke up with her and she won't stop contacting you: sometimes it's better for her to think you're an asshole than for her to think she still has a chance to get back together.

Get married to your mission and make women your mistress. Women often don't want to be the center of your world, it's too much pressure. 

Confidence isn't believing you'll always succeed. Confidence is knowing failure won't break you."
How little sexual attention we get.
"The problem is many people are co-dependent.  They get into relationships not because they really think it's a good fit, but because they're basically psychologically dependent on having someone there supporting them.  This causes people to start or stay in very unhealthy relationships they probably shouldn't be in.  So the recommendation if they want to have healthy relationships going forward is to learn how to not depend on someone else for your own emotional well being.

They're not saying that being single is better than being in a relationship.  They're saying that in order to have a healthy relationship, you need to have your shit together emotionally."
Not with that attitude 
"Well it was just temporary. 

I have a fairly basic fetish thing - I'm really turned on by my wife dressing slutty, like thigh highs, etc, and kinda acting out a whore/porn star role. 

Well after our baby, I was excited to get our sex life back - but she was having a really hard time getting into that ""character"". But she didn't really tell me that, I just noticed she was never up for that anymore, and barely up for sex at all. 

Finally we had many discussions and past of her issue was just being in ""mom mode"" so it was hard to get into ""sexy wife mode.""

Many talks later things got a bit better. "

They wouldn't listen but... school is a big fucking deal. Pay attention and work hard. The system is designed to favor the middle so you'll do great if you just do the fucking work.
"I've dealt with this, and it can be a really frustrating situation. Too often, the only advice people will give you is to break up with them. But what do you do when your SO is a wonderful person, but just happens to be on their phone a lot and it happens to bother you?

Communication is a big key. You need to be blunt. Sit down with them and tell them WHAT is bothering you, HOW it makes you feel, and WHY it makes you feel that way. It's easy for a conversation like that to turn south when the other person feeling like you're attacking them, when they're usually just trying to entertain themselves. Basically, you need to do something more than just criticize them and try to make them feel like shit. You also need to understand that if you're going to ask them to stop being on their phone so much, you need to be able to tell them that you are going to work on not being bothered so much about them being on their phone. This kind of thing works two ways, make no mistake. You will have the greatest amount of success when you compromise when asking others to do the same.

After you've talked to them about the problem, *you need to recognize when they are trying*. Give it a day or two, and then compliment them and let them know that you have noticed their effort in trying to be better, even if the effort is very small. Often, praise can be a huge motivator for people to keep them on the right track.

After a few weeks or a month, review. Sit down with your SO and tell them what you've seen over the past month, and how it's affected you personally. Let them know that their efforts have made you happier and that you feel have strengthened the relationship."
"When we were freshmen in college my suitemates and I befriended some junior transfer students in our dorm, who invited us to off-campus parties where we were always the only freshmen there.  Much fun was had.  One time though one of the girls whose apartment we were at tried to haul my friend, who was very *very* drunk, upstairs.  He didn't want to go, and at the foot of the stairs he was leaning back against her pulling him by the wrist with both hands.  It was the kind of thing, if I saw it today, I would intervene immediately, but that was 1993 and not one of us had the internal vocabulary to process it.  A woman could be raped by a man, a man could be raped by another man, but we didn't even have a concept of a woman raping a man.  Something deep inside me was unsettled, but I couldn't process it.  I was a little drunk myself, which wasn't helping me make any big leaps in ethical thinking.  I just nervously laughed like my other friends.  She relented, but I'm pretty sure it waa because people were laughing and it was starting to be humiliating how hard he was struggling to not go upstairs with her.  We continued to hang out with that crowd, but I kept my distance from her from then on.

The absolute worst thing about this memory is my 100% certainty that if he had allowed himself to be dragged up there, we would have teased the shit out of him for days for hooking up with her.  Remembering your own ignorance is painful."

We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, ""10101000101"", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright.

We gonna knock the hell out of ISIS, believe me. Thank You, Thank you, Thank you.

"Senior year of high school we had a student teacher in English class. Naturally everyone had already checked out and wasn't paying attention. Me and 3 friends were talking too much in the back and the real teacher grabbed us and brought us out into the hallway.

In reality i don't care, i know you guys have checked out. But can you please just be quiet for the last 20 minutes of class.""

A lot of women don't realize this and take it to mean that we don't care about the problem. Thats because we often dont realize that women usually are looking to vent, not get a solution. 

For most men, we only get emotional with something if we dont know how go fix the problem. Women on the other hand don't even need to be presented with a problem they can't fix, or any problem at all sometimes to get emotional about it. I understand this now...but god is it frustrating anyways. "
"I don't go out of my way to approach someone in public. However, if I'm near them I make an effort to talk to them if the situation is right.

ex: I was in Scotland and on a train to the capital. There was a pretty girl sitting in the isle next to me. I talked to her for the duration of the train ride.

ex: I'm at the gym and there's an attractive girl working out next to me. Don't even bother trying to talk to her.

ex: at a crowded coffee shop with no open seat and see someone sitting alone. Ask if I can sit for a little bit. Might talk to them if they seem open/friendly.

ex: eating at chipotle and see someone eating alone and reading a book/listing to music. usually just leave alone and enjoy my meal.

I think being able to distinguish the situation matters the most. Just be friendly and know if they want/don't want to talk."

"On her phone too much, if she's spending half the date texting her friends and checking social media she's clearly not that interested in even being here. 

I've walked out of a date once because she was ignoring me to text people and only giving yes/no or one word responses. Pretty clear she wasn't actually interested, she didn't even look up from her phone when I said ""yeah this isn't going anywhere"" and got up and left. 

Checking other people out on the date. I have enough respect to keep my eyes to myself/on you for a date, is the same courtesy too much to ask in return? Not just a quick peak because that does happen, but full on oggling other dudes so hard your eyes look like they're going to fall out.

She did this cute puppy look while the folded piece of paper was still on her lips, I hesitated taking it but I took it nonetheless.

"This is such a dumb Reddit cliche. Have you actually read those posts? Most of them feature genuinely horrifying, insurmountable problems. Not to mention if you're complaining about your relationship to online strangers, it's usually pretty far gone. 

Edit: People who disagree, go on r/relationships right now and browse the front page or two. Do you see anything resembling a chorus of ""DIVORCE *IMMEDIATELY*"" being suggested to minor problems? 

The *real* r/relationships cliché is that they suggest therapy for *everything*. Therapy is all well and good but that sub seems to think adults can't work through minor issues without a counselor involved. They genuinely think everyone has the time and money for not one, but multiple therapists. My favorite example of this is when they counseled an unhappy married couple to get a therapist for the husband, a therapist for the wife, *and* a couple's therapist. "

"I can see how it would be a deal breaker (and also how it's a turn on)- as someone who is very ticklish I've had this issue pop up a few times. I'm currently dealing with it in my relationship, actually. I still don't know how to balance my fear/reduction in sexuality, and his affinity for tickling.

In my experience, guys really enjoy tickling me. They like that I'm laughing, the sounds, the squirming. For them, it is fun and sexy. For me, it is scary and wildly uncomfortable. I say outright that I hate tickling, it's uncomfortable, almost painful, not fun, not sexy, just instills fear in me and makes me afraid of their hands. It literally instills panic and fight or flight mode. But it's rarely taken seriously and they'll usually test the barrier of how much they can tickle me. Then eventually it leads to difficulty being aroused even in sexy situations because instead of thinking about him touching me sexually, all I can do is think about where his hand is and if they're going to tickle me.

Sorry for the long post OP - I wish you luck in finding someone you can share that with!"
"Taking ""the college experience"" a bit too seriously and thinking that life ends after college. I could have networked better with professors or maybe spent more time reading good books. The truth is that for people who life right, it only gets more fun after college. I managed to move to a major city about 3 years after graduation, parties I went to were way better, girls I ran into a lot hotter, and people I met a lot cooler.

I took too much life advice from losers who amounted to nothing in life after college rather than taking life advice from winners who made something out of their lives. The losers who amounted to nothing are the ones who will come on here, talk about how much life after college sucks, and convince you how life ends after college while they moved back in with their parents and couldn't even get a job."

"I wouldn't say people promote being 'alone'. It's more common to promote individual happiness because happiness in a relationship is not fully in your control and may be fleeting.

If you're happy on your own, you have more power. You have the power to decline if someone wants to be with you and you think they aren't a good fit. If you think you can only find happiness in a relationship, that leads to a lot of desperation and usually ends badly.

"I would tell them that ""doesn't matter, had sex"" is pure bullshit. Sometimes it is so lousy that in hindsight you would prefer not to have done it. There's no need to push through your own misgivings or revulsion just to add another notch. And it won't magically cure your ""foreveralone"" feelings either — a week after a drunk hookup you will feel the same as before. Sex can be fantastic and validating and rewarding, but it needs to be done right and under the right circumstances, it isn't anything *in and of itself*.

"My biggest missed connection was with the guy who fixed the smoothie maker. My theater had one behind the cafe and it was broken so they called a guy to fix it. He was my age, very cute, and we had a blast. He was back there cleaning up the smoothie maker and getting it back to working order, as that back cafe is only one person wide, we were in pretty tight quarters. I think only 3 customers the whole time, too. He was there for maybe an hour. He was done and I should've asked for his number.

Next week at the same time I worked the week before, he came with his friends (very much out of his way) to see if I was there. I had left a few hours before. And never heard from him since.

I still wonder what would've happened with him, we definitely hit it off and he'll always be 'the one that got away.'

But it's all good, I met my current boyfriend a few months later. And I still like him several years later."

My ex then said ""It's ok, just don't ever get like that again because that looked really bad and I'd have to dump you"". It just came off as so insensitive and an unnecessary jab at my ego.

"Myself.

I grew up being told I was special, and not just by people close to me. It was pretty common for me to impress adults I was introduced to. A very common thread was that people expected me to be wildly successful.

Fast forward a few years and I'm a college dropout who can't hold down a retail job. My social life was in the shitter and because of that I surroundes myself with shitty people. I was constantly having to borrow money from my parents to pay bills. Things, surprisingly, went down hill from there.

"My teacher kind of did the same for me. I took 3 years of Spanish. In the first semester of the first year, I had a 66, which was a failing grade. I had a 77 for the second semester which I thought averaged above a 70, therefore I should get credit for the class. I went on to take Spanish 2 and 3 with another teacher (one who was actually good) and made A's in both. I finished Spanish 3 my sophomore year and I think I'm done with it forever.

When I got my class schedule for my senior year, they had me placed in a Spanish 1 class. Of course I raised he'll about it but my teacher told me if I take the midterm and pass it right now, the school can credit me for the class. I went by after school on the first day and hammered out the test and got like a 98 and got to drop the class. "

"In high school I dual enrolled at the local community college because the high school let us double dip on credits through some program. I took Japanese because it fit my schedule and I thought the language was interesting. 

The class was about half people just checking boxes for credits, and half your typical weeaboos. Most of the weeaboos dropped the class pretty quick when they learned that watching anime hadn't properly prepared them. 

I kept the fact that I was a high school student a secret because at the time I thought people would think I was lame. Towards the end of the semester the professor suggested that we should consider joining the Japanese Culture Club. I planned on continuing to take Japanese so I signed up but the semester ended before any meetings. I figured the club would be mostly just a few Japanese students and other people taking the language classes like me. So I spent the break practicing so I wouldn't make a fool out of myself when trying to speak to native speakers and students in higher level courses. 

So I show up to the first meeting and it was not at all what I expected. Going around the room there was:

The professor and his wife (the only Japanese people there).

Late 30s white guy with a mullet and bandana (later discover he has some serious yellow fever).

Recent home school graduate who thought he was the single smartest human on the planet (also made part of a game on RPG Maker one time and claimed to have a job offer from Blizzard).

A gay furry complete with fox ears and collar (pretty self explanatory).

Bi anime super fan and her girlfriend who dressed in full cosplay every meeting (different one every meeting).

Former army brat who had actually spent a few years in Japan.

Despite being the most socially awkward group of humans ever assembled, the meeting went well enough that I decided to keep going if not just because I couldn't look away from this train wreck. Also the professor and his wife were amazing cooks which helped.

Unfortunately a few meetings in the professor let it slip that I was 16 and the whole dynamic changed. Formerly the super fan couple had been fawning over the furry, homeschooled guy was jealous, and me and army brat practiced Japanese and talked about nerd shit while creepy guy was creepy. Suddenly I found myself being called variations of ""little shota prince"" by the super fans and it became clear they were trying to play out some anime harem fantasy. 

Being a 16 year old highschool kid I briefly considered my options before firmly deciding nothing good could come of this. Luckily I only had to deal with it for a meeting or two before the professor threatened to kick them out and go to the Dean it got so bad. They stopped, but the meetings were very awkward after that. I finished out the year but decided to stop taking Japanese. 

Me and army brat kept in touch for a bit and I got to hear about some of the events after I left. A few Japanese students actually joined for a short while which resulted in yellow fever guy making some unacceptable propositions and being ejected. Super fan couple broke up mid meeting in a pretty dramatic way and only one of them came after that. Homeschooled guy started hitting on her hard and left crying after being rejected and never came back. Furry guy started bringing his extremely Mormon boyfriend. After that I kinda lost touch.

I should go check out the club's Facebook page to see if I can find any of their profiles and see what they're up to now. Man I've been sitting on that story for almost a decade."
"He is waiting to see if you are someone he can show weakness to without it ruining the relationship dynamic.

Most young women are not, at all, mature enough for that, so its likely he's had some bad experiences with opening up to women in the past.  "
"I'll be honest, your current ex sounds the worse one. Her reply pissed me off too. "
"Society is not crumbling because of the destruction of the nuclear family or lack of gender roles. *Rolls eyes. 

But yes both men *and* women being willing to take risks on someone they really like does make for better relationships. "
"As a man, you do not let your guard down - ever. 

I would say the only place it is acceptable to let your guard down is in front of a good, trusted, male peer. 

I think that every man has been in a relationship with a woman who kept going on and on about wanting him to ""open up"" and he refused. 

Then, some crushing defeat happened in his life, or depression crept in, and just as he had been told by the girl in this relationship that he could ""open up to her"" the moment he did, is the moment the relationship started to end. 

I'm not going to postulate either way on why this happens (although I have my own theories) I will simply say that most guys have noticed it has happened and many guys have noticed it happens almost predictably. 

I'm not saying you can't show vulnerability, but you have to do it from a position of power. 

For example...lose your job?

What you really want to do is yell, scream, cry, complain. 

What you ACTUALLY do is say, ""I'm really upset, I'm worried... but I'll make it through this. We'll come out on top.""

*This* is the kind of vulnerability or ""opening up"" in relationships I think girls *actually* mean. 

It's that - shed a tear on your way to battle vulnerability, not bury your head in her lap and cry for hours like a five year old fucking child, punch a hole in the wall, and complain bitterly about life in general. 

What I notice is a ""fall from grace"" when this happens. 

So, men - more or less - must always have their guard up, lest they lose the respect and admiration of their women. 

That doesn't mean being dishonest or not saying ""I'm upset"" but it definitely means you can't *actually* display the weakness you feel. 

A woman can display those types of sweeping vulnerabilities - crying, mood swings, talking so someone will ""just listen"" - and nobody will think less of them. 

Yet, despite what people say (especially whatever significant other you may have) about ""seeing the real you"" once it's on display, it's almost always immediately accompanied by a complete loss of respect, unless you're being vulnerable or open from a position of power. I.e. ""I feel this, I'm scared, I'm worried - but I know I will make it through this"" even if you don't believe a goddamned word of it and all you really want to do is cry yourself to sleep.

&gt;Co-directors of the group said restricting fraternity membership to only males is a form of sex discrimination. The group does not have an official position on whether sororities should be gender-integrated as well.

I have a large issue with the government funding events or groups for women only, while ignoring men that are in equal or greater need. The obvious reason is that the government does not (should not) have the right to discriminate against men. The government is supposed to help all of society.

E.g. http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/british-columbia/38-new-drug-treatment-beds-for-women-1.3950301

&gt;The B.C. government is partnering with Vancouver Coastal Health to open 38 new beds for women seeking help for substance abuse in the city's Downtown Eastside.

Despite the fact that men are far more in need than women:

&gt;A total of 914 people died of a drug overdose in B.C. last year. Of that, 176 were women."

"I dunno, could've just barged in, thrown them out and when they hammered on the door, dad could've just stood there going""I like my new house"". Even if it's illegal, it makes for a damn hilarious mental image, like sending LDS folks to a Scientologists house."

"We teach to the middle because that's where most of the students are. We have most students all lumped together rather than grouped by level. One end of the bell curve isn't being challenged and is bored, and the other end is struggling to keep up or isn't making any effort at all."

"I was an intern at a US embassy in Europe a couple years ago. I don't remember the exact way we met, but somehow I ended up getting to know an intern at the Canadian embassy. We hung out a few times going to museums or to get coffee. I don't think it even counts as a missed connection because it never seemed romantic, but I thought of it because after we each left the city we fell out of touch and I've never been able to contact her since. We each had phones and emails provided by our embassies which shut off after we left, she wasn't on any social media, and she had a pretty common name so any time I've ever tried to look her up on the off chance she got on FB or something I haven't found her. It would be nice to reconnect and reminisce about our time there. "

"&gt; Started trying to become more in shape. Realized drinking was impacting that.

"I was a good student and a polite kid, but I would always skip class and fell behind in my last 2 years of school. In those last few years I lost all motivation to do anything, I barely left the house and my attendance across the 2 years was 30%.

My design teacher knew I was going to flunk school, and one day in my last few months of school he asked another teacher to cover his class for one period. He then asked me to come with him for a chat, and we ended up walking for the entire morning (we ended up outside the school and walked all across town) where he told me it was not going to be the end of the world, that I'll soon figure life out, and that as long as I was happy in the job I find myself in that was all that was important.

10 years later I still haven't figured out what job I want, but I have one I'm happy in, and pays enough for me to backpack the world a couple months a year, which is all I want in this world.

I did what I could, and she asked me to stay after while she graded it on the spot. Got a 70%, but she gave me a...whatever I needed to stay at an A in the class.

I broke up with her after 2 weeks but she keeps clinging after me. Everyone thought I was an asshole but you know what?

Your life may seem kind of lame now, but you'll have plenty of time for socializing after you graduate and have a nice job that pays you enough to do cool things.

"I used to ride my bike to baseball practice, and one time during practice I saw some kid running up the street with it (the hill was too steep to ride up). I ran after him, staying hidden about 50 metres behind, and saw which house he went in. I walked home and told my Dad, who drove me to the house to confront the parents. Dad spotted my bike in their backyard leaning against a shed, and proceeded to knock on the front door.

Dad: ""Did your son just come home with a bicycle?""
Parent: ""No, I don't know what you're talking about""
Dad: ""He just now stole it from the oval and ran off with it, about 25 people saw him do it. He brought it to this exact house.""
Parent: ""Nope he's been home all day""
Dad: ""The bike is in your backyard right now, return it immediately.""
Parent: ""Let me check""
*closes the door*
*door reopens 60 seconds later, parent pushing my bike*
Parent: ""He said he found it""
Dad: ""He ran away with it checking behind for witnesses""
Parent: ""He didn't know it belonged to anyone""
Dad: ""That's why he should have left it. You should probably teach your children that stealing is wrong.""
Parent: ""He didn't steal it, he thought someone had forgotten it.""
Dad: ""It still belongs to someone else-""
*Parent shuts door in Dad's face*

That's when I learned that bad people support other bad people, and that makes them think it's okay to do bad things. I wanted to be like my Dad, a good person helping other good people. He was also a firefighter.

-Be exceptionally late for a stupid reason.

 * Her eye contact is either a soul-violating stare or really evasive. She can't make regular eye contact.

 * She goes to bed late and gets up early. If that ""less sleep needed"" gene exists, she has it. She's a morning and a night person at the same time. Plus she wakes up by just opening her eyes and ""re-animating"". No lazing in bed, shuffling around, or shivers from the cold. Just asleep to awake in a blink.

Take time off to grieve. 

Death hurts beyond comprehensible explanation or understanding. Let your emotions ring out. You want to cry? Cry, and do so without any shame. You're going to feel angry too, and be angry. Don't let this rest- don't ever bottle your thoughts and feelings. Express them and make things easier, by letting the weight off your back. It's perfectly normal to be guilty, ashamed, tearful, and ignore anyone, any man, any woman who says otherwise. I speak from similar experience. Don't keep this bottled, please. 

Take solace in your family, your loved ones, trustworthy friends, any safe circle of people you can call home. Isolation and loneliness are painful, so ease this by allowing people to occupy you with their warmth and love. 

Allow time to take its root. There will be days when you will be crying on end- there will be others where you will hate everything and the world for taking away your beloved. Losing something so beautiful and precious can never be forgiven, but you have to forgive yourself. Don't take this out on yourself. Don't echo that pain across your bones, because before this, your girlfriend loved them to an unmeasurable extent. You were her world, the reason to wake up, her lover, her partner, her everything. Live on in her memory, as the man she fell in love with. Talk to counselors, or a voice who is welcoming and will protect your pain from others.
 
Please don't do this alone. This will take years to overcome, and even then, it will hurt. Take her memories, every hug she ever gave you, every kiss, every time she said ""I love you"" and treasure them somewhere within your heart. The time she spent with you will imprint itself in beautiful ways over the years to come, and she will always love you in some way. 

Sincerest condolences, 

TheAdventurousWriter."

"In regards to that retreat, I went to a Catholic high school and everyone was required to go on a religious retreat during their junior year.

But I've had a very different experience with organized religion than I think most Americans have had. I was raised in a Coptic Orthodox home and going to church was very social. It wouldn't be weird for me to spend 4 hours there on a Sunday. Spend around 2 hours in mass, 20 minutes after it talking to people, half an hour or so in Sunday school or religious discussions/meetings. Then an hour or two hanging out and getting food to eat.

There were Friday youth group meetings which were also very social. Which is, yes, how I spent a lot of my Friday nights during high school. 

The whole god thing was the background to my social life but it's not like I was religious or anything. Neither were most of the people in that group. "

"I'm not sure it 100% fits in with the question but it kinda does and I've been wanting to tell this story for a while as I found it very cringe worthy when I thought more about it later in the day. 
A couple of years ago I used to work in a retail store, usually only in the back doing menial jobs while almost everyone else worked the store front, but people would constantly be coming to the back to chat,get off the floor for a few minutes, or just pop their head in before their shift started. 

It was around Christmas one year and one of the guys who'd been there a while had hung up some mistletoe between one of the double doors in the room that I'd spent most of my time. I'd always had to be one of the first people in to work to get started before other people had arrived so they'd also be able to have things to do when their shift started. It was still quite early in the day so there had been a couple of people already who'd shown their face and said their hello's but sometime after it'd died down a bit one of the nicer, more approachable girls came in and started a conversation about something. After a couple of minutes she points out the mistletoe and does the usual conversation of ""Who put that there?"", ""Has it caught anyone yet?"", the sort of stuff I'd talked with most people about before (I take it she just hadn't noticed up until this point). As I'm responding to her questions about it, she moves over to 'inspect' it while she's fiddling with the bobble in her hair.

Bare in mind please before I continue, when this was occurring I was in half-asleep mode doing something trivial like putting clothes on hangers so I wasn't thinking at all; I was in a rhythm. 

At this point, she's standing beneath the mistletoe looking up at it and her bobble falls out of her hands which she's taken out of her hair. I didn't notice when she did it but she then asked if I could pick it up for her as she couldn't pick it up with her nails. So, being the half-comatose gentleman that I am, I say ""Of course"" and walk over there and pick it up. The one strange detail I remember from the time was thinking that I was awkwardly close as she hadn't backed away and it was an weird personal space reaction I had almost immediately after reaching for it. As I stand up straight again after picking it up, I handed the bobble back to her and then did a small (but noticeable) jump backwards to back out of the personal space feeling I was I was getting.
She said ""Thanks.."" and then exited out the doors she was still standing in. I only realized what had happened as I was walking home because I still had this feeling of personal space violation.

"Read the classic novels, all of them. Learn that while your emotions are real, useful, and beautiful, you always have the capacity to control them using your reasoning abilities. Learn to frequently think about why other people are acting or saying what they are so you can begin to understand others.

"Yes. Back when I was single.

One woman in particular I thought was very attractive when I went out drinking with my friends one night. I walked up too her, introduced myself and asked her what her name was. I told her I had seen her from the table my friends and I were sitting at and asked if she and her friends would like to join us. Unfortunately she said she wasn't looking for a BF or anyone in particular at the time. She just wanted to be out with her girlfriends. I told her no harm, no foul. At least she let me know directly and didn't try to use me for free drinks.

But she did tell me it took guts to go over and talk to her, a complete stranger. I said if you don't try, you'll never get anywhere. She gave me a wave bye and a smile when she left, although I never saw her again."

I saw someone get high-fived after yelling at some religious church group people (I think they were selling baked goods to raise money for some earthquake in asia).

"I was a student at the time, there was some kind of last-day of school party going on and the music was really loud. I wasn't having much fun so I left and went back to my room to sleep.

On the way there I encountered a girl who was probably the most attractive around, and apparently also left the party. We had never spoken a word to each other before, but she spoke up: ""I'm going to my room to change, do you want to come along?"".

I was a bit puzzled, the girl dorm was really close by, and we weren't friends or anything, why would she want to be accompanied? I answered negatively and went on my way.

About an hour later: ""FUCK!"". Damnit, she was super hot! Never saw her again."

Or more seriously, it matters about as much as you let it mate. Your willy is a bloody small part of who you are (even more so in the winter months), it shouldn't define you or your relationships. Will the chaps who look like their dad was a horse have a different experience to those whose genetics prefer a more classical Greek approach? Yeah, just the same as blondes and brunettes, or chesty girls and their flatter mates, or chaps who enjoy a civilized game of rugby versus the barbarians who drool along and grunt their support for a game of footie. End of the day though, life's what you make of it. None of us got dealt a hand full of aces, ya maximize what ya got. Big todgers good for bragging rights and elaborate murders involving bludgeoning victims to death and confusing the poor coroner to no end - there's nothing a big ol' slab of meat can do that you can't match with ya fingers n tongue.

Truth is, most lads aren't hauling around a trunk in their pants but they're still living good lives. They date, they fuck, they marry, they hate their jobs, they have strong opinions about how stupid other people are, sometimes they're happy and sometimes they're sad. And yeah, in all of that sometimes they worry about their pricks - but they're never limited by the extra room in their undies (nascent career in fuck-flicks excluded).  It's a rite of passage that lads worry about their dick dimensions, and fuck knows most of us have side-eyed a bottle of coke and felt a little inadequate, but it leads to some important life lessons. You do the best with what ya have lad. And most things that haunt you - body issues, embarrassing moments, fears about what people think - are precisely that...yours. Very few people go through life noticing the things you think define you at your worst, most of the time you're bloody lucky to get noticed at all."

"Read more philosophy. Yes, I'm serious. Especially shit on Buddhism and Stoicism. To summarize in two sentences: Suffering is the difference between expectations and reality. To stop suffering, change one or the other.

Another method: realize that you are *choosing* to be angry. When you stub your toe and you feel a flash of boiling rage well up inside of you, when somebody cuts you off while driving and you get pissed off at them and curse them out in your car, when you drop a cup and spill a drink all over the floor and get so damn angry at this situation happening.

Then ask yourself: Is this helping? My anger did not make my toe hurt less, it did not make the other driver act more considerate, and it did not clean up the spilt liquid. My anger does not *get shit done*, it just makes me more emotional and bitter. My anger is actively hindering me from dealing with the situation.

Then realize: the negativity in this situation is the sum of 1) what happens, and 2) how I respond to it. In fact, most of the negativity is in how I respond to it. Either I can roll with the punches and say, ""Well, that sucks, now let's do something about it"" and have the situation resolved in under 2 minutes, or I can let 100 little things pull down my mood, so that a normal day ends up with me boiling inside by the time I get home, and I spend most of my day *wasting time* by being angry at things.

Finally, remember: you are *choosing* to be angry. That means you can *choose* NOT to be angry. This does not come automatically, or immediately. It requires months of practice of intentionally choosing to remain calm. But eventually, it will come naturally. And you will find that even if you have the same situation again: you stub your toe, you spill your drink, whatever, the situation will be much less negative, because you will simply accept that a thing has happened and then adapt yourself to move forward now."

"Winner by miles for me:

While I was at the mandatory school time, I had this amazing teacher is civics, religion, geography and history. I often talked to her and I was (and still am) friends with her daughter. I was also having a bit of a rough patch at home, as me and my mother fought a lot. So one day I get kicked out because of it (I said something like ""fuck you""). So while being kicked out I talked a bit to her daughter and answered looking for somewhere to sleep when she asked me what I was up to. After a few questions I get told to go to the outside of my school by her. Where her mother was waiting, her mother picked me up and let me stay there for as long as it was needed (I slept on a mattress in my friends room). Extremely nice of her to let me do that."

"I could honestly look at it in a few different ways, I don't see myself as attracted to ""damaged"" people specifically.

1: The guy has been through the same kind of pain and maybe sees a little bit of him in her and maybe thinks they can find some common ground.

2: The guy could going for an easy lay (this isn't always true) and may see the damage as a ""weakness"" to exploit.

3: Maybe the guy sees somebody who needs love and care and wants to be the one to help.

4: Perhaps even they dont recognize the person is damaged and maybe it's just a coincidence he happened to be attracted.

Edit 5: After reading some of the comments, another big one appears to be insecurity. Some people feel safer with someone who has been damaged because they may be less likely to harm them having been through whatever experiences said ""damaged"" person has endured. Or some believe they can't do better.


Just my two cents on what I think, attraction works in many different ways for  many different people so I can't list every one. Anyone else, feel free to add on or correct me :)"

"Told this story a couple of times. My ex-wife wanted to have kids and I did not. We discussed it a lot. She was never at the ultimatum stage and I was more open to the idea than I thought (in hindsight). Then one day I looked out my backdoor and saw my dog sitting on the deck. I loved that dog and she used to sit with her butt on the top step and her front paws on the next step down. Odd, but adorable. At that moment, my heart filled with an overwhelming sense of love for that dog and life in general. I realized right then that if I could experience those kinds of feelings for a dog, having a child would probably be another order of magnitude. I told my wife then that I was ready to have a kid.

I will say that despite that, I was scared to death when she finally told me she was pregnant. My kids are teens and I still have days when I wonder if it was the right thing for me. I am not one to sugarcoat what it is like to be a parent (you can see some of my older posts), but I will say I am quite happy to be a father.

Edit: Just realized you were asking men who did not have kids. Sorry about intruding. "

"Ok so this one girl i met on a dating app came over to my apartment for the first time. I mean it wasnt like a hookup app so I wasnt expecting to get laid.  But we ended up making out and eventually it led to that.  The crazy thing was she had such an amazing body, but for some reason i guess she was shy. We were making out on the bed, clothes on, her on top. I started taking her shirt off and as soon as i unbuttoned the last button she said she was shy and if i could close my eyes.. Mind you i had drank a couple beers before she came over to take the edge off of meeting someone for the first time. At first i was kind of like ok. Even though the lights were off and all we could barely see each other. She then proceeded to put a pillow on my face and said its so that i wouldnt cheat and have a sneak peak. She let me take the bra off. As she lay on top of me with the pillow on my face. The things going through my mind was like is this 50 shades of grey shit (she had previously told me she was reading the books) or is she going to suffocate me and rob me (as this was our first time ever meeting). At that stage in my life and because of the beers in my system i honestly didnt care what happened. When it came time to feel her chest she had like the best natural firm double dds ive ever felt. Eventually she takes the pillow off of me and we start to kiss and feel each other. I swear the buildup was the best i ever had. we get down to no clothes i get on top and we start having sex. And oh man she was so tight it surprised me. Im average sized down there and i still could not get all the way in. It was the most amazing feeling. That lasted all but only 3 minutes of actual penetration sex. Im usually not a quickie type guy. Ill last about 10 to 15 mins. But i swear to you releasing with this girl was the best orgasm i ever had."
