Just ride it out for a few years to be polite (I'm British) 
"I think the smart play is to always make a first date a coffee or a drink meet-up rather than a full on dinner. 

That minimizes your exposure to situations like this, since you can just have one drink then make a polite excuse to leave. 

Being rude about how (un)attractive someone is, even if you feel misled, is still a totally uncalled for thing to do. "
Her. She has to want to date me too.
"I haven't learned much that I didn't already know before. I guess the main thing I've realised is that men are also very insecure and want validation [about looks, sense of dress and other superficial things] too but tolerate not getting this the way women do because society expects them to go without it. Also, I will say, I think a lot of women THINK men love chasing, pursuing etc. but actually TBH I'm surprised how many men bemoan the lack of effort the women they are dating make, on here. [I always suspected the latter to be true TBH but this SubReddit confirmed it]. "
I didn't realize how much a woman initiating sex with her SO meant to so many men. I've been making a conscious effort to make sure my guy feels wanted as much as he does that for me after reading posts here.

"The suggestions you asked for:

* Tell him he's cute and ask if he lives in the house. Suggest to see his room.
* If you're dancing, tell him he's a good dancer and jokingly ask how much he'd charge for a private dance.
* The guys won't have experience with being initiated on. Don't take their awkwardness as rejection.
* Other girls aren't competition unless you're all going for the same ultra-hot guy.
* Most of the time though you'll be the only girl initiating and won't have much competition.

The suggestions you didn't ask for, but IMO need:

* Be careful. Remember you're 19 and they are likely in the same age range. You're all still figuring out how this stuff works.
* A hookup is a hookup and nothing more unless expressly stated. Don't expect a relationship or any measure of exclusivity. Some guys will even be inclined to hook up with someone else right after you. Have fun, be safe, and take time to think about your own feelings.
* Know and practice how to react to bad situations. He's lightly choking you without your permission, what do you do? He's trying to slip it in your butt, what do you do? He's going really hard, harder than you'd like - again, what do you do? He's talking super dirty and degrading, what do you do?
* Actually practice what you'd do/say in front of the mirror. Practice. Practice. Practice. You will enjoy your sex life a lot more if you know how to vocalize what you need. There are some genuinely bad people in the world who won't listen, but you can at least prepare for the guys who are simply dumb or have a different sex style than you.
* Along those lines, go partying with friends. Let them know what you're after and how they can check up on you without being a cockblock."
I keep stroking while it pumps out cum. It feels good. Once the cum stops pumping it immediately feels sensitive/painful.
"That's a bingo. Women claim they want you to be emotional and vulnerable, but in my experience what they think is emotional and vulnerable and what is actually emotional and vulnerable are two very different things. They want to hear that sometimes you get sad when you think about your childhood pet and that you occasionally miss your friends. They don't want to hear about how your depression is slowly crushing the life out of you and you're absolutely terrified that if she leaves you you'll never find another person to love you and you'll end up all alone drinking yourself to death. One glimpse of that guy and she's running for the hills saying how she ""sees you in a different light"" and her ""feelings have changed"" and she ""thought you were someone different"". So yeah, I'll tell her all about how I cried during Up, but it'll be a cold day in hell before I ever truly open up again. "
"I know, right? Imagine the uproar if a guy said he spent money on his girlfriend expecting sex in return, and when he didn't get it, he feels like he's wasted his time and money?!

@OP, is sex the only thing you care about? This is the same person you claim to love judging by your relationship post? You're the same girl who was arrogantly gloating about defrauding people's credit cards, and you're a drug addict enabler. Karma is a bitch they say!"

One i learnt not long ago that made me really sad was that men don't get enough friendly affection from women. So many men were starved for a woman to just compliment their outfit or tell them they looked good. Women get this often so i guess it never occurred to us that is was in high demand. I've made more of an effort to make such little comments since :)
"Recently a woman I rarely work with in my office smiled as she passed my cube. ""Nice shirt, is it new?"" she asked, to which I responded yes as she walked off. After she left, I ran to the bathroom to see if I had forgotten to remove a tag. THAT is how often we get unsolicited compliments from the opposite sex. "
"Go into the office and go tell everyone I'm leaving the company, tell them how much I appreciated working with them and how grateful I am, and especially my manager. I'd probably stick around to help my team finish the project which needs to be done by end of June. Then I'd leave amicably.

In my view, the ultimate badass is someone who chooses to be a grown-ass respectable adult man. "
Just keep going until the shame hits you bro
"Picnics are a awesome way to get one-on-one time with a lady. Sunshine, flowery field, munchies.... screams ""you got that loving feeling"". And if it rains... jackpot! 

I would be excited if she brought food that she made or thoughtfully selected. Even more so if it is actually good food. I would be much less excited if she just picked up McDs, BK, KFC, pre-made store crap, etc."

I was surprised how many men feel like they'll be rejected (by women) for showing vulnerable emotions. I had always took it that men hide those things because maybe other men made fun of them or something - like in the playground at school and whatnot - but it didn't occur to me they might actually think a woman would reject them for it. 
"My grandpa loved to nap in his chair with his feet up on a coffee table.


When we were kids we often ran around playing and would have to step over his legs, and every so often he wouldn't be asleep and lift up one of his legs causing us to trip and stumble. He thought it was hilarious.


It got to the point where'd we try and check if he was asleep by lightly poking him, whispering ""grandpa are you awake?"" or checking his eyes were actually closed. Having convinced ourselves he was truly asleep, we'd step over his legs only to have one raise up and catch our back foot causing us to eat shit and him to have this little smirk on his ""sleeping"" face."

"The one thing I've learned browsing different subs- AM, AW, TwoX, etc. is that men and women are really not that different.

I feel like the biggest hang up is that we occupy opposite extremes in how we are treated.

E.g. Women complain about getting too many vulgar of completely useless messages on dating apps; men complain about never getting messages. But I think both would prefer a few *quality*messages.

Women complain about sexual harassment, cat calling, etc. But, as a guy, we are never so much as complimented at all and we are pretty ""touched starved"". So I think both would prefer more *quality* physical affection.

Women are seen as too emotional and never taken seriously but men are seen as weak for showing any emotion other than anger. But both would like to have their emotions taken seriously and to feel free to express them.

Women are seen as chaste beings that are whores if they ever fuck anyone; men are seen as only ever thinking with their dicks. But both would probably like to have the fact that they enjoy sex be okay and to be seen as deeper people than just ""food. sex. sleep. video games.""

Women are seen as too irrational to make decisions and men are seen as alpha males that must be leaders. But both probably wish they could have control over situations where they are most knowledgeable and to feel safe to ask for help if they aren't. 

There are so many examples of this, and I feel like the largest paradox of boys vs. girls is that, really, we aren't *that* different. But we are treated as yin and yang and so we wind up seeing the other side's experience through our own lens.

Wouldn't it be great to be asked out on dates? Or to have my food paid for? Sure. But it would suck ass to have to worry about being raped and/or roofied. Wouldn't it be great to turn someone on so much that their genitals visibly extend and to receive lots of compliments? Sure. But it'd suck to have people yelling ""nice ass"" at you all day.

Tl;dr: We can't accurately evaluate the experience of the opposite sex through the lens of what we experience. 

That's the one thing I've learned through Reddit."
"Maybe 3-4 times a week on average there are times when we both just feel too tired for it. We both work full time and sometimes we finish late so when we get home we just want to order takeaway and watch a couple of episodes of Walking Dead or whatever we need to catch up on then go to bed. 

The sex is awesome but sometimes it's nice to just have a chat and watch something over a meal then maybe have a cuddle in bed until we both decide it's too hot and then roll to our own sides to sleep lol. "

"It has only been one date. Even if everything went to shit you're barely invested in this relationship, if you can call it that. Fortunately for you, she asked to go on a second date. Now if I were you I'd be excited about my second date with this lovely lady and not coming up with a million reasons for it to go wrong. Don't be your own worst enemy here. "
"I feel like the polite thing to do here, regardless of gender, is have the date, make conversation, split the bill and then let them know later (text, call, whatever) that you didn't feel a connection but you wish them the best. One could always shorten the length of the date by saying they've got work early in the morning, or they aren't feeling well, etc. if it was really bad. 

Edit to add: Someone who uses old and/or photoshopped photos on their dating profile obviously has some insecurity issues. There's no need to exacerbate them by saying ""Wow you look was less attractive than I thought, I'm outta here,"" because they know this already, hence using the inaccurate photos. I suppose it depends on how you feel about bringing other people down; personally I wouldn't be able to just shut the date down before it even began, because even if the person is ugly they don't deserve to be humiliated. Their penance would be knowing no second date was on the table. "
"The ""other side"" of the story in regards to US love culture I guess.

I had heard all the stories of women being bothered and randomly being asked out by strangers when they don't want it I guess. I just never quite made the realization that the side of the story for men is ""We have to put in all effort into ever forming a relationship"", not just sweat but also money.

From what I gather reading here, in the US a man is actually expected to dump 2000 USD on a ring at one point or the ""relationship isn't going anywhere"".

Made me appreciate the other side of the story of the guy ""bothering women""; ultimately the guy can't know in advance whether she'll be bothered and if no man did that any more apparently no new American babies are going to get made who can pledge allegiance and 6 and then join the army later to police the world."

Give them a story for the reader to attach to. You've got to learn how to push the reader's buttons and tug on their heartstrings. Like kill the protagonist's dog who he rescued from a shelter at a ripe old age. You've got to give some sort of relief. You've got to show off some sense of success.

"I was actually surprised to find guys are way *more* superficial than I assumed. I'm pretty unattractive, but grew up being told (by other girls, by adults, even by guys themselves) that ""inner beauty"" is what matters, and personality is what carries the day, and so long as you have confidence, not being gorgeous wasn't going to keep you out of a satisfying relationship.

Entering college I started to suspect this wasn't the case, but have gotten into *so* many arguments (again, with both men and women) that I started to think maybe my experiences were just weird. Reading this board, nope, all my experiences have been confirmed over and over again. Sure, ya don't need to be a perfect 10 model.... but personality ain't getting you *anywhere* without looks. I was actually pretty shocked to discover just how obsessed men are with physical female beauty, which is saying something, since I had already assumed it'd be in the top 3.

It's been pretty eye-opening and actually very liberating. I spent years beating myself up for having personality and yet being unable to find a relationship where I felt loved/attractive. Now I realize that it's literally impossible; guys will never love me so long as I look the way I do. It's helped me re-orient my priorities so that I'm no longer as into the idea of long-term love, marriage, or relationships, and embrace the idea of a happy single life. "

Or if you're doing well at your career/school, they want to hear how your parents divorced and spent all their time fighting and didn't pay attention to you, but you found your passion in life to distract you from them and build a sense of identity.

They don't want to hear how you're scared and lost inside and you hide it with a fake smile because you don't want to bring people down. Or how your dad beat you and you're constantly in a rut trying to be more manly than him but feeling inadequate no matter how much you accomplish. "

And those things were even likely done out of the goodness of your heart and your love for him, you are still coupling gift giving and unselfish acts with the anticipation of sex.

Have you asked him why you're not having sex? Even phrasing it the way I did can sound accusatory, so the discussion should be focused on really what's going on, rather than the goal being more sex. ... The end goal (for you) IS to have more sex, and that's totally fine; but if that goal doesn't consider why it's not happening, it may not end up with the result you're looking for.

Good luck!"

Rejection sucks.  Rejection is hearing in definitive terms that a person you have feelings for considers you to be unattractive and/or finds some fault with your character.  Even if it's the sweetest, most sincere rejection in the world this is still what's in the background.  Pretty tough to take.  Throw in the possibility of this occurring publicly or it making its way through the various social circles you're apart of, that adds another layer of hesitancy.  It's tough to build up thick skin and no matter who you are, sometimes it's just not worth taking the hit.

They weren't even that attractive, but just ""done up"".

"I'm from the UK and moved to the US in 2014. It's mainly a historical stereotype but it has *some* truth to it.

The US instills dental standards and routines much more rigorously than the UK does, but it is more rigorous than pretty much the rest of the world and not just the UK. Braces are the standard in the US. They're common but not nearly as widespread or standard in other places. Dental cleaning and whitening are also more common here. Plus, cigarette use is pretty low too. 

The stereotype is definitely more of a joke imo though. "

"People on both sides of the political fence do this: Making their decisions based on preconceived notions or personal opinions, that run contrary to expert consensus or pre-established results.

For instance, one governor made a Facebook post about how his staff were using lean and six sigma principals in the state government, which if you're in an industry that uses these, you know it's a way to reduce waste and accomplish more with less resources. One commenter insisted that this was just another big government program made to waste more taxpayer money. It was explained to him that this was specifically meant to reduce government size and spending, but original commenter then said that anyone who believes that is stupid, and provided no evidence to back his point.

(Note: I realize Facebook political arguments are the dregs of society, but I think that's the best, politically neutral example I could think of, and it's fairly indicative of how a lot of people think, politically)."

Have a safe trip home and good night to you and Maude"" THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

I live in Montreal so it was in french and translated word for word I sent her something like this ""It was great, have a ugly bad you""

I figured that that when I typed Maude, it autocorrected to ""mauvais"" which is ""bad""  and I don't remember what I wanted to say but ""laide"" which means ""ugly"" came out.

She didn't respond but I made it clear it was a mistake the next day. She believed me and we were off for a second date!

"Her post history tells a pretty complete story. She was very close to a guy, her first love, and they broke up. She's trying to move on but most of her friends are going to frat parties. She doesn't want to miss out on quintessential college experiences (i.e. banging) but has come from a fairly religious background and doesn't know how to do the romance stuff and is also dealing with some issues of shame.

It's a classic situation for college undergrads and will probably lead to a year or two of fucking around for fun until they get tired of that lifestyle and come full circle back to looking for ""the real thing"". Still, it's a formative experience and often helps sheltered girls develop a more adult sexual identity."

"One of the things I've noticed some female writings doing is making their male characters a little too self-conscious and too concerned about whether they're liked and accepted. 

This is a difficult thing to explain but basically how I see it is that women see themselves more as objects of desire in the world. If someone thinks they're ugly or strange it's a real issue because they're no longer desired. So in fiction they're often more aware of how they are being viewed through that lens.

Men tend to see themselves as objects of respect. It's not a question of whether women desire me, it's a question of whether they'll let me have them. Whether they think I'm capable. 

To think of it another. Let's say you have an antagonist who makes a snide remark. The female protagonist might go, ""oh no, everyone hates me now"". The male protagonist might go, ""I'm going to make that jerk see he underestimated me.""  Teenage girls go bulimic and teenage boys shoot up the school. 

Now I'm talking in huge generalisations here that don't reflect the real world or how vastly complex people and their emotions are. But the point I'm making is that I often read male protagonists written by women who care way too much about whether people like them in a way that seems a bit feminine. 

Good writers tend not to do this however and that's because they understand their characters and their motivations. "

"I gotta say though, from reading this sub and TwoX I really feel that this whole dare I call it disease for wanting validation is a product of US culture where children are constantly told white lies by their parents, since childhood, told they are oh-so-special and all that stuff so that everyone grows up to be emotionally super delicate and dependent on that kind of treatment.

Like I see a lot of ""support"" posts on TwoX which is basically ""Here's my super biased side of the story in a conflict I had; please tell me I did nothing wrong from hearing my own biased side of the story"". That's not women; that's Americans. I spent a lot of time on Dutch girl boards in my teens and early twenties and it was absolutely nothing like that there. Yeah people posted problems but it wasn't emotional support; it was practical advice they were soliciting and receiving.

North America has really become a place filled with emotionally extremely fragile people because they've been raised without anyone ever being remotely straight to them so the first time anyone does that it hurts like hell so no one does that. It's also a place where a lot of people are seemingly very _lonely_; they are unpopular exactly because they do something that is annoying or they smell or whatever and no one is telling them out of fear of hurting their feelings, they just avoid them.

Like there was a topic here a while back where someone explained the a situation of how to tell someone he wasn't interested in a second date. The top upvoted response was something like ""I had a great time with you but I don't think we're going to work out."" I replied to that with ""Ehh, reading the OP that's a bold-faced lie; OP did not have a great time at all."" and then you get told that ""civilized people"" know when white lies are appropriate.

Yeah sure, they're appropriate if you don't want to actually help people. If you want to help that girl, give her some actual constructive criticism and tell her why you didn't have a great time so she can improve herself."

"I remember being at a shit kicker bar, real cowboys and truckers sort of place. My brother took me there, when I got back to the states, then promptly got called off to the hospital. So I am in this bar loving the taste of ice cold beer after 4 years of shitty local brews.

When I start chatting up the waitress, it was slow and  she was probably in her 50s so I didnt see much harm in it.


Somehow that conversation warped into everyone of those rough tough men talking about the most romantic thing their wives ever did for them which ended in one of the truckers borrowing the bar phone and having his wife confirm on speaker phone that she did in fact  propose to him in Disney (world? Land? the one in florida) its a small world after all and that he cried like a baby whilst saying yes.

SOOO much male bonding. I still go bow hunting with one of those guys. "

"a few days ago there were similar threads in askwomen and here, asking for a thing the opposite sex does that you find annoying or can't understand. 

Women answered things like ""ca tcalling! :( "" or ""following us around"" essentially things that make us feel unsafe. 

Men answered things like ""shaving their eyebrows"" or ""girls complain about everything"". Frivolous stuff. 

I found the difference kinda disturbing, and interesting as well. "

"How exactly does one get pussy while living at the white house as a teenage boy? The secret service always cock blocking you. when you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches you smiling at her and immediately blows shit out if proportion speculating that you are somehow breaking international law with your awkward teenage flirting, so you have to testify before congress that you didn't give away any top secret documents to her and are made to admit live on C-SPAN that you've never even kissed a girl . Then you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at you and flashing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to you while you were going through some airport or public event, and when you passed by and shook her hand she leans in whispering she is going to diddle her clit thinking about you tonight and how much she wants to suck your dick off, just to fuck with you. Then you try to look up some porn when you get home just to relieve the tension but you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies are watching you beat off. Then you finally break down and Jack off in the shower which sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock down until they can find the source of the specimen and you end up getting debriefed by the joint chiefs of staff about your masturbatory habits and how you almost created a national security issue with your dick. Then wikileaks leaks your search history showing you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about your supposed micro penis. So you end up squirming a little since you are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people are saying you look like a fucking mental patient and you start to think you'll never get any pussy.

GENTLY you ape! and a *little bit* of tension is the keyword here. Then, use your tongue to flick it, either from underneath, but some girls prefer from the side, some like the clit head exposed some prefer the stimulation from under the little hood. Put a bit of pressure with your tongue and flick it. You can suck it like a mini dick a little too. See what works and gauge her reactions / body language. You can take a little pause and lick/suck on her labia a little too, but if something works and she tells you not to stop, don't speed up, don't put more pressure or too much enthusiasm into it, keep doing *exactly* what you were doing when she said ""don't stop"" or ""right there"". If you do that, and keep the pace, she *will* cum and squirm and spasm in your face and you'll feel like a champ

"FYI there is a steroids subreddit, and the bodybuilding sub has a weekly Steroid Saturday thread.

I have never used, but the info I've absorbed from reading about it:

* It requires some homework. You're altering your hormone balance, and your body reacts to that by producing more or less of certain hormones, so you need to know what combination of drugs you're taking, how you're dosing them, and how you're timing them, and getting regular blood tests to make sure nothing's going wrong. For instance, if you take testosterone, your body naturally produces more estrogen to counterbalance it, so you need to take an estrogen production blocker with it. Towards the end of your cycle, you need to ween off that, and take a third drug to get your hormone production back to normal. You also only hormones in cycles (Don't quote me on this, but like 1 month on, 3 months off) because if you take it for too long, your body stops producing it.
* Steroids don't instantly make you stronger, they increase your capacity to work and recover. You're still going to have to work out hard to get the most out of them.
* Roid rage is misunderstood by the general public. Basically, it just shortens your fuse. If you're a level headed guy, you may just get annoyed more easily. If you're the kind of person who goes around starting fights because you're on steroids, then you probably did that to begin with, just less frequently. In the news a couple years ago, a metal singer named Tim Lambesis was tried for attempting to hire a hitman to kill his ex wife, and his defense was that roid rage made him do it. It didn't, that's not how it works."
Absolutely be careful out there.

"I don't feel the need to cram as many activities into my free time as possible and it annoys the shit out of me when you do and then guilt me into playing along. Just because we have a Saturday free doesn't mean we need to have activity after activity after activity planned so we spend the entire day touring the whole god damn state. I don't mind doing things, but I also want to have some time to just relax without having to schedule it between activities and adventures. "

"Complimenting things like ""I really respect... about you"" is usually the same, but we (or at least Myself) take things like ""I love your hair"" as compliments rather than small talk, so I usually end up 'complimenting' more than receiving 'compliments' of that sort.

"That men may actually be capable of feeling real emotion. Hear me out... I grew up in a household where my Step-Dad showed his 'love' for my Mum through jealousy and possessiveness.

"A few weeks ago one of my coworkers (male) was like ""It's not like you're an unattractive dude"" when we were talking about my shit luck in women.

That's the best and only compliment I've gotten in 2017, and the compliments in 2016 numbered somewhere in the low teens. Whereas it seems the default thing to talk to women about is how *great* they are.

So, yeah I'm a little bitter about it. But I also wonder what having more compliments in a single conversation than I get in an entire year is like. I would probably feel patronized if that happened. "
"When I was 4, my dad took me for a ride on his bike. We were having fun and went a good few miles through some trails around the hills at the back of our house. I was sitting side saddle in front of him and after a couple hours was starting to get bored, thought it would be a good idea to idly swing my legs in circles. My heel went into the spokes of the front wheel and we flipped at speed.

I think he grabbed onto me because I don't remember hitting the floor at all, but I had a light scratch on my shin which I bawled about the entire way home. The bike was bent to shit and basically unusable. I remember him swearing a bit before hefting me up and starting to walk back home. When we got back, I remember my mom yelling something before dashing into the kitchen for a moment before coming back out with towels. Yelled at my dad to sit down then ran to the phone and called for an ambulance.

I didn't know at the time but his arm was broken in two places and he had a 3 inch gash just above his kneecap, deep enough to see bone. This was before mobile phones were widely used and we'd gone far enough away from where we lived that there was no one to call for help. So he carried my dumb ass back home over his shoulder, on foot, for at least 5 miles on rough trails.

Dad was a beast.

"I think in the man's defense, women rarely give each other constructive criticism.

I've been in situations where my wife and I will be out at a social function and a girl friend of my wife will be complaining about a recent break up or bad date, and tell her end of the story where she did nothing wrong and the man is evil for whatever.  My wife and I fully know that this girl has a reputation for doing the exact type of shit that the person tried to give her constructive feedback on, and my wife will just play the, ""Well I think you're better off without him"" card.

On the ride home I'll be like, ""Why didn't you tell it to her like it is and politely explain that had she just XYZ'd she probably wouldn't have ended up in that situation so that she can make that change in the future?""

My wife will just say, ""she didn't want to hear that, she was just venting and needed to be comforted.""  Multiply this by 5 of her friends.

I'll get downvoted for saying this but I really feel like women have created a culture of never playing devil's advocate to one another, so any time an outsider aka a guy does give any type of feedback, it's met with hostility."
"I think what surprises me is how surprised some women are that men have feelings and, it turns out, don't love chasing women around vying for their affection with their time and money. And I don't mean you personally at all, just that it seems odd to me that so many women just don't think about it at all. It's like, if the roles were reversed and you had to constantly court and woo men, wouldn't it bug you? But every time I have this conversation with a female friend they're often surprised by it, which still blows my mind a little because it just seems so obvious and relatable as a human experience to me.

"I've made a recent attempt to show more interest in others. Making sure I ask them further questions about stuff they tell me. I don't really know if it works or not, I feel so fake when I do it. But it's better than my awkward lack of responses before I guess.

The big hurdle that needs to be overcome is my dwarfism. Every new person I meet is usually very nervous around me as they've never actually spoken to a dwarf before. To counter that, I throw in a couple of self deprecating jokes about my size to at least acknowledge it and let them know I find humour in it. That does a good job of clearing the air and making them more comfortable.   

On the humour thing you mention, I tend to hold back to see if I can get a feel for their sense of humour first and adapt to that. Then slowly I can be a bit more myself and test the waters, as some of my jokes can be mistaken for sincere meanness or me really laying into myself. If they know I'm just kidding around, then I know its all clear."
I never realized anybody ever cared about this sort of thing? I do both because I don't really care to give it a thought.

"&gt; That alcoholic depression stuff is a valid red flag

He didn't actually say he was alcoholic there and nothing he actually said would be a red flag for me. If someone told me ""depression is slowly crushing the life out of me and I'm terrified that if you leave I'll never find another person to love me and I'll end up alone drinking myself to death"", then **assuming everything else in the relationship is ok**, I would say: ""Right, that sounds fucking horrible. Let's talk about this and let's find a way to get you some help with your depression and I'll be right here to support you through it"".

Now the big thing is, **it depends on the rest of the relationship**. Is he kind and supportive towards me? Is he a giving person? Does he tend to take responsibility for himself or does he tend to lash out or leave things to fate far too often? It's all to do with context, but so long as this is in the context of a loving relationship, I would definitely want my boyfriend to tell me when he felt like that so I could make sure we work together to get him the help he needs.

And that's the second point, really. He needs professional help, I can't offer that. I will be there to support him in the background while he goes through therapy/tries medication, whatever route it is he takes to get a handle on the depression. But I *would* leave if he was going to come to me for help I can't provide - professional help. I can only provide empathy, I can't treat depression. I've been depressed for a very long time and I can say from first hand experience that if you are depressed, the only person who can do something about that is you. So you do need to take responsibility for your own emotional welfare, but so long as you do that then I'm here to support you and I'm rooting for you."

Other times it can get destructive or dangerous.  He had a RV for a while there.  The bathroom had a plastic sink.  He wanted to tile it, so he tried using a handful of 1 inch square tiles he didn't cut and some super-glue like adhesive.  Definitely not the kind of thing you lay tile with.

She probably already has a bunch of guys hitting on her and I don't want to contribute to that.

All the sex I have is out of my league.
"Your girlfriend sounds kind of like me. I don't think it's necessarily laziness, but being a homebody can definitely look a lot like laziness. Personally, I have a very stressful job and my weeks are very long, so when I have free time I like to spend it relaxing at home. My girlfriend on the other hand is more like you, she's always up for adventure and activities. It's taken us a while, but I think we've found a good balance between the two. 

For starters, don't try to force her into doing things she won't  enjoy. It's just going to breed resentment and anger on her part.  Try to find things that meet in the middle of what you want to do and what she wants to do. Maybe it's not a full on hike up a mountain or a heavy duty bike race, but a nice walk or easy ride through the woods on a nice clean path is a step in the right direction. Even just going into the city to spend an afternoon wandering around is something.

If she's not receptive to doing *anything*, then sitting down and having a very frank discussion is probably in the cards. Don't call her lazy or anything mean like that, but let her know how important it is to you that you guys get out and do things together. Assuming she's a good person, she'll recognize the importance of it and try to step up more. It will take time and compromise on both your parts, but it can get better. "
i do notice it. but only on girls i have a crush on. its amazing the things i pay attention to when i like a girl.

She also made a post about moving in with him thinking it would lead to more sex. 
Yeah I'm here right now and it's kind of depressing.
I know it might seem foreign to you but there are men in this world who like to have sexual contact with other men.
"1. Being a compulsive liar
2. Having substance/alcohol abuse problems
3. Cheating on me

In the past was in a relationship with somebody who managed to cover all three in a very short space of time. Started with #2 and I tried to help her but then #1 kicked in and later #3 and you just can't deal with that anymore. "
That's what a yard is for.
"And obviously, he can't say no. Because of the implication.
"
Yeah she's making loads alright. 
"That's pretty much it, yes.

I don't expect to read about Harry masturbating to porn. But his desire for the other gender sounded like copied out of erotic literature for women."
Well there is no butt stuff.
"I wouldn't say anything in that spectrum has changed since we got married, but over the course of our entire relationship, she definitely became more feminine during and immediately after college.

When we first met at 19, she mostly wore basic tee shirts/similar tops and jeans (not masculine, but definitely not a lot of dresses/skirts/fitted clothing) most of the time, didn't own any makeup or even have pierced ears. She also didn't care much at all about fashion or coordinating. 

Over time, though, she slowly became more interested in really maximizing her appearance. She began learning to use makeup and becoming really interested in it, became really obsessed with skincare/bath products, started at least having a more ""traditionally feminine"" sense of style (even if she wasn't following trends much or reading much up on that). She still maintains interests in a mix of topics, including some more ""masculine"" things, but she's added to her interests a lot of beauty stuff, to the point where I would classify it as a serious hobby of hers. 

I like to say that when we met, she was basically as close to an IRL expy of Daria Morgendorffer as one could get... but over time her ""Inner Quinn"" came out to play. She's still got that cutting, dry wit and deadpan sensibility to her, but with a much softer, more image-conscious approach and demeanor to round it out these days."
"Lay a girl flat on her back.  Look at her vagina.  The nubby thing at the top?  There's a hood.  If you pull the hood back, viola.  Clit.  "
This is literally a comment chain on how we do not have access to this information.
"There is some hostility towards women asking and answering questions in r/AskWomen, don't take it personally."
"You know whats worse than rejection? 

**Remorse**, when you realize that you'll never know if she actually would have said yes unless you asked and you're gona have to live with not knowing. Having the regret of not knowing whether they would have said yes or no and the chances you're missing out on. Think of what your life could be with this amazing girl but you'll never know if you don't go for it.

Put it this way, you don't ask her your chances aren't going up. So not asking her just to spare your feelings? Yeah it's hard but the positive if they say yes is so much more of a euphoric feeling. Your life, do what you want tho

edit- bold lmao"
Keep track of what is due and when it's due and keep up with it.
"Disengage, get tested, move on. This is a dealbreaker for so many reasons."
"Literally every girl I know complains about it, especially regarding male friends and acquaintances that mistake their friendliness for romantic interest."
I enjoy arguing.  Not angry arguing but the exchange of ideas still-respect-eachother-while-disagreeing arguing.  I find people tend to take their position personally.  That arguing against it is equivalent to insulting them.  
That id rather shit on my hands and clap than spend time with her sisters family of spoilt little brats.
I think he's talking about book 6 where Harry describes his lust for Ginny like a lion.
"In high school I basically friended everyone I knew, and ended up with zillions of friends I never talked to. In college I stopped doing that, but still ended up adding people from class projects and whatnot.

So I have a tendency to unfriend people on their birthdays because I'm reminded that we're still friends."
Fuck that. I'll buy her a used engagement car for that price.
My boyfriend and I are HUGE fans of cheese or charcuterie boards. We go crazy overboard..we drive the people at the deli counter crazy getting 2 bucks worth of 25 diff cheese and meats (jk..they like us) We eat that for dinner once a week in bed spread out like a picnic and binge on tv. Netflix and charcuterie.
"For what it's worth, I've had really filthy sex, I've had a really rough sex, and I've had really passionate loving sex, but my first kiss is still one of my favorite memories.  I still smile from time to time when I think about it. And if I think about it for a long enough, I still get the taste of her vanilla bean lip gloss."
*applause*
god bless you
"It's several things, most likely.

First, a lot of it is that Reddit skews less socially adept and more introverted.  Most of us aren't what you'd consider charming.  The majority of us aren't lookers, either.  Most of us aren't exactly prime choice on the list of people that women want to be approached by, and most of us don't have reading body language down to second nature.

Second, a lot of it is due to heavy feminist influences.  Schools have mandatory seminars that basically amount to ""don't rape women.""  ""Harassment"" has been watered down to the point where a simple greeting against someone who doesn't want to be talked to is harassment (not legally, but we're not talking legal definition here either).  As far as healthy interactions with women go, a lot of guys get far more ""**DO NOT DO THIS**"" messages than positive ones.  Feminist scare tactics only make the problem worse- telling women that [1 in 5 will be raped in college](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence) does not promote healthy interactions with the opposite sex.

Third, most women are bad at flirting.  Protecting the ego is more important than getting the message across; the best way to do that is with [plausible deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability).  In many cases, that means that flirting amounts only to actions that could also be considered platonic or not actions at all.  A casual compliment is a prime example of this- a woman saying that I have a nice shirt could just as easily be flirting with me as not flirting with me at all.  As such, women who would otherwise give a platonic compliment will avoid doing so to avoid a misunderstanding, which in turn means we get fewer and fewer compliments from them, which in turn means that their compliment is more and more likely to be flirtatious in nature.  It's a self-perpetuating cycle."

The Red Pill. I don't really like the way they view the world and I think a war would be good. Though they're a bunch of alphas so I think that means us beta cucks will get our asses kicked.
"I mentioned this to my ex long ago and she replied ""bit, bit men don't need compliments, do they? Why would they be needy for that attention? Don't they just have confidence, or get their confidence automatically, all by themselves?"" 

Yeh, now I remember why I left your ass. 

Edit: I may sound resentful but I'm not, she really didn't know. We enjoy a great friendship (she's the mother of my boy) nowadays including occasional compliments for me for stuff she notices. "
