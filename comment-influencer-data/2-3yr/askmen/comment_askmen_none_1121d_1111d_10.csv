"I'd say it's the ones where you can't even tell they are hitting on you and you think you're just having a really out-of-place conversation.

Like I had a new girl at work ask me ""How do you make friends?""

I was like ""I don't know, I barely have any friends in the first place. You're asking the wrong person""

Months later after our first date, she was like I WAS HITTING ON YOU, YOU IDIOT. I WANTED YOU TO ASK ME TO A BAR But at the time I remember just thinking ""wow what a weird fucking conversation? How do I make friends? Is she autistic?"""

"I can admire an attractive man, but I do not find them sexually attractive compared to women"
"I guess I'll be the one to post an actual story.  I'm 26 for reference.

Senior year of college, drinking in my fraternity house.  We had made a giant thing of riot punch, and this being my last year, I had dedicated myself to going above and beyond the 3 previous years (which were pretty wild).  Between the drinking games and beer bonging a bunch of it, I was pretty heavily intoxicated.  I handle booze really well, and usually stay within my limits, but (as I'm sure many of you know) mixes like that can fuck you up before you even realize what is happening.

One of the girls I was hanging out with I had somewhat known for a couple weeks.  You notice pretty quickly when the same group of girls keep coming by all the time.  She was really unattractive, but was kinda funny, so I didn't care that she was drinking our booze.  Looking back, I don't think I remember ever seeing her take a drink.  I'm not sure if she thought I was flirting with her or not.  I'm a ""everyone have fun"" kind of person, so I'm pretty outgoing and friendly when at parties.  Sometimes I feel guilty because if I would have just ignored her, it never would have happened :/

Late into the night, I felt my body pretty much say ""it is time to go home.""  I wanted to get in bed before the spins or anything like that.  A few of us seniors lived in an annex house just down the road, so I said my goodbyes and headed home.  As I'm leaving, this girl decides that she wants to walk me home.  I wasn't going to hook up with her no matter how drunk I was, so I just viewed it as company to walk home with.  I was much stronger than her, so even in nightmare land where a girl would actually try to hurt me, I knew I would win.

We get to the annex, and I'm pretty much blacked out at this point.  Alcohol takes a long time to get into my system, so it can take a while before I feel the effects.  Cleary I had drunk more than I wanted.  I don't know how she convinced her way into the annex, or how she got into my room (we had single rooms in the house).  I think I remember her say something like ""I just want to make sure you get into bed.""  So in my drunken stupor, I guess I took off some of my clothes, climbed into bed, and passed out... or so I thought. 

 Frankly I don't remember a whole lot, and for a long time I think I tried to convince myself that it was just a really terrible dream.  I only remember bits and pieces, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was asleep for most of it.  Basically, she climbed into bed and had sex with me.  I remember saying once or twice ""fuck off, I'm trying to sleep,"" but that is pretty much all of it.  She was a heavyset girl and I was half asleep, so I don't know if I could have pushed her off, or if I even tried.

I woke up the next morning and slowly connected what had happened.  For a few days I tried to pretend to myself that it was a really bad dream, but over the years I've accepted the fact that it had really happened.  I can't remember if she had put a condom on, or if I even finished.  I was terrified that she had gotten pregnant, or I had caught some disease.  I got an STD check, and luckily, I was clean.  I think I saw her once around campus after that, but she certainly never came back around to our house.  I had assumed she was with one of the sororities or something, but I never saw her with them when the packs of them would come around.

How did it affect my life?  Well, I have a harder time trusting women.  Part of this was a holdover from what happened to me in HS, but this event certainly didn't help.  On first dates I don't really drink much, if at all.  Maybe 2-3 beers for the entire night.  I'm sure I seem boring to the girls I'm going out with at the start, but frankly I don't want to be vulnerable like that ever again.  I'll let loose later on once I trust her (not super drunk or anything, I still keep it classy).  I also don't sleep with girls who have had more than a couple drinks.  Even the slightest sign they are buzzed, and it isn't going to happen.  I know for a fact I have missed out on a lot of sex because of this, but frankly the fear of putting someone else in the same position I was in terrifies me.  I haven't had a one-night stand or a long-term GF since then (over 5 years now).  I go out on dates, but nothing serious.  I do get really lonely sometimes, but I have a great group of friends which kinda makes up for it.  I never told any of my friends or family, and I pretty much just keep it to myself.  Frankly, no one seems to care if this happens to a guy.  It was also really emasculating: me, a man, was raped by a girl?  I still don't know why I didn't fight her off or anything, but I think that goes back the whole ""this is a bad dream"" aspect."

"She tried to hit on me by turning to me, and trying to start the conversation by singing ""call me maybe"" where she completely forgot the lyrics on top of mumbling the lyrics she did remember in such a low volume I couldn't really hear her. It was also before I heard the song, so I was wondering what her deal was because she kept stopping and repeating what she did know before she ran off embarrassed because she botched the whole thing.

I didn't hear the song and put 2 and 2 together until I got home, since this was very early on before they blasted it on every radio station. 

If she just came out and asked me for my number or just gave me her number instead of whispering a musical performance, I would've accepted."
"I think the only relationship I've been in where the girl took things seriously (as in actually wanted something long term) was a girl who's long gone..

I was 18, working in a laboratory and she worked at the same place for a month, she had come over from Italy to do work experience..

Anyway, so like the first time I really noticed her was basically on the first day she worked there, I was outside having a smoke and she came out and sat next to me..

I offered her a cigarette and she smiled and shook her head, we talked for a bit and she asked about me and my life.

I told her where I lived, what I did in my free time and shit, and she told me a bit about herself, she said she was going into Newcastle with some friends that night and would love a tour guide..

I showed her all the nice parts of my city, I'll never forget how she looked as she gazed at the beautiful buildings and views around the city that I took for granted on a daily basis.

She was going to get the bus home, but she said ""why don't you come back to mine for a
Coffee?""

And I came back with her, and the sex was the best I've ever had, I don't believe in love at first sight and all that bullshit, but I do think that I was falling in love with her day by day.

The next few days flew by, and I found myself thinking about her every minute of every day, when I was working in the sampling department one morning, she came in and dropped something in my pocket as she walked past.

It was a vile cap, but she had drawn little hearts on it, I still have that thing somewhere..

We talked a lot about her staying with me rather than going back to Italy. She said she would, but she was studying to be a vet, and staying here would sacrifice her chances of becoming one..

I remember a night where we just watched the sunset together, I gazed into her eyes and held her like she was the most important thing to me in the universe.

The day she took the flight back to Italy was a rough one, she held me tight as we walked to the airport, she cried and I wiped the tears from her eyes and said ""just promise me you'll come back"", she smiled, kissed me and said she would.

Fast forward three years later, she's married to her best friend and I've had a really shitty time in general..

She emails me out of nowhere, saying she wanted to come see me.

For some stupid reason I say yes..

At this time in my life, I was a mess, I was an alcoholic, I barely had enough money to eat, and I was in therapy for suicidal thoughts and depression..

She saw me at my weakest, and I never should have let her see me like that, there was still something inside of her that loved me.

But she was married, she looked at me with pain in her eyes, she saw how empty I felt.

One night I asked her ""if you'd have stayed, I would have probably asked you to marry me after a couple years, would you have said yes?""..

She said ""in a heartbeat""..

I went for a very long walk that night..

I don't think I'll ever see her again, and every single woman I ever date ever again will be compared to her, and there's nothing I can do about that..

I woke up in the middle of the night not too long ago and just burst into tears, I don't remember what she smelt like..

I don't know what I would have done differently, I'm just glad I met her man.."

"I think the biggest thing here is not to take it as a rejection.  If he's been living with you for a while now, maybe he just wants to spend some time with his mom, especially since he said it was only for a semester."
"The older I get, the more I realize that my mom is not the shining person I idolized in my youth.  She's scared of anything outside her bubble, closed minded, and stuck in the past. 

She'd be crushed if she knew. 

Edit:  As I read replies this morning I'm re-qualifying what I've said here.  She's still a good person at heart and, even though she'd be incredibly sad to hear my original response, she'd probably have some wisdom for me along the lines of 'you're still growing up no matter how old you are' and what I saw then vs now. "

"I've got loads of them. I was out on a date for with a girl once and she invited herself back to my place, then she decided it was too late to get a cab and asked if she could stay over...so I made up a bed fo her on the sofa and went to bed. 


Another girl really loved it wh n I made her tea. She used to come round to my place and lounge around on my bed and I'd sit on a chair and we'd drink tea and watch TV. She was really friendly."

"dude that's not awkward, that's just red flag city."
"I've dated girls who loved having sex with me so much they acted like I was doing *them* a favor. I've also dated girls who treated sex with me like it was a chore. Like they rationed just enough sex to keep me from breaking up with them. 

The really bad girlfriends will try to make you feel grateful they're even with you and you're so undesirable that you'll never get another girlfriend ever if they leave you. Creating a scarcity mentality so you'll stay even if your needs aren't satisfied.

Will never settle for the latter situations ever again. 

I've never cheated, but man was I tempted when girls expressed strong interest to me while I was stuck in nearly sexless relationships. Beyond the prospect of sex, just *feeling desired* had become such an alien concept I'd almost forgotten that women could find me attractive. 

Whenever a girl flirted with me, I'd be stunned. After repeated rejections from a partner, I'd internalized the belief I was unattractive. Even if my partner expressed love verbally, I couldn't believe her without the physical intimacy. ""If she doesn't want to have sex with me, she doesn't love me."" Actions speak louder than words.

Although I definitely put in the effort, communicated, tried to be understanding, etc., the sexless relationships always failed and severely damaged my self-esteem. Learned you can't bargain or earn attraction (big lesson). I used to stay in relationships far too long where the girl and I were compatible in every way--except sexually. 

Took me way too long to be honest with myself that I couldn't be happy in relationships like that. If I have a girlfriend, I'd like to have sex with her and she should want to have sex with me. Stupid obvious. This doesn't help, but looking back, I think it was for the best that those relationships ended.

I laugh at it now, but I used to feel shame for my desires, i.e. ""How *dare* you be attracted to your girlfriend and want to have sex with her?!"" I'd berate myself. Sometimes that shame came from outside too. Had to remind myself I'd been with girls in the past who did enjoy frequent bedroom times with me. 

There's nothing wrong with having a sex drive. Monogomy isn't just about having not having sex with other people; it's also about having sex with your partner. Some girlfriends enforced the first part, without fulfilling the second part.

Eventually, I grew out of that mindset. Now I simply think, ""She doesn't owe me affection; but I don't owe her attention."" I'll find a partner who wants me in bed too or I'll just be single.

Do you two live together? As a side note, I've found when you move in together, the sex will spike up for a few weeks, then plummet. Whereas with girls I dated but didn't live with, the sex stayed frequent for much longer. There have been (delightful) exceptions with live-ins, but it's a pattern I've noticed. 

I think it has to do with familiarity and keeping some space from each other keeps things from going stale as quickly. Also enmeshing my whole life with hers. Forgetting to maintain my own friends, my own hobbies, my own life. She was attracted to the guy with a well-rounded life, gotta keep that.

Admittedly, I deserve some blame for having gotten complacent in the past and should have kept ""dating"" those girls even after I'd gotten into relationships with them. I took it for granted they would stay attracted once we were exclusive. Now I know better and believe that attraction has to be maintained, it never ends. Learn from my mistakes.

Ironically, it's when I've started to pull away that some girlfriends have tried to reel me back in with sex. Like they could feel me becoming distant and thinking about breaking up with them. ""Oh shit I'm gonna lose him. Better bang him and then he'll be okay for a while."" That may not have been what they thought, but it felt that way.

(The girlfriends that didn't care about losing me had either mentally checked out of the relationship, already planned on dumping me and/or already had sights on another guy).

Giving more attention didn't work, but the withdrawal of attention did. Especially if the girlfriend sensed there was another girl or girls on my radar. 

I hate to say this, but when other girls have found me attractive, it has done *wonders* for making girlfriends more interested in sex again. Like if your girlfriend sees other girls checking you out, or flat-out flirting and complimenting you in front of her.

The girlfriend will usually be pissed-off and annoyed and act like she hates it. But later that night she'll be extra enthusiastic in the bedroom (or even initiate in the first place), to remind you of what she's got. To also ""beat"" those girls, in her mind.

A few times I tricked myself into thinking the problem was resolved and would stay, when all it did was prolong the relationship unnecessarily. Once I was back on board and the girlfriend thought her competitor(s) were out of the picture, the sex would plummet again.

Reading over what I wrote, it probably sounds like all my exes were bad like that. There were certainly good ones. It's just the nature of the thread made me recall the bad experiences.

Things are better now. I'm honest with myself about what I want, and recognize there's a responsibility to maintain attraction. Gotta do my part. It's okay to lose bad partners and worth it to find good partners.

EDIT: Here is a comment where I shared some resources. Realized I didn't give much actionable info.

&gt;In many (but definitely not most) such relationships, the man still wants more sex than he gets.

&gt;How to deal with that?

I think Esther Perel addresses this question better than I can in this video:

[The secret to desire in a long-term relationship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa0RUmGTCYY) 

Not moving in together has helped a lot. Although that doesn't help people who are married. But I think maintaining some healthy space and having a bit of a life that's independent of your partner helps. Having your own friends, your own hobbies, etc. Give her the gift of missing you.

The other thing--and it pained me to admit this to myself--was that I just wasn't a good lover. Once I made peace with that and decided I could do better, I was able to progress and learn better how to give pleasure. Newsflash: the more pleasure you give a woman, the more she will want to have sex with you. What a shocker.

[Whispers] Here's the book that helped me . . . 

***Women's Anatomy of Arousal: Secret Maps to Buried Pleasure*** by Sheri Winston. I couldn't find the whole book online, but here's a link to [the first chapter](http://intimateartscenter.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ArousalTitle_TOC_Ch1_CIA.pdf) (PDF, images NSFW).

Excerpt:

&gt; In  some  ways,  humans  are  like computers.   We come equipped with  hardware, the  factory-installed equipment  we  were  born  with. the forces  of  nature  shaped  evolution  and produced our unique DNA blueprint, giving us blue eyes or brown skin. 
&gt; 
&gt; It also hardwired us with certain types of sexual behavior. We all know  about  the  basic  mammalian  humping motion, for instance. This isn’t something we learned at school, and we didn’t need Nike to inspire us, either. We just do it. 
&gt; 
&gt; We’re  not  just  our  hardwiring,  though.  We  also  come  loaded  with lots of software—our extensive programming, also known as culturally learned behavior. We probably do more learning than any other species. Much of our sexuality is learned, absorbed throughout our lifetime as we  simmered  in  the  soup  of  culture.  
&gt; 
&gt; We  learn  from  our  culture  how to kiss and caress, what’s acceptable and what’s taboo, what’s hot and what’s not. 

&gt;In other words, sex is natural *and* we learn sex. 

Yes please.

I also wouldn't admit to any girls you had to learn from a book. In my experience, most girls prefer a guy who was a ""natural."" As if a guy had to stoop to the level of reading a book, he must be a loser.

However, a few open-minded girls really appreciated that I made the effort to get to know their bodies better, and was handsomely rewarded. Some reacted like having that knowledge was sexy and a big turn-on. Sapiosexual.

Thanks to who gave me the gold :)"
"I made out with a guy once to freak out some loud and vocally homophobic asshole at the bar one night, and to get him to either shut up or leave. 

I was reasonably sure I wasn't gay before that. Now I'm *totally* sure I'm not gay. It did absolutely nothing for me. We didn't half-ass it either. There was lip biting, hair pulling, nipple touching, and everything. It just felt super awkward and generally not good. Not something I really want to try again.

Also, I would like to apologize to all of my ex-girlfriends for my chronic laziness when it comes shaving. Beard stubble is pokey as hell.   "

"My fake daughter. Shes my nephews girlfriend and her parents are garbage. Her real father is not really in the picture and her mother spends the little bit of money she has on herself. She lives in a 2 bedroom house with 6 people and does not have her own bed (she shares a bed with her mom).

When I met her I noticed that she never wore weather appropriate clothes and she often wore the same thing over and over again. After talking to her about it I found out that thats all she had that fit her. I took her to buy some new pants and she was 2 sizes off when picking some out to try on, thats how long it had been since she got new jeans. The more I spoke to her, the more things exactly like this scenario, seemed to pop up. Its almost as if she is the real life version of Cinderella and I couldnt just shrug it off and ignore it.

Over the course of the last year or so I have spent a couple thousand dollars on her (school clothes, things she needs for sports she plays, ""just because"" gifts because shes a great kid and deserves to have a few things she wants, I bring her along on family vacations, she has her own room in my house.) I have 2 of my own kids and I try to treat her exactly like them and more often than not, I end up giving her preferential treatment. Shes a great kid and I want her to know that regardless of the shitty hand she was dealt as far as parents and financial situations are concerned, if you do all the things youre supposed to do and overcome those adversities theres rewards and support that will come along the journey.

Once you power them up, they're a little dull-witted. Being dead for a while can do that to you. However, after a few days, they seem to regain enough of their mental faculties to play Overwatch with you. That's usually enough. Wait, where are you going?

Day 1 - We met at my work.  She was a customer.  We spent some time talking and what not.  Just casual.  Never thought I'd see her again.  
  
Day 2 - One month later, she came in again.  I recognized her (always had a thing for remembering faces).  She bought something, left.  5 minutes later she came back in and asked if she could take me out.  We went out *that night* after I got off work.  Went to the movies, went back to her place.  
  
Day 3 - We went and saw another movie.  Hung out afterwards on this romantic looking bridge and talked for hours.  Knew it that night.  We both did.
  
We pretty much started living together that week.  Got married two years later.  That 3rd day was in 1998.  We celebrate that date more than our wedding anniversary, which will be 16 years next month."

"A few years ago, a few friends and I were queing up at the local cinema to see a comedy film (*I think it was The Other Guys*), and right after I finishing paying for my ticket and turn around, a girl with glasses and an annoying voice literally pushes her way past a mother and her child and yells in my face, 

""Alright babe? Tell ya wot, I think you're cute. Wanna sit next to meh in the cinemah?"" (whilst slapping her thigh and giving me a perverted look that creeped me out even more.)

*This was the kind of girl who you'd see on the edges of town, with a cig at her mouth, wearing track bottoms and piercings across her belly, and a really low T-shrt that deliberately exposed her cleavage. The chavvy type, as we call it in Britain. Full-on Cockney accent too, for unflattering comedic effect.*

I politely refused on obvious grounds, but it creeped me out. That and the fact that she pushed past the other two people in the cue to make her point. Couldn't she just have waited until after she paid and then approached me? It made her appear very rude in front of me, not to mention the poor mother helping her boy onto her feet after being knocked over. That was the first and only time a girl had ever asked me out and I don't regret rejecting her."

"Relationships like this are special, but they aren't 'real'. The fact that there is a time limit changes so much. People are more willing to let their guard down with people they know are temporary so you get all of the intimacy of a longer relationship, but it doesn't last long enough to find out what it would be really like long-term. The impending end forces you closer. You're lucky to have experienced this, it's a beautiful thing, but it might help to realise how much of a difference the special circumstances made."
"Her: hey I got a new part time job at the art museum, I could get you in for free...

Her (blushing): the only catch is, uh, well, I'd have to go with you....

Me: oh, well I wouldn't want to put you out, I mean you're there every day for work, you probably wouldn't want to go on your day off, and I can afford a ticket anyway.  But thanks!!!"
It won't be the employee's first time dealing with that. Just tell them when you bring it in that you were using it for something that should be kept discrete and ask that they boot it in the back.

The actual experience of watching sports doesn't appeal to me, but the one thing I do feel like I'm missing out on is the ability to walk up to any guy in my city, make a comment about one of the local teams, and have an instant connection."

"Good luck beating this one.

We were at a student trip party, and this girl I liked but had renounced pursuing because she was way out of my league, came and asked if she could sit on my lap. I said I didn't mind but she could have my chair as I wanted to go dancing now. She came to dance with me.

Later I was tired and wanted to call it a night, she asked if I could escort her to her tent, and I did. On the way I notice that my tentmate has company over, and she offers I stay in her tent as her tentmate is staying elsewhere. I say no worries, I can sleep in my car. She proposes we walk a little more before calling it a night. We walk and talk for like two hours.

She asks if me and an upperclassman girl I'm often around are an item. ""No, she's with &lt;guy&gt;, I thought everyone knew that. I don't exactly have a girlfriend."" ""Aww, don't say that, I don't have a boyfriend either."" ""Yeah, but you're a bit picky here. Any guy would jump on the occasion the moment you show the tiniest interest.""

-----------

Another one:

Girl had been very huggy and cuddly for years. Not gonna complain about that, she was much younger and that was cute. One day she starts kissing me on my lips out of the blue. Used to her original ideas I take it as her playing a game mimicking some cultures where kissing the lips is for friends and family and not only lovers. She had been inviting herself to my wife and I's bed for years, and continued when my wife wasn't around anymore. She'd sometimes say she would do anything to make me feel a little better, and I'd hug her and say I know, she's already doing everything.

I am an idiot.

And apparently everyone is upset that I never noticed anything about my childhood best friend.

Oh... lazer tag. James bond that shit homie
There is a point where when guys get too drunk they stop caring about sex. Its a weird place.
Thing is it isnt boring because youre doing shit that makes you happy which kind of is the definition of not boring.
The internet makes me feel like I'm the only one who doesn't put my tongue where the poop comes out.

"PSA: Here's a list of hints a girl likes you. Disclaimer: every girl is different. 

Observe her ""baseline behavior"" and see if she has *deviations* from that behavior. Example: She doesn't touch anyone, but hugs you a lot.

Girls prefer to ""create opportunities"" for the guy to make a move, rather than make a move herself. These are clues, not confirmation. Real answer is to ask her out.

* She says compliments like, ""Hey, I like your shirt."" If she keeps walking, no go. If she stays to chat? Stop, talk to her and get her phone number. It's a common piece of dating advice in women's magazines to say something like that to guys. The problem is, men assume the girl likes their clothes, not likes *them.* 

* She asks what kind of girls you like, who you have a crush on, your relationship status, says you could get any girl you want, etc.

* She asks what clothes you think look sexy, hairstyles, etc. Sends you photos of herself in outfits to get your opinion. Green flag: you tell her, and she dresses that way. Or she changes her hairstyle based on your preference. If she doesn't change fashion *but her friend does*, she was a wingwoman to gather info for her friend to date you. 

* ""Friendly Inquisition"" - her friend(s) ask, ""What do you think of [girl's name]?"" ""Is she your type?"" ""Would you go out with her?"" *She sent them as spies.* Variation: her friend calls and asks. *The girl is on the line too, listening to what you'll say.*

* She creates excuses to hang out *alone*, e.g. studying together, watching a movie, show a talent. But she spends more time flirting with you and asking personal questions. Green flag if you're not even in the same classes or she does not need help studying.

* She asks you to help her with easy stuff. Key is she's over-the-top grateful and doesn't want you to leave.

* She's always ""around."" When you arrive at class, when you leave class, at the coffee shop you like, when you're at an event, etc. 

* She's gotten off work and has no reason to stay. *You're* the reason she wants to stay. If she's at work but says when she gets off work--she wants to hang out with you after.

* She preemptively mentions being single. Or that she's broken up with her boyfriend.

* She gives you her phone number without you even asking for it. Or she gets your number from someone else.

* She texts you cute/sexy pictures *and* invites you to hang out.

* She shows interest in your hobbies even though she didn't before. ""Come to my house to play video games.""

* She brings up a movie she wants to see, a bar or restaurant she wants to check out, a party that's happening, etc. Especially if she says, ""But I have no one to go with."" She wants you to ask her out. 

* She casually bring up events, and gauges your reaction. If you show interest, she pounces and says you should go together. [4 hours later that night] *""Wait, did she ask me out on a date?""*

* ""Self-invite"" date, e.g. you tell her about a cool bar you went to, and she says, ""You should take me there!""

* ""Reminder"" date, e.g. ""When are you gonna take me for a spin in your car?"" ""When are we going to watch that TV show at your place?""

* She asks if you have plans for the night or weekend. Ask her out for drinks.

* Calls, texts (especially when it's late), likes all your Facebook posts, etc. Key thing: when you do invite her to hang out in person, she does, and she's eager to. If she constantly flakes, she just enjoys your attention and doesn't want to escalate further. If she acts like this with you while in a relationship with someone else, stay away.

* She shares songs, photos, quotes, videos, stories etc. with you related to love. It's a ""test"" to see if you think about her in those ways.

* Writes big long messages in your yearbook, her phone number and an invite to hang out.

* ""Third Party Endorsement."" When she expresses what she wants as if it was the opinion of other people. Saying things like: ""My friends think we would make a cute couple."" ""My Mom asked if you're my boyfriend yet 'cuz we hang out together so much."" ""Since we're alone together in your room, the other people at the party probably think we're hooking up right now."" 

* Touching, hugging, sitting on your lap, holds your hand, puts your arm around her, dances close, etc. Asks ""Have you been working out?"" and feeling your biceps or abs. Massages and back rubs (takes off top). Play fighting. 

* Clumsiness or acting drunk as an excuse to lean on you, for you to hold her, and get your faces in kissing range.

* She complains about being cold. If you're outside, put your arms around her. If you're lying down watching TV together, cuddle closer. If she says her hands are cold, hold her hands.

* She shows off her body. Bends forward to show you her chest or butt, shows off her legs, answers the door wearing little clothing (or a towel). She's really trying if she tells you to look at her dress, legs, etc. ""Look how short my skirt is!""  Or she invites you to touch. ""I just used a new razor to shave my legs and they're so smooth. Come and feel!"" 

* She finds excuses to remove clothes. Too hot, has to take a shower, change clothes, etc. Key is she doesn't change rooms or close the door or kick you out. 

* She ""steals"" something from you--like a hat. You're supposed to chase her into a room and make out. Or takes a small item from you and drops it down her top. 

* She ""borrows"" things (she doesn't need) to make up a reason to talk to you.

* She ""forgets"" things at your place so she has a reason to come back--and hook up.

* ""The Friend Fadeaway."" You go out on a group outing with her and friends. They gradually leave until you're alone with the girl, maybe even her house or room. Variation: you show up thinking it's a group outing or a party, but she's the only one there.

* ""Party of Two."" She invites you to a party or event, but sticks to you the whole night.

* If you get sick or injured, she gets more worried and concerned beyond what you think a normal friend would. If she comes over with food and other supplies and plays nurse, it's a big hint.  

* After a night out at a bar, nightclub, or party, when she's ready to leave she asks to split a taxi with you back to her place. And she doesn't mentions sharing a cab with the whole group of friends, just you. 

* If she has a party at her place, at the end of the night she shoos out all the other guests but wants you to stay. Or she'll come with some excuse that you're too drunk, your home is too far, weather is too bad for you to drive home now, and she insists you sleep over.

* If she's dropping people off after a party, night out, event, etc. she drops off everyone first and you last, even passing by your home to do it. To get you alone.

* She ""misses"" the last train, bus, etc. so she can sleep over. Or makes excuses not to leave your car.

* She brings up sleeping arrangements. She doesn't want you to sleep on the couch (or floor), and *insists* you share a bed with her.

* She mentions how she's home alone tonight, roommate is away, her parents out of town, etc. She wants you to invite yourself over to fool around. Or for you to ask her to come over to your place.  Hot tip: text her ""coming over"" or ""come over"" and see how she reacts. 

* If she comes over to your place, she confirms repeatedly that you're alone (no roommates or parents).

* Thirst: ""I'm so horny!"" ""I need to get laid tonight"" ""I've never fucked in [location you're both in now].""

* She brags about her sexual skills. ""I give great blowjobs.""

* She implies that the current circumstances are ideal for sex. ""We're the only ones here."" ""We could fool around no one would know. ""No one can hear us with these walls."" ""This bed is really comfortable, you know."" ""I'm not wearing panties."" ""I'm on birth control."" ""I've got condoms in that drawer.""  Those aren't random facts she just brought up.

* She kisses another girl in front of you--and wants you to watch. Or invites you into a room to fool around more. How threesomes start. 

* She asks *you* out. She's tired of hinting. Straight talk is the last resort.

* She says she used to have a crush on you. If she's single, she could be hinting she *still* has a crush and you should ask her out.  He gets hung up on how she used the past tense, and treats it as her saying, ""I'm not interested in you *now*.""

Negative tactics.  Some girls do these things to attract guys, but they actually repel guys.

* She tries to make you jealous.  She brags about guys asking her out, flirts with guys in front of you but always looks at you to make sure you see it, etc.  She wants to let you know she's ""in demand"" so you'll want her.  The problem is girls are turned on by competition in relationships, while most guys are turned off.  

* Complain about guys hitting on her. What she means is, ""I don't like it when other guys do it, but it's okay for you because I like you."" This backfires, because the guy will assume the girl doesn't want *him* to make a move too. 

* She bad-mouths any girl you date, because she's jealous of them getting to be intimate with you. 

* She opens the conversation by insulting you.  house_robot explained this really well in another thread.  

Quote:
&gt; 
&gt; When a girl says, ""Oh you're a player aren't you?"" its similar to when they say shit like, ""Oh you want me to go home with you? You sure you don't have other girls there already?""
&gt; 
&gt; Its the female approach to giving a man a compliment: passive aggressively, and couched as an insult. Shes letting you know you have desirable qualities.
&gt; 
&gt; When girls say this type of nonsense to you, never confirm or deny it.

It took me a while to realize this was a thing. I'd meet a new girl, she'd break my balls, and I'd be turned off. Hear later she liked me. WTF?

Let's end on a positive note.

* Food (+1 if she cooked or baked it herself), gifts, handmade greeting cards, mixtapes, poems or stories she wrote, etc.  

Good luck!

No wonder people go crazy.
"Success with women is the foundation of self worth for a lot of guys. Insecurity for a lot of guys has plenty to do with interaction with the opposite sex, it's not exclusive to either sex. 

What is exclusive is that guys have to deal with the anxiety of being found creepy, even by women they're uninterested in. 

I imagine there's some counterpart to this for women, but I don't think it's easy to convey what it's like to have people be offended by your presence in a way not normally thought of as judgmental. 

"
That is really odd though.
That is the weirdest phrase I've ever heard.

"I knew after the first date that my first wife was the one. That marriage lasted 20 years, and was only cut short by her death due to cancer. 

I remarried. I knew after a week. We got married this past March. I'm never letting her go. "
"I have absolutely no interest in men, so no. "
"I've never really gotten sports. Either regular football, soccer etc, or even the e-sport variety. 

I guess something just doesn't click for me, I don't get why people would have a favorite. I've never been particularly patriotic or full of school spirit or any thing like that. "
I had to squint reading that first paragraph. That's rough.

"When I was a teenager, I had to work at McDonald's (my Dad insisted my brothers and I learn how to work, and besides, apparently 1 out of 3 CEOs worked at McDonald's). Anyway, I had to clean the toilets throughout the day.

The women's bathroom was always, and I mean always, far dirtier and more gross than the men's. Women (sorry) are terrible in the bathroom. I don't know what it is, but it was consistent. I'm talking about used feminine products, piss everywhere, you name it.

Granted, this is not a statistically significant sample (it's McDonald's), but I was surprised to see that everyone dreaded entering the women's bathroom vs. the men's.

That said, yes, men do miss at times. It's disrespectful, and it's wrong. 

But women? Please...how do you live with going to the bathroom when so many of your gender leave it so gross?"
"One time my wife and I were at a restaurant and the waitress completely ignored her and would only acknowledge me. Everything I ordered was ""OMG thats my favorite!"" and everything I said was hilarious. Then her demeanor would completely change when having to get my wifes order and she wouldnt look at her.

It was more funny than awkward or uncomfortable and we still laugh about it occasionally. This happened like 7-8 years ago but neither of us will ever forget it. The girl gave zero fucks. I kinda respect her gangsta lol

Who the fuck makes friends by going to bars anyway?
"She may be your ""fake"" daughter but you are the most real person in her life and are going to influence her long after you are gone.  She is very lucky to have you and the reverse is true as well. Being able to give of one's self to a person is very good for the giver, too. "
"I would like to add, for the love of god, put the weights back where they belong. Don't put the 45 lbs plates covering up the 35 lbs plates. And if putting them on that spot blocks you from being able to get another type of plate off the weights, just don't put it on that spot for the love of god.

Yeah if they are ridicuously attractive I can recognize that man is attractive but doesn't do anything to me that's it.

"It doesn't change how you feel inside.

Apart from a brief (6-month) terrible relationship, I've been alone my whole damn life. Since college my salary has shot up and I'm projected to make $300-400K by the time I'm 30.

But I'm fucking lonely and money can't cure that. Sure it'll bring the gold diggers and prostitutes but they don't give a shit about who you are, only your bank account. An unattractive guy is unattractive no matter what. Polishing a turd, etc.

I'm sitting in a swanky airport lounge right now with catered alcohol and imported foreign sweets. But it tastes like cardboard, always has, because I don't have a single girl to share my life and experiences with. Doing cool stuff and having cool things just becomes like masturbation after a while if you're doing it by yourself. A wealthier guy can be depressed and think daily about stepping off his 5th-floor balcony every night just like a poor man can."
I slam car doors closed.
"Smalltalk in texts is actually good because it can lead to longer transitioning conversations, because texts can be planned out in detail, while spoken words can't be changed.

At least for me the problem is that when texting I don't have to worry about not stumbling over my words, worrying about what to do with my hands, eyes, etc, all the while trying to hold a conversation."
The obvious solution to this problem is to start an Excel spreadsheet.
"I was wearing a Team Rocket shirt once and this short chubby girl in a hoodie, with the hood up, walked up to me, squeaked out an ""i really like your shirt!"" And then ran off.

She wakes me up by rubbing her tits on my face.  I wake up very happy when she does this.
"It's not about betrayal. Here's how it would go down, assuming 'showing interest' is so obvious it's unmissable and I was actually interested:

I'd tell my bro when I find out. We'll probably go somewhere with some liquor and talk it out - bitch about the situation and laugh at how stupid the universe is, then I'll tell him to man up and ask her out, he'll either agree or not but either way if he doesn't succeed he'll tell me to go for it and not fuck it up or he'll have to punch me. We'd drink to that.

I'll tell him she's an idiot for being interested in me when she could have him. He'll probably agree and say that well girls are stupid but better me than some other assholes we know who we'd talk shit about. We'd drink to that too.

Depending on how much my friend liked her I'd either keep things discreet when around him or invite him out with us so we can wingman for him. Obviously either through the girl or otherwise I'd be trying to find someone else for him.

No betrayal, no drama, you just talk shit out and both do what you want and look out for each other. "
"Matched with some girl on Tinder and we started texting a little.  We barely knew each other and didn't meet yet, and she was already calling me pet names. For example, on Christmas she texted me ""Merry Christmas baby!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"" And would also call me stuff like ""cutie patootie"". And no, she wasn't a bot. "
"Out of all of these replies, this one actually made me lol."

"*How Football Sounds To People That Don't Care.*

&gt; Firstly, imagine every time within a day that football is mentioned by someone else. Secondly, replace it with something that you don't want to hear about every day. Say... Archaeology. Then, think carefully about how an average day would pan out.

&gt; So, you awaken to the clock radio. It's 7AM. Just as you awaken, it's time for the news and archaeology already. Not news and other historical investigations, like library restorations or museum openings (unless there's another event happening), but just the news and archaelogy. Malaysian plane is still missing. Pistorius is still on trial. New dig announced in Giza. Ancient Mayan temple discovered. Exciting stuff.

&gt; Time for a bite to eat over the morning TV. More news. More archaeology. Yes, you are aware of what is up with the missing plane. Fine. Now the archaeology in video format. Video of people dusting off some skulls and bits of pottery. All well and good, but archaeology isn't your thing. It would be nice to hear about something else.

&gt; Even when it isn't archaeology season, the media follow noted archaeologists. They drive fast cars, date beautiful women, advertise fragrances, and sometimes they go to nightclubs and act in the worst possible way. Scandals erupt as the tabloids follow these new celebrities when they're not searching the past for answers. It is entirely possible you can recite the names of certain researchers, even if you don't pay attention to archaeology. You don't know what transfer season is, but you know that someone was transferred to a dig in Peru for a sum of money that could fund the London Underground for two whole days.

&gt; Out of the car at 8:55 and into work. What are the colleagues talking about, I wonder? Oh, Jones dropped a 3,890 year old pot and smashed it? What a useless wanker! Someone should do something unpleasant to him. And don't even ask about the unfortunate incident in Athens two years ago - you'll be there all day! Breaking a pillar like that! We don't talk about that here, mate. What? You don't want to discuss the finer points of the prevalence of phallic imagery in Pompeii? Is there something wrong with you?

&gt; The drive home from work. Every thirty minutes, no matter the station, someone mentions the archaeology. Best sit in silence. Drive past a huge billboard with a black and white picture of a rakishly handsome archaeologist draped over an impossibly beautiful woman. He's winking at you. Trowel in his left hand, supermodel in the right. Jurassic, by Calvin Klein.

&gt; And now the pub. A nice pub with a beer garden. Posters in the windows. LIVE EXCAVATION AT THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS! All of it on a huge TV with the volume up too loud. Drunken people yelling at the screen. ""SEND IT FOR CARBON DATING, YOU USELESS ***K!"" ""WHAT ARE YOU ON, MATE? DUST THE ANCIENT MEDALLION GENTLY! SMELTING METHODS OF THE TIME PRODUCED VERY SOFT AND IMPURE METALS EASILY PRONE TO DISFIGURATION!"" All this from two men out of a crowd of twenty. One lousy drunken idiot and his chum ruin the image of other archaeology fans. Carbon dating report from the lab updates on TV, read by a man employed because they've been following the beautiful science since they were a boy. The drunk chimes in again. ""WHAT PHARAOH'S REIGN DID YOU SAY? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR THEORY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF 4TH BC EGYPT? GET IN, MATE!"" A cheer cascades through the building and you can only wonder why.

&gt; Best go home and avoid anyone who might be drinking and singing. You once met a disagreeable chap who threatened to beat you up because you didn't watch the archaeology. ""Not a late paleolithic era supporter are you? Think you're better than me? I'll have you, you scrawny tw*t!""

&gt; To bed. To repeat the cycle tomorrow. The inescapable, inevitability that wherever you go, someone, somewhere, is just dying to talk to you about the archaeology.

I've had a girl tell her mother about how she planned to spend the night at my place while we were on the phone with the mother, but when I joked about being an awesome boyfriend she said, ""Whoa!

"Letting me pay her drink, before coming over. I mean... No. ""He will pay for me"" and having me pay for a 12 bucks cocktail for a person I'm a) not attracted to b) am already pissed, will not make me wanna get to know you.

Tell her it's an error in colour coding and it only dispenses vanilla. 
"I got too fat. 

Totally reasonable. I *had* gotten too fat. I was always a bit on the heavy side, and she still loved me as I was gaining weight and that's amazing to me, because when I look back on pictures of me... holy hell. Anyway, at a certain point, it was just too much.

She tried to play it off as other issues when we were breaking up, but she eventually fessed up. I don't recall even being mad that was the reason. It was just... Yep. I'm fat.

I've lost a lot of weight since then and even joined the Army. My life's headed in the right direction and that will never be a problem for me again. Everybody has a right to their preference, and I can't fault her or anyone else in my future for it."
"She was expecting him to say, ""Go to bars."" or something. She should have said, ""Hey, do people go somewhere when they're trying to find a date?"" and then he would have said, ""Usually bars I think?"" and she would have said, ""Wanna go to a bar with me?"""
"&gt;I was out on a date for with a girl once and she invited herself back to my place, then she decided it was too late to get a cab and asked if she could stay over...so I made up a bed fo her on the sofa and went to bed.  
  
Oh, man. On Halloween about 4 years ago, I ran into a coworker at a bar. She's out of my league, so when she says, ""I'm going home with you"" and turns to her friends and says ""I'm going home with him"", I just assumed she didn't want to go home. Not that she wanted to go home *with me*.  
  
Did the same thing:  made her a bed on the couch and went to my room. "

"I remember feeling what you're feeling when I was 21 and just got a reasonably good job. One week later my pay check came through as I was sitting on my balcony drinking tea in the afternoon and I realised I could do pretty much exactly whatever I felt like.

I could:

Go up to a girl at the supermarket and ask her out and we could make an evening of it.

Buy all of the ingredients for a huge lasagna and eat it all myself.

Save some of my money and go somewhere completely different from where I live.

Pursue any of my hobbies to the point where I gain mastery over them.

Et cetera.

Don't get me wrong, there's a box. It's a pretty large box, however, and being a single guy with what I assume is a steady job at the beginning of your life means you're in a very fortunate and free time in your life.

"When she's cold the first thing that feels cold to the touch is the tip of her nose. So when we started going out, sometimes instead of asking if she's cold I started touching or kissing the tip of her nose, and at some point she started rubbing the tip of her nose on my neck or somewhere sensitive to say she was cold. Sometimes I'll just be relaxing and I feel this tiny soft cold boop on my ear and I'll turn around to see her demanding cuddles because she's cold. "

"It sucked. 

For whatever reason, no matter how much I could tell that something was wrong she just wouldn't own up to it. 

Then after about 3 months, I come home from work after a particularly shit day at the office and I can just see it on her face. She's cleaning the apartment, and she just has that look. 

If you've ever been with an SO long enough, then you know the look I mean. The 'We need to talk' look. Unfortunately I needed to not be near anyone. So, because the 3 months of trying to get her to talk to me prior to this had failed. I just went to my office and spun up my servers to start working on a few projects to chill out. 

She comes in and sits down, crying and the big reveal happens. 

I felt... well a lot of things? Betrayal? After the weekend of her telling me she loves me and all that good stuff. Coming home to this? Tore me up. 

We tried for another 3 months to make it work. It didn't, maybe I tried to hard to keep the pieces together. But that part of our lives was over. Eventually we split for about two months. 

After about a month apart, I was casually seeing someone. My then-ex was still texting me. She tells me she wants to get back together, but in order to do that she had to tell me somethings. 

Well she had really screwed up the first weekend we split. Two guys and a girl (not at the same time), some drugs, etc. (I've known her a long time. This was 100% not her. Not even on her bad days, to her this was like the end of times.) But it didn't matter, damage was done. I saw red, and it was a about 3 weeks before I agreed to sit down and talk. 

Now, to put things in perspective. She has never lived on her own. She had a friend who had built up this romanticized version of being single. Some real Bridget Jones diary, How to be single kinda shit. I wasn't sure where the new found desire for ""freedom"" came, I never had any issues with her going out, festivals with friends, house party, hangout at the bar. So long as she kept me up to date with where she was so I didn't worry, it was all cool. ( I did the same ) I told her the real world doesn't work like that. She learned some more lessons the hard way while we were split. 

To me it seemed like she was coming back purely because she got bit in the ass. I saw the flags, but we still had an apartment together, 3 cats and I loved her more than anything. Maybe I came on too strong? Maybe she just needed to learn a few hard lessons, I know I did. I stopped searching for answers to be honest. 

At this time I had cut ties with the casual girl for varying reasons. So I agreed we could casually date, and she could stay at the apartment again. From there she worked her ass off to show how much this changed her. How much remorse and regret she had. She never did anything to mismanage my trust, she was open and honest. ( We are very open anyways. I could have looked at her phone any day of the week. I just had no desire too. I can read her like a book and I knew when something was up) If I asked her what was wrong, she told me. 

She's never asked me to pay her bills, or to do more than pure 50/50. Even before everything fell apart. So I went against every red flag I saw and said ""Fuck it, one more chance."" 

3 years later, things are better than before. She's never wavered, not like the first 3 years of our relationship. She never says ""I"" it's always ""We"".

Next spring, after my loans are off, I plan to buy a ring. 

So, kinda long. But just a tale of how it can sometimes workout, if everything aligns properly.  "

My biggest pet peeve is when people take big divots out of the dip and put it back in the fridge. Then the dip separates in the fridge and there is a pool of congealed shit in the divot.

The only thing I could think of was that she is in fact a man. I sat by the river getting drunk, contemplating life. I want her, no matter what, even if she is a man.

I spoke with her girlfriend though and she said that's not it. But I came to the decision that it doesn't matter.

"I found out last summer that my little sister was actually a mistake and my mom wanted an abortion. My dad was against it and they ended up having her still. My parents got divorced a few years later and my dad tried to split us up. He only wanted my little sister....But my mom fought for full custody and got us both so we wouldn't be separated. I won't ever tell my little sister or dad that I know this. 

Edit: To clarify, I found out from my grandma. Also, my mom wanted us both to keep us together and also to give us a better life by moving out of a small town with minimal opportunities. As for why my dad only wanted my little sister, maybe he felt closer to her because I'd always be upset when leaving my mom. But in reality, we saw him the same amount of time. Maybe it would've just been easier to have just her. "

"The problem is, as a guy, you inherently understand this:

&gt; I was much stronger than her, so even in nightmare land where a girl would actually try to hurt me, I knew I would win.

There is something of a social expectation of men that not only can you take care of yourself, you can take care of others. If you confide weakness to someone else, or that you made an error in judgement and put yourself in the position to become a victim, it's often going to diminish your reputation in the eyes of others somewhat.

I'm not justifying this. I'm just saying, we don't always have people in our lives that would respond well to these kind of admissions. But I think repressing your feelings and moving on with life, is a lot more effective than it's sometimes perceived. And especially for guys, it's usually safer than giving someone access to your secrets, or worrying how it effects their opinion of you. The world respects us handling our shit a lot more than needing help with it -- even with the disclaimer that it's ""ok"". 

I think guys always appreciate empathy and understanding. But confiding in others doesn't come naturally for men, and there a lot of good reasons not to. So we usually end up keeping a lot of heavy shit to ourselves, for better or worse.

Just my own rambling feelings on this, apply salt as necessary."

Don't overthink or question your relationship right now. Just keep it going, and get to know each other. The more you do that, the stronger your relationship will get, and the more confident you will become in it. Taking advice from a 20 year old virgin on how to ""run game and shittest"" is only going to lead you to a baaaaad time. "

"I have an experience like this.

My roommate and I went to go check out a DJ who is massive now but was just getting big about 4 years ago. This was in our student town and we went to one of the more popular student nightclubs there. 

We took some illicit substances for the show and also drank heavily. We met these two girls there (not very attractive) who wanted to hang out with us after and we brought them over to our place. Our place was right across from the university town's nightlife district and people came by after all the time to hang out, play some XBox, and hit some bowls. There was nothing abnormal about this for me and my roommate as randoms always came over after due to our vicinity and how open the rest of my roommates were. I wasn't feeling too well and went to the upstairs bathroom to puke and eventually pass out. The last thing I remember was passing out on the bathroom floor (I was in second year and pushed myself past my limit).

The next thing I know I wake up and she is on top of me and taking off my pants. She tried getting on top of me and I was in no condition to fight back. Thank god I was too fucked up to get it up, but it was a pretty messed up experience nonetheless.

It affected my life in a good way, I think. I'm much more vigilant of my friends now, both girls and guys. When I worked as a doorman at that same club a few years later I was especially on the look out for girls who have had too much to drink or been drugged, and I stopped a lot of ""incidents"" to my credit. However I do distrust women a little bit and don't like one night stands anymore."

"&gt;What do you wish more women knew about men?

A while back a user on AskMen posted passages from the book ***Self-Made Man: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man*** by Norah Vincent.  The book is about a woman who goes undercover as a man to understand what it's like.

Edit: /u/reasonbeing9 shared a video clip of her ""in the field"" on the dating scene, cued up to the relevant part:

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip7kP_dd6LU&amp;t=9m21s

Credit to /u/exit_sandman for finding these passages from the book, related to dating:

&gt; An interesting passage about her realizing the feminist fallacies about what women actually want to have in men.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    I was most surprised to find nestled inside the confines of female heterosexuality a deep love and genuine attraction for real men. Not for women in men's bodies, as the prejudicial me had thought. Not even just for the metrosexual, though he has his audience, but for brawny, hairy, smelly, stalwart, manly men; bald men, men with bellies, men who can fix things and, yes, men who like sports and pound away in the bedroom. Men whom women loved for being men and all the qualities that testosterone and the patriarchy has given them, and whom I have come to appreciate for the very same qualities, however infuriating at times I still find them.
&gt; 
&gt; Or how funny the dating experience as a man can be.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    But for those women - who had never dated other women, and thus never been romantically hurt by them - men as a subspecies, not the particular men with whom they had been involved, were to blame for the wreck of a relationship and the psychic damage it had done to them.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   It's hardly surprising, then, that in this atmosphere, **as a single man dating women, I often felt attacked, judged, on the defensive.** Whereas with the men I met and befriended as Ned there was a presumption of innocence - that is, you're a good guy until you prove otherwise - with women there was quite often a presumption of guilt: you're a cad like every other guy until you prove otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    ""Pass my test and then we'll see if you're worthy of me"" was the implicit message coming across the table at me. And this from women who had demonstrably little to offer. ""Be lighthearted,"" they said, though buoyant as lead zeppelins themselves. ""Be kind,"" they insisted in the harshest of tones. ""Don't be like others,"" they implied, while having virtually condemned me as such beforehand.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   The bitterest women I met were usually in their midthirties or older. They'd been through the mill a bit and they'd probably had more than their share of hellish dates or hit-and-run relationships before I came along. To hear them tell it, the pool of eligible, mature, stable, reciprocating, emotionally evolved men out there was small and polluted, and having to wade through it when what you wanted most in life was to settle down and start a family would be enough to shorten anyone's fuse.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;    Then again, many of the women I met weren't emotional giants either, nor were they particularly well adjusted or stable. They just considered themselves as such. And even the ones who knew they were damaged seemed to feel entitled to expect stolidity from a man, as if, in the time-honored way of things, a man is supposed to be strong, to hold things together for a woman, to hold her up when she can't do it herself.

A great podcast episode that's also relevant:

[This American Life 220: Testosterone](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220/testosterone)

I highly recommend listening to [Act 2: Infinite Gent](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220/testosterone?act=2).  It's about someone who received massive doses of testosterone. While it may not be representative of every male's experience, it made me think more about my urges and desires in a new light.

Excerpt:

&gt; Griffin Hansbury: My first injection was a pretty large one of 2 ccs of 200 milligram strength depo-testosterone, which is a fairly high amount. Just to give you a sense of how much that is, the average amount of testosterone in an average male body is between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter of blood. After that shot, and after an average shot, my testosterone levels go up to over 2,000 nanograms per deciliter, so that I have the testosterone of two high-testosterone men in my body at once.
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Blumberg: You have the testosterone of two linebackers.
&gt; 
&gt; Griffin Hansbury:
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. Exactly. That's a lot. That's a lot of T. And what's amazing about it is how instantaneous it is, that it happens within a few days really. The world just changes.
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Blumberg: What were some of the changes that you didn't expect?
&gt; 
&gt; Griffin Hansbury:
&gt; 
&gt; The most overwhelming feeling is the incredible increase in libido and change in the way that I perceived women and the way I thought about sex. Before testosterone, I would be riding the subway, which is the traditional hotbed of lust in the city. And I would see a woman on the subway, and I would think, *she's attractive. I'd like to meet her. What's that book she's reading? I could talk to her.* This is what I would say.
&gt; 
&gt; There would be a narrative. There would be this stream of language. It would be very verbal.
&gt; 
&gt; After testosterone, there was no narrative. There was no language whatsoever. It was just, I would see a woman who was attractive or not attractive. She might have an attractive quality, nice ankles or something, and the rest of her would be fairly unappealing to me.
&gt; 
&gt; But that was enough to basically just flood my mind with aggressive, pornographic images, just one after another. It was like being in a pornographic movie house in my mind. And I couldn't turn it off. I could not turn it off. Everything I looked at, everything I touched, turned to sex.
&gt; 
&gt; . . . 
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Blumberg: What did you do with that? I mean, what did you think?
&gt; 
&gt; Griffin Hansbury:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I felt like a monster a lot of the time. And it made me understand men. It made me understand adolescent boys a lot. Suddenly, hair is sprouting, and I'm turning into this beast. And I would really berate myself for it.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember walking up Fifth Avenue, there was a woman walking in front of me. And she was wearing this little skirt and this little top. And I was looking at her ass. And I kept saying to myself, *don't look at it, don't look at it.* And I kept looking at it.
&gt; 
&gt; And I walked past her. And this voice in my head kept saying, *turn around to look at her breasts. Turn around, turn around, turn around.* And my feminist, female background kept saying, *don't you dare, you pig. Don't turn around.* And I fought myself for a whole block, and then I turned around and checked her out."
"I was at a concert talking to a rando about our jobs when his very overweight cousin overhears that I have my shit together and sticks her hand out ""I'm OverweightCousin69, single and ready to mingle!"""
It just sounds so boring. I'm probably just a naive young person though. 
"I was insecure and I didn't know how to deal with someone who actually liked me so I sabotaged my own relationship.  Wish I hadn't, I really liked her."
"Driving a gigantic diesel truck with 40"" tires doesn't make anyone think you're cool. In fact, everyone literally hates you."

"That sounds much easier to interpret,  bravo."

"I wanted to join a counseling program due to crippling self-esteem issues in university. Signed up for it and got the response that the program is only available to women and there's no equivalent for men.    

It sucked. Took me weeks to work up the courage to send that Email and finally decide to get help and then you get blown off."
But don't overdo it with the smalltalk.  Sometimes it can make people tense up and back away.
"There was a girl I met (also Tinder), who was totally normal texting.


First date though, she's *so* forward. Around an hour in, moves to sit right next to me and try to hold my hand etc. Sighs romantically and longingly mutters about how we'd spend our Sundays, with the kids running around.


I got out of there pretty fast. "
"So I had broken up with my girlfriend a couple months prior, was going through the paces and had been with a couple different girls, one night I through a party at my house and this decently attractive girl came on to me...

One thing led to another and we engaged in some sub par sex. 

She was a pretty chill girl and we met a couple times after and did the same thing, the sex was sex...

Flash forward a month or so and she hits me up after drinking with some friends, she want to Fuck and I couldn't disagree, I had been drinking too and thought we'd meet up. 

I drive over to where she's at, she comes out, hops in the car and we take off to find a secluded spot. 

Hop in the back seat and start getting to it, it wasn't easy (she wasn't the slimmest or most flexible girl) and to be frank It was just too much work... 

I had told her I wanted to end it but she wasn't having it, my dick went limp while still in her but she refused to get off and said fuck it to the condom aswell, stripping my dick of its protection and shoving it back into her. 

I'm not a small guy but the awkwardness of the position and the cramped space of the car prevented me from pushing her off, and FOR WHAT EVER FUCKING REASON MY BODY DECIDED NOW WAS A GOOD TIME TO SHOOT COME OUT OF MY LIMP DICK IN TO HER VAGINA. 

So no I'm done, real done, I finally push her off and this chick goes berserk. 

She starts saying crazy shit and it freaks me the Fuck out. I record it secretly on my phone and drive back to where I picked her up. She refuses to get out of my car, still doesn't have her pants on blah blah blah. 

Her friend comes out apologizes and convinces her to come with her. 

About a week later she starts texting me asking me weird questions like ""what's your middle name"" and personal info kinda stuff... 

I freak out even more and file a closed report just to cover my ass if she decides to do something crazy... 

About a year after that we finally talk she's fine and all and it's been brushed under a rug really but for about 9 months after I was secretly worried as hell/ couldn't get it out of my mind...

Tl;dr 

FWB drunkly refuses to stop, strips me of condom, body decided to cum, she talks crazy, I file closed report, everything's good now.

"I've been through that. What worked for me was ""fake it til you make it"". Basically if I got rejected, even if I was devastated, I would just go ""ok no problem"" and go do something else immediately, like housework. 

If you find yourself frustrated due to frequency, you should bring it up at a time you're not initiating. It's a normal thing to happen throughout a relationship. "

"At the gym. 

Her English wasn't that good but she stopped and introduced herself when she saw me. Being the only foreigner there, I'm a rarity. 

She's not in shape and quite awkward. Not my type but I'm happy to talk when I can. 

One day she asks if I have a girlfriend and says that she doesn't have a boyfriend. Then she proceeds to give me her email address. 

Now every time I see her she asks when I'm going to send her an email. 

Lovely girl but I'm not going to lead her on. Just leaving it at friendly conversation. "

"I'm not entirely sure why, but when I see horses I tend to bail"
"I'm pretty bad at explaining stories, but here goes. I don't know if this counts, but I wanted to be in a relationship with this person, but I completely ruined it.

The person I'm talking about is my high school crush. We kept in touch after high school and for about 2 years, we have this weekly thing where we just make playful fun of each other, and in one of those sessions, I went too far.

During one of those sessions, she started it by calling me a pig. I had a status ""I'm so hungry, I could eat a bucket filled with fried chicken"" (or something, along those lines) in Yahoo Messenger, it was payback from a week previously, where I called her a cow for having a status, basically craving for pizza. After calling me a pig, I tried to find stuff to say to one up her, but couldn't think of anything good.

Despite not being the closest of friends, she's opened up to me about a lot of her problems throughout of short friendship. How she felt upset she didn't get accepted to the university that she liked, how she wished her parents would get back together, how she's afraid of other's opinion of her, and how they look at her as a bit childish.

It was there I used all her confessions to me against her, all her problems, all her mistakes, all her shortcomings. I was on the attack. During our last chat, I told her she was stupid, how getting accepted to the uni was easy, and that she was too stupid to get in. To make matters worse, I connected all her vulnerabilities and used it against her, even though none of them are connected. Like how I even told her that her dad left her because as early as her childhood, he saw that he had a stupid daughter and left or how her brain is lagging behind that's why people think she acts like a child. I kept going, and going, and going, I didn't realize how horrible the things I said was, until she called me, and I quote, a ""Jackass!"". Something that started as a playful tease, turned into a living nightmare for both of us.

When I realized what I've done, I tried to apologize, but it was already too late, I reached a point where she probably would never forgive me. I tried calling, I tried texting days after it happened, but got no reply, and just like that, friendship was over.

The girl I love let herself be vulnerable around me, and like a sicko, I used it against her and shattered her heart into a million pieces. I feel disgusted, I can't believe the things I said to her, and ugh, I wish I could say it wasn't me, but it was, I really don't know how to live with myself knowing I hurt the woman I love. Almost a decade, here I am, still deeply regretting my actions, and going through depression.

It's funny, we were never really a couple but a lot of people(both my and her friends) thought we would make a great one, I sure let a lot of them down. I wish I knew what to do.

Anyway, that's how the story ends, not sure what else to add, I'm sure I'm missing some details here and there but the most important message was told, I acted like a jackass to the woman I love, and now I'm treated like a jackass. I wish this was a movie, and I'm about to start the sequel, where we magically run into each other, we get together, I make up for all my past mistakes and we live happily ever after. Sad reality is, this is real life, and more often than not, things in movies don't happen, and what's more likely to happen is that I get hit hard and fall flat on my back. All I can do now, is find ways to make the movie sequel a reality, and do my best to set things right.

I'm so sorry."
"I married at 31.

My partner changed me for the better in pretty much every way.

I think my wife is the first women I've gone out with that didn't view me as plan-b or the placeholder boyfriend.  So, having someone really want you was insanely gratifying.

As for physical changes - I don't know.  I started lifting again at 50 after my wife asked me when I was expecting. Does that count?"

"**In order for us to help you, please provide more description of your Macbook.**

- Is your laptop a Macbook Air or Pro? 

- What size is your laptop, 13"" or 15""? 

- Which OS X is it running on? (10.9 Mavericks, 10,10 Yosemite, 10.11 El Capitan)?

In the meantime, go ahead and reset your [SMC/PRAM](http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2010/12/04/how-when-why-to-reset-the-pram-smc-on-your-mac/) (it will reset your laptop's power management system - the cheapest solution).

For the PRAM, some laptops can have their power management reset by having their battery removed, hold down power button for 20 sec. Install the battery in and hopefully the power settings will reset and it will recharge again. 

If its a charger issues, I suggest you try to borrow from someone to see if your old charger is going bad. If it charges with another charger, then its your charger thats faulty. Make sure your wattage of charger is compatible with your laptop. 13"" operates on 65W, 15"" is on 85W (I think).

If its a battery issue, get a new one. Normally, the software should be able to tell you if its not charging correctly or you can examine the battery health on your computer. You can check by going to Apple logo on top left -&gt; About this mac -&gt; more info -&gt; system report -&gt; power -&gt; There is an option that says *condition*.

If all else fails, you're better off at the apple store. Worse case scenario is that your logicboard's power system might be failing and will need replacement. 

I will try to help you. Reply back to my post I'll keep checking. Good luck!

**EDIT:**

What browser were you using? Was it on incognito mode? If not, what's going to happen is fi you take it to apple store for repair, your laptop's memory has cache files stored onto it. So whenever you boot up your laptop, the cache files from memory loads first as soon as computer completely boots up to GUI (user) interface. As a result, the windows you were viewing may appear again (meaning your content will be brought where you left it off). If it was on incognito mode, it won't remember because incognito does not store cache in memory.

Next time, use incognito mode for watching porn (because it doesn't store files onto your harddrive and never tracks history, current location), use Zenmate Web firewall, Fair Adblock, Dr. Web Anti-Virus Link Checker running (this is all for extra security to protect your laptop from harmful data, viruses, etc.). Be advised that these chrome extensions will slow down your computer but if you have an SSD (solid state drive), your laptop will hardly break a sweat. "

It is widely agreed upon and accepted by ourselves, friends, and my gf that he is my wife and we're married.

He thinks its hilarious and will do ""wife things"". He texts me little things and asks if my gf has done similar. If I say no, he'll text me ""wife&gt;girlfriend"". Although we always split the tab, he complains to the staff that ""i never take him on dates anymore"". Whenever my gf is over, he will solomnly stand nearby and say ""I remember when you used to hold me like that"" and run off to another room fake sobbing.

Suddenly she reaches out to her side with one hand and starts massaging the shoulder of some guy at the bar while continuing to dance with me. He turns his head slowly and just smiles at me.

"&gt; The feeling when your team scores, wins, loses, etc. it's an amazing feeling

That's the thing: I don't have a team.

You are excited about your team because you know their story.  You know they are on a hot streak and you want to see if they keep it up.  You know they have been losing forever and maybe this will be the start of a comeback.  You know that Player X was away with an injury for the last 5 games, and now he is back.  You know that Team A and Team B faced off in the Super Bowl last year, and you want to see who is going to win this time.  You know that the lead pitcher for tonight's baseball game is on your fantasy league team.

People who don't follow sports have none of that background drama.  For us, watching sports is literally just watching random people in arbitrarily colored uniforms run on a field and throw a ball back and forth.  We don't know the story.

That's how you get trampled
"Very true.

I re-read my post and realized I didn't give enough actionable advice. So here are a few tips I've shared before.

Girls like it when you fondle their . . . minds. 

There are two parts to sexual tension: 

* Build-up: flirting, foreplay, etc.

* Release: sex.

Where some guys go wrong is trying to skip from build-up to release. This usually fails.

There's a saying that men are like microwaves and women are like ovens. Men get horny fast and it's over fast. Women are slower to heat up but last longer.

What I've found works best when flirting in a relationship is to consistently keep your girl at a simmer, so she's always more open to the idea of sexy times. 

You might tap into her lust that day, you might not. You have that luxury to choose. Sometimes it builds up so much passion that she has to jump on you instead.

Her mind is a major erogenous zone. Words, metaphors and imagery can be a huge turn-on. Language and hints are her porn.

Ideas:

* Physical affection and touching.

* Flirting and teasing. Talk, phone calls, text. 

* Do romantic things for her--*outside* of normal holidays. Big gestures can come off as desperate and needy. I've found little things can be deadly effective, e.g. cute post-it notes, a pack of her favorite snack on her desk at work, etc. 

* Hot tip: if you know when she's on her period or going through tough times and do something nice for her unexpectedly (like when you're not there with her), it's 10x more powerful. Thoughtfulness trumps the amount of money spent. 

Women seem to love little pleasant surprises and variety. Don't do it all the time to the point you drown her in affection and kill the effect; enough to get her excited once in a while and keep her on her toes.

The key is to *don't do these things only when you want sex that day*. Women figure that out fast and feel manipulated. That's when they start to get suspicious and resentful whenever you do something nice for them, because they think a request for sex is coming.

The foreplay started with that compliment you gave her on the hot new dress she bought last week. Foreplay is an ongoing process. On the flip side, maybe she's denying sex now because you argued with her best friend six months ago.

Easier to flirt all the time, but not escalate to sex every time. Make it a lottery, not an ATM transaction. Random, unpredictable payoffs are addictive.

Don't spend 100 percent of your time with her. You have work, hobbies and friends, a well-rounded life. Give her the gift of missing you. Ideally, she should be drowning in sexy anticipation, wondering when you're going up and ravish her. 

If it's a new relationship and you've hooked up with her a few times: when you're out of bed, remind her of a specific detail. Something she would associate with sexy times. A special naughty secret only you two would know. Make it a secret game for only the two of you.

I did this accidentally the first few times by being flirty and goofy and just trying to make things fun. Eventually I caught on to the effect it had on girls. 

For example, there was a girl who liked to tie her hair back before we would get down to it. Sometimes, I'd hold her long hair in my hand instead.

* One time, she was washing her face. I saw some hairs straying, so I helpfully swept back some of her hair and gripped it in my hand. She shivered a little and immediately gave me *that* look. That was by accident, before I realized it was a turn-on. It was like Pavlovian conditioning, where she associated the feeling of her hair in my hand with intimacy.

* She texted me she was coming over. I jokingly texted her back: ""Bring a hair strap."" Then I went back to watching TV and promptly forgot about it. She told me later that drove her wild. She couldn't drive fast enough.

* At a boring party, I whispered in her ear: ""Let's get out of here and go somewhere you can put your hair up for me."" She grabbed my hand and pulled me along.

* If you're feeling daring and risque, reference that sexy thing with innocent-sounding language when you're both among other people. ""Ah yes, my girlfriend always has the prettiest hair straps,"" you say, while giving her a knowing, naughty look. Warning: some girls are horrified by this. Others get embarrassed but also crazy turned-on and will act on it with you later in private. 

* Send her a flirty reference just when she's arrived at work. Girls *hate* it that they're all turned on but stuck at work thinking about doing it all day long. Let her lust build. Sexual tension builds precisely when it cannot be released. Brace yourself to get pounced on when she gets home. I once texted her a picture of a hair strap in my hand. No message.

Mix it up: spoken, written, visual, little actions. Feel free to get creative. 

Let her get turned on and writhe in anticipation because she doesn't know when you'll make your move. It's okay to drive her crazy this way. She secretly desires that sweet torture. It's not manipulation, it's appreciation. You're making the extra effort to keep things exciting.

Other examples:

* One girl had this set of high-heeled shoes she always wore when she wanted to seduce me. If she came over wearing those shoes, you knew it was on.

* One girl liked to put on certain songs or singers when she was in the mood.

* One girl would spray on this special perfume if she was feeling up for it that night.

Every girl has her ""hair strap."" What's your girl's?

Remember it. Remind her of it. Have fun.

Warning: once a girl gets into it she'll often turn the tables and start doing sexy things to turn *you* on all the time. The photos and naughty texts they send, hot stuff.

This is a mind shift, but experiment with treating your mission as your SO and your SO as your mistress. I think some women like that they don't have to bear the burden of being your world, your everything. 

She's the fun escape from work; she's the sexy distraction that pulls you away from time to time. Helps to keep up the flirty vibe.

Hope this helps."

"&gt; /u/RampagingKoala Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I definitely see a previous version of myself in them. I think a lot of the users of our sub are younger guys who are hormonal and girl-crazy, and are confused and trying to figure out what that means for them. We've all been there, and I think that it's really easy to get in your own head and psyche yourself out. It's really easy to get hyped up on minor successes, and it's really easy to want to give up after tiny failures. I think that the internet has done some interesting things to us, but hopefully we'll all make it together.

"Some girl that I just met was into me. I ignored her, so she got drunk and started crying because apparently ""I hate her"". She obtained my number and wrote a long text about how she likes me and if I only gave her a chance, I would see that she's a nice girl."
"We didn't hit it off as well as she thinks. If I'm with a girl and concluded that I'm not into her I'll often prod her and ask her lots of questions and followups about herself and she'll enjoy talking about herself. Most people do. I do it to get through the awkwardness and keep the conversation going, but usually I've checked out and its a low effort way to make it through the night. People love talking about themselves though, so after getting her to talk about herself all night they tend to walk way thinking it went well.

I'll generally end it with a ""I'm not that into you"" before I head home, but a lot of people find it easier to say nothing than deliver the bad news in person."
"God this resonates more deeply with me than I care to admit. A good comparison I think of is my dog. He is dumb, big and goofy and loveable, but just because of his breed and size people try to avoid him cometely or just cross the street. Even when he just wants to make friends. By that comparison it is hard to believe someone accepts your presence let alone would ever enjoy you in an intimate way. "

"* It's normal to be attracted to attractive people 

* Some people find their attraction to others increases as they get to know them and become attracted to their personality. Are you giving less attractive women a chance to get to know you platonically? Or are you refusing to interact with women who aren't super hot?

* At the end of the day you need to figure out: Is it easier to lower your standards, or is it easier to increase your worth? If you're overweight, lose weight.

"Talking to a girl (or a guy!) you find attractive isn't a big socially choreographed exercise. It's just a conversation. If you dig each other, you dig each other; if not, then at worst, you had a nice talk with someone. Don't worry about hitting every cue and trying to church yourself up; trying too hard shows a lot more than any personality flaw or awkward habit you have might.

Friendly shittalk is a pretty common element of the male dynamic, but little complements and encouragement make a big damn difference in your friends' day.

"From 2016 two stories jump out.

1:  I'm at a gay club on dyke night (My lesbian friend didn't want to go alone, which as it turns out was for the best, because she may have been drugged).  A girl is impressed with my dance moves, tries setting me up with a guy.  I tell her I'm straight, just came with a lesbian.  Apparently she is doing the same thing.  

We dance nearby for a while, she asks me if I'm sure I'm straight.  I'm just like ""dude it's 2016 why do you care about my orientation"" and after the third time she asks, I do actually get the hint.

2:  There's a conference in town, I go to a hotel lobby with some old acquaintances to play music.  We all go out to dinner.  Everyone goes home except for this 35 year old doctor who asks if I want to get drinks (I'm 23).  I say sure, and we wander in the 30 degree weather huddling for warmth.  We get drinks, she pays the tab, we ditch.  She kisses me, I try to flirtatiously ask if more stuff is going to happen.  She jokes about doing that with every guy she meets.  

I don't realize it's a joke and don't make any moves for the rest of the night.  A few minutes later she turns off her phone saying it's out of batteries, asks me to call an uber which I do.  We keep huddling for warmth, when the uber gets here she kisses me again, tells me I'm beautiful, and has the driver wait for a minute while I wish her goodnight and stand outside awkwardly.  About a minute after the car leaves, it all hits me."

It's not. They're only looking at the ""alpha"" dudes and not at the average man. Yeah the tall, white, good looking wall street guy probably has a pretty kick ass life and a sense of entitlement you couldn't begin to understand.

"Not my romantic relationship, but one with a family member.

Awhile ago, I enthusiastically agreed to help a friend with her bridal shower next weekend. That's not the secret, the secret is why: to avoid going to the entire wedding-weekend of said family member. Why? Well, I don't support their marriage, he's spent the last 2 years bitching about her/ them/ the relationship and I can't un-hear what he's said or un-see their incompatibilities, and I don't think that I can maintain a good facade for more than a day-and-a-half, which is how long I'm going for. He thinks that this bridal shower is a big huge deal, but really, that friend didn't *need* my help, I could have easily skipped it and not be missed. 

I suspect that it'd cause some rifts if that little tidbit got out. I do feel like a douche, but hey, it's easier than the alternative in this case.

"Can people have close friends of the opposite gender and still keep it strictly platonic? Yes it does happen. Except it can get messy. Human emotions are a funny thing. Sometimes people get intimate during stressful times not because they are incredibly attracted to the other person but rather because of the emotional bond one can develop. 

If my SO has a best guy friend, I have no real problem on the surface. I trust my SO and her intentions. I also trust her ability to understand the guy's intentions. If the guy is interested in her, at one point was, or at one point they had ""history"" then I have an issue with that. Not a ""you can't hangout with him"" issue but something that would need to be talked about seriously. With both of them. 

Now lets say it's just a guy friend with no history and he isn't trying to hit on her. No problems if they hangout or talk. It's just that when that gets excessive. If my SO is hanging out with her male best friend a little too often I would find issue with that. I am fine with friends and I understand you can't spend every moment with your SO. Plus nobody would want that. It's just that when hanging out happens often, choices are made to spend time with them over me. 

I also feel that there are certain situations I would not be comfortable with. Constant one on one hanging out. If she is just going over to his place, that's weird.

All in all I think healthy relationships can occur. I just think rules should be established and boundaries made known. "

"Yes, a few times. 

One of them didn't tell me but I suspected. She was incredibly sweet and smart but she never wanted to spend any time; she just wanted sex as soon as we met up (good sex too, i didn't mind).

Eventually she cracked while I was holding her after sex. She was engaged to be married and although the guy was stable, successful and likeable, she wasn't sure she felt the spark. 

The next time we met she asked me directly if I thought she was making a mistake. She looked me straight in the eye and asked if I thought anyone else could ever love her. I liked her. Really liked her. Much more than I'd intended. I was pretty sure that given the chance I could fall for her like a ton of bricks. 

But I couldn't do it. Not like that, not by demolishing what someone else had built. So I said I didn't know and I walked away. She married him. And by god I wonder to this day whether I might not have been truly, really happy with her and I missed it."

"A few years ago I was at a bar with a couple friends. I was sitting at a table near the edge of the dance floor taking a break while my friends were dancing away to some country song. I see this girl coming around the edge of the dance floor in my direction, eyeing me up like I'm a piece of meat. 

She sits down next to me, leans over and tells me that I should go with her. I politely decline and she just repeats her statement that I am to go with her and she saunters away. I just shrug and go back to my drink while I wait for the country music to end so I can get back on the dance floor.

I tell my friends about it and they just laugh it off. Some time passes and a while later I'm once again sitting at our table alone and I see her edging around the dance floor except this time there is more drunken sway to her step. I just ignore her as she again sits down near me.  She leans in  and states that I didn't follow her. I respond that ""Sorry I'm not interested. I'm just here hanging out with my friends and having some drinks and dancing.""  At this time the current song playing ends and one of my friends wanders back off the dance floor and sits down on the other side of me. My friend is smiling like an idiot cause she knows that this is the girl who propositioned me earlier.

I turn away from the random girl and start to chat with my friend. At this point the random girl grabs my shoulder and leans in towards me while loudly growling in my ear ""I'm not looking for a god damn relationship. I just want to fuck."" She then bites my shoulder, and I'm not talking sexy nibble or anything, she was going for blood (It broke skin and was there for a few days) The girl looks pleased with herself and once again tells me that I'm going with her and she walks away without looking back. My friend just starts laughing as I'm sitting there with a WTF look on my face.  

My friends almost killed themselves laughing about it, especially when we found out how bad she bite me.  I just continued on with my evening while keeping an eye out for the biter. At some point one of my friends lets me know that they saw her leaving with a random guy who I am assuming was going to give her that dick she was apparently craving.

**TL;DR - Turned a girl down and got bit.**"
Yup! I think she forgot about telling me but I remember that day like it happened yesterday

"Challenge accepted!  
  
We were at a college bar. Let's call her ""J"". J was drunk, but not too drunk where she couldn't remember what happened the next day. At first, she tried having a chat with me. I'm an oblivious, introverted, and reserved guy - I kept my responses short. Then, she wanted to dance/grind with me, I kindly refused, said I don't dance. Finally, she said, ""d8nkey, do you want to me to buy another bottle of liquor and come back with me to my apartment to drink?"", my response, ""J, you're already drunk, and I know you blew a lot of money on that tab tonight, it's fine.""  
  
The next day - I asked her if she was alright from last night, if she wanted to get coffee to help last night's drinking. I remember an embarrassed response, but didn't understand why.

"Just over a year ago, I was raped by a woman.

I don't know if I picked up a drugged-drink intended for someone else, or if it was intended for me. In the end it doesn't matter, because she took advantage of it regardless. I don't remember anything after about 10pm that night, but the evidence was there.

My body responded to her physical contact, despite my unconsciousness. (Nasty fluids all over me). My rectum had been torn from a dildo(s) etc.

I woke up naked, in pain, and with a dildo up my ass lying next to this whale. After I come to, I immediately went into shock. I found most of my clothing and ran out of the house. I regret this the most.

Had it not been for the immediate shock and shame, I would have 100% killed that bitch. I still want to. My anger for her has given me insight into the people capable of murder.

I went to the police, got laughed at. I spent the next 11 months as a hermit. I avoided family, cut off all friends, and stewed in my anger. The occasional pictures of that night sent from her set me back on any progress i was making.

#if this happened to you, please PM me. I don't want anyone to end up like I have."
"To me it seems less about men vs women getting along, and more how they *handle* not getting along.  
  
Most guys I've seen (myself included) simply brood when they have to be around people they don't like.  We keep to ourselves and don't engage.  It's like a *recognized* thing.  
  
I see women actively hating and talking shit about each other when they don't like people."
"I was in my early twenties as was in the very early stages of accepting that I really prefer fucking dudes. At this point I had been in an extraordinarily unhealthy marriage with a women, and slept with plenty, both before and after. I was under the foolish assumption that being gay meant that it was literally impossible to have sex with girls, so coming to grips with the fact that I had literally fantasized about men my entire life was kinda odd.

At some point during this time I was at a private party with a couple of mates. Standard drunken early twenties partying. During the evening the girl whose apartment we're in is just slamming down booze like she's trying to win a competition. It's a bit awkward, since the rest of us are not in any mood for keeping up with that pace. She obviously gets hammered, and then starts acting rowdy. You know when girls get really drunk and think they're doing ""sexy"" things, but it's mostly just weird or gross. At some point she's swinging around a 1½ foot dildo that she presumably pulled from her stash.

People had been slowly leaving for a while, because it was pretty uncomfortably being in the same apartment as this girl, but the party was still sort of going. Then she disappears. People notice, but no one really wants to figure out what happened to her, because everything is much more pleasant not that she's gone. After a bit I start feeling guilty, so I go looking for her to see if she's all right. I find her in her bedroom, punching her mirror. This is where a clever person would have turned around and left her alone. She was clearly still breathing.

But me being a complete idiot I go over to her and ask if she is ok. This starts one of those pathetic drunken rants that we all fall victim to once in a while. Her's is just particularly bad. She's going on and on about how nobody loves her because she's just a whore, how she's useless and stupid. It just goes on and on. She's clearly not making herself any happier, so I try talking her away from those subjects. After a bit she has cooled down a little, and I convince her that it might be a good idea to just sleep it off. Thinking I've handled the situation decently I get up to leave the room, when she grabs my wrist. ""No, I don't want to sleep. I want to fuck. Fuck me"".

For million good reasons I **really** don't want to do that. I tell her so, and try to be both firm and polite about it. She sits back on the bed and does that pathetic sullen face some girls do. I open the door to leave the room, and she says: ""If you don't stay and fuck me I will tell everyone you raped me"". She doesn't even say it loudly. Just a low muttering, almost to herself. And like an idiot I stop in the door. I am convinced that if I had just left the room right there she would just have fallen asleep and done absolutely nothing. But me stopping showed her that she could manipulate me. So she repeated, and this time with a completely different tone. Some sick sort of triumph.

And I did as she told me. I fucked her. With a dick so soft that I actually had to use my hands to stuff it inside her. She's moaning and gasping, in some absurd reenactment of a bad porn film, and suddenly she grabs me around the neck, pulls my head close to hers, looks me directly in the eye, and says ""Fucking is the only thing I'm good at. It's the only thing my dad taught me""

What little erection I had managed to conjure up before that vanished in the blink of an eye. I was 100% unable to go on. I felt like a was about to throw up. Maybe I did. I don't remember how I left the room, or the apartment. I only partially remember getting home. It's like someone pulled out the better part of two hours, until I find myself sitting in the shower and crying. Stayed there for a couple of hours, because I was afraid to run into the people I lived with, and them seeing me that way.

It took me a year or two to mentally archive what had happened. Everyone I knew from the party were all ""Oh yea, you totally banged her!"". At first I tried to explain, but even beginning to was met with refusal. They wanted their version of the story. Fair enough.

I wouldn't say it has influenced my life in any meaningful way. I've been subjected to much much worse, both before and after. It's a sore spot in my mind, that annoyingly still makes me feel ashamed when I poke it, but other than that it's just like all the other scars."
"Definitely my dog
"
"Meh. So far I've never seen a naked dude that made me think ""yup, I'd fuck that dude."" But maybe there's a dude out there that'll make my dick hard. I'm open to the idea, I just don't think it'll ever happen. 

Also I'm married and my wife isn't in to guy on guy. So no."
"""Oh, didn't I tell you already?""

""Why, no, you didn't.""

""That must be because it's none of your fucking business.""  

or

""I have one.  Her name is Noneya.  None ya business.""  "
"""How big is your boat?"""
"We don't feel ""emasculated"" by women who make the first move, that's just some women projecting their own views. *She* thinks less of him, if she has to make the first move. You should stop listening to these women."
"What's wrong?

""Nothing""

:head explodes:"
"The ability to not want to hang around me 24/7. I know it's odd, but I just can't be around anyone all the time. I know for most people, before moving in together or getting married they like to spend most of their time together. 

Just give me at least one day a week to be alone. I won't feel like I am being rejected."
"Always, I honestly have no idea how I'm even supposed to show my attraction to someone in a way that's not creepy or awkward."
"""Don't message me if &lt;blah&gt;,&lt;blah&gt;, or &lt;blah&gt;""

How 'bout I just don't message you? 

""I'm so sick of creeps on here who don't understand &lt;BLAH&gt;!""

They didn't care what your profile said before, they won't care now.  I bothered to read it and I have to get yelled at.  Next."
"Before sending an opening message on an online dating site, ask yourself if you'd want your mom or sister reading it. Most women don't respond well to ""hay bby u want sum fuck?"" And it makes it harder for the rest of us."
"I don't think it means what you think it means. Becoming an adult doesn't mean you've magically got everything figured out, and I highly doubt anyone's really got everything figured out. Of course we're not totally clueless, though."

"In middle school, people used to be able to rush the line for whoever made it in front. Then some teacher decided to make it so that the lines were ""lady's first"". This meant that once the boys reached the line, the amount of food was already low enough that the guys plates probably had 50% the amount of food the girls plates had. 

A lot of those girls also happened to be fucking assholes who'd steal extra food. None of them were poor. They weren't starving. It was a private school. "
"I would actually be highly curious about a South Korean muskrat ping pong tournament. I mean, who is organizing it? What do the muskrats get out of it? What's their training regimen? 

Shit man, I'm emotionally invested. "
I guess there's no such thing as too obvious
"Putting on my ""I don't care face"" and being all stoic in the face of everything turning into a cat 5 shitstorm. I may be cooking inside but look indifferent from the outside."
"It's one of the things we go to lounges or book clubs to discuss. 

None of us really know what we're doing. We just pretend until we end up with things we want, but can't afford, then we try to work harder to afford those things. Same applies to bills.

If you want something more, I strongly recommend travel. It's not as expensive as everyone makes it sound, and it will really help you take a step back and better understand human nature."
"Most important thing is enthusiasm, act like you're fucking pumped to be there and this is exactly what you want to do right now. Tell me that in a sexy way and that'd be bonus points. 

Good suction, going down as far as comfortable, using your hands to stroke shaft and play with the balls etc.  

Talk dirty to me, ask me where I want to put it and then let me if your down for it.  

Just look sexy, eyes up every once in a while but please don't stare, can throw you off.  "
"I already told this one recently, so I'll just quote myself:

&gt;I was at a club near my college when an unattractive blonde girl asked me to dance.  I knew her by face but not by name.  I told her I didn't know how to dance, which was mostly true.

&gt;Later that night, an attractive brunette girl asked me to dance.  I still didn't know how to dance, but I decided to give it a shot because I knew I'd regret it if I didn't.  Then she passed me off to her unattractive blonde friend.  An absolutely shameless bait and switch.

&gt;After a few awkward seconds she said, ""You don't have to dance with me if you don't want to,"" and I walked away.

"
"There is this girl who sent me a letter on Valentine's day and a few months later had her friend to tell me ""one of my friends likes you"". I was like ""k, good"". I still don't know who that person is.

Tl;dr: best approaching technique = no contact "
"In high school. Lunch bell rings. I start heading for the cafeteria since I hate waiting in lines.

Girl: why do you always head for lunch so fast?

Me: to get something to eat

Girl: there are other things to eat. Like me. If you ever want to, just let me know.

Me, being autistic and taking things literally, decided to avoid the crazy cannibal lady for the rest of the year... Someoen eventually explained what she meant a few years later when I told this story to a friend at college... o.o;"
"Wins: decent looking guy with slightly above average learning capabilities.

Losses: migraines that require drugs to fend off. The ability to become complacent super quickly so I either have to be all the way in in an almost obessive way or I'll just stop doing whatever.

Edit: it took me an hour to figure out loses isn't a word. So much for my learning being above average at all."
Crash a wedding. 
"Sometimes you can flush and it doesn't all go away.  Or one little turd will dive down during the flush but come up for air at the end.  I could see where if you flush and don't watch to ensure it all goes down, you could leave a little leftover floating in the bowl."
"ur mum's a bit biased, m8."
That last statement adds yet another reason to the list of why I'm scared to get pregnant.
Because often it feels like rejection validates the negative traits we see in ourselves while acceptance causes us to focus on the positive traits.
"""date me or ill kill myself""

it was grade 10, she was a fuckin weirdo, i said yes to get her off my back and never talked to her again. dont know what happened after that lol.. shit."
" All you fucks who send dick pics, manipulate women just to fuck them or stalk women who are clearly not interested are making dating worst for the rest of us. You are making women defensive. They feel like they are walking on eggshells in the dating world because they think so many of us are selfish assholes who are only into sex. I'm tired of having to prove that I'm not one of you."
"You know, one of the essential things you need to learn as a man (not only in dating) is to stop counting the rejections. It is unhealthy to count."
"We have feelings too, besides sex, anger, and hungry"
"Worked at a gym for a few years and this, for some reason, bothered me more than all the other shit people did. I still cannot walk by a weight tree without fixing it."
"My girlfriend.

She was born into a family with narcissistic and near sociopath parents. Abused verbally and emotionally daily. All 4 kids screwed up. Some barely functional. 

When we met i could see she was super funny and kind, but also broken inside. We dated immediately and she was torn in pieces every period when her inner pain came out. Suicidal, rage, anxiety, giving up on life. She wouldnt believe or trust my care and love, so she would try to bail from the relationship every few weeks. I mean just bolt like a terrified horse.

I have a history of anxiety and depression. I know what it is to long to end myself, so it didnt scare me. I held her, gave her massages, encouraged her to tell me and cry.  I started getting up 2 hours early with her to make her breakfast and her lunch and walk her to her car. I text every 3 hours to let her know I'm here and she's loved now. I make dinner, kiss her back and pet her head as she falls asleep.

For over a year ive done this. It was very hard at first, but week by week, month by month, she's learned its possible that she's worth someone's time and care. And through trials she's learned to trust that I'm safe and will be there tomorrow and next month. 

Now she adores me, treats me like gold, says I'm the center of her world, wants to have my children, and is generally a perfect girlfriend. Its been a long hard road but worth it. Ive done more for her than for anyone ever. Ive gone above and beyond. I hope one day our kids will do the same for someone who needs and deserves it. And be happy too.

: )"
"Nah, do it with puppy eyes, and mention you don't have much more time on earth"
If he doesn't count kissing as cheating then he should tell his girlfriend that he did that :)
"I haven't quite hit ""riches"" yet, but I think I can contribute here.  I used to make $10/hr working third shift at a food warehouse.  I now make more money per year than 90% of my fellow Americans.  Of all my friends and most of my family, I am the most well off.  

Bad things:

* You don't realize how much people complain about being broke until you aren't broke yourself.  Suddenly, half of all conversations don't apply to you.
* You don't want to spend your evenings with friends doing nothing because you'd rather be out doing the things you used to dream about doing if only you had money.
* Latent guilt caused by having more money than your loved ones.  

There are no truly awful bad things that happen when you start making money.  The hardest part for me has been watching my friends or family struggle financially year after year.  I help them out, of course, from time to time.  I think my brother owes me a few thousand!  But, watching them struggle with a problem that you no longer have is something that most people don't consider."
Why did you think he rejected her? 
Then it's perfectly okay to be blunt.  Ask him if he's interested in this continuing or not.
"     Also, I would like to apologize to all of my ex-girlfriends for my chronic laziness when it comes shaving. Beard stubble is pokey as hell.


Haha!!! So much yes!  "
Those are all pretty ambiguous and can be quite hard to read
"Shy guys can also be oblivious.

All the way up to college I was a very popular extrovert who was very shy and oblivious when it came to sexual and relationship things.

In reflection, and also as told by friends, there are MANY situations where I was invited over for a movie or to hang out and I enjoyed the time with the person but apparently missed what they were hinting at.

You don't want to come on too strong but you can't play games either. It really helps if you start by testing the waters, ex use the advice others gave to figure out if they are interested, and then if they are you might have to put yourself out on a limb by leading with ""hey, I like you""


Here's an example from my life: Turkish visiting scholar in my graduate program and I were hanging out a lot. She was very attractive but our advisor told me to ""introduce her to people! Show her a good time!"" So I didn't assume anything except that I was suppose to help her enjoy being in the US. One night while watching a movie on my projector, she nervously said ""I have something I need to tell you but I can't"" this was her usual way of saying she doesn't remember or know the English. So I responded ""ok, say it in Turkish first"" (my trick for getting people's neurons to connect.) when she did I said ""what does that mean in English?"" Her: ""Do you want to kiss me?"" 

I must have flushed red. Of course I had a little crush on her but that wasn't in mind at the moment. I responded in the Turkish she taught me accidentally saying ""hayir"" (no) in the split second when her face was starting to show she had put herself out on a limb and was crushed, in her own language, I quickly corrected ""evet! Evet!"" And kissed her.


So you might have to put yourself out there if you either think or know they have a thing for you. If you catch them off guard, they might accidentally respond negatively when they didn't mean to. The way to know they didn't meant to is they'll get super nervous and try to correct their mistake.


So good luck!
Shy guys can be pretty awesome when you get them out of their shell ; )"
"Never. I just finally gave in because we had a pretty good life together. 

I'm divorced now."
"Its just sooooo boring

Sometimes I do feel like I'm missing out when everyone is talking about it. "

She had a hairy butthole and instead of using my words to communicate that like an adult I just broke up with her. If I could change anything it'd probably be the amount of hair around her butthole.

"I have a question in addition to this one - does it matter how long they have been best friends? I have a male best friend but we've been friends since 7 years old, so it's not like he became my friend in order to get me into bed."
If they're in a club they're not jailbait.
