"Ah an election megathread, how nice of you."
"Unsolicited advice: don't take advice on how men think or feel from women. Women are not men. They don't know how we feel. This is why Cosmo is nonsense. Women telling women how men think.

You wanna know how guys think, ask guys -- like you have here.

Even better? Ask **THE** guy. Your partner. Ask *him* how he feels.

It's entirely dependent on the individual.

I, as a person, find it difficult to accept help, gifts, or compliments from people, friends, and partners.

Family environment didn't include that sort of support. 

So getting that stuff now is unfamiliar and trippy. It's something I need to work through.

"
don't you dare
"Dear /r/askmen, my election seems to be lasting more than four hours, what do?"
"Yeah, guys are going to assume that (a) you are religious, and (b) not interested in dating non-Muslims.

If you are interested in dating them, ask them out! You don't have to be the passive participant here. Why wait a around, dropping hints, hoping that he might ask you out, when you can just cut to the chase and ask him yourself.

For what it's worth, I have seen a a lot of *very* attractive women wearing hijabs, and only found it off-putting in the sense that I figured I didn't stand a chance as a Christian guy. I wouldn't want to be somehow disrespectful or ""bark up the wrong tree."""
Well say something now because hiding something like this for years is going to be viewed as way weirder than not having a sense of smell 
"***Men***

Pros:

* **In my experience** its been a lot easier to have sex with men. You know how their minds work and you know what its like to be horny in a man's mind. Courting a man is exactly what men have always hoped courting women would be like. You speak your mind then fuck if you're both interested.
* Dicks are hot. I like dicks and women don't have them.
* Grindr
* You don't have to beg for Anal/ Don't get strange looks when you talk about butt stuff.

Cons:

* Men are hairy and I don't love that. 
* Anal is an acquired skill and unless you're dealing with a pro you usually have to go slow and ease into it.

**Women**

Pros:

* Boobs are seriously so great. Oh man. Boobs are just so great.
* Vaginas have built in lube machines and were almost literally designed for a penis. Feels good man. After a life of sticking your dick in things like hands, nerf footballs, and those [water tubes that are hard to hold](http://iw.suntekstore.com/images_cache/264/10009184/suntekstore1335268071_image.jpg), its nice to put it somewhere its supposed to be.
* Women are shaped differently than men and I like that shape
* Very smooth and soft. Usually smell really nice too.
* You can roleplay a straight guy

Cons:

* Vaginas bleed sometimes and you can't have sex around that time. (unless you're about that life)
* You can accidentally become a dad just from having sex. WTF.
* Women sometimes don't fully understand your need for sex so they can get annoyed if you've got a higher sex drive than them.
* You don't have a vagina so can have some trouble knowing which buttons to push to achieve climax.

^^^^^These ^^^^^are ^^^^^my ^^^^^personal ^^^^^experiences ^^^^^and ^^^^^in ^^^^^no ^^^^^way ^^^^^do ^^^^^they ^^^^^represent ^^^^^an ^^^^^official ^^^^^or ^^^^^general ^^^^^idea ^^^^^of ^^^^^either ^^^^^men ^^^^^or ^^^^^women."
"You are disgraced. Abandon the heathen immediately, travel to your nearest snowy peak and spend six centuries in seclusion, meditating on your failure."
"During sex, suck her finger. Maintain mouth diameter until you get to the store."
She sounds like a scared person walking on very thin ice.
"Look humans are built to find resistance and push back/ problem solve. Everyone needs to have an enemy/problem. 

The annoying white girl is middle to upper class who has no clearly definable struggle or problems in their lives. This can lead to them finding the tiniest problems and self righteously speaking about them as if other people are the problem. Or making small problems to be much more important than they are. 


EDIT

I agree with myself. "
How little time I spend playing video games.
"That Adult me has a job, plenty of money for fun stuff, and I don't own a game system. 

And that I've turned down sex before cause I was too tired. (It was like 8:30 am!) 

No nevermind adult me is mad at me also for that. "
"Wait until you're sober. Then start mentioning names and places and tell her what you know. Once she knows she's been caught, dump her and find someone who respects you enough to address potential relationship problems instead of running around on you. "
"&gt; You can accidentally become a dad just from having sex. WTF.

Yep.  Time to grow up and be an adult.

Marry her.

You're sitting on a beautiful long con joke here. And I need you to alter your life plans for my enjoyment. "
I think OP needs to ask them out **and** explicitly mention how she's not religious/conservative. 
"If any of my ex's occasionally surprised me with a 6 pack of beer, or something like that I'd be thrilled. My recent ex once came over and kissed me, got very sensual out of nowhere. We had sex then she told me to shower because she was taking me to dinner.

That was the best thing I've ever got to experience in a relationship."
"""Hey I have anosmia, which means I can't smell things. I didn't tell you earlier because I felt &lt;feelings&gt; but I like/love you and feel comfortable telling you that now. I got you some flowers. Hope they smell nice coz I sure as hell don't know""

Or something like that. Throw a bit of humor in there for her or something."
"Basically it's a way to make fun of white people (which you can do without any condemnation or PC blowback) and women at the same time. What you might be talking about is the so-called Basic Bitch. It's a upper-middle class white girl, from the ages of around 16-30 (the upper limit seems to keep growing). She usually has a college education and leans liberal. But the stereotype isn't about her background so much as it is about her vapid personality and bland cultural interests. 

* She speaks like a middle schooler who is excited/outraged by the smallest things: *That was AMAZING*, *this gives me LIFE*, *I've lost my faith in humanity*, etc.

* She dresses in very popular clothing: yoga pants, Ugg boots, North Face fleece

* She is addicted to Starbucks Frappuccinos and pumpkin spice lattes

* She is obsessed with social media, particularly Instagram, since it allows her to show off and get the validation she craves

* She's generally not an intellectual powerhouse 

* She's consumed with celebrity gossip and pop culture along the lines of reality TV

* She usually has a standard tattoo like a butterfly 

* She might have vocal tics like the vocal fry or what used to be referred to as a Valley Girl accent

* She is often very into Disney movies, stuffed animals, and coloring books

* She tends not to be good with money or other adult responsibilities, which she refers to as ""adulting""

* She tends not to have any passions or hobbies outside of ""wine and Netflix"" or generic ""travel""

* The words ""I love to laugh"" will most likely be on her online dating profile

There is plenty more but you get the picture."
"This is spot on. 

It also doesn't matter one bit if every man in the world hates getting gifts if your boyfriend/husband is the one that likes it. He is the one OP should be asking this to."
"I'm calling my local butcher to let them know not to sell to my wife. I also left her a bad trip advisor, yelp and google review. I also unliked all her facebook pictures and unfollowed her on instagram. I threw out her loofah because I needed it to scrub off the meat sweats I had from yesterday and ruined it. 
Otherwise I don't know what to do, I fear being alone may be worse than this. But what can be worse than this. "
So the conclusion is: i'm being an ass about it and I just need to confront my insecurity?

I met my two closest friends because when they moved to my middle school i decided to be nice and befriend them. They both arrived at my school a couple of weeks apart and both times i became friends with them quick because i know how depressing being alone is.

We have all been close friends for like 10 years now and one of them is a male model and the other is a WR in the NFL.

They have both invited me to events that i never thought i would partake in. I have gotten to meet celebrities, been to movie premieres and got free stuff from companies.

The bad part is that since they are so busy that we never really get to hang out unless its planned out ahead way in advance. "

"Well it depends on whether you really consider me a big guy, to be honest. Some things to consider:

- First of all, did people care who you were before you put on the mask?

- On a scale from 1 to 10, how much loyalty do you have for a hired gun?

- Regarding the mask, if I took that off, would you die? 

- You don't get to bring friends -- is this a deal-breaker, or can you call it in?

- On the subject of how many of us they expect in the wreckage, brother, where do you stand?

- Unless getting caught wasn't part of your plan, you're going to be in charge of making sure the fire rises. Are you up for that?

Anyway, considering the fact that I was born in and molded by the darkness, crashing this plane -- *WITH NO SURVIVORS!* -- has worked out pretty well so far."

"Yeah.  But you're wearing something that effectively communicates to just about every guy you meet that you're a reasonably conservative Muslim.  If you don't tell them otherwise they'll keep that assumption and as you've discovered, they won't pursue you.

And then there are all the guys who aren't even talking to you because the hijab alone ruled you out for them.  Probably most atheists, for example."
"&gt; And no, I won't take the hijab off. I know too many people in the Muslim community who will look down on me for it. Not worth the trouble. If I could take it off without being judged, I would, but that's not an option. 

So. Um. Okay. The fact that you recognize the cultural burden in terms of yourself is important.

You understand this feeling you're expressing here? Where you don't want to be hassled by a cultural subset's expectations or demands? This is **exactly the same thing** your potential romantic interests are feeling when they see the hijab.

So here's the thing... Even if you get the opportunity to express your ""I'm different"" stance... You're inviting them to experience the exact same ridicule and hassle from your community that you fear would occur in removing the hijab.

Ultimately, you're trying to shift that burden from yourself to your romantic interests. And *frankly,* they're 100% in the right for staying away. I'm not saying you can't or won't find someone that will shoulder that burden but... I personally would never be able to accept it because I don't need to get into some kind of situation where familial/cultural pressures would render the relationship doomed *from the very start.*"

Make it about health:

&gt;You have gained a lot of weight since we have been together and although I love you, you are no longer a person I am attracted to. I am willing to help you lose the weight, but I am very concerned about the health of our relationship if you cannot take care of your own health.

"I actually think this is a really important topic, because it has to do with the way a lot of men think, and I'm not sure if it's healthy or not.

Essentially, I believe that most men rely solely on women for their intimacy and affection. Men do not generally feel comfortable being physical with other males, at least to a degree that would in any way satisfy the human need to be touched in a sustainable way. Not to mention emotionally, where men rarely share their more awkward thoughts or feelings with each other. Due to this sense of emotional and physical isolation, men require women in their lives in order to feel happy, because who is happy without being touched or cared about? As a result, men often decrease the value of other males, because they essentially ask the question ""If I know I need a girl to be happy, and men can never make me truly happy even if they are fun to be around, why should I ever invest seriously in a male-male relationship instead of just putting all my effort into finding a girlfriend?"" 

It's sad to see, but this is what I've observed within male circles. Men are always focused on finding a girlfriend, and in doing so, they usually pass up on opportunities to invest in each other. That being said, I'm not sure if it's avoidable, or natural. I'm also not sure if it's a good or bad thing. I do imagine that, if we could have  healthier friendships, we could be happier and less dependent upon women. However, I also realize that these judgments are based on practical reality. It's silly to expect another straight male to enjoy touching you, or listening to your feelings. Our desire for affection is heavily rooted in our very primal sexuality, which is further rooted in physical urges more so than a mental desire for social contact. Because of that, I don't think men can gain as much from something like cuddling with another straight guy while watching Netflix, because even though it may be nice in its own way, we just don't really care if someone we're not sexually interested in touches us. It doesn't have the same value. At the end of the day, so much of who we are is based on our sex drive, which points us solely at women, and makes them the key to our happiness."
"When your children get to late teens/early twenties, you should spend more time with them than ever. I'm close to moving out for the first time and I spend little to no time with my parents any more aside from when we're eating. Don't let yourself become distanced from your children when they aren't children any more, the last couple of years of them living with you will determine how your relationship with them goes for the rest of your life."
"I'm gay but I'll chime in because I've had sex with both. 

**Men**

* Pros: The gender roles are not as restrictive. In my experience, women tend to want the man to be the initiator. With two men, those expectations seem to go away. Also, since you have the same equipment, having sex is similar to playing on your home field. You know how to work things more easily and you do not have to figure out the other person's genitalia. Men tend to be more open and direct with communication. 

* Cons: Due to preparation, spontaneous sex is not always an option.

**Women**

* Pros: To be honest, a vagina accommodates a penis well. 

* Cons: Once again, gender roles. If you are a man who wants to be submissive to a woman, you will most likely be stigmatized. Also, perceptions about the other person's genitalia can make things difficult (i.e. you may think you should do xyz to a penis, but really it's not comfortable). Women tend to be less direct with communication.

If your boyfriend appreciates you doing something, don't stop doing it just because your friends said ""men don't like that"". He clearly likes it. If you're genuinely concerned, ask him, not someone that doesn't know him as well as he knows himself.  

Men don't dislike gifts or being pampered anymore than women do. Why on god's green earth would someone dislike a show of affection? That's insane and I feel bad for your friends' future partners.

And, further more, if you suddenly change the way you behave towards him, for example suddenly not giving him gifts/pampering him/etc. he's going to start thinking ""what have I done wrong that she's starting to treat me differently?"" which is a whole kettle of fish you probably don't wanna bring to boil."

Now, as a 29 year old widow, all the abuse I suffered from my husband taught me how to love myself and someone else.  I'm finally in the kind of loving, team-mate  relationship I used to dream of. "

"-Use wet wipes when you take a dump. Men especially since our asses are hairier than chicks. Using dry toilet paper just cakes and smears the shit into your ass. 

-Floss

-Keep dryer sheets in your t-shirt drawer to keep them smelling fresh

-Spray cologne on your wrists, neck, and chest. 

-Shampoo your hair once or twice a week at most. Use conditioner only for the other days. 

-Exfoliate your skin once a week. Once every two weeks if you have sensitive skin. 

-Wear clothes that fit. T-shirts should fall just above the waist of your pants. 

-If you're short, wear shorts that go above the knee to make your legs look longer. 

-If you're a man, you should own some staples. Plain white button up, plain black button up, dark blue jeans, black jeans, brown and black dress shoes, brown and black belts, one formal suit (black), one casual suit (grey or blue), a variety of ties and pocket squares, plain white, black, and grey t-shirts. You will be required to wear all of these at some point in your life."
"Well the first time she asked you to smell something would have been a good time to say ""Oh I actually don't have a sense of smell!""

But now that you've kinda lied about it... You should just come right out and say ""Hey when you mentioned dinner smelled good the other day and I agreed with you... That was stupid of me.  The truth is I don't have a sense of smell and I've just gotten so used to brushing it off that I didn't think to mention it sooner."""

"I'll give you one advice for when you do eventually break up.

Delete and block her from every social media you might be connected on. I can't stress this enough. It's not enough to just delete her, block her too. Permanently delete every picture you have of her, on your phone or facebook, or whatever. In this day and age, it's painfully easy to get constantly reminded of your ex. Seeing mutual friends post pictures of her, her face popping up every time you log on the computer if you have her on skype or facebook. Don't do that to yourself, it will eat you up from inside. Completely delete her from your online life, while you still have the feeling of being wronged, so you don't get any hesitations. Trust me, you don't wanna go through all that later."

My only other addition is that it is much much easier for women to be aesthetically pleasing than men: women are made up of curves, and our eyes like curves. Men are all boxy and square and while this has its own aesthetic, it's more of an acquired taste than the curves thing. 

Also it is *way* easier to suck a dick than it is to eat a pussy. Also more fulfilling. Like, there is tangible palpable ~~palatable~~ results that say ""hey, you done sucked that dick good"". Pussy, not so much. Yeah, she gets wetter and you can feel the contractions of orgasm but it's not the same as being covered or filled with hot sticky love butter.

"What it's like to be cautious on the street at night. People seem to think that women are at more risk than men because they are typically physically weaker and we talk about female victimisation more, but statistically, men are more than twice as likely to be mugged, randomly beaten, and murdered.

It bothers me that we almost exclusively talk about female experiences in life, as though us men float around on clouds and couldn't possibly understand what it's like. Whereas in reality, men could easily partake in those experience sharing Twitter hashtags. Just because our experiences are different doesn't make them any less bad. I think it's a shame though. If we included male experiences in many of those campaigns, I think women would feel less victimized in society. And there's too much of that going around these days.

I think we have far more in common than women seem to think we do."

"One of my closest friends is a woman (I was her matron of honor, she was my groomswoman), and we've known each other as long as we've known our respective spouses.  I won't say we hang out all the time, but every couple of months we'll spend a saturday afternoon at her place or our place chilling on the couch or in the backyard with a couple of drinks.  We grab lunch or dinner once a month, talk on the phone every other week or so and probably text a few times a week.  

But here's the thing.  Our spouses are always welcome to join us.  Sometimes it's four of us, sometimes three, sometimes just two.  Sometimes I take my kids over.  (She and her husband don't have kids and like playing with ours).  Even when we talk on the phone I'll stay in the same room as my wife unless I think the noise is bothering her.  

It's a ""trust but verify"" thing.  There's nothing between us but a long friendship but I don't want my wife to ever have reason to be doubtful, because she's more important than any of my friendships.  And similarly, I don't think she's ever been suspicious because I've always been very open about it.  Never been a problem. "

"Yeh.

Handies are always an option, more so when I'm too tired to give a bj or have sex.

Do you want a plain handie? I've got soft, hot hands that love shafts and throbbing shrooms. I can do things with the palms of my hands that feels a little bit like magic.

Are ya feeling kinky and want yourself fucked by some soft panties? I'm totally up for that.

Or even a little bit kinkier? I love very slowly polishing a knob with the leg of my pantyhose...little bit of twitchy ecstasy there...it's amazing and all the men I've had love it just as much as oral....and I am really good at oral. Easier to wash cum out of pantyhose that teeth anyway.

And then! I usually do handies because I am too tired for PIV sex or oral, but sometimes makes me feeling hot and wanting a proper shag."
"No one is saying you're breaking any rules, but you're removing clothing in public, which is generally against common etiquette. The boxer analogy is the closest thing a guy can offer for our gender, and it's not like it's completely different. It seems like you're looking for validation on this issue that you're not going to get across the board. 

Personally, I grew up in the city and have seen enough weird shit that I would probably give a girl taking off her bra in public about half a second's thought, and then only if she's attractive to me, so I wouldn't have much of a reaction at all. But it's completely reasonable for other people to have a negative reaction to undressing in public, even if you and I don't feel the same way."

* having to take care of all of the ""life stuff"" by yourself, like bills and signing up for insurance and grocery shopping and figuring out a budget--not just getting myself to class on time and studying

* I hate this part, but loss also. It's very humbling when you lose an adult romantic relationship, or your own pet dies, or even something simple like your car getting broken into. I feel like that humility can lead to self-reflection, which is a step toward not being a prick"

Here's an idea: have a sit down conversation with him, acknowledge that you haven't been the best parent but you want to be supportive in a constructive way, ask him what he wants to do with his life and where he sees himself (does he see himself having a house? If so then how does he plan to get one?). Ask him if he's depressed or struggling, if he is then get him the mental health care he needs. Remind him that college is there but if he won't go to college then he needs to be actively looking for a job. Lay down ground rules as to when he should have a job by and stick to the deadline but make it a reasonable deadline. If college is going to be paid for then maybe suggest that he can live at the dorms- this might be appealing to him because he can get space while he figures out what he's trying to do. While we're at it- I'm sure you weren't a gem at 23 either."

"If she has body image issues, then you're not going to change her mind.  
You're also not going to convince someone who doesn't want to send you nudes to send you nudes.

But if you do want to do something for her, then compliment her. Don't be crude or crass, just tell her how you feel about her and her body. You'll never get her to see it the way you see it, but it might help her feel good.

As for getting naughty pictures. You're not going to get them often... maybe every few months, or every couple of years. (Unless something changes in her.) So get used to that idea."

You deserve someone who'll take your feelings into consideration, and who will be up front with you, if they are unhappy in the relationship or don't feel that they get enough out of it.

You really have to decide whether you'd rather face the judgements from the Muslim community for not wearing it, or the judgements that you are facing from the men in your dating pool for keeping it on. Have you considered wearing it when you're around the Muslim community, and not wearing it elsewhere?"

"Any woman can fake an orgasm and probably fool you ... if she really wants to.

Best way of knowing that it's real is to know your woman.  Cultivate a relationship of honesty with her in the bedroom.  Tell her you never want her to fake it, and to always let you know both when it's eminent and when it's happening through her body language, moaning, or whatever.

Physically, there are a few ""tells"" you should come to recognize that are specific to your woman.  Like snowflakes, such tells are different with every woman.  However, most women's vaginas will spasm rapidly during an orgasm.  If you're fingering her or doing PIV, you should train yourself to recognize the sensation of those spasms squeezing you.

It's just an AWESOME ego high -- at least for me -- whenever I can get a woman's vagina to spasm like that while her body writhes with pleasure!"
You're a big guy!

"Gender issues, specifically those affecting men, since that's the ""other side"" of gender inequality that gets talked about much less frequently despite including some pretty important issues. To mention a few, men are more likely to be incarcerated (including because of receiving harsher sentencing than women), homeless, murdered, [they're more likely to commit suicide](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/spotlight-on-mens-suicide-rates/), and they have a lower life expectancy.

In terms of societal attitudes, there's the fact that we simply care less about the safety and well-being of men than women. We have tons of examples that show this, including the fact that ""violence against women"" is treated as something separate from and worse than ""regular violence"" (by traditionalists and progressives), that tragedies are often framed in terms of ""40 people were killed, including 10 women"" (as if the women's deaths are extra concerning), and even that crimes that harm women tend to be punished more harshly in the justice system than crimes that harm men ([sources and examples here](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/defining-demonstrating-understanding-male-disposability/))."

That being said, communication is important, and I would want to be told if a woman felt like I wasn't paying enough attention to her pleasure, and I appreciate guidance so I can help her enjoy herself instead of just making me figure out what works and what doesn't. I've also found that a lot of women don't take their pleasure into their own hands - you can do that, we certainly have to."

"These are rather personal and based on a mere 29 years of doing the sex with various people, so it is not quite statistically significant.

Men, Pros:

* They will take your trousers off and then do things with your penis.

* They will cheerfully put their penis in your bottom, which I find rather diverting.

* They don't mind if you enjoy it.

Men, Cons:

* They like to blurt out stupid shit during sex which can be off putting. Shush now.

Women, Pros: 

* A lot of them have big bottoms, which I like.

* They like a man to go down on them, which I also like.

Women, Cons:

* Your trousers usually stay on.

* Fear of a man's anus. You buy a strap-on and it gathers dust in the wardrobe for three years and then you have dispose of it before relatives visit and it's too big to just throw in the bin so you have to cut it up with a saw and you feel like a serial killer.

* You can go down on them for an entire night and part of the next morning, until your jaw is a red hot horseshoe of pain, but they won't reciprocate. Because a penis is where a man urinates from, euh. Which is fair enough. I don't want anyone to do something they don't enjoy!

* But then when they find out you enjoyed going down on them they act affronted, like you've stolen something from them. Actually, they say stuff like, ""I wanted to finger your arsehole just then, but I thought you would enjoy it too much,"" and the phrase ""you would enjoy it too much"" keeps going round in your head because from your point of view, you WANT a partner to enjoy sex to the maximum possible, so they will want a sexual relationship with you despite your other failings. Enjoy it too much. What?

* They ask for penile insertion and you say, ""Are you sure you're ready for that? I'm happy just kissing and cuddling, and going down you endlessly,"" and they insist on it, so you take it really slowly and try sooooo hard to be in tune with them and empathize with how they're feeling, so much so that you can't be sure whose parts are whose and who is penetrating who, and they seem to be enjoying it but then FUCK! it's like a light goes out in their face and you immediately stop and ask if they're okay but it's too late, the way you were breathing reminded them of their ex, or your loving, passionate face looked a bit odd and they remembered that you don't get on with your mother and decide that you must hate all women, and they tell someone else later that you were pushy or worse, and you think back and try to decide at what point you should have stopped, and hey, it was the trousers! You shouldn't have taken your trousers off.

* After one year in a relationship the sex dies. She feels closer to you than she ever has to anyone, and that kills her passion for you. Familiarity breeds contempt, and she's seen your floaters in the toilet. I don't do it on purpose. It's like they hide round the U-bend and then bounce back, and they're as bouyant as cork. Is it because I'm a vegetarian?

* After ten years you have the same thoughts every day: ""Should I not fancy her any more? But I still adore her, seeing her naked is the absolute best moment of my week, but am I objectifying her? Am I missing her mind by adoring her body? But I adore all of her, she's my best friend! But I'm not her best friend, Sarah is her best friend, and Sarah's compliments to her mean more than my years of support and attention, because Sarah doesn't want to touch her arse, she says. But if she'd said at the start that bum cheek viewing and touching was unwanted then I could have stayed a friend to her like Sarah is, and touched someone else's bottom instead."" And at the same time she's thinking, ""I wonder what time Poldark is on, I really should get that paperwork done, are there any of those chocolate eyeballs left from Halloween, wow, this place needs dusting, he's looking a bit pensive, what's going on there? Tsk, men.""

I hope this has been informative."

Look her in the eye, ask her to repeat what she just said. Say ""what did you say?"" Then ask ""why would you say something like that to me? Are you trying to make me uncomfortable?"" Call her out on it EVERY TIME. Embarrass her. Other people notice what she's doing, they're just glad the jabs aren't at them. If you call her out, they will take your side. Don't worry about ruining the vibe of the group, SHE is ruining YOUR vibe by fucking with you all the time. After the altercation is over, don't act angry, just act like nothing happened. 

She only does it because she gets away with it - because you let her get away with it. She's the newcomer, not you, she's threatened by the fact that her fiance is your bro. In her fucked up bitchy mind she's gaining social status by shitting on you. Nip that shit in the bud and she'll go find some other poor sap to pick on. "

"They lay on their back at the edge of the bed with a few pillows under their hips. Bring their legs together and push them toward their body. You're standing btw but don't hunch over. Keep standing straight up so you push against their g-spot 

Another one is the girl lying on her side, she puts one of her legs between yours so you're straddling her leg and you hold the other against your torso or bend it and have it pressed up against her torso. This allows for good penetration at an angle that's not often explored, but once again make sure to not hunch over much. It also frees up both hands for exploration 

Another one is cowgirl but she puts her feet up by your head or underneath your arms so she can get better leverage, then she just takes the wheel. She controks the motion entirely. Having her feet near your head pushes her hips forward so much more than traditional cowgirl and stimulates the g-spot. Another plus for this position is that it's easy for her to clench her out of you when she's reached her orgasm, and I'm told that's supposed to feel amazing for girls "

"in my experience with women, older women are more likely to be open minded and better with communication in regards to how well something is or isn't going. the younger women i've dated (20-30) all seemed to feel uncomfortable with letting me know if they're actually in to the situation. the older women i've been with (36-52) all were very talkative. very teasing, in to foreplay and longer buildups and different scenes. not just putting Ps in Vs. 

the only guys i get with are doms and i only hook up with guys for a wider bdsm scene, so i can't really go off what everybody else is thinking about. regardless of age, the men i've been with were very open to communicating and trying new things. "

I was a bouncer at a night club but on that particular weekend I was free and went to a house party at my friend's place. Throughout the night I was asked by the host to remove some guys who were being creepy and acting inappropriately and I did so.

When I left the party early in the morning it turns out that the three guys I had kicked out were friends and they ambushed me. At this point in time I was incredibly drunk and incapable of defending myself, foolishly I hadn't taken any of the usual safety precautions I would have taken if I had been leaving from work.

Anyway those guys worked me over pretty good for a minute or two but my friends at the party fortuitously went outside for a smoke break, saw what was happening, and came to my rescue.

I don't have any memory of that night but apparently I was in good humor and went back inside to keep drinking (dumb move, worst hangover ever). My friends don't hold any ill feelings towards me and it's become a really funny story to tell at get togethers now. "

I agree with this so much, personally. It sounds kind of neck-beardy,  nice-guy-ish, but I'm 19 and being 19, I'm around many other 19 year olds. And that leads to lots of occasionally true, but usually false (or exaggerated) stories about ""all the bitches i fucked last night"". And you know when you're in a group and all you just gotta nod and pretend to give a shit but I'm always thinking in my mind how unappealing that sounds.

"People have this misconception that good subs are people who will simply do whatever they're told to, that they're spineless. This kind of thinking comes from people who aren't very experienced at Domming or generally clueless.

The best kind of sub is a person who clearly communicates their boundaries, what they prefer, how they get off.

It's when a sub clearly defines limits and gives you full control of them within those limits that makes them awesome. Because once the boundaries are defined and trust is established, that's when they can completely surrender to a Dom's control.

Also, subs care about how Doms feel. I know subs experience a more intense drop after a session, but Doms crash too. So, during aftercare expressing appreciation and gratitude towards the Dom and reassuring them that they did a good job and that you enjoyed is also a very good quality in a sub."
