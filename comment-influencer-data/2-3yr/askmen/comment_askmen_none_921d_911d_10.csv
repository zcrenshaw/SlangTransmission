You're allowed to have sexual preferences. 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
"Big Brother, Big Sister, find him a background checked, fingerprinted mentor through their program"
"I get up, jerk off, got to work, come home, get drunk, jerk off and cry myself to sleep. Sometimes I jerk off while I cry. "
"I was pretty well behaved as a child, honestly. About the closest I can come to is a time I was angry banging my high school gf and my parents came home. They told me they came in the door, heard the headboard hitting the wall, and decided to go play some golf instead of interrupting.

To be fair, about a week later *I* came home and heard them going at it. Booked it outta there as fast as I could "
Find a new barber. 50 bucks for a haircut is obscene.
"A cousin of mine lived with us while his parents (my mom's brother &amp; his wife) were divorcing. He bullied me a lot. My mom put him on a scale, and then put me on it. He was heavier than me by about 20 pounds IIRC. She told us I could use anything up to that weight limit to defend myself.

Baseball bats don't weigh anything near 20 pounds."
Then that person is not a potential SO.
"Great. 

I poop with the door open. I can eat cereal for dinner and cake for breakfast. I sleep when I want. I don't have to fight for the tv or be forced to sit though reruns of Americas next top model. It's pretty great.

EDIT: I GET IT A LOT OF Y'ALL HAVE GIRLFRIENDS AND EAT CAKE FOR BREAKFAST AND HAVE ALL THE SEX AND HAVE TWO TVS AND WATCH NETFLIX ALL DAY"
"Speaking as a fat chick, it's never a problem when dudes aren't attracted to fat chicks. The problem is when dudes are assholes to fat chicks. 

These are not the same thing. 

If you're not into her and just wanna be her friend then tell her ""You seem like a cool girl but I'm just not into you like that, I really like hanging out with you though, I hope we can be friends."" Just like you would with any other girl. "
"When I'm in a relationship it's great, because it provides a great place to hang out, have sex, etc, and also a buffer when you need space and want to be alone.

For your question, when I'm single (which I am now), it can get very lonely in a hurry if you let it. You have to fill your social calendar. Meet with friends and family at least 3-4 times a week. I play basketball once a week, coach youth sports, and hit the gym 5 times a week. I always text friends to hang out, and I visit my parents at least once a week.

If you don't do these things, you will find yourself on the couch watching netflix most of the time and you will be alone with your thoughts a lot. You have to keep busy."
Because I was in the military and that was the preferred way to refer to them 
"Why not just have a cool friend? If you don't want to sleep with her, don't. Problem solved. You are absolutely right, physical attraction is important. Nothing wrong with not being attracted to someone. "
"I feel bad, lately. When I was living with my parents I wanted to be alone more, but now it's boring. I often feel too lazy to do things like get better at guitar or read, and am so picky about media that I don't like 90% of things on Hulu and Netflix. 

When I can motivate myself to do social things it usually gives me a little bit of a boost."
"Hey... If you're getting lonely sometime and feel the need to talk to somebody just pm me, I'm not a native speaker but I love to practice my English and I like getting to know new people. "
"My cousin is 28 and his girlfriend is 61. They met while he was bartending, she owned the bar and was a widow. They have been dating 4 years it's really awkward at family get together and social gatherings. He is a two time felon and I am constantly wondering how awesome the ending of this relationship will be."
"I trained bjj for a few years before it got really popular. I was just average or below-average in my school. Then I enlisted in the army. In Basic when we were being taught hand-to-hand combatives, I realized we were being taught beiginner level jiujitsu. I always flew under the radar, the drill sergeants never noticed me until I was the only undefeated guy in combative. Got yelled at a few times for instinctively doing some advanced moves they haven't taught us, but besides that it was pretty awesome. Felt like a bad ass"
I don't think you quite understand how not getting a haircut works 
"You will cheat, or you will ignore her and she will cheat.

A disaster in the making."
I'm too old for hating music genres.
"When I was young I was in that exact situation. I married her. It was a disaster. Two kids and eight years later we divorced and it was a Planet Bullshit Divorce and I was stuck living on Custody Battle Island for the next 15 years. 

Don't do it. Lol. "
"3-5 day rule for texting/calling. If I like her, she's getting a text from the taxi before I'm even home, and if she likes me, she'll be glad to hear from me."
"you go in with some people, get absolutely wrecked, dance like an idiot and talk to everyone you bump in to at the bar etc

then you've either hooked up with someone with your slick moves or you're throwing up down the street"
"I own my own business and I recently raised my prices because I had more clients than I could handle. 

I'd let him know you are thrilled about his success but he's out of budget now, and can he recommend someone. 

He will either give you a discount to keep your business, or understand that raising prices means losing clients. "
"I was a pretty stereotypical well behaved child growing up - never smoke, drank (besides the holiday brandy slush with the family), did drugs, etc. When I was 18 I was going to study abroad in Belgium, and that meant I was going to be drinking. Before I left, my parents filled the house with different types of beer and booze and told me to drink until I was drunk, so I knew what it felt like and what it felt like when I needed to stop. 

When I was there they also fielded a lot of questions from me about how to deal with people pressuring you to drink, which I had a hard time with until I switched who I hung out with. 

And even before then, they told us if we drank they'd be infinitely more upset if we drank and drove than drank and asked for a ride or said we had to spend the night because of that. They also said if we ever felt uncomfortable and wanted to say no to something but the peer pressure was bad to make up and excuse and blame it on them so it was their fault we couldn't drink, not just us not wanting to. 

Oh, and the first time I spent the night at my boyfriends I was still living with my parents. I forgot to call at night saying I wasn't coming home, and so when I called my mom in the morning I was scared of what she'd say. I said I stayed because I had bad Chinese food and didn't feel safe driving and she was like ""that's what I used to tell my mom too""

Really I can go in and on because my parents are wonderful and I love them. "
"Pretty much... there's a definite difference between not being attracted to someone who is overweight and, like, fat shaming or something."
"You say, ""Oh thanks! A lot of what I do is made up on the spot! Like what I'm about to do next"" then she says ""Oh, what's that?"" And then you go ""can I have your number?"" Boom. "
"Me and my wife were born 5 hours apart. 

Edit: forgot to add it was the same hospital to. "
I suspect most people here just do it to get the thread tagged with FEEEMAAALES. Always cracks me up üëç 
Multitasking is a valuable skill.
Nothing wrong with that. Can't control physical attraction
Just normally continue the conversation and when it's wrapping up or if someone has to go ask for her number..
"im not trained in any kind of fighting whatsoever, but i was acting as bouncer at a coffee shop that  had a punk band known for their crowd's destructive potential. i was helping some kid get up off the floor of a mosh circle, but the drummer who had several years of kickboxing and mma training, and a few too many drinks, thought i was keeping the kid on the floor down, so in the middle of the song the drummer kicked over his seet and rushed towards me, tripping over some of the moshers and giving me enough time to dodge two of three very sloppy punches and roll a table into the drummers gut real hard, winding him. the gig was over then, and the band ended up giving me a substantial part of their pay, and the coffee shop owner had me to her place every saturday for brunch for six months. 

i never respected them as a punk band until that happened. "
"Mom's a curator at a museum, she was showing me and a friend around. I ask her about this dresser ~500 years old that I remember from years back. She steps over the red rope meant to keep us peasants away from the life of luxury.

Security guards go o.O... and walk over. My mom holds up her badge without pausing her speech or stopping her presentation to me and 1 friend. Guards go O.o... and then back off without ever saying a word.

Mom continues undoing every latch showing endless secret compartments that I remembered from the first time she showed me."
Like father like son. 
"There was one that was made to look like an old kung fu movie, complete with the grainy video, and being in Chinese, subtitled in English. A naked guy and girl were fighting, flying around through the trees, and would catch each other in weird, acrobatic sex positions and yell out the names of them. It ended when the guy yelled ""Ejaculation!"" then pyrotechnics went off, and launched the girl across the forest."
"Why do women only call it penis, never ""pork sword""?"
"Same here.

I suspect a lot of it was trying to avoid stirring up shit. Using the term ""girl"" or ""girls"" could result in accusations of diminutive usage. Using the term ""woman"" or ""women"" could be construed as either undeserved/inapplicable (in case of immature/irresponsible servicemembers) or derogatory due to historical noun connotation &amp; association (cultural history of talking about what and wasn't a woman and a woman's work/job/role). ""Female"" &amp; ""females"" were dry and medical enough that it was easily able to ditch all that.

And then since we used those, we had to use ""male"" &amp; ""males"" to be fair.

Also, anything dehumanizing was good for Boot Camp/Basic Training. And a lot of those habits stick. So really, take your pick, could have been anything I just mentioned or all of them."
"&gt; I feel like a total hypocrite

Why? Are you also fat?

Anyway, everyone has a ""type"" of potential partner that they are attracted to. There's no need to beat yourself up over it. It's normal."
"Had a fun conversation about this with friends from a martial arts club. My favourite 2 weren't from anyone in our club but friends of theirs.

These two guys were walking through the slightly rough part of town, one of them a boxer on the University team and one a black belt in tae kwon do. A guy suddenly pulled a knife on them and demanded their phones and money. Without any conscious thought, the boxer punched him out. At this point, the TKD guy started freaking out. ""Why did you do that!? Oh my god. Jesus. Why did you do that? What if you missed and he stabbed you and then I had to fight him!?"" They then both stood there for a moment pondering what they should actually do and ended up kicking the knife into a drain and hastily leaving as the guy started to come round.

The second one was actually about a climber rather than a martial artist. He'd just been shopping for kit for an alpine trip and was walking home through a dark alley, as you do. He noticed a couple of big guys slink into the alley behind him and start following him. He wasn't sure if he was just being paranoid, but they gave him the creeps, so he reached into his bags and slowly got out the ice axe he'd just bought, letting it just hang loosely from his hand as he walked. You know, just in case. The guys started speeding up, then as they got close he heard one of them suddenly say in a shrill stage whisper, ""Jesus Christ, he's got a fucking axe, he's a psycho. Fuck this!"" And both guys legged it back the way they came. "
"Can I take a shot at armchair psychologist?  I'm a sports-coaching dad (for almost 10 years, and I have had many types of kids on our teams).  I also lost my parents at a young age.  It hurt.  Your son sounds very hurt, and he is showing his pain in a very normal way, but one that is also self-destructive.  He sounds smart too, like simple platitudes and standard distraction will not help.

Treat him like a grownup in this case, maybe because life has made him one a bit too soon.  Acknowledge the problem: yes, your dad is gone, and that sucks.  There is no way around that.  His pain is real and needs to be addressed or it will continue to hurt him emotionally and physically.

All you can do is tell him he needs to find something that brings out the best in him as an individual, and if sports is not it right now, so be it.  You are okay with anything that helps him (within reason) I presume, so tell him (believe me on this part) that you love him and will support him and try your best.  But you are both missing somebody very important, and you will need to lean on each other to be strong.  What other people have or don't have does not matter, you have each other.

If sports is too painful right now, ok, walk away.  There will be time later to get back into it if he wants, and if sports makes him feel less normal instead of more normal, listen to him.  That will empower him and he will know that you tried your best, and whatever happens after that he will be more open to healing or forgiving since you were genuine with him.  Best of luck."
"My parents are 26 years apart.  My dad's side has excellent genes so even though he's in his 90's, he is quite fit and active.  Still, he will have occasional health problems and my mom is there taking care of him.  They've been together for 37 years &amp; it has not been easy but they're still together.   At this point in time all of their marital issues seem to be less important to them than in years past."
"One of two reasons:

1) I'm trying to be clinical or scientific.

2) I'm imitating Ferengi"

"""...my single mother who was very abusive towards me.""

You've got to repair that damage with a therapist as soon as possible. What you're experiencing now is only one symptom. "
"Serious questions only, please."
My grandfather at 77 married a 33 year old after knowing her a month. He's dead and I never see that bitch anymore so yeah... 
"My aunt started dating a guy when she was 17 who was 17 years older than her. Her parents made them break up, so she went a started dating an even older guy. They made her break up with him so she went back to the first guy and eloped. They've been happily married for eleven years now and have three kids. "
"Looking at all these politically correct super-ethical responses, I guess I'll be the asshole here: yes, I do think there are two broad categories of women. Girls whose personalities and lifestyles only make them good candidates for short-term fun (ie those you fuck) and girls who are actually driven, kind, intelligent and have qualities suitable for building a real bond and life together (ie those you marry).

The two categories are not mutually exclusive. Of course I want the woman I marry to also be the woman I fuck a lot. But there are **definitely** many women out there great for a fling and that's it. One of my acquaintances goes and parties every weekend. She's flirty with everyone and has cheated in relationships in the past. She's also really hot. Would I have sex with her? Absolutely. Would I marry her? Hellllllllll no."
That's why I get drunk and play Team Fortress 2.

Upwards shows familiarity.

Both are signs of acknowledgement."

"For males, ""guys"" is accepted to refer to anyone.

"My mom drilled into my head that my childhood was over the second I got a girl pregnant, so she bought me condoms, too.  (Though one girlfriend found them and was pissed that I ""assumed she would have sex with me."")  

I was also allowed to pretty much do what I wanted after the age of 16, including stay out all night with the proviso that I'd call to let her know where I was.  I didn't once, and the punishment was pretty tough.  

This was all predicated on not doing stupid stuff like missing school or work, not being a drunk (though I could drink at parties), no drugs and stuff like that.  

Oh, and I was allowed to have a subscription to Playboy from that age too.  My mom got it one year and my grandma got it the next.  "
"Gotta be back when I started a new job as an office junior. Obviously being new to the company I was putting in extra hours. Working through lunch, getting in a bit early, staying a bit late etc. One evening I was later than usual - had a lot of copies to do, and the printer was slow as fuck. Had some time to explore so I thought i'd head up to the roof, to see if there was anything interesting up there.  There was. It was basically a large shed, in good condition, and a light was shining out from under the door. I thought it was weird  so I went to check it out. You know those odd moments when you knock then just open the door anyway? yeh I did that. Barged in and a woman was there doing naked yoga. She looked up at me and smiled, probably the sexiest smile i've ever seen, and said ""You must be the new guy."" Never even knew OP's mom worked at my company."
"Instead of dodging hard work and scraping by doing the least amount of work you can get away with every day, go out of your way to do more. Wake up with a purpose. Do things on purpose. Don't procrastinate. Be the change you want to see in the world. Love somebody? Love them %100. Do not half-ass your love. Say what you mean and mean what you say. Be kind to children and the elderly. Take care or yourself. "

"It was wonderful hanging out with you, and I enjoyed myself, but I'm not sure we're a good match as a couple.  Best of luck.

"Dogs crave human contact in a different way than they crave canine contact. Having another dog around isn't going to make your dog care any less about you leaving. 

I don't really feel bad leaving my dog at all, because he's super amped when I leave the house. I worked hard on a ""leaving routine"" where he gets a kong toy filled with treats and goes into his kennel. He zooms into his kennel when we get the kong ready and waits wagging his tail for me to give it. Kennel training made a big difference to his separation anxiety because he goes into sleep mode in there, and it's his safe spot (ie: his kennel is a place where awesome stuff happens, treats, toys, meals, we never use it for discipline.) 

He also has a dog walker that comes in on work days to take him to the dog park with a group of his doggie bros. It's all gravy baby. "
Uh anything requiring a spotter standing next to your head....
"....T_T God damn we have to do better, /r/askmen.

"It was a girl I knew since my freshmen year but I didn't develop any feelings for until the end of my senior year of high school. I always thought she was cute but we just had a really good platonic relationship that I really enjoyed. We talked a lot about medieval fantasy and baseball, she liked the same music as me, and so on. 

We took an art class elective in the second semester of our senior year. We were doing a portrait painting of celebrities and she had chosen to paint Sean Connery circa SNL Jeopardy (I was doing Christian Bale in American Psycho). She was really concentrating on hers and I glanced over at her. 

Her hands and forearms had quite a bit of paint on them. She proceeded to wipe her arm on her face and left a big smear on her cheek without noticing. She was so into her painting she didn't notice how ridiculous she looked. I don't know why but that exact moment I fell for her."

"Anime people are socially awkward. Horse people are crazy and spoiled.

I love anime and nerdy stuff like that. Just not a fan of a lot of the people that become obsessed with it.

Not a horse person."
"Sexuality and relationships in general.

However many bad things I have to say about my father, and no matter how much I chafed to be independent of my mother from an early age on, I have to say this: The way they dealt with these topics was just about all a child and young adult could hope for.

Without ever pushing anything on me, they yet answered all my questions with angelic patience, and without making it awkward for me. Once, (around age 10) a little ""girlfriend"" of mine and I went to my father and asked him ""what sex feels like"". Now keep in mind that my father was a very insecure and shy, and as a result extremely patriarchal and irascible man; and yet, he answered us calmly, seriously, even feelingly, to the best of his ability (which only in retrospect I realize how much it cost him to do).

Unlike today's helicopter parents, they were cool with me skinny dipping with the other kids; they probably also were dimly aware that I and a neighbour girl were playing ""show me yours and I'll show you mine""; yet they never treated any of that as anything other than fully natural.

And above all, they instilled in me a line of thinking to which I attribute both a good deal of my happiness with sex and relationships, and my completely relaxed and confident attitude to sex (e.g. never being for a microsecond worried about penis size, lasting, whatever): That sex and love are deeply connected and supposed to be; and that they are nature's greatest gift, the perfect expression of love and unity and gentleness you can share with a partner.

It is only consequent that, when I had a girlfriend and became sexually active at age 15, they both were happy for me, *with* me and their only question ever was , ""do you love her?"", and their only advice, ""be gentle with her, don't hurt her feelings"". Advice which I have faithfully adhered to."
"I think a lot of them say that because its the ""right"" answer."

"biggest age gap was of a biology teacher i had in middle school. him 67 wife 23.story behind it was that he had a buddy from the middle east and somehow met his sister through him, they would skype, talk on the phone, text etc. he would send her money because a month of her job barely made what he made in a couple days after awhile of saving she was finally able to move to the US and they got married. don't know how they are now but he was an awesome teacher.

"I had an ex that looked like she was going to develop a ""I am not the best at X so I am going to give up"" complex. She quit something that she was amazing at and that she had put in the 10000 hours for. We stayed friends and had ex-sex often. She started college and I could see the writing on the wall. She wanted to be a doctor but I could already tell she was giving up, but not because of grades (she had a 4.0). One of the last things I told her was that she would never be a doctor because she just gives up. That pissed her off and she stopped talking to me. Based on her personality, I figured she put her head on straight for a few months just to spite me. 

I looked her up a while ago and it looks like shes a doctor now working for/at NYU. I still feel kind of shitty for saying that to her, but maybe I helped?"
"First date, she told me she had no gag reflex.  I had to ditch her.  I hate to see anyone waste their potential."

I'm definitely less flexible, I have less possible motions in my arms and shoulders mostly. I've gotten more compliments vs. being told to eat something. large increase in confidence, also I'm less fearful because I know I'm more muscular than the average guy. Girls notice me now, I'm less afraid to take of my shirt for swimming. I'll add more if I think of more."

"I think I outgrew the ""I fucking hate X"" phase. Sure, there are plenty of genres which I don't find enjoyable, but it's not like I hate them or anything, they're simply not for me.

"One guy I was talking to at a nightclub said, with an arrogant tone, ""Just because there is a goalie doesn't mean you can't score.""

Yup. The biggest different between an SO and just a best friend is the having sex part and being attracted to them. Don't compromise on the rest of your life.

Yes. Former best friend. I was there every time a girl broke his heart; he couldn't find time when my brother was diagnosed with brain cancer and given 50% chance of survival. Months later we accidentally crossed paths. He started to apologize. I told him to get fucked and never talk to me again.

"Old roomate was a passive aggressive bitch and I got tired of her shit (she would bitch about dishes not realizing I don't make dishes, and when I do, I just wash them after using them, and put them away when I'm heading to work) so I went into her garden with a large container of Morton's salt, and poured that fucker into her garden during the winter. When spring came and the snow melted, she never understood why nothing would grow in the garden. Felt bad when I saw how much it bothered her and I may have dug up the garden later in the spring and replaced the dirt."

I also had an abusive mother and working through the trauma and shit with a therapist might be your best shot TBH. At least it worked really well for me in giving me a more healthy view on women. 
"I got pretty good at clubbing the more I did it. I think for a lot of people who start early, they have a bit of an advantage if partying is their thing. It takes a while to get used to the social etiquette of being at a club. I also find that they types of guys that do well there are the ones that don't overthink it. Narcissists also do well there and I noticed that clubbing exaggerated narcissistic tendencies in myself.

I started off in my mid-20's as a slightly socially awkward guy who had only ever been clubbing once or twice in my entire life. Then in the past 4-5 years, I started getting free cover and free drinks at a few of the bars and having several bar acquaintances and a few hookups too. On a personal note, its still a very empty experience for me.

I made several mistakes in the whole process and putting in the time in the club environment (a few times a week at least) is the only way you start to figure it out and it becomes fun. Money also helps and you seem to be fine in that regard. I think emotionally, detaching yourself from the activity is advised. There are a lot of arrogant assholes and bitchy girls at the clubs (I do live in a small city though). If you're a sensitive person, expect to spend some time being down from unsavoury interactions with drunk people.

For talking to women, I've found that the best place is at the bar when you're both ordering a drink. The dance floor can be pretty busy and its easy to get bumped around. I found group dancing is best if you go with friends. It feels less awkward.

Lastly, I didn't used to drink in my early 20's so the few times I went to a club, I couldn't understand why people were so into it. But then I found the more that I drank (within reason, since you want to avoid getting kicked out) the more I was able to get into it. I also see the nightlife as a curve where after you peak, there are no new experiences to be had and it saps you of the energy you need for daily life. Just my outlook based on how I have experienced clubbing."

"Your point of view on ideal wife here sounds a lot more one-sided than a marriage ideally would be. You say 'perfect wife for me' - that's your take on the situation. Have you been married before? You know what to expect? I'm getting the sense that there is a lack of experience in long-term emotional relationships for you - because you don't even have an idea of what an intimate relationship with your friend would be like, and you think she'd be the perfect wife. But would it be that perfect relationship?

 On paper, and restricted to your selected stipulations, it seems perfect. What about the curve balls? What about when that relationship is active and dynamic? Will *that* be perfect? Because in my experience, even great couples have to put work into making something awesome. 

I wasn't as attracted to my wife when I met here, as mucu as I thought I should be. But she was attractive enough and I found her more attractive as we grew closer. Plus, having an emotional connection with someone can contribute a lot. I was still sexually attracted to her, ultimately. Sounds likely there's zero for you.

While part of the point of dating seriously is to see if you can go long-term with someone, I've never gone in presuming they were perfect - sounds to me like you're setting yourself up for disappointment by relying too heavily on expectations. And it sounds like you aren't interested or ready for sucu an exclusive relationship in the first place. That's my take and the vibe I'm getting from you. Doesn't sound like you want whatever you're considering.  "

"Hmm. Had something similar. Mom found condoms in my drawers. She apologized finding something I was obviously trying to hide, but told me I did not have to hide and I could ask for money to buy them if I wanted. Technically my allowance already had extra that was supposed to cover ""in case I need it"" beside just having money to buy stuff. And the condoms were there out of curiosity, I used none of them with a partner and that would have been very unlikely.

What they handled really cool is when I announced I was taking in my Goddaughter and she was instantly their granddaughter to them, and showing it.

"Those people are certainly right that you shouldn't judge someone based solely on their appearance, and you clearly didn't do that. You are friendly with her and think she is a good person. What is absolutely normal to do is judge how attracted you are towards someone based on their appearance. The fact of that matter is, is that unless you are physically attracted to someone, a relationship will fail, that is a guarantee. On top of this, faking attraction to someone, in hopes you will one day be attracted to them is unfair to the other person who should be allowed to date people who are actually interested in them."

Many people seem flabbergasted that I brought up such ""heavy subjects so soon"" like it doomed the relationship but this has never been an issue for me. Everyone I have dated has appreciated the honesty and didn't feel like they were trapped or things got serious too quickly. "

"My presence on reddit, particularly in the AskMen sub."
"When I was in college, I was visiting my long distance girlfriend at her school. She sent me her room number and told me to come right up but being unfamiliar with her school, I had to ask for directions from a girl in her building. As luck would have it, the girl I asked knew my then-girlfriend and was happy to take me to her room. When I knocked, she opened the door in lingerie, not realizing her hallmate was standing right behind me. She squeaked, slammed the door shut, and her hallmate and I had a good laugh together. My girlfriend was mortified at the time, but we came to laugh together about it."
"There was this girl I knew back in high school and we used to be ""that older couple"" who would always fight and banter all the time.  We were friends, nothing more, but we had a lot of innate rivalries (Brazilian vs Venezuelan, our tastes in sports, religion, politics, etc) so we'd bicker a lot.  She was also one of those popular girls that dressed nicely and put up a front like they're tough, but you knew it was fake.  Turns out, she wasn't fake.

We were hanging out one day just me and her.  We got in to a more heated discussion and she jokingly said I needed to stop or she'd kick my ass.  I told her to try and she punched me in the arm and called me a dick.  The thing is, she threw a legitimate punch like she was trained, just didn't put power behind it so it wouldn't hurt me.  We play fought a bit and she actually knew how to fight.  Normally girls play fight and kind of crumble on purpose, but she actually stood up to me and it turns out she took martial arts on the side and didn't tell people since it's not girly.  Idk why but it was crazy hot that she could fight and that her backbone wasn't just fake attitude, but actual self-confidence.  Gotta love girls who are tough and confident."

Everyone wants sex, but it's not the only thing we want. 
For me I look for a relationship for the companionship and sharing my life with someone. Sex is awesome, but not why I'm seeking relationships."
"Like most, young adults and teenagers of this generation, I watched WAY too much porn as a kid while growing up. I was about 8 years old when I first started googling ""boobs"" and what not with my friends... Just basic human curiosity, generally harmless. But the I got older the craving for more sexual and graphic pornography increased. Early on in high school, at like 13/14 years old, I was watching some really explicit shit and masturbating multiple times a day. Many say its completely normal, and it may very well be, but porn had a huge impact on my self confidence and warped my initial young perspective of sex. But things changed when I started getting intimate with my first girlfriend. I was expecting some wild porno sex, where I bust on her face and call her profanities. Can you blame me? Thats all I knew... but bless my first girlfriend, she told me that sex shouldn't be like that, and that it doesn't have to be ""naughty"" or vulgar. She taught me the one thing porn can't really; how to love someone else. So I really started to understand that sex can be about tender and very deep connection between two people, rather than just ""fucking"".

People that weren't there however start to buy it and it and I lost a couple friends over this. After weeks of losing friends and becoming a social pariah she comes over uninvited to apologize. She tells me that she was sorry and just did it for the attention. Halfway through her incoherent blabbering and fake crying I grabbed my keys and got the fuck out. Didn't say a thing.

She's the baby daughter of my best friend and his wife, who also became a great friend for a variety of reasons despite having also a lot of differences.

They died in a car accident while they had left their daughter to my fianc√©e and I.

We were expecting the baby's family to, among other dealing with death imperatives, wonder about their daughter, who's watching her, who will be taking care of her, I mean, it just feels like obvious basic questions. Well nothing. Nada. I brought up the question since no one did, and they said since I seemed to like her, it would be best if I took her as mine. Weirdly enough their will gave me that opportunity, though the natural family could have easily disputed that. Okay, well don't mind if I do. It will take three years before I can officially adopt her, and that's as much time they have to change their minds.

Also, I'm only speaking of family on the mother's side. Family on my best friend's side, is involved and helping us with the baby. But they feel like they're too old to raise a child themselves, which I can hear.

My training doesn't exactly make me a fighter, but my opponents knew no shit. Nothing they did surprised me nor wasn't trivial to deflect. I just pushed them strongly enough to make them fall every time they approached, until they gave up or security arrived. I'd say that was a huge advantage.

But only because the idiots who wanted a fight had no clue how to fight. A seasoned fighter I would have been useless.

Like a genre like ""metal"". Like you can literally take Beethoven's 8th, replace all violins with guitars playing the same melodies in a slightly more rhythmic way and it's suddenly no longer ""classical music"" but ""metal"" while it's the exact same thing with a different instrument.

In fact they do this kind of stuff all the time. They take something from Mozart and play it in different instrument and suddenly something called trance, or metal or dubstep or whatever is born.

I do a lot of fun stuff, going to the gym, hiking, biking, running, volunteer work, going to the movies, concerts, theatre, and so forth, but haven't really found any people that I would call friends. I'm also introverted and very independent, so while I would like more social contacts, I'm not that desperate to really pursue it.

"People who watch anime are just..eww

Now, it's not fair. I know that, but I've met so many that are just socially inept, and colour their hair and don't know how to shower. It's disgusting and whenever someone say they're into Anime I just..view less of them. 

Is that right of me? Fuck no, That'd be like someone telling me I'm a school shooter because I like guns. Idk man.

"I have a co-worker who is overweight and goes on dates with women he meets online, only to dump them because he thinks they are too fat. He comes over to me and says stuff like ""bro, she was shaped like a pear. Pfft. Not my thing.""

I got mad at him today and said ""can't be turn down pear-shaped girls when you are shaped like a pumpkin."" 

He also doesn't get why some female coworkers think he is a dickbag for talking about women in a disparaging way for their looks. Like, c'mon man. Have some social awareness. Many women don't like hearing about men talking down about other women because of their appearance. He's also made comments to me and other coworkers about how he thinks our boss and the senior director (also a woman) check out his junk sometimes when he wears tight pants. We're a professional organization. Just keep that shit to yourself. Besides, nobody is looking at your junk. "
"Well I was a big coward and never asked her out. Classic case of being afraid to lose our friendship if it got awkward. She was the kind of girl who would date a guy for a couple weeks before losing interest, she wasn't a slut or an easy girl but if someone asked her out she'd give them a chance. I was worried the same thing would happen to me. I also started dating a coworker at the time who had been coming onto me pretty hard. Didn't even tell her I had feelings for her until a couple years after we graduated. The kicker is she said she felt the same way but thought I had no interest in her so she gave up and settled for friendship. I was in the Army at the time and she was still in school, we joked about trying out long distance but that conversation never went anywhere. We kept in contact after that for a while but I haven't talked to her in about 3 years now."

"&gt;Just like you would with any other girl.

Pretty key. There are people you're going to be attracted to and people you aren't. You could be absolutely disgusted by a girl at a normal weight because her personality is garbage. The reason you're not attracted to this particular girl happens to be her weight; it is what it is.

Also speaking as an overweight lady, there are/ have been plenty of dudes who are attracted to me. I'd rather not waste my time or yours trying to force it; I'd rather be banging dudes who worship my body as is. It's better for all parties involved, believe me. 

I have plenty of attractive guy friends that I don't wanna bang for one reason or another. It's totally fine."
Dealt with this recently.  Turned out she wasn't attracted to me and was really horny.  She had a sexual itch to scratch and didn't care that it would change our friendship.  She never disclosed in the months we were seeing each other that she was only interested in hooking up because she didn't want to feel like a slut.  She ended things saying that the reason she wanted to hook up in the first place was because she was horny and knew that she could so something casual with me because she saw me as so unattractive that she wouldn't even think about starting a relationship with me.  She taught me that I trust women too much.

who's ever trying to convince you that you should be attracted to people you're not are idiots. They might be your friends but don't take their advice seriously. And it's not body shaming to not be attracted to fat people. It'd be body shaming to call fat people lazy slobs
"I was shy in high school, and never asked anyone out. Once in college I found a girl in class that I got along with and asked her out. At the end of the first month of dating she dropped all contact with me. I'm now even more shy and reserved because I think it will happen again. Do not ghost people. Honest, gentle communication is a great habit for both continuing and ending relationships."

"When my grandparents met, my nan was 19 and new to the area with her brother, only just learning how life works. My pop was a 29 y/o divorced single father (with full custody, which was very rare in those days).

They married a year later, and lasted nearly 61 years until Pop died earlier this year. Obvioisly I didn't see the difficulties of the early days, but they certainly made it work in the end."
"I punched one square in the jaw, she was attacking my friend at the bar after she thought my friend had said something petty or rude. She starts swinging at her grabs her by the hair and scratches and punches my little friend who is trying to keep from getting torn apart. Our other friends were not jumping in and security was nowhere to be found so being the biggest of the bunch I jump and pry this banshee from my friend.

The crazy bitch starts swiping at me and throwing fists I'm holding her tightly so the first thing I go for is a massive bear hug, maybe a thorough squeeze will settle her down, nope. She starts kicking and flailing so hard she breaks my grip, now she is standing before me and she is telling and barking and starts spitting at me.

Still no staff has shown up and we're getting pretty dicey, she makes a move to punch me and I put my fist up and she literally ran into it herself. It was a pretty hard hit despite the fact that I didn't actually throw a punch. We get bounced, cops are called, we dip out and never go back to that bar again. 

And that's the story of the time I punched a girl. "
"I prefer non-religious. Each religious woman I've dated has either had a problem with my (lack of) beliefs, or tried to pressure me into changing or attending whatever services they attend.


It gets old, saying ""no"" all the time. So I prefer dating women with less likelihood of asking me to do things i don't want to do."

For roughly 2-3 days a week, I spend a portion of the 9:00 PM - 2:00 AM section doing an online math tutoring session. 

On Saturdays, I reward myself for a long week of grueling hard work by sleeping in until noon, watching more movies or TV shows, and catching up on cleaning/laundry/yard work/etc.

For just under half the year, I spend my Sunday morning and afternoon with my local Cleveland Browns Backers club. I go in early to set up tables, TVs, raffle prizes, etc, and hang out with everyone after the game is over. Usually the highlight of my week. Then I go home and start cooking dinner (which eventually becomes lunch for the next few days)

During the offseason, replace the Browns club time with more time being a lazy piece of shit like normal.

I go home to see my mom and her dog about once a month on average, give or take. Her and I go to New York for about a week every summer, as our annual vacation. It's usually spent avoiding middle-school-level drama and arguments with crazy relatives that we never otherwise talk to throughout the year.

"inb4 disgusting story

I found her sleeping in bed. The sheets were smeared red a bit and so were her pants. I knew it was her time to be bleeding but I had never seen it like this before. As I approached to wake her up, I damn nearly tripped over a tray on the floor. Suddenly I knew what was up.

So I woke her up with the most serious face I could manage and said: ""You're bleeding, we need to clean you up and change sheets."" Her face turned white and she panicked.

Turns out she just made food with lots of ketchup and most of it spilled on the bed where she decided to eat because she is the most clumsy person I can imagine. Still had to change sheets."

"My sister of all people gave me the best perspective on this and its worked for me every time this question has come up in my life:

If you feel you'll look back on life and can only say ""It was rough, but we had some good times"" then its probably not a relationship worth continuing. If you can look back and say ""It was great, there were rough times, but it was worth it"" then you are doing good. 

If you feel honestly in a relationship that you are not happy, and won't be happy, ESPECIALLY because you've started to resent things about your SO that you can't change, or that they want you to change about yourself, then its time to move on. 

If you are just having a bad time, going through a rough spot, or feel stressed out about dealing with the relationship, then be honest about what is going on, how long it will take to fix, and work around it.

If you can work around it and move forward then don't throw away a relationship simply because it's convenient at the moment. You don't get fulfillment from doing the easiest thing every time. "

"It was a great experience, but has also weighed a lot on me as i reflect on the past 8 years (the time after he moved, which i mention below).  The positives were being able to know you are giving someone a bump in the right direction, and to know that to someone so young, you are someone important in their life. It does take commitment, and its important to be willing to invest the time. It doesn't take much to make a great impact!

I joined when i was 19 in college, im 30 now. I saw Scott every other week, it was good and he needed a young guy to show him the ropes since he was around 12 and his parents split, so it was his mom and him.

We lost touch, and only saw each other once a year for a bit. We talk a lot, reconnected after a few years, and i try to be there now, but i feel like i wasn't around when he was in his late teens and probably needed me most.

I didn't ""bail"" - im a super ambitious guy who takes on too much, and just like the rest of life, time flew, and before i knew it i realized we lost contact and he might need me still.

We talk 2x a week now. That helps a bit... i just hope i kept him out of some trouble and he knows i will always answer when he calls.

"My grandparents had a swimming pool.

The kids in the neighborhood would come over on weekends to swim, alongside us grandkids, so the pool was filled with screaming chaps.

One weekend, in my early teens, the college age girl was home on break and swam with us. Of course, she was wearing a bikini, nothing extra special, but compared to what I was used to, and considering my age, it was.... Impressive.

Anyway, after swimming, we would use the basement to change in (two doors to the outside, two sides separated by a wall and the stairs, so it was segregated).

Whoever was last on the boys side would carry the suits over to the other to hang them to dry.

I was last because I was a water fiend (I was always first in the pool, and last out). And since everyone else had been out of the pool for ten minutes, once I changed I just went over, expecting tar side to be empty. It wasn't.

The college girl was changing still for some reason. When I rounded the corner, she was bent over, her bottoms dropping to the floor, and her top was already off.

I could just see her pubic hair with the light behind it, her tush and lady parts bare to my eyes. She straightened up, and began dressing.

I was frozen. I watched her put on her bra, then step into her panties. It wasn't until she had her shirt on and was reaching for her pants that I realized I was standing there, staring with my jaw open and the most painful erection I'd ever experienced. I turned and went back to the boys side to wait.

I don't think she knew I was there or anything, but holy crap was I obsessed with her after that"

Well at some point my friends all went back to the beach to dry off, but i decided to stay in the water for a bit. 
I had a cigarrete and lighter in a little baggy in one of my bathing suits pockets, so I lit up and relaxed in the water. 

There were these two beautiful women, around my age IIRC and one of them was wearing a tiny little red two piece suit. I couldn't take my eyes off her, and she seemed to be interested in me too, stealing a little glance in my direction every once in a while. 

Well I was just about finished with my cigarette, so I started to head back towards sand when I heard a cute little gasp, and I turned around to see what happened. The first thing I saw was that same hottie with only the lower half of her little bikini, hiding her breasts with her arms.

"I was psychologically bullied on a routine basis by many girls in my year throughout high school due to my dwarfism (it's kind of a long story of how they went about it, since it was was spawned by a specific way we do dances at our school) and over years it really wore me down to the point that I felt guilt and shame for simply existing in the presence of girls. I'm still trying to shake off the mentality to this day. 
 

At the end of 6th year we had a leaving dance - the last time we would probably see many people in our year. We had all matured a lot by then, and during the interval one of the very popular girls spotted me (I'm not exactly hard to single out) and came over to me, in full view of her exclusive group of friends. She apologised to me for treating me so horribly over the years, and even acknowledged that her apology probably wasn't enough to redeem herself.

I told her I thought it was admirable to do what she just did - especially when she could have just waited another 5 hours and never see me again - but that I did not forgive her. What she did would stay with me for a long time, and I didn't think there was any tangible way to make things okay again. She accepted that. 

I guess I did give her a chance to apologise, so this probably doesn't count, but I didn't forgive her."
"Been married for a few years, and seeing my partner for a total of 8. 

Have to say the whole ""everybody argues"" shit is not something we've experienced. We talk, we discuss like rational fuckin' adults. We don't ever 'argue'... no raised voices, no name calling, no shit slinging. 

In our years together we've never had a shouting match. We don't see the point - it's even more important we stick with that now that we have a newborn daughter in the equation!"

You told her this, right? Because if you were just hoping she would notice and then set in motion a revenge plan that didn't come to fruition for months, I don't know if she was the passive-aggressive one."
"In university a couple girls in my class approached me and insisted that I go out with their friend who I'd sat next to once or twice and nothing else. I gave her a look and she was pretty enough so I said to them, ""sure, we'll hang out over the summer."" I had forgotten that I had a flight that evening and was spending the summer with my family in France. I completely forgot she even existed until I saw her again in a lecture and thought, ""Oh Neptune."""

"For me it's when girls start touching me. It makes me feel really cheap but there were girls whose personality I didn't like but then they found some reason to grab my hand (stopping me from rubbing my eyes, pulling me to go somewhere) and that was such a huge turnon.

And that was when I realised I was a slut "
"What to call women/girls/females/gals always seems to be socially charged.

They all have different meanings, both literally and socially.

Some women don't like being call ""women"" because it implies they are old. 

Some women don't like being called ""girl"" because it sounds demeaning. 

Some women don't like being a called ""gal"" because it sounds awkward. 

Some women don't like being called ""female"" because it sounds clinical. 

So, it's hard to know exactly what a woman prefers to be referred to as. They don't exactly walk around with it taped to their forehead.

And guys/men/males/boys don't really give a shit what you call us because we know it doesn't really mean anything to us.

"This is a pretty big your-mileage-may-vary thing, though. I started watching porn when I was 12, jerked off multiple times a day almost every day of my teen years, and I didn't go into sexual relationships with the idea that my girlfriend must naturally crave anal fisting and gang bangs."
"18 years old. Still living with parents. I used to get beat severely by my parents when growing up. Apparently it's a part of Indian culture, and I assumed as parents normally know best, that they knew what they were doing. Only as I grew older did I realise that it wasn't OK. It wasn't OK for my dad to whip out his leather belt and slap me across the floor because I didn't want to do maths. It wasn't OK at all, and for years I convinced myself that it was. I will never forget that incident in my life, and no matter how much therapy or counselling I seek, it's made its mark. I'm not my parents' child- I'm their vessel for releasing pent-up anger. It still haunts me in my nightmares. "

"When we were dating I was at her place one night watching movies or something, and she decided to make us hot cocoa. She grabs the cocoa powder, and from the directions on it puts in the amount of powder, sugar, etc. But instead of 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla she puts in 1/4 cup. 20+ years later and I still bring it up sometimes, and to be fair, it did taste pretty good."

"If you don't mind me asking, what's your background?"
"Women tend to be significantly less hairy than men on average, and have been emphasising that difference via depilation and shaving pretty much forever.

As such, hairlessness in women has become ingrained as a mark of femininity and status (given that it is labour-intensive and time-consuming).

A hairy woman, therefore, is stereotyped as being coarse, low-status and neglectful of basic hygiene. 

It's one of those self-fulfilling prophesy things; if someone is unwilling or unable to devote time and effort to the grooming rituals of their peers... *well!* We all know about *those* kinds of people, don't we?

 Faced with that kind of stigma, pretty much only *those* kinds of people end up not doing it.

Which is all kinds of stupid and sad, but that's humans for you.

The whole hairless-genitalia thing is very recent for the most part (paintings and sculptures aside) - up to the 90s, it was considered downright perverted. Then almost overnight, boom, pubes were considered women-over-40 material at best. "

"Everyone here is saying if no sexual attraction then no point in relationships.

But what if 20 years down the line the woman didn't age well? Like things out of her control - weight gain after children, wrinkles, age related problems? Will you just leave her then because your dick doesn't want to hit it anymore?

Or perhaps you will blame the woman for gaining weight like so many guys on here bitch about? Everyone is always saying how oh it's because the woman doesn't feel like she needs to put out anymore but the fact of the matter is shedding post pregnancy pounds is hard, add to that the fact that as a parent you might be too tired to monitor every lb you gain, and suddenly there are all sorts of issues because people want to rely on physical attraction to solve their problems.

So what happens when you both start out as hot and suddenly turn unattractive with age? Divorce and find someone younger and hotter and give that as an example for your kids to emulate?

I get it, potential SO's shouldn't be like some amorphous blob or a face so ugly you can't even stand to look at it. But there seems to be no middle ground between repulsion and explosive attraction and that's just being really spoiled."

OK so you probably haven't realised how many drugs are involved in the clubbing scene. A lot of these women will probably be on ecstasy. There'll be a lot of coke around too in some cities.

One other thing you havne't mentioned is the music. If you don't enjoy the music then you're missing a huge part of the reason people go. People enjoy the music. They don't dance because they feel like they should, they dance because the music played loud makes them want to move.

If you don't feel moved by the music then you miss out on a big part of the experience - the collective feeling of the dancefloor. If you're going to DJ clubs (places that'll have names on the promotional posters everywhere) this is definitely the reason a lot of the people are there. People dancing in unity, sharing the love of the music.

re: dancing. Dancing in a club isn't something you have to know how to do. ""Can't really dance"" means one of a few things - you don't feel the music, you're too self-conscious, or you're overthinking. If you don't hate the music, try just standing on the dance floor, stop looking around and focus on the music. You're not trying to socialise, you're not trying to impress, you're not trying to 'have fun'. Just try and let the music take you.

As for the rest, well you might start enjoying yourself if you let yourself dance, and you might start understanding the people around you. Once you're 'in' the atmosphere then it gets a lot easier."
"Guess I'm gonna be the cynical one. This thread smells of tough guy tales where the truth is stretched.

My take on it - yes, it helps. I don't know how much or if it's the same for everyone, but there's some rudimentary instinct about reacting to strikes and positioning if you get in a grapple. Getting stronger and more athletic is a big help too I'd guess.   

I honestly haven't had enough clean ""street fighting data"" to make a good analysis except that it helps if you're not stupid about it.  

I remember watching a TKD guy assuming his fighting stance in street fight with a guy. We were all ""oh shit, that guy knows what he's doing"". The other guy looked intimidated by the fact that this guy apparently knew some kung fu shit.  
Our hero tried an awkward turn kick and promptly got his nose smashed in. They got separated and the fight was over."

"I was actually really high up in my class and a member of some of the elite science clubs, so I had access to the stock room of our science labs that only a few others did. I also had just discovered pot with some of my buddies who also did well. So we stole an Erlenmeyer flask (bong), glass funnel (bowl), test tube (downstem), and plug with 4 holes for plastic tubing (so we could all smoke at once if we plugged it into the top of the flask). Got a diamond drill bit, and made our first bong, ""Einstein"". Well we weren't fully done with Einstein's production process, only had the holes done, and stored it in the trunk of the car I had just gotten. Mom found it, thought I was running a meth lab, and she and my stepmom wanted to send me to military school. My dad told them to calm tf down and not give me a reason to truly rebel, and believed me that it was just for marijuana after I demonstrated for him how it was assembled. 

The first time I smoked I recognized the smell because I had smelled him smoke it out on the patio as a very young kid. When I turned 18 (after a very long grounding for the Einstein incident), he told me he had to play it cool too, and we've been smoking together ever since.

"Because it directly contributes to a larger system of sexism? Same thing with racist and homophobic slurs? Like using the word ""gay"" as an insult implies it's a bad thing to be gay, similar to how using the word ""pussy"" as an insult implies it's a bad thing to be feminine.

You can insult somebody in a way that just insults that individual (asshole, jerk, fucker, etc.) without calling in larger societal prejudices. Insults don't have to be offensive to a group of people in order for them to be effective insults.

With u/karm1ne's example, he could have just said that she looks vapid. He didn't have to include ""ho"" - that inherently made it a gendered insult that both insults female promiscuity (WHY DO YOU DO THIS YOU DO REALIZE THAT BY STIGMATIZING PROMISCUOUS WOMEN IT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT YOU WILL HAVE SEX WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL JUST STOP HAVING SEX WITH MEN) and further stigmatizes sex work."

"Speaking as a woman here, but men don't ""only"" want anything. They're humans with mixes of priorities who want a *variety* of things from a meaningful relationship.
