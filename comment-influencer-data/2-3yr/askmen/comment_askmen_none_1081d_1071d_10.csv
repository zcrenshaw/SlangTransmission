GUYS LIKE FLOWERS AND CHOCOLATE TOO DON'T FORCE YOUR GENDER ROLES ON ME YOU SHITLORD
How are you still single? You're so great! Any girl would be lucky to have you!
"We grew up together. She was the first girl I ever kissed at six years old, and the first girl to dump me when I got jealous of her talking to Greg P.  Years later in high school she sat in front of me in history class, the only class I didn't hate, and we made friends again.  I fell in love with her passing notes when the teacher wasn't looking (she knew but let us get away with it.)  We were both loners, and shared emotions slowly, at best, but I knew she was the one when some girls made fun of her and she cried to me on the phone.  We were made for each other in an age when true love only happens in the movies. I lost both of you in a car wreck one New Year's eve, and my life has never been the same. Twenty-five years later I still think of you both and miss you both every day of my life.

Edit: This sort of blew up. Thank you all for your kind words.  Our time together was short in years but I would not give up a moment of it, not even the tears.  You have to grab what you can while you can."
"When my wife and I were first dating (in the 90s) she was headed to my apartment and wanted to bring me something.  Like guys do with flowers.  
  
When I opened the door she was standing there holding a hammer with a big red bow on it.  Cutest damn thing I've ever seen in my life.  
  
Sure, I had like six hammers.  But it's the only I *still* have and have never replaced.  Also the only one I can identify where it came from.  It's great that you're trying to think along these lines.  
  
Being a bit of a tool guy, my wife still likes to bring me random flash lights that she thinks are unique or that I may have a specialized use for.  Headlamps, magnetic, you get the idea.  
  
Take something he's interested in and go that direction with it.  Think of it less like 'mens version of flowers' and more like 'here's a gift from something I know you like.'  "
"I think where this idea comes from is people confusing being nice with passive and mean with assertive.  Assertive people tend to do better in life because they go after what they want and let others know what they want, but it is entirely possible to be both nice and assertive."
"""I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend"""
I came all over her ass that's what came of it. 
"""she probably dislikes it for reasons other than attracting you.""

Upvote for this"
"Like other comments, I also recommend just plainly telling her how you feel about it.  However, unlike them I neither expect her to change her view nor judge you if you no longer find her attractive.  You like what you like, and she probably dislikes it for reasons other than attracting you.

This may just be a sticking point for you two, but unless this is the subject of major complexes you will be happier for getting it off of your chest, and she will feel a bit more at ease in bed knowing at least you like it."
"""Dont worry, youre the kind of guy girls will look for when they want to settle down and get married.""

Or anything similar to that. Its never been said to me (because i am not one of those guys) but ive heard girl try to console lonely guys with it. Its like saying ""youre too ugly or weird to fuck right now but women may get desperate enough to touch your penis when they get old and need someone to pays the bills for their kids."""
"That was much much younger than I 'worked it out', but I think 14 year old me would have been horrified if my parents directly commented on it. I mean, they probably knew, teenagers are awful at hiding a huge pile of tissues in the bin. 

I wouldn't address it. Pretend you don't notice. "
"When I was 11 or 12 I convinced my parents that it was pointless to put age restrictions on my AOL account because I could ""hack the system"" and change it back since I already had done it a few times. In reality they just forgot to log out when they walked away from the computer, but as far as they were concerned I was a master hacker. Clearly they were right, I'm so good I'm hacking the government without even realizing it."
"I use to stop at the Tim Hortons across from my restaurant before my shift everyday. This girl would always blush the whole time she was taking my order, even though she would rush and fight to be the one who took my order. I would never progress our encounter past small talk because I'm a typical male who can't comprehend signals.

Fast forward time, I'm at a bar with a buddy, and we run into another friend who invites us to his house to have some drinks. We head up there, and turns out his roommate is his cousin who happens to be the Tim Hortons girl, who is just hanging out in her pajamas playing halo in the living room. 

We chatted about video games, and we added each other on Facebook, and then dated, and yadda yadda yadda, we have two kids now."
Especially after being rejected by that person
"Yes. We'd been drinking together regularly and the flirting had slowly gotten more and more physical, and we were both single. 

Sent her a not sober text saying I wanted her after one of those nights of drinking, woke up to a reply saying she did too. Explored that for a few days and we seem to be moving toward a relationship, so so far, so good."
"Mental health, probably. Men are 3.5x as likely as women to fucking kill themselves. That's a bit of a problem."
"Guy-gifts, as a rule-of-thumb, are generally best if they're something the guy wants but sees as ""frivolous"" spending.  I think that's why flowers are common on the other side.  They don't have any practical utility, but they just make somebody happy (which is a utility).


For me?  I like a decent whisky but always realize that the $ would be much, much better spent paying down the mortgage.  If somebody else, however, were to get me a bottle, even a little one, I would enjoy it guilt-free.  Doesn't even need to be whisky, I'm sure every person has something they like that's got the same idea.  If he has a hobby, like MTG cards, or fancy exotic yarn for knitting, or whatever.

I'm guessing it's painfully stereotypical, but ""Hey honey, I cooked a tasty, healthy meal.  But first, I can't go another second without your dong in and around my mouth.  Then I'm going out with my besties.  Here's a Redbox you've been wanting to see"".  This is assuming you spend a lot of time together already.  "

Sounds like she wanted to nail ya
"*Yeah, you like that you fucking retard?*"
"Anything involving ""there's someone for everyone"" ""just when you think you will never find someone is when you find someone"" ""it's better to be alone than in a shitty relationship"" 

The third one may be true but a guy who just got rejected doesnt want to hear it"
GET SOME CLAMPS. CLAMPS ARE USEFUL AND YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM. 
"""Hey, short guys. Woman here! Just wanted to let you know that not all of us are obsessed with height, so please don't be depressed. Well ok, in my 20s I wouldn't go out with any guy who wasn't taller than me in heels, but I've matured since then. Ever since I hit 35 I realized there's more to life than looks.

Now it's true my husband is 6'2"" but if I were single I bet I could theoretically go down to as low as 5'10""! Wowza, talk about open-minded!

So take hope! All you have to do is to spend 30 minutes perfecting your hair/clothes each morning, hit the gym two hours a day, plan for a wealthy career, learn how to be the funniest guy in the room, and be extremely extroverted and the life of a party. And then you will finally be at the level of the tall guy who rolled out of bed and walked outside.

See, there's no insidious discrimination, it's all **in your control**. What's unattractive is not your height, but rather your insecurity and constant complaining. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to AskWomen to rage against toxic masculinity and patriarchal gender roles that hurt women. Ciao!"""
MY CABBAGES!
"Unless he's doing some weird, crazy shit or asking you questions I'd say there's not much to deal with. Just one of those things that nature just kind of takes care of."
"""Don't worry, everyone finds someone eventually!"" 

Nope, plenty of people die alone. That is a very real possibility for some of us.

[Relevant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUgQPzq6ifc)"
"The problem with not doing it ""too much"" is that how does he know when it's too much? If he somehow decides that twice in one week is too much, that's just an unnecessary battle with oneself and guilt.

I generally went (and sometimes still go) by ""when my penis is sore, that's enough"". I'm not aware of any negative consequences from this approach."
Try my best to reenact what the guy was doing and see if she realizes
"Then you are not a people, I'm sorry."
"No, in fact the idea horrified me. I think I first discovered that function at 7 or 8 and just kind of figured things out.

I'm sure it also greatly depends on your personality type and how open your parents are. For the most part though I think a good general rule is that it's going to happen, they're going to figure it out on their own and there aren't too many ways to hurt yourself doing it.  

Early puberty can cause some serious awkwardness for boys though and sex was kind of a delicate subject for alot of us at that age. "
"If a man gives you flowers, it's generally okay to return the favor by offering him a gift basket that's been artfully arranged with bottles of liquor, beef jerky, and new/gently-used Sawzall blades."
I once left a status on the facebook of someone who forgot to log out so obviously it's me
"&gt; gently-used

Sir

sir

There are no gently-used sawzall blades. Either they are pristine, or they have been through hell on earth."
"&gt; I have no luck with woman  

Invest in a few luck-related feats, some of them allow to reroll when interacting with women.

Joke aside, let's rephrase the problem as:
&gt; women don't think about me as a potential sexual/romantic partner.

One night stands aside, partners are basically friends you're having sex and long term projects with. Hence, act like you would with friends, be reasonably attractive, don't be not attractive (despite the ""everyone is bioutifoul"" thing going around, you're not mashing your genitals into someones personnality), and clear about your intentions. Other than that, it's just a matter of getting rejected enough to call it ""experience"" :p
"
"Sounds like you've got a girlfriend, dude."
Did you just yada yada sex?
"Female attraction and male attraction are wildly different.

A woman's status means nothing to men, while a man's status is an aphrodisiac to a large proportion of women.

You don't see trophy husbands because that kind of arrangement is not appealing to the vast majority of women and men."
"Okay, story time. Back when I was a college freshman, I didn't drive and I had dated this girl I knew from high school for a few months. We ran in almost mutually exclusive circles, but we were set up by a friend who ran with her circle but was cool with me.


Anyways, she had started driving so we'd go out and I'd cover food to pull my weight. She had a guy friend who I thought didn't like me. Probably saw me as a douchey festival goer while my girlfriend at the time's circle saw themselves as intellectuals. 

So the relationship was on life-support for weeks, and things came to a climax one night when we went across town for dinner. She got upset about me getting a tattoo without her permission (because she was apparently the authority of my body) and she basically said, I'm leaving you here, with the bill and peace, good luck finding a way home. She also knew, because I was a commuter, my parents wouldn't let me back into the house after 12. 


I basically sat on the sidewalk contemplating life as my phone battery was dying, super depressed. Uber and Lyft were just starting out during that time so I didn't have a way to even get back (I live in LA so everything is spread out).

Suddenly, a car pulls up and the window rolls down. It's my girlfriend's guy friend who I thought didn't like me. Apparently she had went to him to vent about me, and he said that it didn't sit right with him. He had asked where she left me and she had basically bragged that I had no way of getting back home and that my parents would probably not let me back in. He had drove all the way from his campus to pick me up and let me stay over his apartment for a night and his roommates and I organized a Madden tournament. Still talk to that guy to this day."
Cyber is a threat to our motherland. 
"Your mom was in class and I was visiting that teacher for a project my senior year of high school.  When the teacher left the room I started chatting up your mom.  After a few minutes, your mom mentioned she had a boyfriend.  I asked her who her boyfriend was, and when she said his name, my honest-to-god reflex was to lean in and said ""why?""  

And as your mom was describing what she liked about him, I cut her off and said ""no seriously, why?  Because I've tried talking to him.  He's fucking boring.""  

Yeah, sweetheart.  Your dad was a huge jerk in high school."
Maybe get him a book in a subject area he is especially interested in. A favorite dessert is also good.

A girlfriend who is simultaneously a good friend is one of the best things ever. Losing it is fucking nasty though. 
"If he treats his mom/sisters like shit, probably should stay away. I don't mean the ones who just have bad relationships with them because you never know why that is. I mean the ones who just treat and speak to their moms/sisters horribly and you can't seem to figure out why. "

"If it's in a private place, and he's not using sand paper I'd say you got yourself a normal kid, good on yah"
"*Shy* guys finish last. The majority of people who view the people who actually get women/men/whatever as ""bad guys"" are either too timid or too delusional. All it takes is confidence in the notion that the worst somebody can do to you is turn you down. "
Friend blew me at her place once. That was 17 years ago and we have never spoken of it since.   
"  &gt;""How do you even have sex with a girl?""

Their poor girlfriends, aw man.

But really, that seems kind of dumb to me. Of course you're gonna run into egotistical men that think their cock ia magic. Try not to let it bother you too much. "
My reaction to suprise blowjobs from my wife is identical to her reaction to surprise flowers from me.
"...You okay, bud?"

"Oh, she did.

"It'd be nice if my wife sent a little something every day, just so I know she wasn't Taken 3

Don't want her glued to the phone by any means though"
"I understand how tempting it is to try and change your girlfriend's opinion of herself to match your opinion of her. Unfortunately, pointing out something that she dislikes about herself, and trying to convince her that she should love it because you do, is not the way to go about it.

It's not about how much you like it. Touching her belly is a constant reminder of a perceived failure or flaw, on her part. I'm in a similar boat, and I can assure you that your touching it is very annoying, distracting, and even ticklish.  

Imagine having man boobs and your girlfriend bouncing them and saying ""I love your adorable man boobs!"" right before she motorboats you. Would that make you feel sexy? Considering the absence of ""Grow your manboobs in 30 days!"" commercials; I'm going to guess that it's a ""no"".

If you want to compliment her and help her self-esteem, give her specific compliments about things she has clearly done to look good or be a good person. ""The cut of that dress really accentuates all of the things I love about your figure"", ""That hairstyle is perfect for your face"", ""You are so thoughtful, I love how you always hold doors open for others at the store"".

In the meantime, if you love the feel of a plump belly, so much just grown your own and play with it ;)"
"Best friend of 6 years. Got broken up/cheated by my girlfriend of two-years. Best friend was super sweet, stood by my side through all the tears and sorrow. Slept together a few weeks after the breakup, started dating and we're now happily married (of one week, whoot!) and have the cutest 4 month old baby.

Easily the best decision I've made in my entire life. "

"I was being an asshole in a chat room on AOL in 94 and she called me on it. Been together ever since, now have 3 kids. "
"Yes. Best friends since early high school (both 24 now). Hooked up for the first time drunkenly a few months ago. Both panic over it and agree it was inevitable but we weren't going to ruin our friendship over it. Wasn't going to happen again. Except it did. Again and again. It's currently 4 months later, we hook pretty regularly soberly and drunk. But haven't discussed it again. And I'm sort of afraid I've caught allll the feelings."
Probably that men's issues tend to be downplayed or outright ignored. When is the last time you saw a massive charity drive for prostate cancer research? Or an awareness campaign about male victims of domestic abuse? These issues just don't get the attention that breast cancer or female victims of domestic abuse get.
That men have literally never spoken or interacted with women in their lives.
They don't give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry.

"It was surreal. I first saw the him after having a fight with his mentor, who I actually knew personally. I didn't realize he was my son, but there was just something about him. He looked so familiar, and I couldn't quite place my finger on it. 

Fast forward a few years and I actually found out that he was my son. I had learned that we happened to be in the same town together on business and I confronted him. He was shocked. Apparently, he was told I died years ago. I really tried to make amends, but he rejected me. I offered him the moon and stars. I offered to hand over our family business to him. I practically begged him to forgive me for not being there. I would have done anything to make it up to him, to make things right, but he had made up his mind. I was devastated.

Things ended up okay between us though. A few years after that last encounter, we met again and had some words. I was very calm and understanding at first, but eventually he made me so angry that we got into a huge brawl which ultimately ended with me throwing Emperor Palpatine into the Death Star's core. After that, we forgave each other, and while our time together was short lived, I was able to continue on peacefully."
Literally everything.
"See, I think straight men should have no problem understanding lesbianism. Personally, I don't find men attractive or sexy at all. And really, I can't understand why so many women do. Don't get me wrong--it's great that they do, and that some men are also attracted to men. But the idea of a person being attracted only to women makes so much sense to me, because that's how I am."

People (AskMen included) loudly talk about how if you've never had a fulfilling romantic/sexual life, you must be some gross neckbeard who's never wiped his ass or taken a bath. Come on man. Some of us are just extremely below average, so low that this superficial stuff won't change anything. I keep myself clean, gym every damn day, go out socializing, have a great job... hasn't made one whit of difference.

But it's so exhausting trying to explain this because when I do - now I'm not just an unwashed troglodyte, I'm an unwashed troglodyte who's defensive and in denial. Just can't win."

"Reproductive rights. Yeah yeah, abortion, I'm with you 100%, but don't start bringing up misogyny like it's my fault for having a dick.

"Especially after seeing so many terribly broken and generally undesirable and not-so-good men *not* getting rejected.

"Seriously, this is always the most common response and it's such a worthless comment. Imagine if people answered this way to similar questions.

""umm.... that they're also humans?? Just interact with them the exact same way you interact with anyone else""

Like, the answer isn't wrong but it also isn't helpful in the least. Yet when it comes to questions regarding women, this response always pops up and people just start shitting on OP with accusations about how he must see them as subhuman just because he's asking for some advice."

"Dirty talk. 

Its really *really* awkward to start, but once you start holy shit it can make things much more intense. 

Edit: How do I dirty talk?  Here's a quick starter guide. (for the record, I'm an old man in a loving long term relationship, YMMV for insecure twenty-somethings and one night stands).

It depends on your relationship.  

Some people want to focus on what you're doing, what your partner is doing, tell them it feels good, tell them what you like about them.  Call them sexy.  You can probably get into mild objectification/degradation with a partner without asking them about it first, but some people have hard stops on certain topics.

Safe and tame stuff: You're so fucking sexy, god you're tight, I love watching your tits bounce in my face, I love feeling your tits bounce when I pound you from behind, I love squeezing your hard ass while you ride me, You've been teasing me with that tight ass all day, I've been waiting all day to fuck you hard, I've spent all day dreaming about tearing off your panties, etc.  **These are all pretty vanilla topics.  Your goal is to make her feel desired.**

Objectify your woman: You like being my little slut?  You've been driving me wild showing me your slutty body.  I love coming home and fucking my personal slut.  **This ties it to your relationship.  Many women don't want to be called slut or whore but they find the idea of being your slut or your whore a turn on.**

Make it about her issues:  You make daddy so hot.  Daddy loves playing with your sexy body.  Did you ask daddy if your could touch yourself?  Do good girls touch themselves, baby?  It's okay, I know, your slutty little kitty needs you to touch it.  Cum for daddy, baby.  You're such a bad girl, teasing Daddy with your tight body.  Daddy's going to bend you over his knee and spank you hard.  You got Daddy all hard and worked up and now I need to fuck your pretty mouth, baby.   It's okay, baby, just be a good girl for daddy.  You taste so good baby, Daddy's going to lick up all your sweet cream.  It's okay, baby, it'll fit now, Daddy's going to slide his big cock into your tiny kitty.  Oh, fuck, baby, you're so tight, Daddy's going to fill you up, Daddy's going to cum in you, Daddy loves you so much...  

Uh, I'll be in my bunk.  "
Always open the car door for your date if you're driving. You've got a solid 10 seconds to let one rip as you walk to your side. Dates are full of little opportunities like that.
"&gt; Be clear about your intentions

This is a big one most people miss. It's hard to strike the perfect balance between clear intentions, severe awkwardness, and being a downright creeper."
"Whenever it was convenient for them. They're on vacation, I don't want them to go out of their way to talk to me and miss out on something fun. We can talk when she gets back :) And yes I'd like to see the photos "
"The key difference I've noticed in trying to be a good friend to male and female friends is that when men vent about issues in their life, they want you to trouble shoot with them and help find a solution.  When women vent about issues in their life, they want validation that it's okay for them to feel how they're feeling, and perhaps a story of solidarity if one is relevant to offer without ""one-upping"" their story.

"The biggest issue I see is that society in general doesn't think it's possible for men to have ""real"" problems.

Until we solve that one, there's no way to solve the others. 

After all, if men can't have real problems, then domestic abuse doesn't actually damage them. And they won't miss their kids when the ex-wife gets full custody. And the depression they're struggling with isn't actual mental illness. And there's no reason to think they don't actually enjoy being homeless. And when they want emotional support from their SO, they're being whiny. And when they fail to graduate college, they probably just weren't studying hard enough.

Dealing with issues is not a zero sum game. As a society, we can still work on problems women have even if we accept that men can have problems too.

But as long as society continues to deny that men have real problems, things are never going to improve."

"/u/detsnam once wrote [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3z8o75/why_dont_men_get_as_much_of_a_thrill_over/cykm7bm?context=3) amazing post about the ""male romantic fantasy"" that's somewhat relevant and well worth reading (partly paraphrased here):

&gt; Let's think in stereotypically gendered terms. When it comes to love, men have an active role while women have a passive one.

&gt; What are the implications of this? It means that what a woman feels as the ups and downs, the mystery, the unknown, the excitement, etc., all things that define ""blossoming"" love, are things that happen to her. She is passive, she is the recipient. Her agency is contained in her response to these things.

&gt; But for a man, anything that makes ""love"" progress (or regress) pretty much directly stems from one of his actions. He does something or initiates and a woman responds/reciprocates. Because he does not have the gendered luxury of taking a backseat or passive role and watching things happen (if he does, nothing will; the woman will lose interest), he begins, by necessity, to view love as the cause and effect relationship that it more accurately is in reality (he does something, woman responds).

&gt; Seeing something like this takes a ton of the ""magic"" out of it. Compare it to seeing the sun rise every day. It becomes a lot less mystical, exciting, and dramatic when you know exactly why it happens and can simply see it for the cause and effect relationship that it truly is... you may even begin to take it for granted.

&gt; This is why romance eventually becomes well... unromantic for men. Romance is not a phenomenon, but instead a verb; it's a series of actions carried out by a man to earn a woman's affections... it's labor.

&gt; Well, what happens when women make romantic gestures to men? Do they like it?

&gt; Well, that's a little bit off the mark, because it's actually describing an inversion of the gendered roles here (i.e. the woman is an active contributor while the man is a passive recipient or responder). While a man will appreciate such a gesture, it's not quite what composes the male romantic fantasy (more on this later).

&gt; Do men that were heavily pursued by women feel this way?

&gt; Men who aren't used to being pursued are usually confused or thrown off by the reversal of gendered roles. The result is the prevailing idea that men do not respond well to being approached first by women or even the autobiographical accounts from men describing instances where they couldn't respond well even if they were attracted to the woman approaching them. This is the men being shocked out of the traditional ""script"" of romance.

&gt; Secondly, when you talk about women pursuing men, that usually happens in a markedly different fashion than the way in which men pursue women (hint: it's more passive). A woman ""aggressively"" pursuing a man looks more like said woman going to extensive lengths to make it clear that she is available for pursuit rather than actively pursuing; the man is still usually leading things forward in some manner by handling the logistics of this romance. This is where you get those autobiographical stories from men about missing signals; ""aggressive"" pursuit from women is (usually) a set of passive signals that are clear to men who are experienced, but unclear to men not used to being ""pursued.""

&gt; Now, **The Male Romantic Fantasy**

&gt; I'd say that men usually feel most loved when this normal state of affairs is negated; when they are made to believe that a woman's love is not conditional in the cause-and-effect manner described in the parent post. Love is work for men, but it can be rewarding work when things are going smoothly and the woman is happy as a result. But the male romantic fantasy is to be shown that the woman feels the same way and stands by him when he's down on his luck, when the money's not there, or when he's not feeling confident. He wants to know that the love he believes he's earned will stay even when the actions that feed it wane (however temporarily). A good woman can often lift a man up in his times of need and desperation and weather the storm even when things aren't going well. The male romantic fantasy is an enduring and unconditional love that seems to defy this relationship of labor and reward. A man wants to be loved for who he is, not for what he does in order to be loved.

&gt; An interesting way to examine this is to look at what women often call romantic entitlement. An entitled guy is a dude who maintains an unrealistic notion of men's typically active role in love. Before acknowledging reality, this boy uncompromisingly believes that he shouldn't have to do anything or change anything about himself to earn a woman's love; he wants to be loved for who he is, not what he does.

&gt; All men secretly want this, but there comes a day when they eventually compromise out of necessity. After that day, they may spend years honing themselves, working, shaping themselves into the men they believe women want to be chosen by. A massive part of what causes boys to ""grow up"" is the realization that being loved requires hard work. This impetus begins a journey where a boy grows into a man by gaining strength, knowledge, resources, and wisdom. The harsh realities of the world might harden and change him into a person his boyhood self wouldn't recognize. He might adopt viewpoints he doesn't agree with, transgress his personal boundaries, or commit acts he previously thought himself incapable of. But ultimately, the goal is to feel as if his work is done.

&gt; When he can finally let go of the crank he continually turns day after day in order to earn love and, even if only for a moment, it turns by itself to nourish him in return, that is when he will know he is loved.

"Well, clearly you were a master of social engineering. "
"When I was 8, my little brother-- a year younger-- and I were fighting on the top bunk of our bunk beds. He kept pestering me, and then it happened. 

I just snapped and pushed him off the bed. He fell, cracked his skull, and fractured his neck. He's now paralyzed. 

In between my anger management small group appointments, I also talk to my university's shrink. It's been 13 years and I think about it everyday.

"We know when you're faking it. I would rather you be completely silent over faking happy noises.

It was hot."

"Moaning, sighing, murmuring, whispering, giggling, purring, groaning, growling, little (!) cries, etc. are all a big turn-on so long as they're genuine.

Porn-style fake bellowing and hollering and scripted shouty ""dirty talk"" until the walls come down is a turn-off.

Perhaps it's because I'm so used to being with a *quietly* vocal girl - moany, chatty, but never screaming the house down - I've come to be really turned on by all the fine, subtle nuances that lie in quieter sounds.

Like, when having intercourse, her moans will be really, really *soft* and creamy - because for her, sex is all about the emotional satisfaction; it feels nice and full and tingly to her, but it doesn't get her off; it's all about feeling close to me, and the intimacy, and feeling like I'm hers and so on and so forth. All that lies in the really soft gentle moans and murmurs and giggles and tiny squeaks she makes during sex. Just...happiness.

And one might compare that to the sounds she makes when I'm petting her clit, where her voice will get all growly and will come from deep at the back of her throat. Because that, for her, is about the physical satisfaction, that is about her getting her rocks off; it's not as emotionally satisfying for her as sex, but it is what will make her cum, and what one hears in her voice then is that satisfaction of a physical itch being scratched.

While that, of course, is only the most crude nuance, and while it runs much more finely grained (it's pretty easy to tell just from how guttural a moan sounds whether she wants to be touched a little softer or a little more intensely) it gives you a pretty good idea what I like so much about that kind of quieter, but more subtly nuanced noises: They're a form of implicit communication that one can instinctively pick up on in bed, a constant stream of auditory feedback and intimacy - the feeling of knowing her well enough to pick up on the tiniest hints = massive bonding boner - and on a primal level they go directly from my ear to my heart and my cock."
"Then dont! My stomach hasn't always been the flatest and my ex loved playing with it. I hated it, it was painful and annoying. It got to the point that I was nearly screaming so that it would be left alone.

Look, I know a lot of women are attracted to dominant behaviour, and fair enough, whatever floats your boat. 

But please be sure you can tell the difference between dominant and domineering. 

The advice about seeing how they treat waiters probably covers it; there's a subset of people that *need* to exert power in order to feel secure or valuable or whatever, and that's some nasty shit right there.

I had a boss like this once; he was the sort of person who would call you into his office ten minutes before he was done with an Important Phone Call, making you sit in awkward silence until he finished, to drive home how important you weren't.  He also used to schedule weekly meetings half an hour before usual start of business, wrecking everyone's commuting schedule, and spending a chunk of time grilling people on *precisely* why they were a few minutes late. I saw how he treated his partner, and... yeah no. 

If they play shitty mean-girl games, putting people on the back foot to puff themselves up... just walk away.

Taking charge is fine. Not taking shit is fine. But make sure it's because they *can*, not because they *need* to - which means you keep a sharp eye out for any hint of mean or petty in the mix."

"I can speak to this because it happened to me, although it was not my SO but a former SO. It was pretty much like The J. Giles band described it..blood runs cold. 

Back in 1999/2000 I had a short may-to-december relationship with a woman. It was odd...the flirting, spark, attraction etc was intense *prior* to us declaring our feelings and dating, but once it was out in the open it seemed to fizzle. More anticipation then reality I guess. We lasted about 4 months. It wasn't turbulent, just...boring. We mutually ended it and went separate ways. 

A few years passed, and I barely gave her a thought. 

Then one day in 2004 I was cruising around the internet trying to have a good fap session and randomly opened some video...well guess fucking who. At first I thought I was mistaken, and I leaned in closer to double check and sure enough, there she was. I looked at the whole set of still pics that came with it too. There was no mistaking it, right down to the beauty mark over her lip and a few other..err..""features"" I was familiar with. She was blowing some older dude, and looked pretty much the same. 

I wondered how the fuck she ended up there. It's not like she was involved in drugs or anything, at least when I dated her, and it's not like she was struggling financially. When I dated her she had a steady, moderately well paying job and very little debt. Sexually she was a solid B+...not a dead fish, but not a complete vixen perv either. Perfectly fine. I had no idea what had gone on in the years between 00 and 04 with her. This was before FB was a thing.

Lost my hard on. Didn't fap that day. "

"I moved to a new country and couldn't speak the language very well. I managed to join a gym by speaking very very simple sentences. 

In the gym, I was the only foreigner (white dude with blue eyes in a room full of Koreans).

I eventually saw the same people there, time after time, but never tried talking to them. 

Then one day, the gym was closing for renovations, for about 6 months, and this Korean dude I always saw there was working next to me. 

He pointed to the sign and said ""Gym is closing. Do you know where to go?""

I said ""Nah, man, I don't know the area too well, or what to look for."" (I found this gym by chance.)

He said ""I will find a good one, we go together.""

I said ""Cool, thanks!""

He finds a new gym, sends me the information, and helps me sign up at the new place.

"Marriage offers a degree of legal and financial stability to the co-habitating/sharing funds lifestyle.  It helps offer a safeguard for the one at home raising the kids, if they are acting as a full or part time house-spouse.

Marriage also means official social recognition of your relationship.  This could be in the eyes of family, friends and/or God, but it also means in the eye of businesses, courts and hospitals.  Being a husband gives you a lot more control over medical decisions (in the case of unconciousness of your partner) than being a ""boyfriend"", which may be what your partner would also prefer.  Marriage is also more often recognized for things like health insurance, immigration and inheritance than being a ""boyfriend"".  

If you're already co-habitating/sharing funds and one of you makes a lot more than the other, then marrying can save you money on your income taxes.

On a more emotional level, as a guy gets older love tends to be more about stability and friendship and less about passion.  While we can rationally model marriage as a contract that seems to primarily limit you, most people aren't actually that rational in terms of how they feel and behave; the inertia of the marriage contract itself can be an expression and reassurance of the stability that guy desires.

As I am sure the wonderful, happy people of Reddit will point at there are some flaws with marriage, even inferred in this very post, and I am not pretending that it is for all couples.  But basically, if you and your partner have already started viewing your union as a single entity rather than or in addition to a relationship between two separate entities, then marriage helps that principle become a reality in day-to-day life instead of just in your own heart."

I don't care at all. Not the slightest. Worst case scenario is that I could feel good because of the positive attention.
"I think the instinct to care (female) vs. the instinct to protect (male) is innate.

The example I give that really honed in this theory for me occurred while riding the subway. Train pulled into the stop, doors open up, a rider (who had been sitting) stands up quickly, wobbles, then collapses on the floor. In less than half a second 2 women had rushed over to aide the person, while myself and another man rushed to stand in the doors and secure the situation.

Nothing had been communicated, but the gender divide in terms of ""how to handle the issue"" was obvious. The women felt the immediate call to care for the individual in trouble, and the men felt the immediate call to protect her (stall the train from continuing and flag down help) until the situation was resolved. It all seemed kinda preordained in terms of what our roles were in helping the rider out.

"How much harder it is to be ""very attractive"", imo. Genetics wise, you either have it or you don't, and that applies to both sexes. Beyond that, it's easier for girls to get closer to what is considered ""very attractive"". Basically, eat right, exercise enough to keep bf% down, and makeup. That's what it takes. For guys, take out the makeup and add in years of weight training for muscles. Significantly harder.

If you look at the AskWomen survey for what they find attractive, the #1 picked body type was a buff Christian Bale. That kind of body takes years to sculpt with proper nutrition and gym dedication. The ""ideal type"" for guys just requires the nutrition part. 

Yes, I know not all girls like muscles. Just like not all guys like big tits and flat stomachs. I'm not accounting for deviation from what is generally considered ""attractive"". "
"Oftentimes when someone says ""let's just be friends"" as a way of rejecting you, they're not saying that they necessarily want to be buddies and see you all the time. It's a way of softening the blow. It's more like saying ""let's be friendly acquaintances so we don't make it awkward when we run into each other at a party."" Most of the time women say this, they are not trying to deepen your platonic relationship so don't worry that they're somehow ""out of their mind"" expecting your precious time or demanding a spot in your life. Just fade and it should be fine. Most of them are probably expecting you to fade and will feel awkward if you try to hang out with them a lot."

"I love this post, because I've heard the same fucking thing in regards to race (Asian men).

&gt; See, there's no insidious discrimination, it's all in your control. 

The thing is I don't blame people for having preferences, but *not acknowledging* that it exists is infuriating.  Even worse, turning it *on you, the person that has that trait*, rather than the population who picks, is *really* infuriating.  Usually it's done to make the woman feel better; it's not *their* fault for not going out with the minority population.  Of course, it *is*; it's *their* preference.

Typically the easiest way, especially with women, is to point out their own dating histories.  I've had women say the same shit, then ask how many Asian men they've been out with (or in your case, the shortest man they've been out with).  And you can often steer it pretty hard to make them realize and/or feel guilty, then play on the guilt, then point out how their comment is utterly fucking idiotic.  Keep in mind, if you do this, don't do it to be bitter, and if you're accused of it point out that *their own dating histories reflect the bigger problem, and that their advice or views are then just wholly useless*.  Perhaps throw in that they're saying that either because they themselves aren't very observant, or are so far in denial that they *have* to throw those lies out to you.  But that you have to live with that reality."

It is within the normal range for a kid to start masturbating (stimulating their genitals for pleasure, regardless of orgasm) as soon as they notice it feels good to do so.

Your son is normal. There only thing I would say to him is not to put his penis into anything, (old shampoo bottles, etc) and not to put anything on it.(hairbands, rubber bands, etc.) Additionally, tell him not to put anything into his urethra.

Just obvious safety stuff that a horny kid might ignore.

"She was a friend of a friend and I sold her some ecstasy the night before a Halloween rave. We started talking about our costumes and I mentioned that I was going as a Mormon missionary. Turns out we both grew up in the Mormon church but left as teenagers, were the same age and liked all the same music. 

At the time she was in outpatient rehab for heroin addiction which normally would have been a deal-breaker for me but there was something so different and electric in that interaction I couldn't stop thinking about her. We started hanging out and within six months we had left the people we were dating and got engaged. After a frightening relapse that nearly killed her we decided to leave our home state and start a new life on the other side of the country. She hasn't used since.

Four years later and we're happier/healthier than ever, married and have a two-year-old daughter. She's not going to hear the whole story until she's much, much older."
"It was a lot of things that kinda created the perfect shitstorm of unhealthiness.

- We both developed feelings, neither of us wanted to admit it. (Heard him tell more than one person that I was the girl he was gonna marry)

- Stemming from that, a handful of times, I tried to casually date somebody, and he would be aggressive towards that person, and overly emotional towards me. If he was with somebody, I'd turn into a grumpy, angry bitch, whether I was seeing somebody or not.

- He and I were big drinkers (I've since cut back, him, not so much). We never really hung out sober. since we wanted to spend a ton of time together, we were both always drunk.

It basically just kept ending up that one, or both, of us would end up feeling neglected, or jealous, or just generally really unhappy nearly every time we spent time together. We've definitely grown apart quite a bit.. certainly not nearly as close as we were before the physical aspect started. It does kind of break my heart on some level, but it wasn't unexpected.

"My wife and I attended a smaller university together, and for 5 years, our paths never crossed. We found out later we had several mutual acquaintances, but somehow we had never been in the same place at the same time.  

On the night of ""Last Class Bash,"" which was basically the year-end party to celebrate the end of the semester, I went with friends to one of the local pubs, and we ended up getting there way later than expected, due to one of my friends getting sick and not being able to go (I almost didn't go without them). As soon as we walked in, two girls walked past me, and one of them happened to make eye contact and smiled.  

The thought that went through my head was ""I need to have a beer, and then I'm going to find that girl with the amazing eyes and fantastic smile and talk to her.""  

I got my beer, and when I returned to the friend I came with, and who is he talking to? The other girl, who was with the girl who smiled at me! Turns out they worked together, and suddenly I'm talking to this amazing woman, and the next thing I know, three hours have passed and we've just been sitting in the middle of a crowded bar, talking to each other.  

I found out she was moving out of province in two weeks, and we literally spent every single day of those two weeks together. She was graduating, and had planned to move back home, but in the three months we were apart, she came to visit me, I went to visit her, I told my parents she was the one, and in the fall we moved in together while I finished my last year of university.  

We met in April, I bought a ring in August, I proposed to her in November, and we were married the following July. We celebrated our 8th anniversary last summer, and we have two amazing kids, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her."
"I recently attended the funeral of a woman I had never met (I work with her husband, and several of us went to be there for him).  

It's hard to explain, but seeing how profoundly this woman, who I had never met, had impacted so many people's lives, significantly affected the way I think of the world, and your story has had a similar impact on me.  

There are over 7 billion people on this planet, and every single one of them has somebody whose world is completely changed by them being in the world, and again when it is their time to leave it. It's a combination of realizing how vast the planet we live on actually is, and how small an individual life is in comparison, but also the knowledge that no matter how small we might feel, we leave a permanent mark on the people who **are** in our lives.  

Your wife sounds like a wonderful woman, and I hope you can take some comfort that she has left a mark on someone she never met, through your words."

"The second one is a gem.  It's the go-to line for women when they want to make you feel better.  In their defense, they genuinely believe they are giving you good advice because the whole, ""Stop worrying, just sit back and let it find you."" tactic is precisely what's worked for them their entire lives.  I've long since given up trying to explain to them that it just doesn't work that way, so I just smile and say thanks because I know they mean well.  

Meaning well aside, it's breathtakingly horrible advice.  If we followed it, about 80% of us would never date or get laid again.  If you want something to happen, it's on you to make it happen. Fair or unfair is irrelevant.

The other boy is really athletically gifted. Watching him make the interception to stop the other teams game winning drive in their championship still gets me choked up. 

My daughter is harder to connect with. She mostly hangs out with my wife. However we do a lot of stuff together, but she's also still fairly young. Right now she's going through the scary story phase. She begs me to tell her one, and then is freaked out and sleeping in our bed. It's so fun."

"That's fine, but I'm talking about people who follow a majority of just weed related pages on instagram or all their activities are around weed, or have weed posters in their room. I'd say the same about alcohol too. To be honest, and I know how controversial this is, the majority people who smoke weed everyday don't function well. 

This is from years of experience with roommates/bandmates/friends who claimed they were broke all the time but spent money on weed every week. It prevented them from doing certain things: i.e. bandmates ""couldn't afford"" to rent a rehearsal space for 3 hours but spent a lot more money on weed than the cost of a jam space. Shit like that. I have more examples but that one bugged me the most. I don't want that kind of bullshit with someone I'm in a relationship with."

"Ugh, one woman said this to me and it totally broke me.  We were close before High school and only got closer during.  I felt like we had so much in common, I guess I figured she felt the same tension I did the whole time too. I should have made a move then, but was too scared. We were so close, I even went on vacation with her family a bunch of times.  I remember her mother saying something about how glad she was that I always got along so well with her daughter and how we seemed so close.  I figured it was because there was something more between us and that one day she'd realize how perfect we were for each other.  We went to different colleges and saw each other less and less, so I decided to tell her how I felt.  She reacted very poorly and now I don't talk to my sister anymore.  I try to tell myself it's because she moved so far away right after, but I can't help but feel like there's been a rift between us since I told her how I felt.  Oh well, you live and learn, right?"
That's the best fucking response on this thread.
"Yeah, that's the problem. You're going toward random peoples with the intention to shag them. That's fine, but it's obvious, and they have to have the same intention at that moment, otherwies you're definitively out. And the odds of them being in the same mood are...low. Because:

50% of peoples are of the wrong sex  
80% of the rest isn't in your age group  
70% of the rest already in a relationship and faithfull  
50% of the rest had other shit to do than dating/sex today/this week/year  
20% is in a bad mood anyway  
30% of the rest find you ugly  
[...]

Sex and long term relationships are differents things, but the chance of a random person being interested in that, with you, at the same moment you are, are atronomically low. Hence: unless you're in a place/situation expressedly made for intermingling (dating websites, hook-up bars, swinger parties) don't bother with trying to find a partner. 

Just be awesome, and once someone agrees you're awesome, offer to shag them like you're a rare parrot. "

Its not something i had to think about and thankfully i'm not expeced to ""pursue"". It also makes me reconsider how i react when guys hit on me. Guys also apparently worry about dick size A LOT. Even average sized dudes feel like they need a donkey dick or something. Guys have very strict gender roles. While we are breaking gender roles for women, guys are still expected to pay, not allowed to be feminine or show emotion, and a bunch of other things im too lazy to think about.

She loved fucking me which I didn't understand because she was my first girl and I would cum too fast. Then she got clingy and I had to end the hook ups but then it just ruined the relationship.

"To be fair, there are some guys out there who make a lot of money and get pissed off that so many women see *only* that. Case in point, I'm doing pretty well money-wise, but if someone asks me what I do I say ""I work in IT cuz I'm a huge a nerd"" and change the subject. So I see where he's coming from, in a sense.

That being said, I would look for ""arrogance without cause"" and ""obvious neediness"".

""Arrogance without cause"" is basically a guy who doesn't have any reason to be awesome, but still tries to be. It's a sign that he's living to impress others instead of living to be happy.

""Obvious Neediness"" is that stage 5 clinger bullshit. My social life is in the crapper and I find it hard to connect to people. But when I *do* I tend to go overboard. The difference though is that some people try to *force* that connection. Be wary of them because you'll *never get rid of them*. These are the people who threaten to kill themselves if you break up with them."

"That we no longer have a social playbook.

Not sure how to express this but basically it's that because everything is 'okay' as long as you are into it, it's difficult to read and act in any given situation.

Think about first dates - everything from just talking (even if you both really feel it) to sex (even if you don't feel it but are both horny) is on the table.  There's no rules for romantic progression for guys - takes you months or even years to get a date and then you have no idea how to act.

That we are demonized for having opinions about women, about sexual norms, about pretty much anything.  Don't like fat girls - you're fat shaming.  Don't like promiscuity?  Slut shaming.

The lack of social norms also deeply impacts how men interact with each other, too.  How many of you have to deal with social isolation because you work like a dog, have few to no friends and are stuck in some strange city (maybe even making bank) playing video games because you don't know how to integrate and there's just no real options other than 'look at meetup.com' or some nonsense.

 And the internet just makes things worse because some loud ass has a megaphone to tell you why everything you knew about how to act and how to feel is wrong."

"It depends on the guy. Some guys don't care. Some guys view sex as a special thing done between two people who have a connection or something, and if a woman has had casual sex many times with many men, it would suggest they are not sexually compatible. Alternatively, some guys don't view sex like that and prefer a more sexually free woman."

Not sure if want."
"I think because it's not about having a relationship to build with as it was in the past, and more to do with having that sort of ""excitement.""  

When my grandparents or parents are asking about finding a girl, it's for someone to have a family with.  Then I look at the other 20- and 30-something women, all of whom don't want to find someone to build a family with and grow old with, but instead want as a sort of toy/companion/pet.

Love defined by romance, not out of relationship.

You'll pick the cutest and more exciting man in that case.  And sometimes you get married.  And... well... most of the relationships I've seen have been pretty fucking miserable (click check boxes).

It makes finding the right woman that much more difficult.

That's been the reality for me actually.  Most women simply aren't people I'd want to have a relationship with.  Not someone I want to grow old with.  I'm sure that woman exists, but most women just are inadequate.  They may be hot and someone I'd want to fuck, but not someone I'd spend the rest of my life with, especially when their own judgment (and yes, it's THEIR judgment in dating) is so fucking poor.

Ultimately, I think it's why guys in their 30s that have more power in dating end up being that way.  Their 20s ended up being filled with meeting mostly women that lack that sort of perspective, are wholly immature without any sign of growth.  The ones that are worth that time had been taken much, much earlier."

"I'll go to the bathroom. But if it becomes a thing with us, usually about 2 or 3 weeks in I'll level with her and be like ""look, we both know that you and i fart, so let's get over the awkwardness and just let it happen for the sake of both our guts"". Usually she's grateful I said something "

I always just want to say something or just tell them to shut up because there's always a good 10 of them at the end of every set of comments. It's pathetic. No one cares. And they always have 10,000+ post karma, usually to subs like /r/csgo or /r/gaming, and a very active and frequent post history. It's quite obvious where your time and efforts go.
