Is this a serious question or am I the dumb one?
"Okay, so you see a qt at the bar right, but you're too much of a bitch to think of something clever to say. Lucky for you your boy captainfrobie has you covered.

So you walk up to her and you ask her for some advice. If she shoots you down here then, well, shit. Brush your teeth or something next time. She'll probably say yes. You should ask her the best way to approach a cute woman at the bar. At worst she'll tell you don't, in which case you totally saved face because you just wanted advice, right? Of course you did. Just walk away and thank her slick. 

But what she'll most likely do is tell you her favorite pick up line/strategy/fucking *something*. Pay attention, stop staring at her tits. Once she's told you, thank her and walk back to your friends.

Wait five minutes.

Do the thing she said to do. 

I have never not had this work."
"For sex? Never. One trip to Pound Town is all those puppies can handle. However, I've found that there are a ton of other creative ways to reuse condoms if you're looking to lessen that carbon footprint. Here's my fun list of eight ways to be green with condom reuse:            

1. **Trashcan liner.** This is a simple one, but you'd be surprised at how effective they are. Leftover cum really helps the trash stick to the bag and not end up all over your floor. If you want that supply of used condoms to keep coming, you need to keep your living space clean.          

2. **Water balloon.** Everyone loves a good water balloon fight as the weather heats up! Reusing condoms is a perfect way to ensure that you're always the winner.       

3. **Gardening gloves.** Every real man has a garden. Growing your own food is sexy and sustainable. The cum on the inside of a reused condom creates a tight seal onto your hands to make sure that you don't get all dirty while you're planting, and later harvesting, the fruits (or should I say veggies?) of your labor.          

4. **Thundersticks.** Noise-makers like [these](http://minisportsballs.putyournameonit.com/images/other_product_photos/noisesticks.jpg) are great to have at sporting events, but I've never seen them sell for cheap. You get the same effect by blowing up two used condoms and smacking them together as you'd get with the traditional product! Not to mention how much everyone will respect and admire you for having had sex two times.      

5. **Ice pack.** Sometimes life gets hard. You bang your head or you end up sick after a night of debauchery. By filling up a used condom with water and popping it in the freezer, you've created a handy ice pack to ease what ails you. No more need to keep lame frozen vegetables in your house!       
  
6. **Icing bag.** Making someone a homemade cake is a great way to show that you love them. However, a layman might not always have the tools on hand to construct a well-decorated cake. By filling up a used condom with icing and then cutting a slit in the tip, you have an icing bag to pipe out decorations in no time.     

7. **Wrapping paper.** When you're giving the perfect gift, you often need to conceal it or protect it before the giftee opens it up. It's easy to toss a bunch of used condoms in a gift bag to serve either function. No more cutting, folding, or taping wrapping paper ever again!      

8. **Toothbrush travel case.** As I'm sure your dentist tells you every six months, you need to brush your teeth every night. However, when you're away from home, it always seems disgusting to just toss your toothbrush in your travel bag with your shoes and your underwear. A used condom is shaped perfectly to just drop your toothbrush right in and then get it back out when you need it. You can be sure your toothbrush isn't getting gross in your bag by wrapping it up. "

"I'm not big on lines, but one that had a good reception was a total spur of the moment thought.  Honestly, it'll lose something in text, but I was driving this girl I liked in my car.  We had been friends years prior, but nothing romantic.  I told her in plain words, ""You know, I used to be totally head over heels for you"".  (cheesy, I know)  She tried to stifle (poorly) a smiled and looked at me and said, ""Really?"" in a quiet, genuine way, that suggested she was both excited and surprised.

I glanced back at her and had one of the smoothest lines I've ever thought of in the moment, ""Well, can you blame a guy?"" In the purple glow of my accent lights, I can honestly say I now know what someone means when they say ""she was glowing"".  Seriously, she was just beaming with the biggest, pretties smile I've ever seen.

Getting married in a month and she seems to be as radiant as ever.  I wish the best for her and her husband!"

&gt; You're attracted to what you're attracted to. Plus, the differences can be big enough that even if they're attractive without makeup, it could look odd compared to what you're used to and still turn you off which is completely understandable.


&gt; You can't control who you're attracted to, and many women use makeup to hide the fact that they are not attractive

"Shower beers are great.

Sometimes it's for pre-gaming, sometimes is for post-outdoor physical activity shower, sometimes it's before a date, sometimes it's for post work relaxing, and sometimes it's just nice to drink a beer in hot water.

For anyone people who complain about getter water in the beer, keep it above the shower head when not drinking or outside the shower, easy peasy."

"Call me old-fashioned, but I only have sex with a girl who I am ""officially"" in an exclusive relationship with. Personally, while I have made out with girls who I met at parties, and enjoyed that, I have come close to sex but backed out of it because intimacy just doesn't feel like much when I don't have genuine romantic feelings for her.

"When I visited my friend's house as a kid, as we were leaving his mom told him ""be safe, love you"" and he replied ""I love you too,"" which was so WEIRD to me.

And in relationships, the very first time a girl said ""I love you"" all I could say was ""I love you...too?"" because I had never said that out loud before and genuinely meant it. When I start a family, I'm definitely going to incorporate it and let my kids always know that I love them. "

"God. I have several bad ones but here's probably my biggest fuck up (yet somehow ended up ok):

My roommate and his girlfriend were playing matchmaker and trying to hook me up with this girl. She lived about an hour away. We texted and emailed for about two weeks before we met. Texts got pretty explicit and it was obvious we had some chemistry. For our first date we decided I would take her to our city's annual music festival and she would spend the night. 

So the night comes, and she comes over. I was nervous as shit and chain smoking. She's not a smoker. Oops. First big mistake. 

We pregame a little and then hop in my car and drive downtown for the festival. My intent was that we would check out a couple bands together and just have a good time. Well the thing is, back then, I was somewhat of a local celebrity especially within the type of people that would be at this festival. People were constantly wanting to come up and talk to me and I was too polite/not assertive enough to turn them away. So my date felt abandoned (and rightly so). 

It got worse when I was asked impromptu to go up on stage and introduce a band. She said it was fine but I should have known better. She ended up finding a friend of hers (male) in the crowd and talking to him while I was acting like Mr. Bigshot. 

When I found her she was making plans to have her friend take her home. I apologized profusely for being an insensitive ass and offered to take her back to her car. It was late and I offered to let her stay the night with no sexual intentions so she didn't have to drive back home. She decided she wanted me to drive her to her car and that she was driving home. She was seething mad, but didn't talk about it. 

Ok, no problem. So we walk back to my car. During that walk something happened I guess. I quit thinking like Mr. Bigshot and started paying attention to her. She cooled off during the walk. And on the drive back to my house we started talking and having a real conversation. We ended up going into the house and sitting on the sofa and talking more. She said her feet hurt, so I rubbed them. 

When she tells the story that's the point she says things turned around. She hated me until I rubbed her feet - she says that melted her. 

Anyway she ended up spending the night. Fast forwarding - we got married, had a baby, got divorced. 

But it was a roller coaster of a first date I really fucked up yet somehow managed to save. "
"Married guy here.

First of all...

&gt; I'm really liking what those two big companies have to offer in terms of having cleaning and repair right there in house. I don't want my girlfriend to be without her ring for weeks at a time every year.

Cute sales pitch, but this is silly. Rings can be cleaned at home using ring cleaner, and a quality ring should not need weeks of repair per year. Want to know how many repairs Mrs. Anderson's engagement ring has needed over the past 20 years? None.

Want to know the best place to go shopping for a diamond? Your family. Maybe your mom or grandma has a diamond ring sitting in a safe deposit box somewhere? Maybe she'd be honored for your wife-to-be to wear and enjoy her diamond that's sitting around collecting dust? And think of the sentimental value!

Once you have the center stone, then you buy a setting and get the stone mounted. The setting can be bought anywhere. A jewelry consignment shop is a fine place, but you could get something custom made, too.

Second best place to buy a diamond is probably Costco. Mrs. Anderson's diamond earrings came from there. They do a good job and won't try to fuck you. It's little wonder that Costco sells more diamonds than any other company in the US.

If sticker shock is a problem, get a cheap ring now and upgrade at her 5 year anniversary. Do not go into debt to buy a frickin' ring.

Congrats on the upcoming engagement! "
"Played guitar outside her apartments. It looks great in movies, but it is really *really* awkward in real life. It lasted until her mother (whom I had not yet met) came to the door and asked me to stop. Worst part: it was *Wonderwall*

"Plan dates.

I'm in the same boat as your guy, always mentally tired. This is what I'd like to say to my GF:  Just pick a place that YOU want to go to, or a movie YOU want to see.  Tell me exactly when and where I need to be and in what attire. Tell me how long the date will last and whether I should plan to drink, take a cab, drive, etc. Plan the details.

I don't want to spend the last of my mental energy having another ""what should we do?"" conversation, nor do I want to spend it worrying about whether you *really* liked the date or are just doing it for me. Take the initiative. If you plan nothing, that's exactly what we'll do."

"Was on a third date at a girls house. She made me dinner. The plans for the evening were ""watch TV at her house."" Except the TV was only in her bedroom, and the only place to sit was her bed. It was THAT date.

During the ""Netflix"" part of the ""Netflix and Chill"", my belly rumbles, and I head to the bathroom. I am parted from my meal. Oh god. It's not flushing. I look around the room for aid. Nothing. All my fears have come true.

I now have to come out, and tell this girl that we have to make an emergency run to the store, and I'd really rather not go into the details.

Not a fun evening, but at least a funny evening."
"Dude. I know it's too late, but there's an easy solution. Trust me, I was in your shoes. I was also high as balls, which didn't really improve the situation. 

Step 1: many women have a small garbage can in the bathroom. Remove the bag of garbage, gingerly set aside.

Step 2: turn the hot water on, and fill the can as best you can

Step 3: pour that bad boy down the toilet. It SHOULD break up any blockages, and trigger the toilet to flush

Step 4: dry the garbage can, return the bag, and silently thank yourself for reading an inane post about fixing a toilet.

"I'm going to tell another one cause this is fun:

In my early 20's I was working an Indigo Girls concert (as I mentioned in my other post I was fairly well known) and a group of girls came up to say hi. One just radiated sex appeal. I flirted with her, she flirted back and they ended up hanging out about an hour before the concert started. Feeling my oats I told her I had tickets to see Elton John and asked her to go with me. She said yes and we traded numbers. 

I assumed I could get tickets for free (didn't actually have them). Turns out my usual ability to get tickets didn't apply to Sir Elton. So I had to buy them and they were expensive as fuck. But I did it anyway. 

I picked her up and she looked hot.   Pink mini skirt, sexy white translucent top with a lacy bra underneath, very little makeup. We hit a bar near the venue before the show and chatted. She was friendly but something felt off. No worries, maybe she's nervous. 

We go to see EJ and it was a great show. I tried to put my arm around her at one point and she moved away. Ok. No problem. Still had a good time. 

After the show we bar hopped a little. This girl could drink!  Got expensive. Eventually I took her home. i walked her to her door ,she invited me in for a glass of water. Ok.  I'm thinking ""Finally!""

Started getting a little flirty. She didn't reciprocate. Finally she says, ""TheTrashyOne, you know I'm a lesbian right?""

TLDR:  flirted with a lesbian at an Indigo Girls concert, got used for Elton John tickets. "

Now even an overthinking idiot like me can tell it's the 'talk to me' sign but 9/10 times I just can't be arsed with it. 

So she stands next to you, doesn't look at you, and is facing away from you, yet somehow that means she wants to talk to you? Yeah, I wouldn't pick up on that at all. I'm probably not facing her either so I wouldn't even see her! She should just say hi if she wants!"

"If it's super heavy make up, then no not really. If the difference really is like night and day, then no you're not shallow. A lot of models have that type of face going on - suuuuuper plain until the make up transforms them into whatever look the artist needs/wants.

If it's light make up, then yes, you are shallow. Accenting a feature or smoothing out skin imperfections is the point of light make up. Rejecting small physical imperfections would make a person shallow because EVERYONE has small imperfections."

"The biggest ""trick"", so to speak, is having the right mindset, IMO. And that means, allow yourself to not like her. 

Don't try to make a good first impression, don't try to get her to like you or to get her number. All that does is put pressure on you to perform. Instead, make it your aim to find out if *you* like *her*. Get to know her. Show some interest in her, be light-hearted, be flirtatious. 

And *if* you decide she's cool enough to see her again, say so: ""Hey, you're fun to talk to/cool/funny/smart/have giant tits that I absolutely need to see again. How about we meet up for coffee/drinks/random low-key activity?"" Make it a date and don't be afraid to call it that if you feel like it.

Next day tell her what a nice time you had and that you'd like to see her again. Seems like a plan, no?"

"When I was younger I would go on a lot of online dates with this particular story I was on a second date with a girl and it wasn't really going well. I could tell that she wasn't particularly interested and neither was I so I was just going to cruise through the night and be done with it. At this time I was hooking up with my neighbor. While my date was in the bathroom I texted my neighbor saying that I'll be done soon and to stop and get some beer from the corner. 

I accidentally sent that text to my date...she came back from the bathroom saying ""so I got your text..."" I pretty much panicked, apologized profusely and we both admitted the date was not going well and we called it a night."

She died a few months after our son was born. 5 years later, I am remarried. Dating my now wife was absolutely terrifying . It was a whole new world that I had no interest in discovering, yet for my wife, I did it. I'm really glad I did as I am happier than ever.

But still, zero regrets about not using 'my freedom'. I had a lot of years in a very satisfying, loving relationship and I don't think any amount of one night stands or flings would have come close."

When you stop growing up, you start growing out.  

Lift, it actually helps.

Your body fat is a function of your diet, stop eating terrible shit and drinking too much.  Withdrawal from corn syrup addiction felt the same to me as the withdrawal symptoms from cigarettes.


Do activities that get you in the proximity of and interacting with women.  Going to bars is not one such activity.  I work in a male dominated industry in a male dominated profession, i have frequent contact with 3 females - my mother (who is 81), my wife who is 47 and daughter who is 12.

Online dating seems like a good way for regular guys to get their souls crushed while providing the beautiful people access to a wider pool of beautiful people to sleep with.

You will become rich if you think long term -- invest every payday - $20, $50 or something in broad market ETFs like ivog or ivov.  Nothing happens for 10 years, then boom, you have $100K or whatever.

You will eventually fall in love -- don't fall in love so you aren't alone.  That path leads to years of pain.

Once a cheater always a cheater is true.


Other myths I see:

Don't date until you 'love yourself' or some other shit.  Learning to date is part of the process of growing up.

Don't be an orbiter or put your self in the friendzone more than once.  It's a right of passage -- learn from it.

Being an orbiter makes you pathetic.

"A little after things in our relationship started getting really serious she did something kind of foolish (I think maybe she fell down putting on a pair of pants or something) she just offhandedly said ""Oh you married a good one"". 

Once she realized what she had said she got so embarrassed and basically hid under the covers but god it just struck me right through the heart. We had discussed marriage and her making that little slip up just made me know for certain that she was as serious as I was so it was really nice. 

"
"Another gem I had was when I was out for the night with my sister and her roommate.  My sister kept leaving us two alone and her roommate was really getting close with me.  Between the drinks, our chemistry being great, and her being gorgeous (regardless of my BAC) - I was really enjoying our time together.  She kept laughing at all my dumb jokes and kept telling me things about her self that she preface with ""I never tell a guy I just met this...but..."" and then queue something somewhat intimate detail about herself.  She said at one point, ""I'd dump my boyfriend for a guy like you.""

Slightly off topic, this part will be relevant later, but we noticed some goth girl in boots that came up to just below the knees.  They had some serious heels too, so I pointed out to her as she was about to step down the curb (chicago curbs can be high!) that I was impressed by her heel control.  She smiled, grabbed my forearm as if to balance herself as she stepped down, maintaining eye contact the whole way.  My sis kept teasing me that she totally wanted me and we noticed that said roommate was also wearing similar boots - though not in goth drab.

Anyway, I'm getting a bit sloshy and wondering if what I'm detecting signals from the roommate or if it is all in my head, because you know you can never really tell very easily.  So she asks me (I'm paraphrasing I think, the night was getting slippery in my memory now), ""So /u/Flightless_Ferret, are you interested in anyone right now?"", she cracks a smile puts a hand on my chest to steady her lean into me to hear more clearly.  Rather then hit her with my normal response of, ""Not that I know of!"".  I had a sober second and let out a ""Maybe...(half smile)... I have a thing for pretty women in high boots"".  I maintained eye contact and again I saw that same radiant look! I couldn't tell though, on my road to inebriation, if she liked that comment or was disgusted because it was creepy.

So, one day I said ""fuck it"". I packed my apartment into a storage unit, enrolled in a class, and moved to New York. I didn't know anyone, and slept in my car for a few nights, but by the end of the third day, I'd made a friend in class who let me sleep on her couch.

"Ok. You have to realize that if you are going to sell a relationship for cash, you have to deal in the commodities relevant to your market. 

In the words of my favorite band: guys go for looks, girls go for status. 

To get a sugar daddy, a girl must only be hot and fuck the guy. These are the services required and rendered. 

To get a sugar momma, you have to provide the services required: make a woman, who is already wealthy and probably thus important, feel more important. You must be desirable to her friends and counterparts, but only belong to her. You must not only be good-looking, but good looking in the right way- and each situation will be the right way.  Part of your services would be *making her friends jealous*. 

You must be arm candy. You must be a confidante. You must *earn your keep*, in that you perform a service to a woman, an emotional service.  There will probably be sex, and you must be good at this too, but women can find meaningless sex, you have to make her feel so good, so sexy, so important and valuable *that she puts a price tag on it*.

And THEN you need to make her feel like she is getting something for her money. You'll find people are more than willing to spend tons of money on altruistic ends, if they get to feel like they are doing something worthwhile and significant. 

So you need to be a world-class boyfriend, and you need to (and this is the important word) DISPLAY so much potential that everyone you meet knows you are going to go far no matter the opportunity given. "
"To answer your question without adding all the reassurances, yes, it is shallow.  But you knew that ;-)   Just like I know I'm shallow for not being attracted to a handsome man once he takes off his ball cap and I see he's bald.  "
People on Reddit are not an accurate representation of actual humans in the real world.

"First I glance over the pic to take it in quickly, to see if she's my type. This takes a split-second. If she's not my type, I won't be looking for more than a second before closing the pic. In this case, she definitly is my type (boobs could've been a bit smaller, but that's nit-picking).  

I tend to look at the face first. So I enlarge the pic to have a better look up close. I see a very attractive face, beautiful eyes, great hair. At this point I'm already getting a hard on from looking at her naked body. Then I scroll down to better look at her breasts, stomach, legs and pussy as I get harder. I marvel at the sheer perfection of her body, how flawless it is, how sexy she is. I look at her pussy and notice that normally, I don't pay that much attention to them in pictures, but this one does look great. Then I think I'd like to fuck her.

We got to texting, swapped pictures, and met at the local pizza joint a couple days later. She was wearing a top that didn't leave much to the imagination.

We went back to her place and played... I honestly can't remember what it was called. It was a Mario game but in the format of a board game with mini games within. Halfway through I noticed her pants were gone, she was just in panties and the top. ""Damn, this girl's comfortable around me"" was my only thought.

A little later, she told me how she likes to post herself on /r/gonewild under a secret account. Again, the only thought in my head is ""she's trusting me with such secrets, Zoidberg has a friend.""

I asked her what her username was ""for science"". Of course she says ""I don't think you need it"" or something so the topic drops. I forget the specifics but I ended up leaving shortly after.

Looking back four years later, she obviously wanted to have sex with me. I still kick myself not because she was attractive and I missed out on such a chance, but because I don't understand how I could have been that dense. We never did speak again."

"I'm a big believer that you should really talk everything out ahead of time. Sure, it takes some of the spontaneity out of it, but it means a) you're going to get a lot closer to what the other person wants and b) there's less problems with one or both people feeling bad about it after.

And he's going to want to do a lot of gay-centric things, making up for lost time. The fact that he wants to share that part of himself with you is an equal reflection of your value to him as it is his being excited to show you this world - and doesn't mean you have to be front row in the Cher concert.

"First date with a girl from okcupid.  I suggest a coffee shop at one of those outdoor mall type places, figure we can walk around and chat.  Something fishy before the date though, she sent a message about how glad she was ""I was taking the lead"" (really? just coffee) then she sent a message the morning of asking for my #.  I messaged back I don't give my # out to people I haven't met yet but if something comes up she can message me through the app.

15 minutes before the date I get a message from her suggesting we go to a bar at the same mall because it's going to be less crowded...  Kinda odd, figure I'll go the coffee shop first and message her if it's not crowded to come over or if it is just a couple minute walk to the bar.

Anyway, I go to the coffee shop, it's not crowded of course but I do see a girl I was good friends with in college and haven't seen in a few years. She was there with a couple of her friends, one I knew and a girl I didn't.  We start catching up and I'm sorta thinking her one friend is really hot, maybe reconnecting with my old friend might open some doors.  The problem is her friend is just rolling her eyes since she's not really in our conversation (catching up on a bunch of stuff like a couple chatty cathy's).

15 minutes in the hot friend who's rolling her eyes at me gets this goofy grin and leans forward and says ""that girl in line is giving you the death stare"".  Yeah, I completely forgot about my date! I didn't even tell them I was there for a date so they didn't know so I say ""hmm, I'm going to try and get her number"".  So I get up and my old friend is like ""wait, let me give you mine incase you don't come back.""  So I hand her my phone in full view of the girl I was supposed to date who's looking at me chatting up a table with three girls.

I walk over to the girl I was meeting and introduce myself, she says ""what was that all about?"".  I played it off like I didn't get her message and assumed she flaked but she wasn't buying it.  I got an earfull about how I don't know how to treat women properly blah blah blah and I told her I didn't appreciate her attempt to change plans at the last minute (admitting I did see her message), she called me a piece of shit in front of everyone loudly and stormed out, everyone in the place thinks I'm a jerk.

Not awful but I definitely could have played it much better then I did."
"Crunched and swallowed the glass though, that surely makes up for it?"
"Agreed. As a woman, it doesn't really sound like what you did was that terrible, especially since you guys communicated about it and she said she was ""uncomfortable"" not ""deathly afraid you kidnapped her"". Every person is different, of course, but no point in giving up just yet?"

"You know you're not attractive because you're basically invisible. Pretty girls forget you talked to them. Average girls don't talk to you too long in a public setting. People are disinterested in you and your hobbies are considered lame. You don't get text messages from girls that contain way too many emojis. You have never received a nude picture from a girl on your phone, unprompted. You're afraid of tinder. You don't get invited out to the night parties, only to stuff happening during the day. 

There is an easy way to fix this. Start eating right, and working out. No matter how ugly you are, if you take care of your body, and can carve out a life for yourself that doesn't suck, there will be plenty of women interested in jumping onboard. But if you literally offer nothing and are expecting some girl to see past the fat, grease, and terrible attitude, in order to transform you into her dream man, you will be forever lonely. "

But I only notice it because I'm looking for it. "
"Low effort responses and not doing anything or very little to advance the convo on her part. If she tells me she's not into me. Always talking about other dudes.

"I had one job that I said ""Fuck it"" and walked out of.  

I was working at a residential home for violent, mentally retarded, sex offenders between the ages of 13 and 22.  

My normal schedule was 10:30pm to 9am, Friday to Monday.  

About six months before I quit the company had a ton of lay offs.  That meant a lot of mandatory overtime.  

My schedule became:

Friday 10:30pm-9am

Saturday 10:30pm to 9am

Sunday 10:30pm to 4:30pm

Monday 10:30pm to 4:30pm.  

So I would basically work a 16 hour shift, get out of work at 4:30pm, get to my house at 5:30pm, then leave for another 16 hour shift four hours later at 9:00pm.

This was a job where you had to be constantly alert.  

Turn your back on two kids and they'll start sucking each others dicks (it happened).  If that occurs on your watch your fire and the company will bring charges against you for child endangerment to cover their ass.  

Not to mention these were violent kids so there were daily restraints.

"Even if it's just a cheap shitty toolbag from Walmart, it's way better than nothing. Every time I go over to my friend's house I end up fixing something. Her sink was broken for 2 whole weeks. I came over to hang out. She asked if I would take a look at it.

I walk over, open up the cabinet underneath the sink and the flexible tube that leads to the faucet was twisted and kinked up. It took me 30 seconds to untangle it and fix her faucet. There were 4 girls living there, 2 of them had boyfriends that came over regularly. I think I need smarter friends."

"Ok, last one that I thought of while trying to fall asleep.  I didn't realize I had so many of these, I guess I'm just trying to gauge your reactions to see what you all think.

There was this girl in high school that I met freshmen year.  She was in my bio class and was just the sweetest girl, I was new to that school and she really went out of her way to make me feel like I wasn't alone.  I always looked forward to that class, not because of the work because I sucked at honors bio, but because she was there.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I had a crush on her then.  I'd also be leaving out the part about how she was one of the prettiest girls in school - to the point where my friends would make fun of me for having a crush on her (something about leagues).  It was odd, and I doubt it had anything to do with me, but she rarely dated.

Well sophomore and jr year roll by and I didn't get to see her much, our classes never lined up and I hadn't made an effort to stay in contact.  She'd always smile and wave at me in the halls though when we'd pass, which was rare.  Anyway, senior year rolls around and we're in class together and our assigned seats are right next to each other's - her's behind mine.  

Well, we started to reconnect and the end of second semester is a few weeks away.  I'm always making dumb jokes and she's always laughing and slapping me playfully on the shoulder/back or whacking me with pencils when I say something really giggly dumb.  We're discussing one day in class slave ships.  The teacher said something about whips and chains.  She leans in behind me and says in a low voice, ""I'd like to take you back to my place and hit you with whips and chains"".  Ok, so I'm not entirely sure what she meant by that, but I turned around with a slight smile and said, ""I never thought I'd be for slavery..."" Honestly, I wouldn't believe this one if I were telling me.  It sounds like something out of a Pitbul song, yet it happened to me before he was a thing.  I never gave her my number, but I did sit next to her at graduation (again assigned seats, similar last names) and she mentioned staying in touch!  But I got off stage and forgot to give her my number, haven't seen her in years now."

"I've seen firsthand how women behave and handle themselves around an attractive man. I used to hang out with a gym buddy of mine 1-2 years ago and I have to say he's rather attractive, and had the swagger to go with it. Girls would constantly approach him to talk with him in between sets, constant booty calls when we were out for dinner (his phone is ringing every 10 mins and more often than not it's a girl), the way they'd talk with him even if they met him for the first time would be completely different like they felt weak in the knees and somewhat threatened and was falling for him.

I haven't experienced that myself + never been told attractive besides my mum. Mum's always lie when it's about their kid so that doesn't count."

On average, I'd only need 15-25% of the estimated time for a project. The fringe cases are those that I have to build from the ground up, and even then I'd still be way under the estimated time (like 60-70% used). My work really threw off our metrics for that year since it showed that the our forecast of estimates were wrong and needed adjustment. It came to the point where my team lead and his supervisor at the time asked me to slow it down. That's where my procrastination habits kicked in. I'd spend half the day on reddit and the rest working.

Now I do about 20% work, the rest is shared between hearthstone and reddit."

"That's not healthy. Believe it or not there are ""healthy"" ways to have an argument with your SO. There's at least one book written about it. Can't recall the name, a marriage counselor gave it to me years ago.

I've been bad about having to always ""win"" an argument and not fighting ""fair"" to the detriment of my relationships. It's something I'm still working on.  

Maybe dig a little for some reading or even go see a marriage counselor together.

"I can turn literally any conversation topic towards my band. It helps tremendously when I'm in a spot to pitch people in the industry when I meet them, but in casual conversation it can definitely be seen as rude because I don't want to talk about myself too much with someone else."

That line makes any man hard as a rock."
"Here's a few that i find less attractive: 

* Talking negatively about their friends behind their backs
* Has the typical 'woo girl' / party attitude/lifestyle. Excessive partying is not exactly a sign of maturity 
* Acting superior to people in the service business (waiters, cashiers) 
* Making way to big a deal out of social media "
"Was once lying with her on the top bunk of a bunk bed. 

I forget the exact conversational flow, but it was something like ""Oh, this bunk bed isn't so high. I bet if I fell out, it wouldn't even hurt, I'm really tough you know.""

And then I deliberately rolled out of the bed and dropped to the ground like a stone. I imagine I looked very impressive just sort of lying there groaning for a minute."

"Not very close at all.  

It took me a long time to notice this, but I have always made entirely more effort to get to know her friends.  Not that I communicate with many of them, when they're not around.  But when I'm with them, I *engage* them.  Find out what they've been up to, what interests them, and what questions they've been wondering about.  You know, shootin' the shit.

My girl is much more the type to politely say hello upon arrival (at a party full of my friends, for example), exchange brief pleasantries, and then *check out*.  Play with her phone, interject a comment she thinks is provocative every half hour or so...I've considered that perhaps she just hasn't clicked with certain particular friends of mine, but she does this no matter which of my friends (and I have plenty) we're spending time with.  After we go home, I've known her to take petty verbal shots at some of my friends.  Maybe one of them was drunk, and said a single thing that she thought was stupid.  Maybe one of them held forth on an extinct foreign language, for longer than the topic sustained her interest.  Things like that.  Her jabs always surprised me, but I haven't been keeping track until recently, when I started to suspect that she Generally Doesn't Like People.

Now that I've noticed this, I find it kind of annoying.  Kind of really annoying."

"I see a lot of hatred of feminism and women's issues on Reddit. In real life, I know nobody who feels that strongly about it. Most guys I know support it, including myself.  

The idea that you can't be friends with someone who's more than a couple of years younger or you can't have a relationship with them is also something I see a lot on Reddit (AskMen more specifically). I have found that to be completely untrue. While people here who are in their mid/late twenties keep harping on about how anyone who is still in college ""looks like a kid to me"" who ""sound so irritating when they open their mouths"", I'm in a very diverse group of friends where our ages range from 20 to 30 now. And we've known each other for years. It's about personalities, not the number of years you've been around.  

I've never seen or heard of the intense levels of fear of pregnancy (or 'preggo paranoia' as I call it) that I've seen on multiple subs (including this one) in real life. Me, I put a condom on, I fuck, I cum inside her, I pull back, take the thing off and I'm done. I don't pull out when I'm cumming while I'm wearing a condom and I'm not rushing to pour water in it to see if there are any holes in it. Some people here have me worried about their mental health."
I forgot to set my clocks for daylight savings time and ended up being an hour late to the restaurant.
"I didn't date in high school.

I college now, and I just learned the hard way that just because you are dating someone, it doesn't mean they actually like you.  I had always thought that when you were dating someone, it meant that was already decided."
"Congrats on your upcoming engagement!  Here are some suggestions based on my experience:

-Don't go heavily into debt to get a ring.  Figure out your budget and STICK TO IT!!!  This will be a good lesson for your entire married life.  $5,500 is significantly more than $4,000.  $4k is totally realistic for a lovely ring.  Don't let yourself get talked into spending more than you can afford...by the jeweler, your fiance, anyone.  That ""spend three months salary"" is just marketing.  Spend what you can afford.

-Costco is one of the best places to get jewelry.  For the value, I feel you can get a much better diamond at Costco than anywhere else.  Their return policy is fantastic, and customer service is great.  Sure, it isn't a luxury store with tufted pillows and mood lighting, but you'll get an amazing deal.  We've bought thousands of dollars worth of jewelry there and now we only buy our jewelry at Costco.  They repaired my diamond watch for free.  I took it in there, they sent it off, and I had it back in a couple weeks working perfectly.  No questions asked, no hassle.  Not even the watch manufacturer could offer that.  I would imagine they might have something similar for diamond rings....just ask.

-GET JEWELRY insurance.  This is mandatory!!!!  Get insurance on the ring as soon as you purchase it.  JewelersMutual.com is a good company.  Is is affordable and covers if it gets lost, the diamond falls out, whatever.  Accidents happen and you don't want to be out thousands of dollars if the unthinkable happens.

-If you don't go the Costco route, I would look into a reputable, high-end local mom and pop jewelry store (typically family-owned).  Look on Yelp, ask friends, etc. for referrals.  I think you get much better service in stores like this compared to chain stores and the owners will likely be around years from now if you want to trade in your diamond for a nicer one at a later date (ask if they have this option).  Also, they'll deal with your cleaning needs, repairs, and any inspections required to keep your insurance valid.  Build a relationship over time and they'll take care of you.

-Don't worry about her needing to be without her ring for weeks at a time every year.  I've had my ring 20+ years and I've never been without it for a few days.  I think that's a scare tactic from your large chain jewelry store.

-If you do separate wedding bands and engagement rings, see if you can get them welded together.  If you don't do it, over time the rubbing together will wear away your gold and make the band super thin.

-Costco is also great for men's wedding bands.  We got a platinum band there for my husband for a great price.

PM me if you have any additional questions.  This is all I can think of for now.  Good luck!!"

"My parents never directly said ""I love you"" to me growing up. They still don't but they have continued to show that they care in other ways. 

As for how this has affected me, I am really unaccustomed to physical displays of affection. It's a struggle sometimes to even verbally express love. The culture I grew up in has certainly left me behind in terms of emotional intelligence. I see the act of expressing emotion as a skill, and it's something I'm certainly always trying to improve."
"One minor thing that took some getting used to was body temperature in bed. My body had 23 years of experience heating the whole bed by itself. As soon as there was another warm body in there with me, I was drenched in sweat and seriously overheating. It took about 2 weeks for my body to finally turn down the thermostat enough to be comfortable snuggled up to someone at night."

"I don't know. 

That was the reason she gave. We dated for almost four years.  She broke up with me on the phone. I asked why and her answer was ""I don't know.""

Ok then. "

Just scream really loud as you dump the water. It'll cover up the sound of the splashing. 
"She hates diamonds, and in our search for rings she decided that she didn't really like the look of gemstones either. I got her a [silver chainmaille ring](http://i.imgur.com/90kIytE.jpg) and she adores it. The only downside is that she has to say ""I don't like gemstones"" whenever she shows it to someone, otherwise people get judgey. "
"Well I haven't been on a real date in 6 years, and the only responses or feedback I get on online dating sites is fat women. Of which I'm not attracted to, and I think you should be attracted to your partner. 

That said, I do take horrendous pictures and can't write about myself to save my life. "
"Because 32 years ago he took my prized water gun and threw it in the street and it broke; he laughed at me when I cried. 

Fuck him. "
"&gt; Who does that?

Guys who care about their relationship with him and respect him enough to be honest. They can see it upsets him and want to do something about that.

You can dance around the fact he is different and politely pretend there is no elephant in the room. But that's not friendship. Its condescension.

I mean, what do you do when you have a problem like this? Give them meaningless platitudes and lie about how attractive they are until they feel better? Fix your relationship problems with bullshit?"
"Where does this exist? Because where I live I'm only aware of ""bars."""
She keeps talking about marriage and its freaking me out. She already knows this though.
"This kind of happened to me when I first moved in with my now wife and her mum. I blocked the toilet with a massive shit and couldn't unblock it with a plunger. My girlfriend's mum got wind of what was happening so she put on some gloves, grabbed the plunger from me and tried to unblock it herself.

She wasn't having much luck so **she takes off the gloves and REALLY gets in there** ... it was a humbling experience, to stand there while my girlfriend's mum is elbows deep in my shit."

Askmen generally has no idea what it is like to live in small towns or rural areas. Reddit is guilty of this in general.
"Can't deal with the pressure of communicating via text. I'm great in person. I have no problems making a girl laugh and keeping her interested when we're face to face. I cannot stand texting, though. Seems to be a common deal breaker for whatever reason."
"The ""internet people"" think you need to be pretty or rich to attract women.  That's usually just sour grapes."
"I'm not even quite sure how to describe it, other than at it's most extreme (/r/theredpill), but the basic gist is that women, as a group, actively look for chances to fuck over men because they can, almost always using sex - either actual or the implication thereof - to do so.  Especially if the guy is ""dumb"" enough to want to get married.

I'm not going to say there are no women like that anywhere, as I'm sure there are.  There are also plenty of men doing the same thing.

But to assume that of the general population, that the average person you meet is looking to use their sexuality to fuck you over?  That's incredibly weirdly sexualized paranoia.  

And it pretty much doesn't happen in the real world.  Oh, sure, it does happen.  Everyone probably knows A Guy who is in a weird marriage or something where both parties can't stand each other and no one can quite figure out why they're still together (other than maybe some bitter grumblings about how ""she'd get everything if we divorced"")... but that's really it.  Out of the hundreds, if not thousands of couples you know, you know one like that.

Odds are still really in your favor that the person you're dating isn't a sociopath looking to steal everything from you and break you just because they can.

Yet if you hang out here.......


I mean, I know it's anecdotal and all that, but of all the marriages I know of that are in trouble, all of them - every single one - I can tell you the cause, and it's always basically the same - the dude doesn't give a shit about the relationship after they're married, yet is suddenly surprised a few years later when the wife doesn't give a shit anymore either.  And can't figure out why."
People always talk about being oblivious to signs women give but...she took her pants off. It doest get much more explicit than that. Sorry bro haha 
"One?  I've got four.

1: Consistently make jokes about her making you sandwiches.

2:Frequently remind her how pretty and successful her sister is.

3: Before leaving on a date, never forget to turn to her and ask, ""You're wearing that?""

4: And most importantly, only refer to her as ""Your chick"" when talking to other people.  Especially when she's listening.  It lets her know that you respect her.
"
Well she would already be humiliated just by having sex with me.
"Problem being... the type that insists not to wear a condom generally doesn't like 'that's not okay with me' as an answer. Makes it his mission to *convince* her it's okay.

And that's *not* okay."

"My husband and I started dating freshman year of high school.  We have been together for 9 years now,  married for almost two.  And honestly?  The sex just gets better and better.  It's like over the years he spends more time learning my body,  paying more attention to what I liked,  and always trying something new.  We are very giving to each other,  and always willing to try some thing new for each other.  I believe the biggest problem people run into when their relationships go for longer is that they get stuck in routine.  They don't make an effort to experiment or read about something new.  So then everything becomes boring,  and when it becomes boring you become disinterested,  and when that happens suddenly you are feeling neglected,  resentful,  maybe even thinking about other people.  A healthy sex life is one of the most important things in a relationship.  Making love,  not just banging each other,  is what keeps a marriage or long term relationship going.  

I also forgot to mention that we spent a lot of time slowly building up our emotional and mental connection.  We started taking the time to really pick each other's brains,  to try and be more empathetic to each other.  My relationship with my husband has become more than I coukd have ever hoped for.  In him  I truly do have a best friend,  a lover,  and even an enemy when I'm being dumb.  I've never had such an open and honest relationship with another human being.  He's truly the best thing to have ever happened to me.  "
