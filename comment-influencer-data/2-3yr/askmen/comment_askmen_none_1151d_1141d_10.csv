"It's not the same as calling a girl fat - it's worse. Your weight is within your control and can correlate to health. Your height is completely outside of your control. It also has no correlation with penis size either. It's pretty shitty that short guys can be treated like this, and I think it's awesome you stuck up for him. This is coming from a guy who's 6'3"", too.

"Looks aren't everything. If that's the case, then only attractive people date. This means a lot of ""forever alone"" types have shit personalities.  "
"Hit the gym and download tinder. You probably gained some relationship weight during your time with her. Also spend plenty of time with freinds and remember how much fun single life can be. 


Also don't fall for those crocodile tears. She didn't just fall on his dick. She chose to talk to a guy she was attracted to, chose to not turn him down, chose to accept his flirtation and flirt back, chose to make out with him and finally fuck him. She had ample opportunity to turn him down but she cared so little about you and the relationship that she'd easily fuck a stranger. 

She's just trying to do damage control right now, there was no ""mistake"". A mistake is me forgetting to turn the oven off. "

"Society is pretty cruel to short men.  Its not even that great for average height men.  Girls won't date them, they make less money.  

But short guys do live longer, so they have that going for them. "
"Or, like an overweight friend of mine, they refuse to date within their zone. If you are a 3 you have to be willing to date other 3's or be alone. That's just the name of the game, attractive women don't want to date your ugly fat ass any more than you want to date an ugly fatass."
Can't wait for my nice long poor single life.
"Most men are taller than most women.

Height (and size in general) in humans is a clear example of [sexual dimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism).


Height is a masculine attribute.


Those lacking height may be perceived as less masculine. 


Lack of masculine traits in men and lack of feminine traits in women are usually viewed negatively. 


It's very unfair but that's just the way it currently is. "
"That if you ever have any problem in your relationship with a woman, you should immediately break up with her and that she's definitely already cheating on you."
"That your lack of dating success is a direct result of the efforts you yourself are putting in.  If you put the work in, you will get results.  

But, it's easier for a bunch of us to live in fear and acceptance of your lot, or blame players and others for your lack of success.  It's easier - and we're conditioned by society and virtue signalling - to play the victim.  Because, if nothing's ever your fault, you can't ever be held accountable for your failings, and don't ever have to feel any of that icky discomfort that comes from failure.  All your bad luck becomes just a shitty roll of the dice, or it's the colour of your skin, or your height, or 'the system' or your mental illness, or your upbringing.  ""I'm fine, it's *other people* that need to change.""

But I'll share a secret with you: we are nothing more than hairless monkeys living and fucking on an uncontrollable, open-topped, convertible spaceship, hurtling through the cosmos at ~~1000~~ 67 THOUSAND miles an hour.  And yet *some*how we have managed to invent - on the one hand - silly putty and - on the other - napalm.  And nothing we have *ever* done of value has been easy.  As a species, we thrive in suffering and adversity.  We humans *need* to go through pain to achieve anything of value.  We need to fail at stuff, and experience and overcome those failures in order to succeed.  The mark of great men is not in how many times they've succeeded, but how many times they've failed and tried again.  

It's a known, provable, fact that consistent repeated effort + time = results.  But everybody's got that voice in their heads going, ""What if I do this, put in the effort and it *still* doesn't work out?""  That won't happen.  You may never be a *pro* at it, but you will be *better than you were.*

"College roommate cheated on his GF.  Didn't deny it.  His GF not only put up with it and continued to do his laundry for him, but even did the laundry of the girl he was cheating on her with."

Follow-up question: Why the fuck did you tell her?
"You'll fuck it up, but that's okay. Don't seem like you are trying to hard."
"I agree with this when it comes to sexual attraction. I wouldn't challenge a woman on not being sexually attracted to short men. But when it comes to insulting them, being offended by their presence, etc., that's a different story. There's no justifiable reason for that."
Gay because you don't drink? What the fuck kinda of backward ass people are you hanging around?
No porn. Jerk it once a week. Lose weight if you're fat. Cardio. 
"I don't understand why this is not being discussed more. Not only between men but women as well. I feel like with social media and everything, people are in denial about how attractive they are and try to date beyond where they should. I have a couple friends who will only go for women who would be considered universally attractive but those women would never go for them cause they look like Baby Huey. People need to realize who they can actually get. Real life isn't a God Damn Seth Rogan film."
"Settle into a new single guy routine until you're ready for another relationship.   

Take this relationship and its demise as a life lesson, but don't carry trust issues into a new relationship and make a new woman pay for your exes mistake. "
That Reddit is so filled with bad advice regarding women I sometimes wonder if it's a gender-flipped version of Cosmo.
"As a younger guy, I remember the various reactions parents of friends/partners have had when I have been introduced to them.

Overwhelmingly, the more positive relationships I have had with girls have also involved parents who didn't ""evaluate"" me. They trusted that their daughter could make her own decisions and learn from them. 

Perhaps it is coincidence that these same girls tended to be better partners, more trusting and more able to make rational decisions that impacted not only their life, but now mine. But it's probably more likely that being allowed to grow and mature at their own pace made them the people they are today.

If you are a parent, I would advise that you ""trust but verify"" your children's decisions. You don't need to like the guy, you don't need to approve of them - you just need to let your children make their own mistakes (within reason!), and be there to help them should anything go wrong.

As someone who has been on the receiving end of evaluations, it never feels positive, and it always feels like the parents don't trust their own children, which can manifest in other ways too."
"Probably the type that believes here achievements, income and/or intelligence intimidate men and thats why they don't approach her. 'Im a strong independent woman types'. They tend to go out, not get approached then try and decry it as them intimidating men. When usually they're either unattractive, or they're just a bit of a cunt."
"It hasn't changed my views towards women. 

It has, however, changed my perception of how girls and women are treated, portrayed in the media, marketed to, and talked about on the internet.

First two were boys.  Gender never really comes up, beyond ""wow, two boys, you have your hands full"" which is of course true of all children, but I'll give you a pass on that.

Girl is born a few years later.  Literally the first thing out of the mouths of the nurses were ""she has brothers?  SHE'S GOING TO HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME DATING"" and ""Wow, what a cutie!  You're going to be fighting boys off with a stick!""

Basically the conversation turns to how the men around her are going to be managing her sex life within minutes of birth.   And it doesn't really ever stop.  Society always assumes you're going to put her in some kind of bubble and generally treat her with kid gloves because she's a precious little angel who can't take care of herself.  

Seeing that, you understand the baggage women are forced to carry around. It's not one big thing women are saddled with.  It's a million things that—taken individually—seem frivolously insignificant, but which when added up, reveal something pretty disturbing.

I think part of the ""protectiveness"" fathers feel towards daughters is an instinctual understanding of the weird position they're in.  It's like, BAM, all of a sudden you're confronting how fucked up the world is.  Though personally, I'm less worried about protecting her from men than from protecting her from having her soul crushed by how the world works."
"""Men don't want to date an *amazing* girl like me because they'd rather have a hot, skinny airhead who puts out.""

It fulfills the main criteria of being a Nice Guy™: blaming the entire opposite gender for daring to not find you irresistible while at the same time being a catty, self-unaware whiner."

"The thing that helped me get it was when a friend was like, ""You know how irritating it is when you're trying to walk by those sellers at the mall kiosks? It's like that just in regular life."" That totally makes sense to me. It feels uncomfortable to try to ignore them outright, but if you try to be polite, they will see that as an opening and waste more of your time."
I don't know if anything is a complete dealbreaker. I think there's usually room to discuss any problems. I guess refusing to discuss problems would be a dealbreaker

"My daughter is three now, but from the moment my wife and I found out it was a girl, people started in on the ""gotta watch out for those boys"" comments.

A little background, I was an infantry Marine and did two tours in the shithole that is Iraq. Since then I've become an attorney. 

Fast forward to being the father of a little girl:

""You should tell her boyfriends you were a Marine and scare the shit out of them!""

No, I don't plan on terrorizing an adolescent child who finds my daughter attractive.

""You should tell her boyfriends that you're an attorney who knows how to get away with murder!""

No, I don't think suggesting to an adolescent child that, as an attorney, I can willfully break the law without consequences, is a good idea. By the way, it's also wildly unethical.

""What are you gonna do when a boy comes around.""

I don't know, shake his hand and introduce myself? You know, like a human?

I just don't get why people think I need to play the bogeyman when my daughter starts dating. If I need to do that, then I've been a shit parent.

"At the end of year 11, the candidates for next year's school captains all gave speeches about why you should vote for them. Pretty much it's always the best looking/most popular guy and girl in the year level who get chosen, but anyone can put themselves in contention.

All the speeches were lame and predictable, but one sticks out in memory. It was this acquaintance of mine, he started  his speech like the others but halfway through he tore his speech in half and said ""No guys, this inst the real me"". He then goes on a Aragorn-at-the-black-gate-esque speech about making real change at the school and leaving legacy and benchmark that would be followed for years to come, and then he kicked down the podium/stand thing and yelled ""WHO'S WITH ME!"" and held his fist in the air.

It was just so obviously staged that all 350 people in attendance simultaneously cringed and stared in silence and disbelief at what we had witnessed. "

"TBH it's harder than most people think. At one point I had 50 or 60 women (mostly princesses, but also maidens offered by surrounding villages) and storage becomes an issue. I ended up keeping most of them in one big cage that I wove out of trees. I spent WEEKS making that, and when I was done I thought, ""Am I one of those people who do crafts now? Should I have a Pinterest account?""

Then there's the steady stream of knights and trickster-heroes coming to ""rescue"" your women. Somehow they always find a way in, and besides taking your women away they wreck everything, steal your gold, and leave droppings everywhere. On top of that, unless you're willing to make the investment and hide your soul away in an egg, you're basically accepting that one of them is going to kill you sooner or later.

I guess what I'm saying is that all these women aren't just something you get for free for being 60'. It's a lifestyle, and you've got to commit to it.

"Getting a haircut send the guy next to me was hitting on his hairdresser so hard. The woman cutting my hair kept exchanging glances with me and the other hairdresser and holding back the giggles.

He's going ""Oh what is that product? it smells amazing""
She says it's just water
He comes back with ""Oh it must be you that smells nice""

And ""Your hands are so soft"" x3

I nearly died holding back the laughs.

Then there was an awakward moment where he dropped a $50 tip on a $30 haircut. While it was going through the card machine the guy asks her out to lunch. She says she's already had lunch. 

He just goes oh okay then and walks out.

5 minutes later the hairdresser announces she's going for lunch."
"5'6"" Male here. When I was single I'd get this treatment often. Even if the girl was 5'2"". Like it was a joke that I'd even try. I'm not sure what the deal is. Guys with shorter height may be viewed as less manly or something. Honestly I just try and forget about those people. My current GF is 5'9"". So it really doesn't matter. Just initially everyone judges.  

Also I feel like there is a perceived saltiness about being short. I have to be extra chill, and cheeky and roll with the punches. I'm not allowed to be angry. The second I am, someone with more insecurities than myself, projects a view on to me that I am clearly only angry because I am short. Like I should expect less and be angry for different things because I am short. Maybe someone is just being an asshole to me irrelevant of my  height?

Once, one of my best friends girlfriend got super drunk (we were all partying). We were once talking about how I picked up a chick at a bar and also how the girl I was dating was super hot. Something about that just made her snap. In her drunken state she just laid into me. ""I don't fucking get it. How do you even get chicks? You must have a big dick or something... You're short. You're poor. It must be a big dick. None of it makes any sense!"" At the time and even now looking back I thought it was hilarious, but my friends at the time reacted like ""Wow what the fuck?"" They were shocked it didn't bother me as much.  I told them I can't let that shit bother me. Plus I casually never denied having a big penis. haha. 

You should reconsider your choice in friends however. That is no different than being racist. People are born the way they are. That is highly ignorant and shallow. There's nothing wrong with preferring someone Taller. You can't help who you like. However treating someone as a joke is not okay. I can imagine it now. 

Be you.

Confront your friend about their shitty attitude.

Get in big argument about it.

Argument puts a distance in friendship.

Goes on for months until you slowly realize you can't stand anything about her.

More arguments happen.

You quit being friends.

Be her now.

She thinks to herself. ""This wouldnt have ever happened if it wasn't for that short guy.""

Blames short people. 

Continues a worse cycle of hate."
"I'm going to suggest an adult tactic.

Some people just haven't learned to relationship, yet.  Part of life and part of adulting is learning to to set and enforce boundaries *and* how to respect boundaries.

She's crazy about you, is high touch and probably has a hard time controlling herself. You're pushing her away and that makes her a) feel unwanted b) try harder.

So, be gentle (not confrontational or judgmental) and nicely short kiss, short hug and then remind her you need a little me time right now.  If you push way hard, tell her she's being obnoxious or bark at her, she's going to be pretty hurt.  So, it's not all on her to pull back, it's on you to push back gently and with compassion."

"Dispassionate. Like this trend of seeing how much you can give no fucks is the most unattractive thing I've seen. Great, you don't care about the world around you or anyone else. Cya.

"Please do not do this to a woman. My ex husband was never really sexually attracted to me (even though he acknowledges I'm attractive and loves my personality). For years I struggled with the lack of sex and intimacy. He finally admitted to me his lack of attraction and how he will never get it back and it was crushing. I spent years trying everything I could to get him to see me in a more sexual way. 

Even though I'm in the dating world now and get plenty of attention, I have this irrational insecurity that a man can't truly find me attractive. Someone says something complimentary to me and the voice in my head tells me it can't be possible. It's going to take some time and mental work on myself to get this out of my head. Don't do this to someone - it most likely won't change.

"Got married in college because my gf got pregnant.  Started a job I didn't want because the economy was horrible at the time - 2008. 

Around the time she told me she was pregnant I was thinking about ending things with her finally.  We were together at the time for about 2 years or so and have ""broken up"" a couple times through then.  I knew I didn't want to be with her but when she said she was pregnant I just felt like I had to man up and do the ""right thing.""  Had another kid 3 years later.  

The relationship was very taxing.  I wasn't happy but felt I would've failed if I left, so I stayed.  

I eventually grew to resent her.  I didn't feel like she supported me in the things I wanted to do.  I hated my job (retail management) and wanted to take a risk and start somewhere new. Had a couple opportunities that would have made things tight for us, but would've paid off after a year or so... but she kept talking me out of it. Not really sure of what the reason was since it was a while ago but she just kept telling me what was or was not ""best for the family.""

Resentment also grew from her constant resistance to me wanting to see my friends (away from her and my kids) for an evening here and there.  Really wanted a weekend away with my guy friends and brother but I knew that wasn't going to happen.  But every time an opportunity came up I got a sob story about how she never gets out.  To which I respond ""ok, so pick some weekends where you want some time"" and she'll just saw something along the lines of ""its not that easy, im a good mother and i WANT to be around my kids.""  I fell for it.  Over time I realized she didn't really have any friends, and after a few years of complacency I was losing mine.  

But I did nothing.

The resentment grew into neglect.  I wasn't happy.  I despised my job.  I despised my wife.  I despised myself.  I didn't know who I was anymore.  I had my kids and they were the only thing that kept me going.

Because of the neglect she turned to religion.  Neither of us were religious when dating.  Neither of us were religious after getting married.  We talked about religion and knew that we had no plans of making it an active part of our lives.  However, that's where she turned to.  I, however, did not follow and because of that, she began to resent me.

At church she sought counselling and friends... which was great. She went more and more to all sorts of services at church.  Sometimes with the kids, sometimes not.  Rarely with me.  I'd go to the dinners and events, but I couldn't do the services.

At church she started confiding in a mutual friend of ours (my close friend from college) who has a kid too and was recently divorced.  I was aware of this time they spent together and was aware that she asked about relationship stuff with him.  I expressed concern with this and said I wasn't comfortable with it and eventually I stopped hearing about it.  

Unfortunately they didn't stop spending time with each other.  After months of suspicion I found out she was cheating on me.  Soon after that I was served with divorce papers and it was finalized a month and a half later.  I had her change a few things in the paperwork, but I just signed it and didn't fight it.  I didn't have fight in me at the time.

It hit me hard. I felt like I failed my children.  I won't get into the details but basically a couple months of heavy drinking and depression hit and I almost lost my job.  I turned into a sad pathetic person and was becoming a horrible father.  So I stopped everything I was doing and did a 180.  Got into the best shape of my life.  Started dating again.  Stopped getting drunk (except the occasional party).  Started standing up for myself.

The result... I met a better girl who encouraged me rather than held me back.  I have a different and better career.  I found hobbies that are truly passions of mine now.  I have my friends back, plus gained more. Depression doesn't affect my parenting.  I realized that I can, and should, take care of my own happiness while still doing all the things I need to do in life.  And in fact, that being a happier person, that I'm actually better at all the other things in life.

Basically, my divorce was the worst and best thing that has ever happened to me... and I'm glad she cheated on me.  I wouldn't have let go unless it was something big like that.


Sorry, that wasn't supposed to be a book, but that's my story.

TLDR; gf got prego in college, i started job i hated, lost friends, resentment grew (over things) then neglect, she cheated on me, got divorced, depression hit, decided to change my life, now all is well and would not change anything."
"I've dated a couple of girls/women who have had previous 'incidents' happen to them, one of which her story became a big piece of news in UK due to the way she was treated by the police, and she successfully sued them.

All I can say to you is go at her pace, keep communicative and allow her to speak about it a lot. This in itself is amazing therapy. 

I'm not saying you are going to be, but this is a heads up. Don't be an asshole. It is possible that how you treat her will impact her view of men for the rest of her life (I realise that will already have changed), if it's a bad experience for her she probably will have issues for the rest of her life. It's a big responsibility, and be prepared for her to change her mind at any time without notice. You have to respect that. Just be there for her and take it slow, and be her friend. At the same time you don't want her to feel like she is too precious or 'broken', so don't go the other way and not touch her. It's a fine line and you are best going by your instincts. Just try to understand and listen and things will work themselves out."
"&gt; I'm gonna try my hardest to get her to like me

No, don't do that.  Absolutely do NOT do that.  Just treat her like a normal person, because she is.  When people say ""be yourself"" they *mean* it.  Don't pretend to be somebody you're not just to try to get her to like you.  Women can sniff that out and it's an instant turn off.  It comes off as desperate in addition to being fake.

If she asks you what type of things you like, and you happen to like dorky things, who cares... say it with confidence and don't apologize for it.  If you ask what type of music she likes and it's all crap, don't just agree with her or say you love it, too.  Express yourself.  Be polite in any disagreements, but don't suck up to her.  Don't try to be the perfect match.  Just be YOU.

You're going to overthink this date, I guarantee it.  But that's okay.  As you said, you will live and learn.  What you need to try really hard to do on this date is see if she is the right person *for you*.  You haven't spoken to her for more than 5 minutes and you're already putting her on a pedestal.  Stop trying to get *her* to like *you* and try to find out if *you* actually like *her*.

As for the date itself, I have the following pieces of advice:

* Don't do dinner and a movie.  Dinner is extremely formal for a first date, especially at your age.  And a movie is a place to go and sit in the dark not talking for 2 hours... horrible for a first date.
* Since you met playing Pokemon Go, how about you guys go out hunting Pokemon together?  Suggest that you meet at a public park and walk around town for a bit hunting some Pokemon.  Then when you get tired, suggest you stop for a quick bite to eat and maybe some ice cream.
* Ask her questions.  TONS of questions.  As many as you can think of.  If her answer reminds you of a cool story you remember, wait for her to finish talking and then tell your story.  Then ask her MORE questions.
* Try to speak slowly.  I am a socially anxious person, as well, and when I'm nervous I start to talk very quickly and very much.  Before the date starts, take a deep breath and remember to take everything very slowly, especially conversation.
* After a few hours, be the one who leaves.  Say you had a great time but you need to be getting back.  Say that you would love to see her again.  Hug her and go.

Remember, she is not some sort of prize where you need to do/say the right things in order to win her affection.  Just be yourself and see if you guys click."
"The part where you said his behavior may impact her view on men for the rest of her life is very true. I was abused by various men since I was 8 years old. When I started dating, there was not one man who respected my boundaries. I was strangled unconscious and raped several times and he did that without remorse. The ""nice guys"" I dated still constantly pressured me for sex even when I was in pain and I did it while crying, but they didn't stop. Ever. Once I asked if I could put a pillow over my head bc I was crying and wanted to muffle it for him and he agreed.

One day, I started dating a guy and while we were having sex, he asked if I was hurting. I said ""a little, but it's okay."" And he immediately stopped! Literally, he pulled out and we cuddled. We had only been dating for 3 weeks and he showed me more kindness than any man I had been in a serious relationship with. Then I realized, what he did was not kindness... It was just the normal thing to do. Now, I know that most men don't constantly push women for sex and they actually care if their partner is in pain. It ended up not working out with him, but I still think about him and that single moment. "

"I was just reading a forever alone thread about standing close to women on the train and feeling them brush against you and reminding you what human contact feels like and how important that is.

This just sounds insane to me. You don't need to be at all attractive to get hugs from girls. You just need to not have a repulsive, creepy as hell personality. Like, the kind of personality where you intentionally stand close to girls on trains so that they might brush against you. "

"When you ask if a guy is attractive, keep in mind 90% of guys who call themselves attractive aren't really that attractive, they just have a decent face and aren't fat. Their experience will differ completely from a guy with a body like the statue of David. The major difference I've noticed from personal experience pre-fitness and post-fitness, as well as talking to other guys who are actually in shape, is that women send signals much more clearly when you're in shape. They will either smile at you a lot, make excuses to talk to you, or flat out hit on you. Whereas as a normal 'attractive' guy without an impressive physique, you can get girls but you have to do the work."

"A guy tried to steal my girlfriend's purse but she had it wrapped around her arm in a weird way so he pulled her off balance and into a wall, then he kept tugging it but the way she had it wrapped it wouldn't come off of her arm so she was just screaming ""ouch that hurts stop"" so I grabbed the guy's head and rammed it into the wall a few times until he dropped. Police were across the walkway on a higher floor and saw it and got to me a few seconds after the guy dropped and I was still trying to figure out if I should give him a few kicks or just walk off. 

They called an ambulance for the guy and told me I'd be OK and they'd write their report saying I hurt the guy because I feared bodily harm for someone else. 

Edit: forgot to include her reaction. She was pretty turned on and said she liked that I was strong and could protect her. She later came up with some role play stuff that involved me saving her from something and then having sex with her, so I guess overall it was a positive thing  "

He held me. We napped and eventually finished what we started. Be understanding. I have moved twice since the incident. My boyfriend and I bought a house a few months ago and there is no way the attacker could know where I live, however I still ask my boyfriend to check the basement for him when I am having a really high anxiety day. This doesn't happen often but when it does he just smiles, kisses my head and goes in the basement. I don't know if he actually checks or if he just stands there, but he makes the effort and it makes me feel better. If you have any more specific questions, you can message me. "

"Tl:dr Sex is weird and so is language.

This may be an anglophone phenomena. There is no meme of the usage of ""daddy"" in my language and it would sound weird. We dont have a ""kiddy"" version of dad. Its just, dad or father. Both of whom are,i feel, too personal and honorific. Whereas i feel that ""daddy"" is a play on dependence. It's what kids call their father, when they grow up they stop it and start calling them dad or, if you are destined for a lifetime of polo shirts, Father. Daddy is childish and its from that root that it gains its power. 

An adult or teenager using it, no matter the gender, means a reversal of maturity and a surrender of responsibility. That's why a sugar daddy is not a sugar father. A sugar daddy is someone taking care of and providing for someone, A sugar father is... a stately man in a suit covered in sugar? i don't know, my point is the imagery doesn't work with ""Father."" Daddy however, works. The word entails so much, the inexperience and innocence of the person saying it, the ownership of the ""daddy"" over the speaker, and the subtle nuance of the daddy taking the place of the father as a powerful male persona in the speakers mind. 

The underlying cause is of course the fact that sex is weird. Sex, for many, is about power. When you're a top you are in power, when you're a bottom you're giving power away. The word daddy and its association works both ways. The top becomes a symbol of power to the bottom, who is someone to take care of and own to the top. 

Change the word daddy for dad or father and we are creeped out. But daddy somehow has enough playfulness and power mechanic that it works. 

Not for me though, i have sex in my native language."
"Credit unions. Seriously, just switch. They beat ANY auto loan by 2% and I pay $5/yr to be a member. They know me by name and last week I went in and withdrew money without ID or wallet. They know me by name. No service charges, for anything.

A dog. Get one if you don't already. Go rescue one. Let it pick you. They will be forever grateful and you'll have a best friend like you've never had before. 

EDIT - for all those saying they can't keep a dog Bc they work 8+ hours or live in the city/apartment... Even though it may not be an ideal situation, it's better than the alternative for the dog - being euthanized or being caged 24 hrs a day at no kills. I'm sure my dog hates being locked up inside a house for 10 hrs some days, but he sure does love being alive, his $40/bag dog food, walks, weekend camping trips, road trips, dates with other chicks and their dogs, having a best friend and a warm king size mattress to sleep on.

"I was at a McDonalds or some other fast food place one time and it was really busy.  There was this one really good looking girl working behind the counter taking orders and speaking on a headset to the back at the same time, just swamped.  

This guy came in, from the context I saw I assume he had met her once or twice before.  So he pushes his way toward the counter and is trying to make conversation with this girl.  I don't remember what what said but the gist was like:  

""Hey, it's been a while how have you been?""  
""Fine.  That was a Big Mac and a large fry Sir?""  
""Did you go to so and so's party last night?  I only heard about it today.""  
*Ignores him, keeps taking orders and relaying them.*  
""Hey ""Girls name!""  Hey!""  

She was clearly too busy to chat and didn't seem interested in talking to him anyways, but he just kept going on like that for like another full minute while interrupting the ordering process.  Finally he suggests they get together and asks when she gets off work.  
She finally stopped and turned to him directly for the first time and said something like ""Never, I live here.""  before going back to working the til.  

It was pretty fucking obvious that she was telling him off, the way she said it was cold but he didn't get it.  The ""cringe"" in the room was strong, I was literally embarrassed on this guy's behalf. He thought it was a joke and kinda laughed and kept pressing it.  Interrupting people and being a general clueless idiot.  Waving at her trying to get her attention and saying her name over and over while she ignored him and continued to take orders.  

He was relentless though.  So the girl finally used her headset to call somebody from in back, a manager or something I guess and the guy was asked to leave the girl alone and leave the property.  

He finally seemed to get the hint and became really embarrassed and kind of did the slow walk of shame out of the door while not looking at anybody.  

*At which point the whole place exploded with applause.  An old sassy black woman told the cashier, ""You go girlfriend!""  and handed her a $100 tip and the old, crazy white haired manager who's name tag read Albert winked at the girl and told her that she handled it like a pro and she was now ready to both take over the business and unite quantum physic's with general relativity with a simple equation on the back of a napkin from the trash heap.*

"Dude,Here is my 4 step program on how  to deal:1. Cut all ties.  You cant afford to reopen old wounds on the regular. I wouldn't even see her I'd mail her her shit. She can mail you yours. If you do have to see her go with someone. (Shit I'd go with you,  double park the car, you get out for the exchange and if that interaction takes longer than 25 secs I'm honking the horn like a psycho and you tell her: "" That's my crazy black friend outbreak aka OB gotta go he keeps telling me shit is hot?!?!)2. Take a designated amount of time every day to cry it out for a week. Cant let the emotion bottle up. I'd turn the ac to 5, lay on the couch under my electric blanket and play Sinead O Connors nothing compares 2 you or careless whisper. After 5 days of that shit you will emerge from the chrysalis of exaggerated sorrow, a changed new man.3. Hit the gym, find a new hobby and join a meet up group based on that new hobby. Get different clothes try new hairstyles. Call up ur male friends  hang out. I also treat myself to a day of fun shit, cigar, steak,4.  At some point she  may find a way to talk with you . Stay calm don't get back together. But talk rationally.  Ask her how when she's drunk she has the where withal, coordination and core strength to sit on a dick in a strategic fashion allowing for max pleasure but i can't aim straight into the urinal when I'm drunk.In summary.1. Cut all.ties2. Understand that its not ur fault that someone betrayed ur trust and that it's ok to feel.hurt and fucked up 3. N-vest in your self, expand your horizons, meet new people4. Tactfully approach any interactions with this broad. Take time to look back at how far you've come and recognize that this isn't even your final form. Dont ever stop.investing in yourself even if the next relationship.is amazing.I call this the CUNT method. Ok the sugar and  caffeine rush is over"
"Single dad here.  So many non-dads, and people without dating-age daughters in this thread.  Maybe I can help.

My daughter is 18, and three boyfriends into what, I assume, will be the same kind of messy dating life most adults have.  I got all the lame shotgun jokes any dad gets as she grew up, but maybe a little more than most because she's exceptionally pretty.  

That's a small part of what she is, and it's kinda new -- she was awkward-looking through some of the teenage years, so the fact that she's pretty hasn't dawned on her yet, and she doesn't use it for much of anything.  She's a bright, nerdy kid, highly political and damn sure she has the world figured out when she's just packing to leave for college, but yeah, I have to admit...people compare her to Kate Middleton all the damn time, and they're right.

So boys come around.

And I'm not an ass to them.  What the hell good would that do, anyway?

In the first place, this isn't the 14th century, and I'm not trying to keep her pristine and virginal because it's some kind of dowry investment.  In the second place, she needs to learn the hard, ugly lessons we all learn through dating.  It's part of life.

And I want her to learn as many of them as she can while she's safely under my roof.  Better to get her heart broken a few times, break a couple hearts and lose some self-respect over it for a while, and learn how to treat yourself and the people you're dating reasonably well while you're still at home.  There's less of a net in college.

So I'm nice to the boys she brings around.  I get to know them a bit.  I try to find out what their interests are, and talk to them regularly, *so they'll feel welcome in my home and spend lots of time with her here.*

That makes me a much more useful resource for her.  She can bounce things off me because I actually know the boys in question.

So her first ""boyfriend"" was an ass.  He was a year older, had dated a few of her friends, invested lots of his self-esteem into his truck....you know this kind of guy, you know he's not going to be good to her and you know she needs to get the bad boyfriend out of her system.  I didn't like him, but I kept that to myself and let him come around so they weren't out somewhere else doing god knows what, and after a month or two, she came to talk to me about him, and I leveled with her that I thought she was just one of several girls he was playing off one another and it was enough of a dick move to mean that he was a year older than her but less mature.  

She was asking because she suspected it.  She didn't just break up with him, she cut him out of her life completely.  

Boyfriend no. 2 was very nice, very nerdy, utterly terrified to be in the same room as me, and gave off every signal in the world of being gay.  I'm no expert on such things, but I'm pretty sure he just hadn't figured it out yet, and she was part of the process of figuring it out.  They had all the same interests, were the two kids who dominated discussions in English class, and seemed to compete playfully over grades.  It was adorable, and to every adult that saw it, it was painfully obvious that they were just friends using each other as training wheels.  

So I was kind to him, let them hang out here all the time, struck up conversations with him as often as I could, got to know him a bit.  And she admitted that his *weird* awkwardness around me was part of what made her realize something was just off and this wasn't what she wanted.

They weren't really able to be friends after they broke up, I think because it was just awkward.

He came out not long after they broke up.  I ran into him at their high school graduation and congratulated him, and he apologized for being awkward around me.  

Boyfriend no. 3 is the serious one.  They've now been dating most of a year -- an eternity in high school -- and they're going off to separate colleges but going to try to stay together there.

And of course, I let him hang out here, I talk to him, we have some interests in common.  He's a moviemaking nerd and has actually come over to see her and said ""hey, can we hang out with your dad for an hour before we go out? I wanna talk about Game of Thrones.""  

I *really* like this kid.  He's respectful to her.  He can look me in the eye without shaking.  I've met his dad and he's a genuinely good guy.  They've been through a lot as a family (mentally ill mom committed suicide when boyfriend was 11, dad met someone and got married a year or two back, had another child who just turned 1), and I can see how it shaped boyfriend and how he's actually pretty emotionally mature for his age.

And they're having sex.  Which is supposed to terrify me and send me off over some anger cliff....but honestly, she's having those experiences for the first time here, instead of off drunk at college, with a boy who I can see is crazy about her and respects her.  Sure, part of me is a bit upset that my baby girl is sexual now, but it's not a big part of me. I lost my own virginity way before 18, and she's awkwardly told me it happened for her just recently.  

I'm fine with it.  I guess it just comes down to the fact that I don't think of her sexuality as something I own that someone could take from me.  I think of it as something she has a lot to learn about, and boyfriend seems like a particularly nice and safe first partner for that.  We've talked about safety since she was young and I trust that she's making pretty good decisions.

Honestly, it's a little hard not to get too attached to boyfriend, because he's a good guy, and they're leaving for colleges a thousand miles apart next month.  Sure, they say they're going to stay together, but as adults we all know how long the odds of that really are.  

But I hope that, by being essentially nice to her boyfriends and getting to know them a bit, I've given her the freedom to experiment with dating *here*, before she's off at college where the risks get greater and the boys get drunk and the freedom means a lot of underprepared kids make big mistakes.  

So when she's in that environment, she'll have *some* emotional skills and dating experiences to draw on.  It probably makes her a little safer and less likely to get hurt too badly.

And hell, in ten years, I'll wanna know where boyfriend#2 and boyfriend#3 ended up, even though she probably won't be in touch with either one.   They're decent kids.  I wasn't in some competition with them.

"I've got 3 daughters, and honestly they're all so radically different. It's like raising 3 different species. One's a lesbian tomboy, one is a frantic, emotionally delicate 13 year old, and raising her is basically like raising Murph from Interstellar. One is a little fireball who loves to cuddle, and is fun to troll 

There are general differences between men and women, and you can recognize some patters, but for the most part each woman is her own person. If you know something about the general patterns that you see with women, then that's going to help you understand a woman, but that's not even half the battle. Most of the battle is understanding her as her own person. "

Another thing that drives me crazy-and for some reason is totally acceptable to alot of people-is an inability to control your emotions. We all have bad days, alot of people have very bad days but turning that into a constant cycle of emotional abuse is just being a shitty person. You don't have to express every emotion that pops up and very little is more disgusting than adult temper tantrums.

"A guy we partied with as kids started crying one night asking a girl to fuck him. This went on for like an hour until he blacked out.

She kept telling him that she just wasn't up for sex that night but had tried to drunkenly make out with several of us before that. Later, I walked in on her fucking the guy my friend brought with him.

Bonus cringe-I took a shitty job in my hometown years later and that girl's dad was my boss. He would always introduce me to people telling them I used to hang out with his baby girl."

"High school: I fractured a guy's eye socket because he told me he was going to rape my girlfriend and I wouldn't be able to do anything about it. He was that guy at every high school that runs his mouth to everyone, had been running his mouth to me for weeks, and I got tired of it. Dropped him with one punch but I began to regret the decision when my girlfriend called me, freaking out that I had hurt him. Found out a couple days later she was cheating on me with him. Nice.


Got suspended from school, sat out 2 state playoff games for football, and the kid pressed charges against me. I was pretty naive about the system, and I explained the situation to the judge, thinking he would understand. I was found guilty of assault and had to pay a fine and do a ton of community service. Luckily I was 17 when it happened otherwise I'd have a felony on my record. 

TL;DR: Don't be a white knight"

 One time (these are all out/at bars) a girl told me to kill myself and that I personally insulted her by ""thinking I had a shot"". Another one called me a genetic fuckup and that ""she actually feels really bad for me but I need to go away"".


I no longer try. 

The thing that gets me is both guys and girls alike say shit like ""dude, it can be overcome! not that many girls care! You just need to be confident""

Someone, *please* explain to me how the fuck I'm supposed to ""be confident"" when I have shit like that said to my face. When I get rejected based solely on something I can't control, and that's only the times its actually said to my face. How about the other billion times where shit like OP is talking about happens. 

You know how confidence is built in every other aspect of life? Experience and success. If I don't have either, how the fuck am I supposed to be confident? Sure I used to try to put on a confident persona, keep good posture, etc. and you know what? It meant absolutely fucking nothing. Nobody gives a fuck. You need to already have what people want for that to work, and clearly, I don't. It's impossible to be confident when you know, for a *fact*, that you're so low on the totem pole that you're scorn-worthy. But like I said, I've stopped trying. It isn't worth the constant humiliation and reminder that I suck. I'm not mad at women for it. I get it. I can't make them want something they don't want. I'm just mad at my genetics for making me this way.

Anywho, as for why? We're animals. We like things for animalistic reasons when we vet who we want to fuck/date/etc. and even in the work place, for who we want to follow (see [the Warren Harding error](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/residency/peds/new_compeds_site/pdfs_new/blink_chapter.pdf)).

"How to deal with bedroom PTSD is, as far as I know, different for every woman. However, I can tell you about my experience with one of my ex-girlfriends.

If she has frequent panic attacks, it should get better as you get to know her and her triggers.

When we started dating, she would have panic attacks fairly frequently during sex; maybe two or three times a month. Closer to the end of our relatonship, it was something that would happen maybe once every two months. This was in part because she learned to manage her thoughts, in part because we both knew each other so well and I would usually be able to sense a coming panic attack before it happened, and in part because she knew she could trust me absolutely.

When she did have a panic attack, she would cocoon up in blankets and just... Shiver. I would reassure her, just reminding her that I was there, that she was safe and that everything was ok, until she would give me her hand. Like /u/DreadfulRauw said, any unsolicited contact with her before she gave me her hand would make her flip out. I think that's important to remember.

All that being said, there are only two solid pieces of advice I can give you.

The first is that seeing the panic attack will probably make you feel like shit, for a lot of reasons. Because you couldn't prevent it from coming on. Because someone hurt someone you care about deeply and you'll never have the opportunity to put your thumbs in their eyes, because you feel it's your fault. Remember that it's NOT your fault, and try not to be anything but soothing and comforting at the time. Also try to keep as much of a lid on your distress as possible, because of reason number two.

The second is that the panic attack will probably make her feel pretty awful. Beyond the panic attack itself, is what I mean. She might feel awful because she sees how upset you are. If this comes up, you need to remind her that it's not her fault, and that what some piece of garbage did to her does not change her value as a person."

"I'm an office worker that works as a shirtless butler on the weekends. I'm no supermodel but I'm luckier than the average man in terms of looks and height. It also helps that I've been obsessed with fitness and have maintained a strict exercise routine for the last 8 years.

Even though it's not really a challenge, it is interesting to note how much casual sexism is totally overlooked when it's coming from a female. In my career job, if I made the same comments towards women that I receive from them, I'd probably be fired and possible sued.

This includes referring to me with various sexually themed pet names, being told to flex, wear a tighter shirt and being ""pimped"" (where I'm specifically sent to liaise with clients and 3rd parties if they are women). Women are none too shy getting a bit handsy on the odd occasion too. Honestly when it comes down to it, I'm  not bothered by it cause I'm ultimately in control of the situation but the double standards really are rediculous. 

Other than that, being attractive isn't lost on me. Even though I have a great girlfriend, its always a good feeling getting attention/chased by the opposite sex and even better getting paid for walking around in a bow tie, cuffs and not much else. "

One of the compliments I got.. I had to run a marathon to get it. 26 miles in 5 hours and 11 minutes just to be told by a girl ""that's so hot.""

"I'm a hairy Indian dude who maintains a hairstyle. 
Firstly find a good barber. You're not looking for a stylist or a salon, a good old fashioned barber. 

Second the haircut you're looking for is similar to mine, and can be described multiple ways. I'd say show your barber a picture first, but generally what you're looking for is a side part contour with a fade.
 
Third, you pay when you're done with the cut. Prices vary, I don't know where you are so I can't help myself. I personally tip $5 on a $30 cut, if you build a relationship with your barber it's just one more thing that is smooth in your life. Consistent tipping helps. 


Fourth, shampoo when your hair gets dirty, I shampoo every 2-3 days for the most part. 
Tips: buy a nice pomade. I'd suggest starting with a water soluble pomade. I like cool grease XXX. Best value I've found. You'll also need a good comb and brush. Kent no9 for comb, denman for brush. Trust me. 


As far as styling, just tell your barber this is a new haircut for you and you need to be taught how to style it. If he's worth his salt, he'll cut your hair accordingly to make it easier for you to style. Getting your hair perfect every day shouldn't take long, but it is a skill that takes time to perfect. 

Any other questions let me know. "

Once I stayed on the bus an extra stop and made myself slightly late because a cute girl had just taken the seat next to me and our shoulders were touching through about four layers of clothing.

"I don't take offense to your life experiences at all and I believe you 200% but reddit has an incredibly inflated view of how often the average women gets complimented and/or hit on in the real world. 

If us women can understand that and believe you I don't understand why men have to invalidate us women constantly about how rare it is for some of us women to get complimented or hit on too. Maybe the top 10 - 25 % of women have that happen to them on a regular basis but there's still a huge majority of women who don't get that kind of attention at all either. "

She was taking a lot of pictures in one spot so they started snickering at her, so she turns around to them and tells them the pics are not of them so mind their own business. So they mock her going ""oooohh scary"" so I just say ignore them lets go. Then she gets mad at ME saying why didn't I do anything? I was fucking astounded at the lack of thinking she was using, I was going to fight at least 5 dudes and probably get the shit kicked out of me over pictures. 

It was stupid selfish shit like that led me to breakup with her later on. "

"Double edge safety razors and traditional brush/wet shave soaps. Once you figure out how to use them properly, you'll get a way cleaner shave with WAY less irritation than cartridge razors. 


Seriously, my wife got me one of the Taylor of Old Bond Street soap tubs for last Christmas (they're about $20), I still have half a tub. 


The blades run between 10¢ and 50¢ each and most people get between 3 and 10 shaves out of each blade. 


You can pick up an old razor from an antique shop for between $5 and $50 (depending on where you are and the demand) and one of these could last you the rest of your life if  you take care of it. 


I save literally hundreds of dollars a year shaving this way and I don't break out or get razor burn on my neck anymore. "

So we were meant to just meet up for a drink, but as we sat down a weekly trivia night started, so we both agreed that it could be some fun. We entered as ""Team First Date"" and had a blast (just FYI, trivia nights are **BRILLIANT** for a first date idea). 

So the night carried on and after we got kicked out due to closing and we started walking out, she mentioned that she bumped into an old lady in the bathroom who overheard that we were on a first date (because of our team name), she then proceeded to apparently give her some tips about dating, where to meet, what to wear, etc. At this stage we'd just arrived at my car, so I casually turned to her and asked ""so what did she say about about having a kiss goodnight?"". After short adorable moment where she had a big smile on her face, we locked eyes and boom! Kiss town.

"You don't make friends at the bar, or at least not real friends.

If you go to the bar with the intention of meeting women, you're not going to meet any women.

Find people either online or in your friend group that want to go out drinking. Go to a bar that fits your interests(Don't go to a club if you don't like to dance, don't go to a country bar if you don't like country). When you get there, just have a good time with the people you came with. Being fun is contagious, if you and your friends are having a good time people will want to talk to you and get in on it. 

To meet girls, they need to see you and your group having a good time and notice you first. Don't stare around the room checking girls out, they notice that shit and it makes you look hella thirsty. Just have fun and if you happen to notice a girl peaking at you from across the bar go over and talk to her. Don't approach random girls that haven't *at least* made eye contact or smiled at you. 

The point of the bar and drinking is to have a good time, getting girls and meeting people are side affects of having fun."

"Medical student here. Testosterone and other androgens determine penis size for the most part. Thyroid, growth hormones and nutrition determine height for the most part. There is some overlap, but it explains the basis for the two not correlating. All these hormonal levels are gene dependent but can be independent from each other. 

There are so many variations of this. Androgens (including testosterone) can cause people to be tall too, but they'll be that kind of tall and super built kind of person. Most tall people aren't like this, they're thyroid or Gh tall, causing them to be tall and skinny or tall and normal body mass. Some people in fact can have early onset and offset puberty causing them to be short (because their pre puberty growth is cut short) but have a massive personality due to their raised testosterone. 

Endocrinology (study of hormones) explains so much about why we are who we are, it's fascinating! "

"Only recently I discovered, here on Reddit, that men didn't know this fact.  Some guy posted about pulling the towel off, not knowing her hair was in there, and throwing his girlfriend/wife to the ground."
"20, broke up with my girlfriend and found out she was pregnant.  I was an asshole and didn't see her most of the pregnancy and we got back together after our oldest son was born.  We were both in shitty jobs, high school educations but nothing really past.  We shared a 2 bedroom with another friend and after a year decided to give marriage a shot.

23 years later, after 2 separations, a bankruptcy, a lost house, mental health issues, substance abuse issues, infidelity issues, physical injuries, child health issues, death of parents...we're still here, and honestly more in love than ever.

I'm on my second career looking at a third.  She has been through college and is a respected working professional.  Both kids are in college, one in his first choice private college.  We're in a new house the last 4 years in a city with very high real estate costs.

It's really easy to be overwhelmed and let the circumstances define your attitude.  It doesn't have to though.  My kids gave me a reason to improve just so that they could have a better start then I did.  We came in with discouragement and low expectation and stayed and kept going and moved forward.

So it can succeed.  

EDIT:  Felt a need to add a smidge because a lot of people are focusing on the negative and implying it's all still some grand shitshow.  That right there is the lesson to be learned.  ***Don't focus on the bad parts, don't focus on the past. Work toward the future***

  YES there were some godawful bits.  Lots of them.  The darkest parts of my life involved my family and my marriage.  **BECAUSE** we went through all of that **together**, I am still with a strong, capable, confident, and communicative wife and we are moving forward still with no desire to give up the structure we built.  We're a decade past bankruptcy, solvent, sober (where needed), accommodating the specter of mental illness, etc...  And our kids have learned that good can come from a bad foundation.  I consider it a happily ever after myself."

"I put them in the same category as the ""I've never taken a drink or smoked weed"" people. Good on you, keep up the good work, nobody in the room cares.

As far as dating them goes, it depends on what they're saving it for. A girl who wants her first time to be special would be doing something I find pretty admirable and I'd be willing to wait that out and see where it went. A girl doing it for religious reasons or saving her virginity like a commodity for prince charming isn't going to like me anyway. 

Either way, I can honestly I've never met one of these in the wild outside of church and even then it was kind of rare. Most girls like sex just as much as we do and it's weird that we still value female virginity so much."

"I really want to answer this for you, but I'm having a hard time putting it all together.

You already seem like a thoughtful, caring person, and those two elements are essential to navigating a relationship like this one. The fact that you are already so concerned with making this work and making her comfortable is a good sign, for sure. I think you'll be okay. Just be yourself, and when problems crop up for her, be patient, be kind, be a good listener, don't try to take action - just be her support. Ask *her* what you can do for her in the moment, and again, just be patient hold her if she says she does not know.

It's hard to get too specific about what to do or look out for, because everyone is different and her needs are likely different than mine. Just be a good partner, be a good communicator, and be patient. You already sound off to a great start."

"To me, the friendzone has three components, and is generally considered an undesirable position to be in.

1.  Person A wants to date Person B.
2.  Person B does not want to date Person A.
3.  Person A and Person B are platonic friends.

Being friends with someone is not the upsetting part.  The reason people don't want to be in this situation is because it means someone they want to date doesn't want to date them.  You can't force someone to date you, so that's not something you can change.  You can choose to stop being friends, which may prove helpful if being friends is causing you to be hung up on someone whom you've hit a dead end with.

Basically the main reason people don't like being in the friendzone is because it means they didn't get to date someone they wanted to date, which is not something they have ultimate control over.  You can try to convince someone you are worthy of dating, but you can't make them want you.  You can choose to stop being friends, but being friends isn't the root cause of dissatisfaction."

"I don't disagree with you, but the OP's account is of a situation where a man was confident, nice, friendly, and not unattractive and her friends shit on him completely for being short.

Yeah you can find a woman who doesn't care about your height and appreciates you for who you are through not being insecure and some work, this however does not mean it's just going to magically happen for people who are trying or that shorter guys don't face any sort of discrimination in the dating world.

I mean I don't get how you having two short friends who found love means that all short guys are just failing because of their insecurities. It's a view that completely invalidates the OP not to mention the experiences you see all over Reddit either via stories or comments themselves relating to men and being short. 

Yeah I'm sure plenty of men who are also short are lacking in other areas of life which make them unsuccessful in dating but according to your view the man mentioned in the OP shouldn't have had any problem being taken seriously, yet he was ridiculed by OP's friends for being short. Not for being slovenly or ugly or rude or poorly dressed/mannered, but for being short and for some reason presumably having a small dick due to being short to boot.

My gf. Heyyoo
Moved in with her as friends for what was supposed to be a short time between different living arrangements for me.  I was 29 and her 27.  Started sleeping together after partying after about 6 months.  Did that for about 6 months and then started dating.  Dated for a year and she got pregnant.  I had under a year if chiropractic school left and she got pregnant.  Graduated from school and the next day got married.  Our daughter was 3 months old at the time.  I stayed at home with the kiddo and she is an executive at a finiancial firm.  I've been a SAHD for almost two years and baby #2 is due next month
She's been a broad her whole life.
Nothing good happens after 2am.
"I went to a wedding last week. The bride and groom were just radiating pure joy. They both cried enough that it was a struggle to say their vows. They're kind of emotional normally, but this was a whole nother level

I've never come CLOSE to feeling that about anyone I've dated. "

"That's how i got my current gf. Me and my friends were going out in our city and when i was about to walk to my bike to ride home, i saw this amazing looking girl that i knew from school being cornered by 2 guys. She was obviously drunk, she couldn't even stand straight. So i walked up to those 2 guys and pretended that i was her boyfriend. They became angry and we got into a fight. I beat those guys up but i took quite some hits myself. They ran away afterwards. I proceeded to take her home, i knew in which neighbourhood she lived . I texted a friend of her for her adress. I took her keys, brought her home . I discovered that there was no one at home so i decided to stay and hit the couch, and i put her in bed. I left a note on her nightstand explaining what happened the previous night and that i would be downstairs making breakfast by the time that she woke up. The next morning i explained her everything in detaill and she said that it was the nicest thing someone has ever done to her. We went on a couple of dates afterwards and she is my gf now. (P.s sorry for any mistakes, i'm really tired)"
How many of them are stubbornly unwilling to admit that they have a massive advantage in online dating.
Periods have...chunks I suppose would be the best way to describe it.  You are also pushing so more is coming out.
"Nothing good will ever come from telling your SO that. Sharing of sexual history should be kept vague and only release pertinent details, such as STDs, children, and/or traumatic events (in my opinion.)

If someone resorted to paying for sex, that's their decision. As long as they aren't still sleeping with prostitutes during the relationship, and aren't carrying criminal charges due to use of prostitutes, then leave that in the past. Presumably anyone who visits prostitutes is on top of their sexual health and getting regular and thorough STD tests (and really, anyone who has casual sex with anyone should be doing so, regardless if it's a sex worker or not.)

I would be absolutely *not* amped to find out my partner slept with prostitutes (for a variety of reasons that are my own and not up for debate.) But what I don't know can't hurt me, and if he's at a different stage in his life now where he no longer does it, then I'd say: leave it be. "

"I'm pretty sure this is why so many guys aged teen to 30 have such a twisted jaded view on women. The concept of dating a woman who isn't good looking is just not even an option in their mind, which leaves them chasing good looking women. But according to basic statistics, 50% of the population is either average looking or uglier, which means you have a pretty good chance of being in that category. So if you're in that category and you're chasing 7+ women, you're either going to be rejected a LOT, or left dating the hot but crazy-bitch girls. Not exactly a great recipe for developing a healthy perspective on women and dating."
"True, that's regret #2."

"But only if you're over 6'. If you're under 6' you don't have to worry about it because no woman ever in the entire universe would be with someone under 6'.

Edit: Also, sadly, I think some people are upvoting you because they legitimately agree with what you're saying and don't think it's tongue-in-cheek."
"Bring on the downvotes, but you need to grow some fucking balls dude. 5'7'' isn't short enough to be such a whiny bitch. I'm 5'8'' and have no fucking issues at all. The guys who can complain are like 5'2''....or maybe you live in some viking land where the average height is 6'3''

...and you have a solid dick size....you are exactly the example of needing confidence.

Seriously why do you give a fuck what those cunts said to you? The person who would say something like that is shit quality anyways. You want to be with a shit person just because they are hot?"
"This is pretty accurate. I'm a 31 year old male with extremely overbearing parents. My mother judges everyone in general, and her unrealistic and unattainable expectations on me have caused both emotional and relationship issues. It took me a long time to realize that I simply had to stop trying to make her happy and proud, it just won't happen. 

Hell my mom hated my ex for 6 years while I was with her. We broke up, my mom all of a sudden thinks my ex is an angel. Just recently on my 31st birthday my mom wants to go to dinner with my ex my father and I. I agree since ex and I are still very close. We go to dinner, all is well. On the way home I invite my current girlfriend over for cake (ex and current gf have met, may not be friends but get along well enough). Next day my mom calls me ranting about how I'm an embarrassment and that she told me she didn't want to meet my new gf, doesn't like her, felt very uncomfortable and that I ruined the night for her. Yup. She called me on my actual birthday to tell me that I ruined MY birthday for HER because I invited my girlfriend over for cake after dinner. 

People that judge their children's relationship choices may not all be that extreme as mine, but likely it's a warning sign. Just let your kid love who they want to. If you disagree so be it, but it isn't your life, all you can do is support your child and hope for the best. "

I had to stop at some point but the point is this there is such a big disparity in the number of subs that have female nudity versus male nudity. The biggest sub featuring the admiration of men isn't even featuring like random handsome men but famous and attractive men. If physical attractiveness was the only thing they were looking for then /r/ladybonersgw would have more viewers than /r/ladyboners and we would have more posts of male models not just men who demonstrate some skill e.g acting, singing + physically attractive. The difference in subs between Male and female shouldn't be that high. The debate that it is because there aren't enough men who take care of themselves doesn't hold because if it did then /r/ladyboners would have way more full frontal pics than it does. Check it now. So many of the guys are in suits and stuff. Really, you can't say physical attractiveness is what is being solely admired.     "

How about I just raise her to be a strong/independent person so she doesn't need me to fear for her when she starts dating, that she has a good head on her shoulders so she can make the right decisions. However now that she is 3.5 and I see what a little headstrong firecracker she is, I almost feel sorry for the boys (assuming she is/will be straight) she will date in the future, hah."

"Drinking. 

I use it to cope with anxiety and use it to relax. I'm a 100% functioning alcoholic, but I have periods of being drunk where I get in piss poor moods and take it out on people who don't deserve it. Typically strong arguments online.

I've helped resolve this by shutting off my computer when I'm drinking, but deep down I know that I need to shut down the drinking - at least when alone.

My goal is to do that."

"&gt;With period shits you get poop coming out the back in large soft gushy masses that are halfway between diarrhea and solid feces while blood clots gush out the front with the sensation of chilled jello shooting out your vagina. 

Yep. This is the most accurate description I've ever seen for period poops. 

In my case, though, the jello-like blood clots slide out slowly from between my labia -- not shooting out fast. It's unnerving, feeling the slithery bits. And every once in a while, the large gushy masses of poop are interrupted by sudden liquidy fart sprays, covering the inside of the bowl. And sometimes you can barely make it to the toilet in time. 

Feels so good when it's over.

I'm a 5'5"" guy, and I personally like my height, if I had the choice to be taller, I don't think I would.  There are benefits that come with being shorter and I've never had trouble in the dating scene.  If you're a guy around my height having trouble with women, let me assure you its not JUST because of your height.  The majority of women don't actually care about your height if you're not ugly and can be funny and/or charming."

Otherwise I'd probably go vampire so at least I wouldn't murder people randomly whenever there was a full moon. "

I have the same challenges every other guy has.

The girls I try to date and date have other guys who are just as attractive if not more attractive than I am that they're talking to at the same time. 

The guy who is a 6 tries to date girls who are 6s and has challenges, the guy who's an 8 tries to date girls who are 8s and has challenges. I hate the numbering system for attractiveness since it's so subjective, but hopefully its get the point across.

"Used to be a manager at a McDs. I was working the overnight shift with a few of highschoolers, including 2 cute girls. Being that it was a Saturday night, we all know to expect the drunk rush between 1:30 and 3. So it comes, and while there's a few creeps, its mostly good. Near the end, we get one guy who just starts going hard on one of the girls, flirting with her, getting her attention, calling out for her when she disappears, stuff like that. So I go up, tell him to leave her alone or I'm kicking him out. He sheepishly says ok, then, a second later yells out how girl #2 has a great ass and asks her name. I kick him out, and he goes out. This is just after 3. 

At 6, I go outside to take a look at the parking lot and see if there's any mess or stuff like that. He's outside, sitting by a streetlight. So I go up to him and tell him he should get out of the parking lot. He refuses. I call the cops, they say they'll get someone over when they can. shift end is coming up for us overnighters, and I'm giving them both a ride home. Cops aren't there, and I'm pretty sure he's gonna harass the fuck out of them the moment they step outside. So I drive my car through the drive thru, they jump out the one of the windows, and we speed off. 

Apparently he walked in later and asked about the two girls, and hit on the manager working.  Thankfully the cops showed up before she put his head in a deep fryer. "

It's fresh, so of course your trust is shattered.  You'll be less trusting in the future, and that's okay as long as you don't get super possessive or go overboard with it.  Remember that you deserve someone who you *can* trust who will earn that from you, and that if you're worth it, you'll find it someday.
