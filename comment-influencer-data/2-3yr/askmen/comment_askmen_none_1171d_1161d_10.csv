"Read the bottle - if it says ""shower gel"" or ""body scrub"" or the like, you're fine.

If it says ""marinade"", ""preheat the oven"", ""tenderise before cooking"", or ""best paired with shiraz"", I'd be replacing the metal cutlery with plastic sporks.

Also, if she wants to ""go Dutch"" on a date, may be worth clarifying if she means she wants to pay for her own meal, or if she has a backpacker from Amsterdam defrosting in the bathtub."
"If you're thinking of asking your SO to marry you and you're worried about getting a no, you shouldn't be asking. You and your SO should have talked about marriage and the future already. The fact that you're proposing shouldn't be a surprise, how you're proposing should be. "
"Mods are gay and have been doing gay things recently, so they made a post saying that they were gay and that we should be gay with them by accepting their aggressive advances.

"My wife of 19 years has been buying me preposterously-named body products forever...it's not like this ""Tobacco 1812"" lotion here on my desk smells anything like tobacco, it's that she absolutely fricken' loves it when I use some.

Think of it this way: she's decorating you with scent, just like she decorates her walls when she moves into a new apartment.  It's a sweet gesture that's in its own way subtly possessive."
"Of course it's justifiable, you haven't made any commitments and neither have they.  Women do this all the time, btw.

You will end up hurting feelings if they both sleep with you and *then* find out after the fact.  Doesn't mean you were in the wrong necessarily, but you should be realistic.

These things work better if you're honest about your intentions and actions, though there's no need to make a big deal about it or spell it all out for them.  Also works better if there are more than two girls - triangles are hard, but once you get on to 3 or 4 it becomes a lot less personal."
The very obese people that use scooters and wheel chairs because they are so large they can't walk anymore are ruining the bus schedule. Buses are always late because there is so many of them now and the lift and getting them buckled can sometimes take several minutes. 
"I posted this in another thread about a woman sniffing somebody's kid and making vague predictions:

My wife used to... ""breathe me in"" is probably the best way to describe it. The first time it happened was on our second or third date. We were standing, talking, hand-in-hand, side-by-side, and she tilted her head and rested it on my shoulder. She then turned her face toward my upper arm and *inhaled* like I was a lovely spring breeze . It surprised the hell out of me, but it wasn't creepy. I think she sighed when she exhaled and she just radiated happiness and contentment. No previous girlfriend had ever done anything like it. For me it was the first inkling that she might end up being more than just another girlfriend. All through our marriage she did that and a bunch of other endearing little behaviors that told me she loved me with every fiber of her being and I did my best to reciprocate. It's been 14 years since she passed away and I still miss her a lot."
"If you can't handle me at my buggiest, you don't deserve me at my fleshiest. 

Edit. I'm a little high"
"Obese people inconveniencing others in general.

I was reading a forum the other day with stories from EMTs and firemen about injuries they've gotten from trying to help obese people. Some of these injuries ended their careers, but it's not acceptable to talk about because it's seen as blaming the obese."
How about waxing her asshole?

Every single woman has a very faint mustache. If you really want to irritate a woman just point it out.
"My wife adamantly refused to give our son any kind of violent toys.

So, what does he do? Bites a piece of toast into the shape of a gun and shoots it.  She gave up."
"There are a lot of seriously fucked up family situations/arrangements floating around, especially with kids in the picture."
"Every time a mod throws down, I feel like I missed a shitstorm.  Damn it.  What happened?  Where?"
"I asked her 3 months after she got out of hospital, after a serious car crash (just herself, at a highway which nearly killed her). We had been dating for 4 years and it was in the park. She said no in a small voice, amidst the squirrel chirping.

I won't lie, it did sting big and it did suck for a while. But I don't hold it against her. Better to get a truthful 'No,"" then a lying ""Yes,"" which sets it up for divorce later. We broke up after a few days. Haven't spoken to her in years, but I hope she's healed well from the trauma.

"Gender, and more specifically masculinity and femininity, aren't  completely socially constructed. Little girl children act like little girls, and little boy children act like little boys.

"I'm a girl but I essentially said no. 

I was with my high school boyfriend for about 1 year and a half. 

At the start of the relationship we were  certain we'd be together forever, like pretty much all first relationships. He called me his wife (which would always make me cringe). We talked about our future wedding, how many kids we wanted, where we'd live. But it was all immature nonsense. None of it was ever serious, or so I thought.  

After a year or so I wanted out of the relationship but my attempts at breaking up never stuck. He'd beg and plead, he'd follow me around until I gave in. 

At the end of the relationship I went away for the summer. We hardly spoke, and I knew when I got back I'd break up with him. 

I got back and he asked me to dinner. I figured I'd break the news right away. We sit down to eat and he tells me he was very busy while I was away. That he talked to my mom and step dad, and with his parents, and got everyone's blessing. Then he pulled out a ring at the table and asked me to marry him. 

A few people at surrounding tables noticed. My face must have turned bright red because it felt like it was on fire. I then tried really hard no to laugh, which is what I do in uncomfortable positions.

All I said was, oh god, I'm here to break up with you....he looked at me with the most defeated and rejected expression but insisted I take the ring from him to save face. 

We spent the next hour or so discussing our breakup. I cried, I felt so bad, he cried because he felt so dumb. 

We left and I handed the ring back. 

We stayed friends for a little while. But eventually I moved out of state and we stopped talking. "

I remember when I realized that not every family is as stable and loving as mine. That changed my whole world.
"She wasn't the same person ever since the car crash. In ways that I I could not reach her emotionally. . .with anything. Going to groceries, cooking, socializing, it was a different frequency with her.

When we broke up that was part of her paraphrasing. I did fight to keep our relationship afloat because I loved her, but when someone is like that. . .it's hard for both parties. I think my proposal coldly gave a reality snap."
"Not me personally, but my roommate moved to Alabama for a while and dated a chick for 2 years. Her family was super rich, she was gorgeous, so of course he fell head over heels for her. He dropped 5 grand on a ring, proposed to her at a Bama game, and she straight up told him no, and that he should actually move away because he had no future where he was living, which he did the very next day.

AskGayBros is full of awkward teenage boys, who ask about creeping on their straight friends. It gets pretty disturbing sometimes, but the people who say this are often downvoted. The original GayBros subreddit was originally supposed to be for men who are gay, and have masculine interests (cars, sports, guns, grilling, outdoorsy stuff)...but there isn't really much discussion of these, at all. In fact, a lot of the feminine guys have overtaken the subreddit and will try to actually shame guys who are ""Straight Acting"" and don't watch shit like RuPaul's Drag Race.

So, overall I've been preferring this subreddit lately."
"Bravo!  I'm disabled, an amputee.

This goes for sexual orientation as well. I'm a bi guy but I dislike people trying to add more syllables to the acronym LGBT - I don't like more syllables. 
"I talked to them after. They said it wasn't really a blessing, and they tried telling him we were way to young but told him if I agreed they wouldn't stand in the way. But they knew me well enough to know I wouldn't actually say yes. "
People of all genders and orientations get laid more than the guys here.
"It's not universal, but the more attractive a person is, the less of a decent and interesting person they have to be/are. Most of the 9s and 10s I've talked to (male or female) in the past few years haven't made for a good intelligent conversation or were just a shitty person. I think it's because they have to do less personality wise to be approached and liked so they don't get as much of a chance to develop socially and mentally but it's just a theory.

Again not true for everyone, but it's been my experience for years."
"The best indicator of future behaviour is past behaviour - I'll never understand why so many people seem to think that a person's relationship history is dismissable when assessing their potential as a partner.

 It seems people want to distance themselves from their actions by saying it happened 'in the past' and 'doesn't define me as a person' - that's all well and good but if you've cheated on every guy you've been with then that's relevant in the context"
"Being alive is fun, even with all the shitty things that happen. So I look forward to every day as something new might happen. Something I read that stuck with me is, ""I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them"", the good old days to me are when I'm the happiest and I cherish them :)"

"That ""being passionate about a hobby"" will automatically make you more attractive to girls.

Sorry bros, I know it stings to hear but: it really depends on what the hobbies are. I know a guy who plays Pokemon cards internationally - as in he gets invited to competitions and has won money and has written manuals about that stuff. But he's still an obese virgin who girls barely even look twice at.

Meanwhile I have a friend who is physically attractive and knows only enough guitar to play Wonderwall, but every time he whips it out, girls come flocking to him to listen and flirt.

It really depends on your hobby. I'm not saying don't have nerdy interests, I'm saying have realistic expectations about how much they will help in the realm of dating and attracting women."

My mom was a nurse and he had just finished medical school and had been accepted for residency about 10 hours away. They'd been dating for only about 2 years, and he realized that if he left things were basically over, but she couldn't move and go with him (conservative family). So he proposed, she was a little bit surprised and asked for a few days to think about it, and then she said yes, and they moved together to where he was doing his residency.

- That prison fundamentally doesn't work, and that sending kids that break into houses to prison results in smarter, better connected thieves.

- When people say they ""need"" something, 99% of the time they actually mean ""want"".  Guns are the classic example.

- Kids are way, way too fucking dependent on the internet, and I think a lot of them are going to have trouble communicating professionally and in future relationships if all their communication is online, where you can mute people or block them with a mouse click."

For some reason it's ok to be a hoodrat in this country as long as you're black or Hispanic. On the otherhand being a white hoodrat(aka white trash) isn't at all acceptable. Accepting bad havior just promotes it. Certain groups of people in this country are unintentionally encouraged into bad lifestyles by the acceptance and defense of chronic bad behavior.

"I don't feel alienated or left out, from what i see on askgaybros a lot of problem are relatable.

One thing i find funny is guys saying they don't understand women or that  women are too complicated, i feel like it's more general, women and men are complicated.

I also like to see how on some topics straight men are really picky while gay dudes doesn't give a shit.
For example, sexual partners numbers, it's a recurring issue here while for gays it's pretty rare, most don't care from what i've seen.

 One time when she was 15 a friend's older brother (30 years old) asked if she wanted to go with his sister to their grandma's place and have noodles (she made delicious noodles).  My girlfriend said yes and after their noodle meal he invited her to his room only to strip naked and ask her to give him a handjob when they entered his room.
 
Senior year of high school after she graduated one of her teachers asked if she wanted to go see a movie with a bunch of the other students and his wife.  When she got to the theater to her surprise her teacher's wife was not there as well as her other classmates.  whatever she thought and they started watching the movie, after a few minutes the teacher (late 20s early 30s) placed his hand on her upper thigh near her groin and told her he didn't love his wife anymore and that he's been eying my girlfriend all year.  Creeped out she ran out of the theater only to get some angry texts calling her a slut and a whore... again she was too frightened to call the police but later her teacher was caught and sent to jail (and his wife divorced him).

Besides that she gets just general harassment that she and others have faced.  Just today she told me that some guy smacked her ass hard before running off and hi fiving his bros."

So to counter that head spinning bullshit, if I like a girl I just ask her out. Quick, simple, effective. "

People do not start running as you approach, you are not a demon from beyond the stars, you are just an overly awkward dude. Stop exaggerating to feel sorry for yourself. 

You just need to learn how to judge social situations a little better, if I had to guess, you probably stare a little too long, or stand a little too close to someone, or say the wrong things too much. Most of that probably comes from overthinking things so much that you arent in the moment, that comes off as creepy sometimes.

But, overall, I cant know what is causing your creepyness without meeting you and talking to you for a bit. So really I have no clue. "

It also seems harsh to get him to swear forever and in sickness and in health when neither of us really know what that might mean next year. After the last time I stipulated that he couldn't ask if I've needed painkillers that day, which apparently has killed all other attempts.

"Oh man, this happens all the time. 



I was hanging and studying with this girl for a while, and I ended up talking to my other friends about it. They said she was definitely into me. (she had grabbed my hand in class and rubbed it on her leg, and said, ""Look anon, I shaved! My legs are sooooo smooth."" And I'm just thinking she's probably just a touchy feely kind of girl, but my friends are like, nah man. Then she tells me she's a virgin while we're studying alone in her room, and then told me a little about her ex.

A few days later, I get a text saying she needed me immediately. I met her and she hands me a box and an envelope and then runs off. The box had brownies and the envelope had a thank you note, as she was now doing better from the studying. She signed it with a heart.

"I am a bisexual man who lives very active sexual lifestyle with other men.  Social media (grindr, snapchat, and kik) are the go-to places for guys to meet up for sex.  There a few very scary, yet ""plot twisty"" observations I have noticed that I would not dare bring up in every day conversation:

**WARNING: THERE ARE SOME DISTURBING NOTES AHEAD.**

* You cannot begin count how many minors (under 18) are on these apps initiating conversation and advances for sex.  For every time I post my username for one of these apps on a forum (not contacting any users individually), I get 2-4 user adds/friend requests/messages where the users say they're under 18.  Sometimes as young as 13.  Many are looking for older men (like 50+) too.  

* The large majority of old guys looking for minors (online predators) don't lie about their age.  An older guy on one of these apps told me once that there's no point in lying, because even if he were to get lucky, he'd want the other person to still be interested in him for being who he is (they don't want to act like someone else).  

* A surprisingly large number of minors lie about their age.  I only talk to men 18+, and when I submit my name to forums, I make this clear.  Many will add, then say they're 18 or older so that I will talk to them, then once the conversation starts going somewhere, they confess they're only 15 or 16.  One confessed to me that he was 16 once and said ""I had to lie because no one wants a 16 year old.""  It took awhile to explain that they don't want you because it is illegal.  I've had other guys online tell me this happens to them all the time.

* Some of these minors are just dumb and aren't in touch with reality (thinking they're in a sexual fantasy world).  Some are very intelligent and know perfectly well what they're doing and are aware of the risks and potential consequences that come with it.

"Besides the obvious biological ones, I'm glad I don't have to deal with the nonsense that is female clothes.  Clothes shopping as a guy is ridiculously easy, as sizes are largely the same regardless of where you shop.  Women's clothes sizes on the other hand vary wildly from retailer to retailer, often necessitating checking many different stores to find what you need and making it nearly impossible to order clothes online (and don't get me started on the weird body shaming incorporated into how the sizes are labeled).  And the nonsense starts early:  for example, 3T girls clothes are significantly smaller than 3T boys clothes, despite there being no significant size difference between sexes at that age.

Also, most women's clothes don't come with pockets, which would drive me nuts."

"Mate, trying to ""make a splash"" first day on the job has been the downfall of many people.  At best, people think you're trying to suck hole with the management, at worst, they get pissed off because the new guy is trying to tell everyone else how to do their job.

"I like to drink coffee all day and complain about how hot it is in here to all the women in my all woman office. Also occasionally I do some work for a bit and that makes the time go by a bit quicker. I do a lot of wandering around the building. I get up and go to the bathroom even when I really don't need to.

I like this comment.
"In general, men have to worry less about being overpowered by others. I was talking to a friend last weekend and she mentioned how scary it is for a girl when a guy approaches her in an aggressive manner. Males are generally much more stronger than females, so it's essentially impossible for a woman to fend off a man that's trying to sexually assault her. 

Even if the man has no intentions of being violent, the very possibility of it is enough to instill fear in women and make them more cautious. "
"Isn't changing more of a post-shower thing than an every day thing?  I always shower at least once a day so it's never been an issue, but it seems kinda of weird to change underwear without showering first. Wouldn't that just immediately put your new underwear at the same state as the old ones?"

"It was December. I just flew in from Chicago on her birthday, and we were going to the city for dinner and to see the tree in Rockefeller Center, where I was to propose. Of course the minute we reach our cruising altitude, I feel a cold kick in. Once home, she sees how I feel and keeps telling me we can stay home. Of course, I refuse to since I had plans, and I pop a bunch of airborne in hopes it does something. 

At dinner she brings up marriage. I feign disgust and discomfort at the idea, as I didn't really know what to do. She gets upset, we eat, and we go to the tree. 

We can't even get the cabbie to go that close to the area. There are people everywhere. I am, or at least was, shy as fuck. I couldn't speak to a room of 10 people at that time in my life. What made me think this was a good idea? I should have had a few drinks at dinner. I am in panic mode. Where the heck do I do this with so many people everywhere? After walking around a to the side of the tree, its time to just go for it. Why didn't I rehearse this part? What do I say? In my nervous state, I think I will try to say something clever to lighten the mood. I said something along the lines of, ""You jerk. You almost ruined tonight's surprise."" I get down on my knee and propose to someone after just calling them a jerk. WTF is wrong with me? I hear all these people going ""aww"" and what not. It feels like I have the attention of 10,000 passersby. She just stands there with her mouth open. About a minute has passed, and I am scared someone is going to grab this ring. I am holding it up in what has to be the most crowded place in the county at that time of year while on my knee. Between the ring being ripe for the taking and me feeling what felt like the stares of 10,000 people, I am going to have to get up. I am so nervous at that point that I have no idea what I said. Something like, ""can I take that as a yes?"" I get up and only then she finally says yes, but that lack of an answer during the actual proposal will be remembered forever. 

We look back at it and joke about it, and she really appreciated me going so far out of my comfort zone. "

"This might not be quite in the spirit of the question, but it's true to the wording of it:

When I was a child, I became convinced that I was being followed everywhere. I kept seeing the same person again and again, apparently going about their day but always dressed differently. They'd wear a wig, or glasses, or be in a wheelchair, but their face was always recognisable. I became pretty paranoid about seeing this person so often, and in so many different disguises. Surely I wasn't important enough to actually be followed by someone?

In fact, it turned out that I wasn't. The person that I was seeing was actually a variety of people. People with Down Syndrome. One of the symptoms of Trisomy 21 is a particular set of facial features, but no one had ever explained that to me; I was convinced that all of these people were just one guy spying on me while wearing a bunch of slightly crappy disguises.

"I kinda question the legitimacy of ""non-binary genders.""  I have a couple acquaintances who adopted the label, and it kinda strikes me as an extreme case of ""I'm not like the other girls"" syndrome.  I don't think being offbeat and quirky necessarily means you're a different gender."

"I saw a TED talk about the difference between male and female sexuality. Men focus on physical characteristics, women tend to focus on social context. I will never get sick of boobs for the same reason most women would never get sick of being the envy of all their friends due to a partner."
"As someone who is bigger and stronger, a big reason for it is that I don't want to hurt someone just because they're a dick. Especially when, even if they throw the first punch, I'm more likely to get in trouble.

So now you have to ask yourself are we still compatible? You have probably heard a lot about the cannibal lifestyle and have come to your own conclusions about the pressures it can cause in a relationship. Don't jump to any hasty conclusions. But begin asking yourself some important questions. Are you willing to give up some digits or a limb? Will it be mutual and how does that end? Is it compatible with my vegan belief system? Etc.
You probably made it a point to follow Rule 1 and 2. Nothing is a dealbreaker if you can hold those down.

"It's just a game man, it's fun shit. 

First time I played it (a long time ago) I was like ""you guys are a bunch of fucking squares"" and then I just sort of got into it and now we have regular meet-ups and our wives just drink wine and talk about where it all went wrong for hours as we eat pizza rolls in the basement quietly so we don't wake up the children.

"Anything that makes a blanket generalization about an entire gender and speaks it like gospel. 

if someone lacks the social intelligence to know how to interact with people and has to come to the Internet for advice, they likely lack the social intelligence to understand that every situation is different and nothing is black and white. 

Giving advice to people like that in black and white terms is a recipe for failure."

"&gt;She and you are having so much fun you both don't want the date to end.

&gt;&gt; sex

The first few times where that did happen, made me realize that sex really started earlier, way before the clothes came off. It's all one process. Dates build tension; sex releases tension.

* teasing each other and making each other laugh.

* lingering touches.

* how we positioned our bodies ever more closely and intimately, our faces leaning toward each other . . .

* the silent looks where we expressed more about wanting each other than if we had said anything.

* when you stand up to leave the bar/nightclub/cafe, she gets up and moves in sync too, and it's unspoken but understood that the next place you're going, you're going together."
*How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie definitely helped me to become much better at conversation and building relationships.

"I can't stand these people. What's your disability? Oh, fat and lazy. It's worse in a grocery store, where they can't be bothered to walk to the food that is responsible for their obesity. I can't fathom the lack of dignity it takes to decide that taking a mobility scooter around a store because they're so massive they can no longer support their own weight. 

I believe someone shouldn't be shamed for their weight, to a point. That point is when the world has to make accommodations for their fat ass. Their weight is their business, until they make it someone else's problem."
"Being frugal.

I cringe every time I see bottled drinks and single-serve bags of chips."
I think this is only true on the extreme end. Traditional 9s and 10s seem to suck a good chunk of the time but I think it's kind of random after that. Only other thing I can think of is that 1s and 2s are also usually very bitter but I can't really blame them.
"me and my wife are comfortable around the nude form of one another but still there's an effort to keep our Nude forms regal in each others mind.

"Louis CK did an episode on this where an overweight woman keeps trying to date him and he keeps turning her down until she finally breaks down about how horrible it is to be a fat woman. She definitely had lots of valid points, but I couldn't get over why she felt she deserved to date Louie. I mean, he's not exactly a stud, but he's not unattractive and he's very successful. Why does he have to choose her because just because she thinks they're in the same league. She was an overweight waitress from what I remember, and all I kept thinking was if Louie was a short, unemployed comedian she'd have zero interest in him.

Same goes for the Lena Dunham thing. You think people wanna see a naked out of shape man on their TV screen, and that he wouldn't be relentlessly mocked? Oy vey."
"Gonna lay it out simple:

1. Personal hygiene needs to be 11/10 at all times. It's the most important part. No one likes a smelly fat guy.

2. Have a job, your own place, and a car. Focus on these three things and it's a huge step. 

3. Evaluate your standards. Always go for what you want, but keep your expectations realistic. Quit shooting for supermodels.

4. Do YOUR thing. Be confident in your work hobbies, and life. Like anime and video games? Then BE a lover of those things without apology.

5. Get rejected. Every time you are told no, you get a little stronger. Rejection actually builds confidence.

Don't care about up votes, just hope this helps a fellow big man out. You're a relevant, beautiful person no matter your weight. Don't change to get a partner, change because you want to be better. Good luck out there.

"&gt; Better to get a truthful 'No,"" then a lying ""Yes,"" which sets it up for divorce later.

I have a friend that had a girlfriend that did that.  He proposed, she said yes, but as time got closer to the wedding, she started drifting away.  Sad thing is, he noticed it, but they still went through with the wedding.

The marriage didn't last even a year.  He said there was never any intimacy and that she refused to talk about it.  Eventually, she finally admitted that she didn't want to be married to him anymore, and that she really didn't in the first place, but just got caught up in the moment when he proposed.

Things are working out pretty well for him, though.  He's achieved his dream job of being an English teacher in Japan, something he wasn't going to be able to do if he was still with her."

"Female hormonal cycles in general... for so many reasons, the biggest of which is that you don't get taken seriously about *anything*. 

Mad? It's your hormones. Sad? It's your hormones? Sick? It's your hormones. 

On the rare times I go to the doctor, I am taken seriously *immediately*. The doctor doesn't fuck around. If it seems like there is anything abnormal I'll get batteries of tests, the works, whatever it takes to figure out what is wrong with me. 

When my wife goes? My mom? Female friends? Even when their doctors are female they're like ""Wellllll.... lady problems?""

"I have been driving manual for almost as long as I've been driving (around 18 years). My first car, and all subsequent cars, have been manual. My husband started driving manual about two years after me. 

We were shopping for a new car. We wanted a car with manual transmission. We went to the Ford dealer in town. I dislike Fords in general, but my husband had some good experiences with some Focus rentals a few years prior. 

The salesman introduced himself and shook my husband's hand, ignored mine. Asked for husband's name, husband ended up adding mine in as well. Asked us what we were interested in. I said we'd like to see the Focus if they have one with a manual transmission. The salesman goes on this long thing of how we don't want one like that because they're more trouble than they're worth, and how he blew his transmission at a stop sign. I said wow, that's weird, we've never had trouble with them in our experience. We did the test drive on an auto, didn't like it, and left after being ignored further in the ending conversation. 

This salesman was young. Like maybe barely of drinking age. He was probably also new at selling cars. I was tempted to give him feedback at the end of it that it is NEVER a good idea to ignore half of the buying couple. 

We ended up getting an awesome Mazda from a great salesman who got both our input on things."

"Single moms and sometimes even single women, tend to become annoying in their mid to late thirties. They become the sort of weird attention seeking types. I can't really explain what I mean, but I recognize it in most women I see at work or outside and I just kind of want to strangle them.

The first sign is that they talk about themselves and make themselves seem non ordinary. Usually if they have kids at least one of them has some sort of mental/physical thing going on for which the woman in question has to cope with. Eventually they get triggered by something and get attention via that way.

I've only met one married woman belonging in this category.

Single men in mid thirties tend to become these silent guys that rarely talk about their personal lives in any situation. Fun to be with, but hard to befriend."

A lot (most?) of attractiveness is understanding how you're perceived, and then improving yourself until you meet that standard. People who understand how they're perceived are obviously going to be better. 

Also, good looks is strongly correlated with wealth and wealthy people tend to be smarter and more educated. I find smarter/better educated people more interesting, but that's technically a matter of taste.

Also, there have been a few studies on the effects of looking good. Good-looking women are more generous and equitable because they are treated well and they think that's how everyone is treated. Ugly women are treated like shit, and think that's the standard."

Knowing that I can't get out of his grip scares me because then I have to wait until his fun is over and I never wnated to be picked up in the first place.

"Boy have I got a story for you. This one dates back a few years ago to when I was still in school.

This girl who I was crazy about in high school ended up at the same university as me. I was not attractive and not very confident when I first met her but by the time university rolled around I was much better looking and got a back bone. I decided to chat her up, and we started talking pretty often.

One night I was at a club and I got a text from her telling me to come pick her up from another bar. Needless to say I stole my friend's car while I was wasted, drove across town, picked her up and drove her back to my place. We then sat on the couch in the living room and chatted with each other until my friends got back. 

She then told me she wanted to see my room. I really liked her, and my room was dirty, and said that she could see it next time after I clean it. She looked shocked and insisted she wanted to. I kept brushing off her requests. 

She then texted me and asked where I was sleeping that night. Realizing I was fucking things up, in my infinite wisdom I texted ""HAHA with you tonight lol."" She read the text, promptly got up, and left. 

And that was the last time we talked smh."

Guess who tends to have a that ratio in spades?  Petite women who have some curves on them."
"Most favorite, with female. Least favorite alone."
"Waxings cause baldtism.

...I'm tired leave me alone."
"* Has career goals and plans. Shows she has her own life goals and ambitions. 

* Has hobbies and passions in life. 

* Treats waiters/host people nicely and with respect. 

* Doesn't ask about prior relationships or partners. 

* Isn't asking for constant reaffirmation that I find her attractive. Doesn't need reassuring of her own self worth. 

* Can hold an intelligent conversation and can discuss even topics like politics with a level head without getting heated. 

* Likes or has a tolerance for sci fi/ nerdy things like video games and such. She doesn't have to be into it, just accepting and not condemning of it. "
"""Sleep well, exercise, and be social"" are great pieces of advice to a non-depressed, lazy and unmotivated person. However, someone that actually has clinical depression should not hear that advice first.

If you suspect you might have depression, but can't quite afford to see a psychiatrist or a therapist right away, you need to educate yourself on what the disease entails. 

The difficult thing about depression is that it arises for different reasons and manifests itself differently in each person. Reddit users that have very little, if no understanding of clinical depression can offer ""sleep better, exercise and be social,"" and it's nice of them to try, but the fact is that depression is far more complex.

My advice to you is this: start by reading articles, journals or books about depression, and really try to evaluate your own life. When was the onset of your depression? How long does the feeling last, and how often does it occur? What changes in your behavior can you identify? What areas of your life are different now, possibly because of depression? Do you still feel emotions? Do you ever think of suicide? These are all questions that you should consider. 

If you decide that you are definitely depressed and need help, ""sleep better, exercise and be social"" will not cut it for any depressed individual. The next thing you should do is see a therapist or a psychiatrist. If you really can't afford that, begin setting aside some money from each paycheck to go toward a ""Depression fund."" It sounds odd but depression can be a debilitating and fatal disease if left untreated, so you need proper treatment eventually. I'm sure there are some places that will give you free or highly discounted service as well, so maybe do some hunting and check out all the options.

I would also try as hard as you can to develop some sort of support system. Hopefully you're somewhat close with your parents/siblings/someone else, because fighting depression alone is almost always a lost cause. You need to reach out. 

I wish you the best of luck!"
Are you talking about a cat?
"People (including friends and people I just meet, both male and female) say I'm really great to be around with, that I'm easygoing, interesting and fun. 

Not a single girl was ever attracted to me romantically. "
"Very interesting to me is how a lot of guys in this thread mention being physically weaker as one of the things they're glad they don't have to deal with, while women generally don't cite being weaker as the issue, but cite the unwanted attention from males as the issue they don't like. Doesn't really matter, just found it interesting."
You don't want to be the guy she trusts enough to say no to - you want to be the guy she trusts enough to say yes to.
"I poked around his post history and he says he has aspergers. 

So you're probably not far off. "
"Man, I'll have a silent toast to you and your wife when I have my next beer. Here's to your happy memories together."
"I think specifically it's that *fear* of sexual assault that gets ingrained in women that we as men never have to deal with. I mean, I've sometimes been told to be careful on nights out in case somebody wants to fight me, but I've never had to deal with being warned against what I'm wearing, or who I'm going with, or to be super vigilant in case my drink gets spiked or anything like that. Given that women are, on average, smaller and weaker, the fear must hit home a lot harder than on guys."
"&gt; It used to hurt but now I really like the sensation.

Sure that isn't the masochism speaking?

They're squishy and sexy and pretty much ALWAYS staring you right in the face. How could you not?

"Sleep regular hours, get out of your house as often as possible, eat well and exercise. 

Talk to someone you trust abut your depression, a friend or relative, keeping it all to yourself is exhausting, I know. 

Basically make sure you don't end up fat lonely shut-in, because that's a one-way road to depression. "
"Fantasy novels.

There are a few mainstream ones like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, but there's so much more than that!"
"Q can also stand for Queer, which can kind of encompass everything but straight, which I think is fine. I also think it's fine to include people who are questioning their sexuality in the support network. It's not that its an explicit gender or sexual preference or anything like that. It's just that someone is figuring out who they are."
You deserve a certificate of Lady-bro.
"Commit a crime and tell no one, the constant guilt will eat away at you slowly, on the inside and out, giving you that edgy, paranoid look all the grills love."
"I'm a fan of PDA, but that being said, if it's only the three of you that's rude as fuck in my opinion. It's awkward when they're the only couple in the group, but if they're the *only other people period*, that's fucked.

I'd quickly stop hanging out with someone who pulled that move tbh. "
Emoticons and Unicode. Who needs emojis when you've got these mad symbols ‚òª‚òÖ‚ùÉ‚ôï 
"And yet still, we'll question if a girl is into us or not because in some cultures, that's just what you do when you're talking with someone."
"Also came here to say this. There's a hormonal shift, having to manage tampons, cramps, etc. It's all around awful. And as you said, its monthly, and can last an entire week or even longer. No fucking thanks!"
"Drinking coffee on the back porch with my cat, watching the golfers hit balls into my back yard and taunting them a bit. Same thing at the end of the day but grilling with a glass of red wine in hand. Not everyday but more often than not. "
I *almost* didn't cry during the montage in UP.
"Sober guy here.  I found my girlfriend on Tinder where I listed in my bio that I don't drink.  Although my girlfriend does drink, it didn't seem to deter women from matching with me, so I assume a few of those probably didn't drink as well."
Ideally she'd have big tits and ass and be skinny. I think men who like those features also like a little body fat overall. They don't like too much fat.
"As someone who picked up MRSA from gym equipment, I feel you should reconsider your reasoning."
Clearly you don't roll critical successes often.
I get my ass up and go do it because I am disciplined enough to follow through on things. Motivation is useless because it only lasts for a month.
And they completely missed the point of matrix. 
"Very much this, the surprise should be in the way and place you propose.. not the fact that youre proposing.  I'm oldschool, even got her parents permission before actually proposing.  Anything other then happy tears and ""welcome to the family"" and you should really think hard about this major life choice.  "

"Maybe I'm just petty and immature, but if a guy was going down on me and kept wiping me/his mouth because of my wetness, I would feel some sort of way (I think oral sex is gross, so this is all in theory). I know it doesn't taste like fried chicken or a chocolate milkshake (and i'm aware of that), but the idea of him acting like it's the best damn thing in the world is hot. It's more about your partner showing enthusiasm in their efforts to please you, and them being so turned on that they just can't get enough of the finished product, if you think of it that way.

"Because they're not taking a proactive role in dating and still think prince charming is going to come along on his white horse and sweep her off her feet. 

Mid 30s, mid 20s, whatever age you are, more women need to be more proactive with bettering their romantic lives instead of waiting for men to do all of the work. It's incredibly empowering choosing your partners instead of sitting back and waiting for whatever comes to you. This is why you (general you) get shit partners and wonder where all the ""good men"" have gone~"
"Got into medical school. 

Doctor/mentor I'd been volunteering with -- ""Holy shit, I guess they'll let in anyone these days!"" 

Me -- ""Yeah they probably made some kind of mistake."" 

He gave me a hug. 

The other physician I volunteered with watched and went through a mix of emotions. 

She dead panned ""I forgot that this was how men bond."" "

"My ex and I started dating right after my birthday. So she surprised me with a present on *her* birthday a few months later. She decided she wanted to spend her birthday celebrating mine too.

I've never met anyone as selfless."
Being arrested for NOTHING!!!
"I guess it could be taken that way, but that disorder tends to come with a lot of social baggage to unpack.

It's ok man. People thought I was a creepy piece of shit in middle and high school too and I'm neurotypical. You can overcome it."
Acceptance. Not being disgusted by your body. Being horny enough and wanting you enough to not care that she's swallowing spunk.

"&gt; Mental illness is not ""baggage"". It's a legitimate illness that needs actual treatment,

It's both.  It's literally and figuratively harder to have a healthy relationship with someone with a mental illness.

&gt;If that's considered ""baggage"" then so is cancer.

Most people don't want to start dating someone on chemotherapy, no."
"I'll piggyback off this comment because I had this realization a few weeks ago.

A friend and I went on a rather dangerous hike; a misstep during portions of it meant falling at least sixty (at certain points, a couple hundred) or more feet onto hard ground. In other words, if you fell, you're toast. 

I say this because I have dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts in a semi-regular basis throughout the past few years. On some of the ""near death"" legs of the hike, I had two big  realizations: one, I don't want to end it, and two, none of ""it"" really matters. 

We're all figuring it out as we go, and as long as you are enjoying yourself and being kind to others, you're doing just fine. Just enjoy the ride and relax, you'll end up where you want to be eventually. 

My two-cents of bro-philosophy for the day. "
"I've also seen many guys do this. It's so gross. I wipe down before and after.
