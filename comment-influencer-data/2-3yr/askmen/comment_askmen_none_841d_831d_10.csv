He probably lied to protect his ego from his erectile dysfunction. Don't sweat it. 
"Honestly those extra long fake nails. 

Not only they look bad/ugly it really makes me wonder how difficult you every day task must be."
"Okay, so when I was in college I was living with an Indian dude and he came into the sitting room one day and says he is now engaged. I was like ""holy fuck dude, what?"" and he told me his parents had arranged it all. He was really worried as much like you he had never met the girl, his family were quite old school and he wouldn't get to meet her all that much before the wedding.

His solution was to basically have ""dates"" twice a week with her on the phone. He'd ring her and they would talk, sometimes they would watch the same movie or TV show and just make fun of it etc. After a month or so they had gotten very comfortable talking with each and really started to get to know each other properly. It's been almost 15 years now and they are very happy together.

His wife told me once that the dates were great for her because it meants that when she discovered she had started to really look forward to them each time that she became far less nervous about the wedding and her future husband. "
"Talking about our sex life in detail. With guys the conversation is ""you hooked up with her? cool"" then we talk about sports.

I have heard extremely intimate details of what happened between us from their friends, and this has happened across many years and partners. "

"Unwillingness to talk about why she's upset. 

You know the whole ""I'm fine"" thing.

I tried being patient, and I tried pushing to see what was wrong, and I tried convincing her I couldn't fix or make write a problem I didn't know I caused, and I tried taking ""I'm fine"" in the literal sense. 

None of that worked. Problems just didn't get dealt with and escalated to WAY bigger than they needed to and what could have been a simple fix either ended in a fight or me feeling shitty. 

I just won't deal with that kind of emotional immaturity again. Lying to me by saying thinks are okay when they aren't is not okay. Refusing to deal with a problem is not okay. I get it if she needs time to process or to think up what she's going to say, or cool down first, or if it's just not an appropriate time to talk about it but that needs to be communicated. A simple ""we'll talk about it later"" or something is perfect."
"There is a time and place. He failed at both. Being upset about that seems quite normal to me. I would probably have been quite pissed if it all happened in the middle of an act. 

So how would I have wanted the girl to react? I would never have done that as I wouldn't ever have wanted that happen to me. If anything I would have told her the next day or something if I had to tell her at all. 

There there. The internet is here to give you free hugs and validation and saying that you are good just the way you are. 

Edit: spelling and grammar. "
"That women can be oddly comfortable talking about anything to another woman, even if they've known each other for a few days. Seriously, I've known some women that told some serious deep stuff to another woman many would consider an acquaintance at most.

That many women can jump from friend to friend and consider them 'best friends', even though they've known each other for probably 6 months or so. 

Witnessing women taking selfies of themselves, and the many takes they do to get that one good picture, while being completely oblivious to their surroundings."
 Grabbing my chest to feel me up. Though if I'm being honest this is directly related if I find you attractive or not. 
The puppy dog filter.
"Humiliating a girl and demeaning her so much while I fuck her that she starts to cry and I just keep fucking her. Then I fuck her in the ass for extra insult and injury. Cum inside her and then she cuddles me and tells me she loves me and begs me never to leave her. 

Edit: I had a friends with benefits once in my life that I had this kind of relationship with. Best sex I'll ever have and I keep searching for it still. It drove me wild, the control I had over her.

The smallest thing like telling her to go grab me a glass of water would make me rock hard, just from the obedience. She really did love me and I used her. She knew I was using her though and she got off on it. She's the one that got me into choking. While laying in bed together after sex once she meekly said to me ""you know you can choke me harder...if you want"" and that was like my green light to turn it up a notch.

Her subservience made me an animal. I pushed her boundaries every time we were together. I learned what words really struck at her core and made her start tearing up. I learned how to slap her just hard enough in the face to shock her. I wasn't trying to play those silly bedroom spanking games, this was real punishment.

I punished her for being late, for not wearing the earrings I told her to wear, for talking back to me at work (we worked together)...for whatever fucking reason I felt like it but always real. Always a behaviour I wanted to curb in her and she ate it up. She'd always ask me what she should wear, she's defer to me in all decisions, she asked my permission to use the washroom and permission to get a cup of fucking water. It was intense. We were basically in foreplay for every single minute we were together. If I ever gave her that serious look in public, dropped my voice and spoke sternly she knew exactly what it meant. I could be telling her to go wait in line for our food or to go bring the car out front...whatever it was she knew she'd better fucking do it. But don't think she didn't take advantage of being in public to disobey me.

She'd smile sometimes and say ""no"" in this really bratty voice that she knew pissed me off. Even during sex she'd do that just to rile me up. I'd tell her to touch my dick and make it hard and she'd say ""no"" and smile and bite her lower lip. Which immediately made me pin her to the wall by her throat and force her hand to my cock by gripping her wrist, at which point she'd finally oblige.

I'd play with her heart. While fucking her from behind in the bathroom I'd pull her hair and force her to look in the mirror and tell her ""look at us..."" then I'd kiss her neck...""don't we look good together baby? Don't we make a nice couple?"" and I'd keep thrusting and kissing her neck gently. Then suddenly I'd lift her onto the counter and bark orders at her...""open your fucking legs...that's a good girl...give me that fucking pussy...this is what you're good for sweety, you know that? You're good for fucking, you're only here to make me cum, you're a little whore"" and that's when her face would turn red and I'd start to get really hard so I pushed her some more. ""You know this is what you're good for right?"" She'd nod her head, almost about to cry. ""I just want to make you happy"" she'd say to me. I'd then grab her hard by the face and say ""that's not what I fucking asked you. What are you good for?"" She'd look away and then barely able to contain a whimper she'd reply ""I'm good for fucking"" and then I'd loosen my grip and start going slower, and I'd hold her face gently and say ""there's my good girl, that wasn't so hard. You're my obedient little girl. I love you sweety"" and I'd fuck her gently before starting all over again.

Don't even get me started on fucking her in the ass. I have a decent sized dick so that shit hurt. But I was gentle there. I didn't want to tear anything or seriously injure her. The hottest thing was one time she brought lube. This was after I had already fucked her in the ass with that same lube but at her place and it really hurt her. I was surprised she brought it because I didn't think we'd do it again so soon after and when she saw my surprise she said meekly ""well I thought you might want to fuck me in the ass again..."" The subservience was unreal. That she'd do anything to please me. I got hard immediately.

You just have to find your sexual equal I guess."
Have her and your mom go shopping at like target or something benign where there's cheap jewelry. Mom can browse different rings and try things on. Maybe girlfriend will join in and then mom can keep an eye on which ones fit best. I don't know. Just an idea.

"We got married in a park, we never actually recce'd it, we just drove past it once and agreed to get married under the big gazebo.

Fast forward to the wedding day, it's noon and I'm standing there, with the priest, photographer, all of my side, and a few of hers. But half of the wedding is missing including the bride. I get a call from her; turns out that she was under the pergola which to her is just another gazebo but to me is a very different structure. So all of her side come jogging across the park to where I'm set up and she's walking in behind them. 

That was my favourite moment, the fact that she didn't even blink or care that our wedding was already late and in the wrong spot. She could have gone complete bridezilla but laughed it off and got married. "

"Over-romanticizing a person to which the person in real life and the person in their head are very different people with very different interests. A lot of women I know do this, where they have a continual romantic fantasy about a particular person and don't find anything weird about it. For example my first girlfriends already had a detailed design of how I am as a person before I even knew they liked me, and then got deeply upset or frustrated when it turned out that I'm not the sweet prince that they perceive me to be in their minds. Its very off putting.

EDIT:
For the record I'm well aware that both genders do this, however based on my experience and observation it seems to be something that a lot of young women do that they are unaware of."

I'm actually weirded out and sort of worried how this will play out. I've brought it up with a few people but they just laughed it off and said she's being cute. She literally followed me to the bathroom last Friday night when we were out. 

**E**: This is something that got a lot of attention. The thing is I have to be very careful. In a workplace you have to see people every day and in the past I've fucked things up. I'm being careful, not being alone with her, ignoring her for the most part and never showing interest. I've heard of horror stories that start like this and I don't want to brashly reject her and her feel resentment over me. Because you never know how someone can react. And sure the horror stories may be rare but I'm not going to be a part of one because one accusation can ruin your life. "
"My wife and I were both athletes when we were younger, but after our youngest child turned 9 months old or so and life was back to normal, my wife told me that she was no longer comfortable with the state her body was in and that she wanted to get some procedures done. My response was, ""I heard plastic surgery is really painful and results aren't totally certain. Let's clean up our diets and hit the gym hard for a year and see how you feel then.""

Well, that was a lot of years ago, and we're still on the health/fitness track. The surgeries never happened, and we both look great. I am super attracted to her and her figure is better than a lot of women who are half her age, or less. And she's kinkier now, so sex is really a lot of fun at this point.

So, yeah, I'm as attracted to her as I've ever been, and I wouldn't want her to change a thing!"

We worked on math for a bit, but it was super obvious she knew everything and really didn't need my help. We chatted and had fun, but it was frustrating that she didn't need math help. So we killed time until my mom came to pick me up.

Being the oblivious fucking moron that I am, years later, my mother informed me that this girl had a massive crush on me and that the math homework was just a ruse to get me to come over. I was flabbergasted and went through the five stages of grief pretty damn quickly.

"1. No female friends  
2. Called other women sluts 
3. Didn't trust any other women
4. Very insecure about herself 

She had trust issues to say the least. 

I should have seen the signs but everything else about her was perfect. I just wanted things to work out and she was the only person who I wanted to actually have a future with. 

In the end she physically and emotionally abused me for over a year, the relationship ended not because I mustered up the courage to leave her but because she got herself arrested. 

She called the cops on me a lot. She used it as leverage. 

"" if you leave me I'll tell them you hit me"" 

We use to get into a fight, she would call the cops and tell them some bullshit excuse. Use to make me answer the door and just tell them we were having a fight and nothing is going on. The cops would usually tell us calm down or give us a 5 minute therapy lesson and then leave. 

One day she went to far. I had bruises on my face and cuts on my arm from her engagement ring. I was in the fetal position covering my face while she kept hitting me. 

This time when the cops came to the door I answered it and she was screaming at me from across the house calling me an ""asshole"" and a "" lair"". 

Cops came in the house and asked to talked to her, they took her to the cop car and a few minutes later they drove off. 

I don't know what she said, I don't know if she confessed, I honestly have no idea why they took her away. 

I eventually made my statement and that was the nail in the coffin, they arrested and charged her. 

I never got closure, I opted to not press charges but it didn't matter, the RCMP did anyways, and because of that their was a restraining order. I never talked to her again. 

I was 20 years old at the time 6'3 and 180lbs, I was in the best shape of my life and she was 25  5'3 and 120lbs. 

I don't tell anybody what really happened, I just say we broke up. 

My mental health has never recovered, I've been to therapy and prescribed every pill their Is by doctors. 

I've been diagnosed as having anxiety, depression and PTSD. Ive found no comfort in going to therapy and being called a victim. I reject any diagnoses I've been given and refuse to take medication. 

I don't want help from others and am ashamed of my mental health, however  I am winning the fight, everyday Is getting better and I'm to fucking stubborn to give up. No diagnoses in the world will stop me from persevering.

"I've had many breaking points but this was the last one, which ended the relationship. There were many fights where she repeaditly told me to get hit by a car on my way to work, or she hoped I died. she fought like a manipulative narcasist and it drove me crazy. Then one argument I turned around and walked away because she was just ranting without breathing. Then she ripped a door out of its hinges, in my parents' apartment.

"Well it was a mix of during and after. 

During the honeymoon phase she talked about her ex, and complained about sex. ""He wanted it *all the time*""

A few months later, all I was getting was a grudging handjob every 2 weeks. Once I tried initiating and she said ""oh, *all right*"" in this exasperated tone. "

"Contour that is over the top. Like we can see layers and layers of make up but it makes your skin worse so you use MORE make up to cover it up. Contour and make up in itself is okay,(great even) I just think the whole cake face thing is really unattractive.
It also means I'll probably be waiting an hour plus anytime there's something that requires getting ready for which is just exhausting on a regular basis."

"Luckily I'm happily married and not planning on changing that anytime soon. But I were to abruptly go back on the market, I'd say that ""dependence"" would be a deal-breaker. 

I had exes that would basically expect me to plan everything all the time. And would also want me along on every social engagement, like they were uncomfortable going alone. For example, I was on vacation with an ex and we were talking about going out to eat. I stopped to consult a map and after a moment she said ""well are we just going to *stand* here?"" Also once we had a ""guys' night out"" and she asked why she couldn't come along. "
"I'm fairly sure it's a conversation with her best friends about me (or a crush/hookup/whatever). Something in the lines of

"Back in 2005 I was in NYC for college.  My first semester I met this cool goth chick from Argentina.  We got along well, and were in that awkward ""clearly we are crushing but one of us is in a relationship so we will pretend like we are just friends""  stage.  

Anyways, she invites me out one night to a club.  She always talks about how she loves dancing and going out.  I tell her I'd love to go but just had my fake confiscated a few weeks ago.  She tells me not to worry, she knows the owner and he is fine with serving underage because he doesn't believe in societies rules.

Alright, in retrospect that was a red flag but I was 18, looking to drink and party, so why not?  Saturday night rolls around, I throw on some jeans and a button down from Pacsun because that was what passed for ""fancy going out clothes"" at that age.  She tells me to meet her downtown and gives me the address.  I am walking from the subway towards the address, and notice it seems very desolate and industrial.  I had done some searching and found out the area we are going to is called the ""Meat packing District"".  

Anyways, I get to the street corner and see my friend there with her b/f,  They are both fully Goth-ed out.  All black and red everything, make up, etc.  The b/f is clearly upset at my dress.  I'm wearing a white button down with some weird floral print design on the back, that's also in white.  White on white.  He makes a comment about me not being dressed right, and my friend, Angela, says I should be ok, and ""he won't care if we vouch for him.""

We walk down and alley, knock on some random door, a password is given, and we walk down some stairs into a dingy basement.  And all of a sudden, I feel like an extra from *Blade* who didn't go to wardrobe before the shoot.  It's a Vampire Club.  A fucking Vampire club. I'm surrounded by people with cat shaped contact lenses, black lipstick,  bright neon dreadlocks.  I stick out like a sore thumb, and everyone is noticing.  Angela, her bf, and I start walking towards the back.  We are led into some VIP area, and it's all velour couches, candelabras, etc.  I'm introduced to some guy, whose name I want to say was like ""Father Sebastian"" or something.  He calls me ""young one"", asks if im ""fresh blood"", and welcomes me to his club, telling me to enjoy my ""earthly desires"".

I'm given a drink, so I'm trying to relax. Angela gives me the run down.  Father Sebastian is one of two guys who run the Vampire scene in NYC.  Sebastian though allows all types of Vamps in his clubs.  There are ""Psychic Vamps"" who drain Aura from their victims.  And those who actually drink blood.  The other clubs won't allow ""blood play""  but Sebastian does. Angela and her bf engage in blood play only with each other.  But some people will engage with anyone.  Apparently some people believe being vampire, they are immune to blood borne diseases like HIV and Hepatitus.  Angela and her b/f don't buy into it all that much, and just enjoy the culture so they only engage with each other and have been tested.  

I speak a bit with some others, try to be nice and engaging.  Eventually there are these two women who have been hanging with us, and one asks if I would let her feed on me.  She needs my aura.  I tell her no thanks, I don't really believe any of this so I don't feel like engaging.  She smirks and tells me that she's a vampire and I won't have a choice.  She then starts running her hands over my head, saying that my aura is giving her life. I smack her hand away, and Sebastian got upset.  He asks if I would be upset at a wolf for eating me if I wandered into it's den.  I asked if he would just sit there and be eaten if he wandered into a wolves den.  He responded with ""they wouldn't, we are all creatures of the night"".  Which was, apparently, hysterical to everyone in his inner circle.  I stood up, told Angela I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, and left. "
"I agree, but I still don't think its right. Because by that logic when the relationship ends, they're no longer close to you therefore they should tell everyone, every little thing that happened in the relationship. Which is pretty awful.

There should at the base line be some code of honour or something."
"Used to be in IT for a school district. Part of my position was leading high school student techs (think service desk level stuff). Ended up leaving for greener pastures, but found out that the students loved me, and a number wanted to hang out anyways. Ended up starting a DnD session, playing pool, some other stuff. Ended up having one of my former students kiss me. Put the kebash on that for ethical reasons, but if we're being honest, my fantasy? That. She's over the age of consent, and within the 1/2 + 7 rule, so it's not as bad as it could be, buuuuuuut it's a fairly small town, and I'd rather not open that can of worms right now..."
I was unaware that uggs were supposed to be attractive. I just assumed they were super comfy like sweatpants for feet.

The how? I kind of wonder about this sometimes. Each had different methods but they all started with a moment of clarity that I needed to stop. From there it just took hard dedication to stop. It doesn't get easy but it does get easier."

"Define revealing. My girlfriend is stacked so a lot of stuff she wears isn't designed to be cleavagey but on her it is. Some styles of cloths just sit a little...sexier on some women than on others due to their body type. A curvy girl in a wrap around dress will look nearly x-rated where as a slim petite girl in the same dress wouldn't.

However, if she's wearing next to nothing and is doing it for male attention I'd be annoyed. But that'd just a sign of far bigger problems in the realtionship. "
"I caught myself doing that the other weekend. Some guy was talking to me and without even thinking my hand was on his chest while he was talking. He didnt seem to mind. In fact he seemed quite ok with it. However, it occured to me how upset I would be had he been causally touching me like that. Realized I am a hypocrite and should pay better attention to my hands."

"Undiagnosed or untreated mental illness - if you're not willing to deal with your issues, I'm not either.

Lack of willingness to communicate her feelings in a reasonable or mature way - I don't want kids, and I don't want to date people that act like them.

Lack of accountability for her behavior - If everything is everyone else's fault, there's a fundamental lack of self-awareness there that I want nothing to do with."

"Get a match out of 20-30 swipes right.

Get ghosted 7-8 out of 10 matches.

Of those 2-3 conversations that prospered, if you're lucky, maybe one of them will give you her number.

You think you're done? Now try to sound appealing on whatsapp even though you've never met and you're out of things to talk about because you used them to get their number, and try to get a date.

All of this while not crushing under the depressing thought of how many girls are ignoring you.

And this is me that I'm fairly attractive and charming enough to get a couple dates out of tinder. I do not want, for a second, to think what it might be for an average looking guy.

Fuck.That. Just go out with your friends and hit on a girl while you're both drunk, it is so much easier.

"Wasn't so much physically abusive as it was emotionally. She'd go out of her way to make me jealous, gaslit me a few times, and generally did what ever she could to make feel unwanted but just valuable enough to keep stringing myself along. My breaking point was the fact that for almost a year I tried to make things better and ultimately got nothing out of it. I still felt like shit, felt like I'd never have any sort of value to a woman, and ever thing I asked for wasn't even met with compromise. It was that point that it really hit me. She didn't want me to be happy. All that mattered to her was that i was hers and there no way I wouldn't appeal at every turn to her. "
"I really enjoy sewing. Anyone can do a button, but it takes skill to do decent alterations.

I do like to run and stay in shape so I know I look ok but I haven't been in the dating pool for a while because of many reasons.

I kind of sat back in my chair, looked around the empty house with no cats, dogs or wife anymore and just started craving companionship. "

"I volunteer at a place where you ride a bicycle with people with special needs. So I was riding with an autistic guy, and he kept asking me if I have a girlfriend, and when I said that I don't he repeatedly asked me why not, and if I want to have one. Each time he asked hurt a bit more.
A few weeks later I was riding with him again, but he didn't recognize me shaved so I had to answer those questions again, this time I was more prepared mentally though."

"Men want a woman with curves, bones are for dogs.


It's not so much the phrase itself. I'll agree that I don't really want an extremely underweight woman. My problem is that it is often used to deride thin women or fit women, or to justify a woman being extremely overweight. You rarely see a fit woman talking about how men want a woman with ""meat on her bones"". It seems to usually come from a very overweight or obese woman. "
"I'm a big believer in the right to protest. If I encounter a group of protesters blocking a roadway I'll be irritated and assume that they're morons but wait for everything to pass and move on with my life.

"Why are you all calling them failed relationships? 

Dating is *mostly* about finding out if you and other person are good enough matches for the long haul. If you find out you aren't, you end the relationship, not because you or they failed, but because you aren't that kind of match. 

Imagine moving to a big city because you're tired of rural farm town life. You have 3 great years living it up, but eventually you decide you enjoyed life better in farm town so you pack up and move back. Was it a failed move? No, you had fun, learned something about yourself and about life on the other side, and decided you wanted something different. It wasn't failure, it was growth. "

"We're both pretty lonely, since we went through breakups (him more recently). He said that he hadn't tried to do anything since his breakup, and I think he was trying to give casual sex a go.

"This is gonna cause some REEEEing from the ""just be confident"" crowd, but: being unattractive is a creepiness multiplier. Not just facial ugliness but also things like height, weight, race, poor fashion, etc. The more unattractive you are, the more likely any action you take toward the girl will be interpreted as unsettling and creepy. A lot of guys really don't know that.

For example take [this gif](https://i.imgur.com/KsjPJ0i.gifv). She seemed slightly startled and a little amused by what the guy did. Now imagine if he had looked like [this](https://afewminuteswith.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/indian-computer-nerd.jpg).

It guarantees you have something to talk about, lets you introduce her to books you like and could be a god starting point for other conversations. Or  switch it out for a TV show or music ..."
"After months of mental abuse, she turned physical (again) last night. Came back drunk at 12:30am with a fresh bottle of Captain Morgans. Extremely aggressive. Screaming outside the house, woke up all the neighbors. Inside screaming, back outside screaming, inside screaming, back outside screaming. I stayed in my back room with the door braced, didn't respond, and got it all on audio. I broke when She threatened to break or steal everything in the house if she couldn't play her music cranked up to 11 at 1:30am. I shut it down and she tried to grab my phone from my hand (""I'll fuckin' break it""). Started swinging at me and kicked me a few times, and then fell over a trash bag of her stuff and went screaming out the door to the neighbors about how I'm beating her. Then comes back and starts kicking in the front door screaming at me to open it or she'll break the glass in it.

I was supposed to be at work today, but the cops were here until 3am.

I gave her every chance in the book. Let her scream out her frustrations at me with no response. I'm already moving out, plans are set, I don't care what she says. But the stuff she threatened to break while I'm at work for 8 hours, is valued at about $10,000. Plus I have my animals here, and no longer trust her mental state to not cause them harm.

So I'm off to the courthouse soon for a PFA. "
"After about 1 year of hitting and slapping me, cutting herself and saying she would commit suicide if I Ieft, later I got news of her sleeping around with others. I confronted her,  she cried said she was depressed and not her fault.  I dumped her right there,  and she broke a vodka bottle over my neck when I had turned around,  she also knew that due to an older injury I can if I am unlucky get paralyzed from a hit on the neck.

They're 100% concerned with my education and career path, and whether or not I'm happy and making friends, but they don't dig into my sex life like that.

"All women on there want the top 5-10% of men. They all believe they can get that tier of men too. It's where the whole ""I'm an overweight 25 year old single mother that demands a perfect man"" cringe posts you see on reddit come from. A lot of those upper tier guys will be totally fine to fuck one of the average/below average women too, and that makes those women believe that they can date said person, when that same guy would never in a billion years date them or often even be seen in public with them. I've done it, I'll admit it. But that same women now has it convinced that she deserves a top tier dude since she was able to fuck one, and she rejects anything below that. It's why you hear about almost all men having 0 success on tinder, and then a few men that have fucked 20+ women thru tinder."
"I have not met a single guy who likes the high waisted shorts/pants look. At best they show off that you have good hips and slim stomach while wearing your mom's pants from the 80's. The worst can be... shudder.

"I didn't own rings before an engagement ring. They based it off my mom's ring size. Most women I've known needed to get their ring re-sized, so I wouldn't stress about it being perfect. "
"Being upset after sex.

Let me preface with, I last too long which honestly has been more of a nightmare than a blessing like most people would imagine at first.

So three of my previous relationships would always get upset because it would take me awhile to finish, one would cry after everytime saying I didn't find her attractive. I cant do that anymore.

My current SO, before we did anything I was completely honest with her and let her know im not kidding, she was super understanding and our sex life is pretty awesome.

"In the abstract, it's wrong, but I find myself unable to give a fuck in real life. It's not that big of a deal to me, mostly because I'm not really interested in seeing Wonder Woman. Maybe I'll torrent it in a year if it turns out to be good."
"It's not the want for a highlight reel to remember, I take a lot of photos and love having them for memories.  It's the faking of a highlight reel for social status, many of the photos are just lost in the sea of instagram.

If this is someone's true highlight reel, they have some serious identity issues.  Because they aren't trying to live life, they are attempting to become the personification of zeitgeist.

Instagram has had some recent studies that revealed it might be the most harmful SNS.  Feeding mental disorders like depression, anxiety and narcasism."

"I'm a big fan of aromatherapy — but not in the therapeutic sense. I just like when the room (car, bathroom, etc) smells nice.

"If someone tells you you have a problem for wanting sex more than once a week, more than just your sexual compatibility has gone sour.

Her attempt at pathologizing your completely normal libido speaks of a lack of sane argument. By making this about your ""problem"" and your ""aberration"", she can avoid having to challenge her own position, or to work on the issue together.

Sit her down and tell her that you won't play the blame game she's trying to set up, that she can stop trying to shame your sexuality any second now, and that you're willing to work on it together if she is. And ""it"" is far more than just your diverging libidoes - first of all, you need to address your conflict management. Her for trying to paint you a freak when you don't want as she wants, and you for running to reddit for confirmation.

Finally, if she doesn't respond to goodwill, pull back emotionally as needed."
"My girlfriend ends up befriending a hot but dumb submissive girl, the sub girl is crazily attracted to me and her, and both my girlfriend and I use her as if she's just an object and not a person. I end up doing things like kissing my girlfriend goodnight while facefucking the other chick or forcing her to sleep in a basket or things like that."
"That's cool. Everyone has different boundaries.

However, I personally think it's totally normal to know why a romantic partner's past relationships haven't worked out - and I do mean in reasonable detail. If a person can't have a serious discussion about why relationship A wasn't right and what they learned from it (about themself, about relationships in general, about their needs), I'm going to lack confidence in their ability to identify those things and be able to work constructively in the context of our relationship. I value the ability to reflect on past experiences and apply lessons to the present, and that's a really important indicator to me that a person can do that - particularly if they're aware of their own failings or role in the relationship ending.

I'm sensitive to privacy concerns but I think those discussions can be had without unduly breaching the ex partner's expectations of privacy."

Edit: they also went to a restaurant after that while I went home to develop the RAWs and study by myself. That day was flooded with feels

Edit 2: for anyone telling me to end the relationship, it's a problem since we're classmates and I can't just stop seeing her.
Also, she's my only friend (I don't even have guy friends, except for a few that I see once a month or two), ending it means I will be even more lonely.
And last thing, she's thinking about leaving her bf, so I might try my luck when I think it's the right time and hope that we will stay friends if she says no. At least then I could explain why I refuse to take pics of them kissing."

"I would agree if it was on the arm and I would be ok with that (which I am, I am a touchy feely type person) but this was on his chest and stomach region. Had he casually reached out and touched my hip I would have been taken aback. I felt ok doing it because he was a guy. It was ok in my head solely because he was a guy and I was a girl. That's hypocritical.  I wasn't even aware I was doing it. I literally called myself out on it once I noticed it and apologized and he said he didn't mind and leaned into it. Had he been doing it to a girl he would have looked like a creep, but I got a pass because I was a girl.  Grand scheme he didn't mind so no harm done, but it made me more aware of my hand placements.

"I'm glad someone finally had the nerve to ask this question. If you find yourself in a fight with a woman and you have to go down on her, you're not going to be able to resort to the same desperate methods you could when fighting a man. Women don't have testicles or a penis and, while they may have thicker thighs, their knees, ankles and shins are all vulnerable to attack. Any blow you can land below the belt on a woman can also easily knock them off balance as they are very top-heavy in most cases. There is a grading scale for a woman's top-heaviness, usually A to DD. Either make a judgement yourself or ask them before the fight begins where they fall on this scale; since women are usually very nice, they often will tell you."

"I consider myself pretty manly. I work in construction, I'm into combat sports and I like cooking meat over fire.

I don't know if this is effeminate or not but I have a problem with killing things. I mean like anything (aside from weeds in my lawn). Rodents, bugs, spiders, fish. Never been able to do it. I'll actually go to the trouble of trapping a spider just so I can let it be free outside. 

I'm a meat eater too, which sort of makes me hypocritical. I like to think that when it came down to it I could kill if it was the only way of providing food for my family. Not that I'd even have a clue how to hunt. I do have a basic knowledge of fishing though. 

I don't know why I'm like this. Never met anyone with the same issue either. "
Wife and girlfriend? That's too much bullshit.
"This isn't necessarily true... I dated a girl who I thought of as physically unattractive but we got along great, and I saw no other reason not to date her.  After a while, It became harder and harder to force it, and sex became difficult.  I had the best of intentions when I started, but there was no way at that point to be honest and not hurt her feelings.  The guy's timing was shit, to be sure, and you all may be right in that he was lashing out as a means of covering ED, but that's not 100% guaranteed to be the case like most here are assuming.  He might legit not have been attracted to you as you might have thought.  Men are capable of feeling a non-physical connection and wanting to manifest that sexually."

Dumbass me thought she meant she liked guys with nice asses.  I soon broke up with her out of sexual frustration.   It never dawned on me until years later what she was really saying, and to this day decades later I still kick myself for being such a fucking moron.  "

"She is a doctor. She had just finished a 24 hour shift. One might say it was not the best time, because she was almost sleeping (spoiler alert: she was wide awake a few moments later), but I couldn't wait any longer. 3 days had passed since I bought the ring.

Long story short, I called her, when she was on the way home, I said that I want to hang out. She came outside my house, I told her to get in the car, I got breakfast and coffee from our favorite (shop? how do you call these things?) and I drove all the way to a secluded forest in a hill near the city we live in.

I waited till we finished the breakfast and the coffee, in order for her to be somewhat more awake. I listened to her crazy stories from the hospital, (to be honest I wasn't listening, I was on auto-pilot, because I was kind of nervous), I put on the car stereo ''Wet Sand'' by Red Hot Chili Peppers, that she loves and told her ''We might have to go to (name of the city where I bought the ring)''. She asked me surprised ''Why?''. And I say ''Well I think it will be a little big for you and we might have to re-size it.'' (yeah rookie mistake, but I didn't want to borrow a ring from her 'cause I didn't want her to notice. She goes like ''WHAT?'' and I say ''Do you want to be my girl forever?'' She says ''Of course!'' and starts crying haha.

Anyway this is a long comment. I don't even know if you guys care, but someone asked, so here you are! We are both very happy and very lucky. I hope you find such a good teammate for  the best game ever called life. Or Witcher 3....naaah life. I don't know both are great"

"we're good.  happily married, and she's been cancer-free for over ten years, which puts her risk back down to the general population."
"Don't confuse introverted with passive. 

The answer is to go after what you want. In my group of friends it's about a 50/50 split between men doing the approaching and women doing it. You'd probably argue that the guys who got approached are the more attractive guys.

This doesn't mean you need to walk up to a crush, push him into a chair and straddle him but it does mean you'll get more success if you go and talk to him instead of batting your eyelids at him over a coffee whilst other girls swoop instead (and they almost always will given enough time)."

"I've posted this elsewhere so I'll just copy paste it.

My best friends mom was a model most of her life and this is what she told me in highschool.

""That absolutely gorgeous girl that you have no shot with because she is way out of you league? Go for her. Because everyone else things that same thing or is too intimidated by her looks to approach her so she is probably single. If she shoots you down because of her looks then you're lucky​ you found out her personality sooner.""

She also brought me to photo shoots to force me to spend a lot of time around attractive woman. Learned how to be comfortable and myself around them.

Morning after a friend's wedding
"Right after. We were done cleaning up, and we were heading back to our hotel, and I realized I had forgotten to pack shorts and a shirt to wear home the next day. We stopped at Walmart, and it was raining. We ran through the parking lot in our wedding clothes, and we picked up some clothes for me. Including socks. No one seemed to pay us any attention, surprisingly. "
"She would make a list about things wrong with me. Things I should fix about myself in order for her to stay with me, and shove that in my face everytime we had an argument. Everytime I opened up to her about my emotions and how I felt during an argument she would tell me those feelings were wrong. That I was full of shit for feeling that way, and the way she felt was the absolute truth. Bringing me to a point where I was emotionally inarticulate to my friends and family even after we had broken up. 
&amp;nbsp; 

I hope this was a decent elaboration, since I find it difficult to put my thoughts into words. "
"I'm going to be honest, for me that would make an attractive guy suddenly unattractive "
"When I was  about eight years old, I went to a good friends house after school to play board games. His mom is doing her thing, working on something in the kitchen while my friend and I were playing in his bedroom. 

Anyway, while I'm there, his dad comes home and because the door is open, I can hear that he's pretty angry. Friend's mom is yelling, he's yelling at the top of his lungs and then I walk out in the hallway to see friend's dad grab her by the hair and slam her head into the wall while she's wailing in fear. Friend immediately grabs my hand and pulls me back in the room and shuts the door really quickly. Meanwhile, I hear more thumps and other sounds in the corridor and I....couldn't process what was happening. All my friend said was ""They'll stop in a while, don't go out""

So what was a fun afternoon session of playing ludo and snakes and ladders turned into a very awkward situation of me and him being held hostage of sorts in his room while a domestic violence situation played out. Up until that point, I had never ever even *seen* a man and a woman fight, so I had this mixture of ""ooh, a new thing"" and the gut feeling that this was also very, *very* wrong. 

After about an hour, the front door slammed and about half an hour after that, I could just hear the muffled sounds of sobbing through the shut door. My friend gives me the okay, I open the door slightly and slowly make my way to the door and I see her sitting on the floor near the door, hair a mess, very gaunt looking and puffy-eyed. She sees me and there was this flash of horror on her face and she puts on this smile and goes ""Did you have fun with &lt;friend's name&gt;? Come again, okay? I'll make some cupcakes!"" 

I should've asked her whether she was okay, but I was just eight, I didn't know how to process what happened, so I just stammered out a ""Goodbye aunty"" and left. 

I told my parents everything I saw that night and they went there the next evening. I don't know what happened after that because they refuse to talk to me about it, but shortly thereafter the family moved away. The most my parents told me was that they'd divorced, but that's it. 

I wonder where that boy is, sometimes, because I wish I could find out if he and his mom are okay. "

"[5 tips for good oral sex](http://www.laweekly.com/news/5-tips-for-performing-outstanding-cunnilingus-2530968).

The most important tips from the above link are: 

&gt;Please stop pointing your tongue. We don't want to name names, but lots of people out there go straight for sword-tongue when they start giving a woman head. Please do not do that.

&gt;There's nothing worse than when your partner has found a really super rhythm with you, they're licking away, and then suddenly they decide that because you're so into it they should start going as fast and hard as humanly possible just when you're about to come. Instead, if you're doing something that has your woman writhing with pleasure, just fucking keep doing it.

&gt;If what you learned in high school is that forming the letters A-Z with your tongue is the way to make a woman come, I regret to tell you that you've been woefully misinformed."

"Involves 2 coworkers who are dating. Guy walks in on his woman and I fucking in their bed, but instead of getting mad he just sits down and watches. I move her to face him while taking her doggy and hold her head up by her hair and tell her to look into his eyes as I fuck her. We cum together, I pull out and tell him to come over and lick his woman's juices off my cock to get me ready for round 2. "
He probably would have been arrested and not her.
"I wonder how common it is for dads to want their sons to get laid?

I remember when I turned 17 and I hadn't had sex yet my dad was really concerned about it. I ended up dating a freshman girl that year and he was really intense about me fucking her. At the time I felt like he was worried I might be gay or something.

To say he was happy when the girl and I finally fucked would be an understatement."
"Cheap furniture.

When I graduated and got my first apartment I bought nicer stuff thinking it's what real adults do and I'd have it for years to come.  However, after two cross-country moves in five years and living in different sized apartments where some certain pieces wouldn't fit and all that I still have is my mattress (not my bed, just my mattress) and a high top bar table.  Wait until you get settled then buy the nice leather sectional since you know how big your doorframe is and it'll stay that way."
"I hate when Women that have no job, education, or goal to live a good life &amp; then say all men want is sex.

Whenever everyone is comfortable with it. So long as you aren't leading her on and it stays strictly platonic it's fine. 
"The uncontrollable changes in her appearance - grey hair, for example - don't bother me.  I've got some too.

The controllable changes might bother me, if she wasn't keeping them under control.  She probably doesn't weigh but 10 pounds more than she did the day we met, she's careful with sunscreen, and so on.  We both eat clean and healthy, and we get exercise together, and I think that's made a difference too.

If she wanted to add some new workout, or tweak the diet a bit, that'd be fine.  I wouldn't want her to get surgery, though.  Surgery is a huge deal, getting your body chopped up, and it seems nuts to do it unless you have to.

A bigger deal, though, is that we've been married a long time and have grown together on the inside.  If all you had was a picture, she's not as sexy as she was at 23 anymore.  But I've got way more than a picture; she knows where all of my buttons are and she likes to press them.  She knows what things to whisper in my ear and get my motor running, she knows exactly how to make me moan out loud with just a touch, and I know all that stuff about her.  So when we have alone time, we have a good time together, every time.  If she gained an extra ten pounds, that wouldn't really have any effect on what she knows and the skills she's gained.  And in another ten years, I'll still know just exactly what to say to her to make her breathe funny and what to do to make her dig her fingernails into my back, and I intend to keep doing all of that and more.

"Something some girls do, and which I find genuinely creepy, is always trying to get a rise out of you. It varies from straight up insulting, to being dismissive of what I say, to taking everything as an insult, as far fetched as it may be. All this  combined then with flirting. It's very manipulative and not even with a good outcome for anyone. The only possible course of action is to stay away from them. 

Edit:
For clarity. This is not something i have seen many women do. Most women I know are really normal and cool. Only a few girls I know do this to different degrees. Those girls are creepy and I take measures to avoid seeing them or being alone with them. "

"I mean from his, and our, perspective it's clear that he's uncomfortable, but it's entirely possible that it's not clear to her that he's uncomfortable since she can't hear his thoughts. He could outwardly appear entirely unaware of her efforts. Not that it's his responsibility to make his response to someone else's feelings obvious, but guys on this site talk all the time about how dense they are to girl's advances. 

From just his description alone, I'd tend to agree with his co-workers that she's just trying to be being cute, and it's not creepy (except for the bathroom thing, that's fucking weird). I'd probably try to let her know I wasn't interested in as natural of a conversation as I could to avoid any awkward or harsh feelings. If she kept being forward or pushy after that I would definitely be concerned. But I could be totally wrong, I haven't seen an adult act like that in a workplace setting before so maybe it is weirder than I'm giving it credit for.   "
"If a woman told me that my genitals were *so* aesthetically perfect that it inspired her to transition into a man in pursuit of perfection but she's also super homophobic so she couldn't date a guy, I'd be the right level of flattered and confused and glad to be rid of a bigot that I think I'd be alright."
"Her time management was pretty bad but a bigger issue was that she was just an inconsiderate person.

I can't wait to get to know you better - I have some ideas on things to do to get to know each other, but I want your opinions"" I would be floored and would melt. I have a lot of respect for men who are honest, sincere and respect me. You're starting out by saying her happiness and the strength of your relationship are priorities to you, and that's pretty much the most reassuring thing you could make someone feel."
"Being hurt and sobbing is kind of what I call a normal response to being told something so needlessly mean and hurtful. You didn't overreact.

I don't do hook ups. But I certainly would have handled it differently - even *if* I went soft due to a lack of attraction (why would I be sleeping with her in the first place then???) a ""little white lie"" would be the right thing to do."

I mean... I am in a relationship of similar length and I find it would be odd for me to not talk about it at all after 4 years together, especially since we're planning things together like savings, down payment for a house, retirement, buying a car, etc., and also celebrating things like promotions, raises, job changes, etc., not to mention doing normal minutiae together (like filing taxes). I don't remember the exact number of the top of my head (I can't even remember mine, to be honest), but I definitely know the range.

"Just my 2c but those places are popular with people **already** in relationships. Like honeymooners and couples.    

If you actually want to meet *single* ladies, you're better off going to places that they themselves like to visit e.g.    

 - Barcelona, Spain    
 - Paris, France   
 - Copenhagen, Denmark    
 - London, England    
 - Iceland    

Or just do a tour of the US. You can visit a lot of states for $3K, and there are plenty of single ladies if you expand your travel from a couple of weeks to a month or more.

Your elegant reception of his darkly humorous quip makes me sadder for you. 
"Hi. Since you don't seem to be listening to the men you're actually asking, here is my unasked female opinion.   
 
You are starting down an ugly path of blaming everyone else for your own issues. ""Guys don't like me because I'm quiet!"" ""Guys like girls who aren't like me!"" Do you see how these blame both guys and girls for your own singular issues, leaving yourself with no one to turn to? You're only hurting yourself.   

I'm a introverted nerd woman. I've ""asked out"" 90% of the guys I've dated, even if it's something as small as ""hey, I'm going out for coffee, want to come?"" or ""are you going to the fair tomorrow? Want to ride together?"" You don't have to say ""HEY WANNA DATE ME?"" You can just create opportunities to get to know each other better.

Or, you can keep misreading social signals and treading water. It's really your decision."
"I've had 4 long term girlfriends and these are the dealbreakers i've accumulated over the years;

* No severe mental illness past or present : Schizophrenia, borderline, severe depression and anxiety are all complete deal-breakers for me now. Mild treated and treatable depression and anxiety is OK - but if you've been repeatedly institutionalized for your issues then no thank you i'm done with that part of my life.

* Lacking communication skills : Darling, i can't read your mind. 

* History of abuse that has not been dealt with : I'm not a therapist and i'm not your abuser. I will help if i can but i can't deal with being made suspect or treated like i would beat you up just because we're having a heated discussion. Sorry.

* No practical skills in life : If you have a hard time just managing your own life... no, there is nothing for me to do here.

* Fighting dirty : I don't and i can't take people who do. I have a strict rule against using bad words in a fight - step over that and i'm out. I will never call you stupid, an idiot or say i wish i never met you. If you do however, you will not meet *me* again.

* Lacking self-knowledge : Too many girls have promised too much. I dont say i will do shit that i cant possibly do. So please dont tell me you will move to be with me when you havent thought and felt it through yet. I'm going to believe that shit...

Edit : Almost forgot the most important one :

* Sets up relationship parameters but doesn't follow them - Babe, if you said you didn't think it was OK that you sleep with girls when i told you i'm fine with it - then why the fuck did you turn around and sleep with girls and then lie about it?! I already fucking said i was cool with it and meant it. I already had that arrangement successfully befor you. Why the fuck go behind my back with it when i think it's OK?! You made a huge thing out of nothing by lying."

Sure, you could be doing it for yourself. But this is a thread about what men find unattractive. He was simply commenting on what he likes, he wasn't dictating what women should do.

We're all entitled to our opinion here."
"My very first serious relationship was nothing short of a constant psychological warfare.  
I was very young (earliest 20') and it started with me getting completely intoxicated by her look. There was something in her that inspired love in a way I had never felt before (I know it's not much since I was very young, but still) and in the beginning she seemed sweet, even if a bit spoiled/entitled.  

It degenerated relatively fast. After a few months, she asked me (demanded is a better word for it, however) that I cut off any female friend and almost all of my male friends.  
Some weeks after that, she realized that she could manipulate me by making leverage on my insecurities: she was constantly going on about how I never did anything worthy for her, how I was much below her level I was and how she was the only one that she could put up with such a disgrace of a man, but constantly threatened of leaving me if I didn't satisfy her every whim.  
Being young, naive and pretty much at my first experience, I believed that she was right and that I was doing everything wrong, and every day I tried my best to be the man (puppet?) she said she wanted me to be.  
She cheated on me, several times. I was completely destroyed. I couldn't see how all the efforts I put into the relationship were not bringing any positive result. I thought I was a desperate case, and she didn't miss a single chance to reinforce that idea, with all the power that being completely isolated from any friendly presence gave to her words.  

For the first time in my life I had a girlfriend but I had never felt so alone and desperate.  

One day I couldn't take it anymore and I went to have a walk after she verbally exploded on me one last time and got out slamming the door, most probably going to see the guy with whom she was cheating on me.  
I found myself in a wonderful spot with an amazing panoramic view from a cliff a few miles from where I lived.  
I don't know how much time I spent there, since I just wasn't aware of it - being so deep in thoughts, dark thoughts -, but at some point I was brought back to reality by someone calling my name. It was one of the friends I had cut off under her demands a few months back, and when he was approaching me, he was addressing me with a very troubled expression on his face, so I asked if he was ok, if there's something wrong and if he would like me to help him.  
He actually went blank for a moment and said that *he* was worried about *me* and pointed at my general direction.  
It was only then that I realized that I was past the railing, an inch short of the cliff, and that I had been crying the whole time I was there.  

I'm not going to go into details, but he helped me planting the seed of what later became my resolution: I parted ways from that girl a few days after and I completely blocked her and all her friends (which were at the time the only friends I had left) on any social media.  
I finally realized how toxic she was.  

It took some time but eventually I was able to get back in touch with most of my old friends, but that wound never healed completely. And probably never will.  

A couple of years later I was able to gather enough trust to engage in what I thought was a serious relationship. She cheated. At that point I wasn't even angry, I was just very disappointed.  

By now I'm not putting any effort into having any kind of love relationship. It's simply not worth it.  
And I have to admit that I'm in the best mental state I've ever been."
Thank you but no thank you.
"Main reason is, you get so little to go on.

"My wife has a very attractive smell.  Mild and pleasant.  I couldn't describe it beyond that, but give me a dozen worn shirts and I'd bet a thousand dollars I could pick hers out by smell alone.  I sleep on her pillow when she's gone.  Occasionally sniff her clothes when I'm doing laundry.  

And when she was pregnant - it would drive me wild.  More than once getting a whiff of her as she waddled past would get me instantly aroused.  It was kind of crazy in retrospect.  And there were definitely a couple of times where I started kissing her neck during sex and ended up in her armpit.  

Uh, hormones are *weird*.  "

I went with this one. Let's see how it goes
"I feel like it's normal to express what each other is looking for from the get go. Because if you're the kind of guy who just wants to hook up, and aren't ready for a relationship, well then hell no I'm not going to waste my attention on you. I don't think a girl telling you that she ultimately wants to get married means that she's made up her mind about you, it just means that she thinks you might be worth getting to know."
"Trying to get you to come up with the idea to do X yourself instead of just saying what she wants. 

The perennial example is ""what do you want for dinner?"" ""I don't care."" ""Chinese?"" ""No."" ""Italian?"" ""No not that."" ""Burgers?"" ""Nope.""

"She was a racist. After a few off the cuff things over the course of three months, bringing up how, ""Mexicans are disgusting and I hate their culture,"" really throws a wrench into things."
"To stick to the spirit of your question. Here's a subtle signal (not sent intentionally) that I am guilty of and I'm not sure many women have identified in the past.

Plans become more inconsiderate of the other person's preferences. Since I have to spend time with that person, I'd rather be doing an activity I really want to do. Not a compromise activity. Since I'm busy, this gives me a sense of achieving something (task I want to do) whilst evaluating whether this person is worth pursuing further. 

So if we were doing mutually fun things or taking turns on activities in the past, but now they're more me, me, me. That's usually a bad sign. "
"My therapist says that people go looking for broken people (subconsciously) because when they're with someone Crazy, they don't have to look at their own brokenness. When there's a relationship problem, it's always The Other Person. So people seek out folks that can hold the whole weight of the problems of a relationship, because they're too scared to find a healthy human - because if their partner was healthy, they'd have to take responsibility for their own shit instead of being able to say that all of the problems are their Partners Fault."

"I honestly think it's because most girls had that while sex is super taboo for us when we're younger, so we're overcompensating. It's like we're trying to make ourselves more comfortable by checking with our friends that stuff that happens during sex is normal. Doesn't help that women watch less porn, and lack exposure to a lot of things."

"Unless you're a member of a cult, you're not gonna pray your way into a romantic relationship. You're only 19. Give yourself some time. But when you have the chance, jump on it. 

The two things that girls find most attractive are humor and confidence. A buddy of mine was flat broke and managed to marry his banking representative. She could see his account balance. He thought she was attractive for various reasons and walked into his bank. He sat at her desk and said, ""I think I want to take out a $5,000 loan for an engagement ring. She said, ""ok, lets see what we can do. Looking at your finances, I just don't think we can provide that loan."" He knew she was gonna say that. And when she did he replied, ""oh, okay. Maybe we should just take things slow then. I'm pretty sure I can take you out tonight without any loans."" 

His confidence and the fact that she couldn't stop laughing meant he got the girl. She knew for a fact he was flat broke and he still took her out. "

Well he's done well teaching his kids about money management. He doesn't hand them money for anything.He'll buy us stuff we need, he just helped us buy a new bed (45%). Helped us with the deposit for our new house (but not mortgage payments). He'll pay for most things on the family holiday (flights and payment for the big house we stay in). He's not going to give her money for shoes or anything like that. So with the new bed we were going to buy our own, we weren't going to ask for money but it wasn't going to be a good bed. Wife was talking to him and he said don't be stupid get a good strong decent comfortable one that will last us years and he'd give us extra to do that.

"There is consistent pushback when we do. 

Example 1: In school, at some point complaining was dubbed whining and going to an authority to help solve a problem is re-labled snitching. There's a widely-held and strongly-enforced expectation that if you feel some type of way about something you deal with it. If and when you can't, you handle the source of your feelings decisively on your own in the manner of your choosing with a consequence set that you buy into when you act. I was made to feel like talking about my feelings with even my parents or teachers was burdensome. How I felt was my problem to solve and it was a short-lived grace if got to lay my emotions in someone else's lap. The ideal was never to need to.

Example 2: I can express to a girlfriend when something is bothering me no problem. More often than not in my experience, the responses I have gotten have been dismissive, diminishing, defensive, or retaliatory. Often they're coupled with a subtle jab at how they expected me to just take whatever nonsense they're dishing or victim-posturing about how they can't feel free to be themselves as if every bad habit or idiosyncrasy is personality-defining.
