"Mental awareness and suicide prevention.

A massive fuck you to all men and women who contribute to a man's decision to take his own life, because of stupid, fucked up societal constructs that men aren't allowed to have emotions. 

Similarly, a massive fuck you to all men and women who dismiss any form of emotion from a man as weak, cowardly, the like. "
Damn she should take up fishing because she's great at baiting
"Went to my Aunts wedding. My cousin, myself and a few of his friends decided to go for a night out around the city centre in our suits/dresses. I hooked up with one of his female friends and she took me to her parents house.

1. During the act, whilst her parents were in the next room, she said quite loudly ""smash my asshole so hard, my dad can hear your balls spanking my pussy.""

A night full of unprotected anal sex makes this next one so much worse.

2. I woke up to her sucking my unwashed dick. When done, she said ""last night was a combination of ass, cum and shame. I wanted one last taste of that before you left."""
"My ex *asked* if I would mind if she took a vacation with another man — where he paid for her flight out, and she stayed with him at his house. 

I said, ""Well, since you asked, yes.""

She called me insecure and controlling. "
"Wife and I got I to the ""if I get fat"" discussion. I told her I would love her just the same if she was fat, it would just feel like less because it was spread out over more of her."
"My wife was trying to talk to me while I was watching TV.  I said can you please be quiet for five minutes?

She replied with ""well I can't talk with your dick in my mouth"""
"Why the hell do women ask these questions.
Like
""Hey babe, if I was made of spaghetti would you still suck my dick, but NOT eat it?""

"I'm not gay, but my brother is. I was one of the first people he came out to. He wanted to sit down for a serious talk and without thinking I said, ""You're either dying or you're gay, and I know you're not dying.""  In my defense I was rather high at the time. "
"""I'll kill you if you ever leave me"" Came so hard after she said it.

I wonder what that says about me"
"""Would you like it if you came in my mouth so I could spit it back in yours?""

No, actually. No I wouldn't."
"After reading a 19th century gothic story about a painter whose lover turned out to be a she-devil, she asked me if I'd still bone her if she turned out to be a she-devil.

I said yes, crisis averted, all quiet on the western front."
"Not a specific incident but if I had a dime for every time a straight guy said something along the lines of ""it's cool, just don't hit on me"" and then a moment later follows with ""but you think I'm hot, right?""

Well, I'd have quite a few dimes. "
"A friend casually told me that his wife likes anal so much that when they were ready to start a family he told her ""If we're gonna make a baby, I gotta stop putting it in your ass for a while."" She's a kindergarten teacher."
"When I told my brother I'm gay, he said ""thank god you realized. I thought I was going to have to tell you!"""
"Just shared one on a different post not to long ago.  Wife said ""Why don't you just bend me over the couch and fuck me hard"".  

Another time she came out to the garage as I was doing some woodworking projects. Chatted for a minute then said, ""why are you talking so much and not fucking me?""  Picker her up, set her on the work bench and went at it.  

Last one, when we just started dating, and had only had sex a couple times we were in bed and fooling around.  I was behind her and teasing her a bit when she said ""I dont care which, but pick a hole and fuck me"".  Great way to tell someone you're into anal. 

I miss those good old days."
"A girl at a party once asked ""Wanna watch me pee?"" Turns out I DID want to watch her pee."
"No wonder she is your ex now. That just screams ""I already had that planned"" "
"The answer to this shit is so easy. 

""She has the same physical attributes as you, but I'm attracted to your personality (give examples) not just your body.""

Boom done, go have fun sex with your girlfriend. "
"She asked me if I'd still love her and stay with her if she transitioned to a man. I said I'd wouldn't stay but I'd still love her as my best friend and support her. We'd be excellent divorced co-parents.

Still not the answer she wanted. Maybe I'm an asshole for not wanting to be romantically involved with a man who used to be my wife?

Edit: this is why I like this subreddit. It's nice to not feel alone. 

"
Should'a told her to stop horsing around.
"She begged me to cover her in my cum, since that was 'the only way she could feel clean.'

"
"I dated this super conservative girl and she had a roundabout way of saying things so the weirdest things still give me a boner. 

She once told me she wanted me to ""Go between the mountains. "" which was her way of saying she wanted me to titty fuck her. We were 19. "
"When she was pregnant I stomped her ass in monopoly. She cried Everytime she landed on one of my FOUR railroads.

Edit: I forgot to mention the outcome. 

I just gave her all my railroads for free. She cried again because it was sweet.

I still won, she cried again. Pregnancy is funny like that."
"Similar, but different. The other day I told my Gf 

Me: ""I'm really happy with you""

GF: ""that makes it sound like I'm a car or something""

Short pause

GF: ""if I *were* a car, what kind of car would I be?"" 

Me: ""that Lamborghini we saw a few minutes ago""

Gf: ""No way! I wouldn't be that car!!""

Me: ""well I don't know what kind of car you'd be. Calling you a car weren't my words""

Pause

Gf: "" you're right. I'm happy with you too"""
"Such a rookie mistake.  
""No, but I will still ride you ;)"". 
And you are off the hook... "
"Was with this crazy girl at a BBQ at her parents. Her dad was watering the plants with this garden hose. She says to me ""that hose has been deep inside me"" with a wink. It was so dirty to see her dad handle the thing and she was visibly happy about it.

Another creepy/filthy thing was when we met on the local playground way past midnight one time in summer. She sucked me off and before I came she said ""Show me how it's done, daddy! Come to mommy!"". On the fucking playground.

She had some issues man."
Sounds like a golden opportunity.

"My ex asked me, in so many words, ""if there was an identical copy of me who knew everything I did and felt the same way I do, would you be able to pick the real me?""

I gave her a ""logical"" answer. She gave back the ring. Crisis averted."
"One of my ex's would always ask ""if I turned into a guy, would you still love/bone me"" I would say no every time, I said we could be friends, but I wouldn't have sex with you. It was strange though, she would always try to get me to admit I was gay, which I'm not. Once she dressed up like a guy for a day, realistic beard and everything. She was a strange one"

"The correct answer is, ""of course, you'd be the one that asked stupid questions."""
"Not me, but a friend back in college was talking with this guy at a party and just casually/ drunkenly said he was gay. The guy he was talking to told him he was disgusting. Allegedly he then went up to a big dude and was like ""hey, that guy over there is a fag. Let's rough him up a bit to show him they're not welcome here"" or something. Of course, big bodybuilder dude was another friend of mine who happened to be the gay friend's boyfriend, and therefore was also of the homosexual variety. Guess who got punched?"
"I love my girlfriend (now wife), but it has definitely highlighted how awesome being single was.  It's funny, I spent my single days longing for a significant other.  I wouldn't trade my life now for anything, but I never thought I'd look back on my single days with nostalgia."
"Ugh, a guy once told me that ""he didn't have a problem with gay people just as long as they didn't hit on or cat called him"" and I told him that he's just afraid that gay people will treat him the way he treats women. 

That shut him up. "
"I was sitting in a movie theatre, pre-show, with my ex back in high school. It was towards the end of the relationship, I was starting to see our sense of humour (among other things) weren't really comparable. 

Anyway, some ad comes on, and it had a really dry, sarcastic joke in it. I thought it was funny, she said it was ""stupid"". I said, it wasn't literal. She said it was still stupid. I said she was stupid. She left in tears. I watched the final instalment of the Twilight series in theatres by myself. "
Every once in a blue moon I'll look up those videos of deaf people gaining their hearing or color blind people using those special sunglasses just to have a good cry.

"As soon as I watched her leave, as I dropped her back to her place, one last and final time. I was leaving the city forever, and we both planned on marrying one day. We were already in a relationship for a long time- but I never really thought it that way.
I saw her.. leaving.. from my car.. one last time.. she had this pretty yellow suitcase that she dragged behind her as she gave me one final look.. and came back to the car to give me a kiss and a hug and told me that she loved me.
I came back to my place, packed up my things, locked my apartment, gave the keys back to the owner- a friend dropped me to the airport, I was in a daze, boarded the flight, settled my luggage.. went to the washroom after a while.. I swear I had nothing on my mind before that.. washed my face and cried.
God ! It finally hit me that I loved her, I really loved her.
A few years later, she married her now husband, who isn't me, yesterday.

Well, I guess, shit happens."
I like her.

"When I was in grad school, I told one of my fellow students a few months in. We had been casual friends before then but it just hadn't come up yet. Her response:

""Hmm. No""

She just decided that I wasn't gay. After talking about it more, she just didn't believe me and communicated it in a weird way. I thought it was hilarious. "
"Was with a girl and she was very afraid to have sex for the first time because she thought it would hurt (her mother scared her probably so she wouldn't sleep around). I thus took it slow with her, making out, oral etc.

One day we were making out naked and we were really into it. And she was on top of me and somehow we didn't even notice how *it slid into her* and suddenly I realized we were actually fucking. She first didn't get it either, but she was riding me. It was the same motion she would do anyways, except I was somehow inside her.

It was the most natural thing I have ever experienced. No words needed. Somehow it just felt so right in that moment that her fears were erased. Later she was embarrassed how easy it was. 

And we got pizza that night :)"
"Correct answer: yes she is attractive, but not as attractive as you.

So she never checked on your neighbor?
So does his whole neighborhood. 
"I think some people want to know that you love them unconditionally. 

What's sad is that there's no such thing as unconditional love.

Most of us can love through adversity, but there's conditions. Don't drown my pet, don't throw acid on me, etc. if you do any wild shit like that, no, I'm not going to continue to love you."
"Not anticipate she would be home when she said she would be out, therefore arriving with a sandwich for myself to eat but did not buy her one."
"I once had a friend come out to us (his group of friends) and one of the guys went ""for how long"" so the guy went ""well, I guess all my life really"" and the first guy went ""oh no I meant how long are you gonna be gay for, just I'm seeing this bird and I was hoping we could double date and you take out her fat mate for me.""

He meant no harm by it, dudes a fucking idiot, but it was hilarious"

"On ""minimalism"" sub there was a beautiful picture of a living room in Norway that overlooked a fjord. It had a table, couch, fireplace and a basket of wood (I guess for the worlds smallest fireplace). I commented by asking where the TV was? After the sun went down, which is Nov-Feb in Norway right(?), I said I wasn't going to sit around all day a look at a basket full of wood. Apparently that wasn't too well received in minimalism. As I said in response, minimal stuff, maximum judgement. 
I guess that's what you do without a TV."
At least she was kind enough to ask.
"I'd have walked in right past her. If her friend can't be patient, I can't either. "
"Oh thank God, I thought this was some kinky new fetish I was too old to understand."

Yep. Happened at the park over the summertime. One girl decided to hop into the men's restroom and her friend stood in the doorway as the lone woman essentially occupied like 3 stalls and 3 urinals just cuz she didn't want to wait in the women's line.

"Told her I needed to stop mid furious sex because, suddenly, I was absolutely busting for a piss. She was really close to cumming, so naturally she shouted something like ""I don't care! Piss inside me! Keep going!""

Sorry baby gurl, what? ಠ_ಠ "
"She sure was. I had just finished in her butt after anal sex and she turned around on all fours to ""clean me up"" when she said that. She always made sure her butt was absolutely squeaky clean *(she would shower and perform thorough enema's)* before we did anal and we used tasty edible lubricant so it sounded far nastier than it actually was.      

Still, it surprised the hell out of me she suddenly went that far. It was the only time she did that though. And afterwards i could tell she felt a bit embarrassed at herself. "
I hope you're ok with the fact that she put your toothbrush in or around her butthole.
I've got a massive horse dick. It never gets me laid. Usually women just say how weird it is having a horse dick hanging up over the fireplace.

"Last time I was taken by ambulance to hospital because I was sucidal, the ambos rolled their eyes at each other and made other ""What a loser"" expressions. They spoke to me as little as possible on the way.

When handing me over to emergency (probably assuming I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings) one of them joked ""I should put him down as female, he's not a man"".

A week or so later I got the paperwork from the ambulance service, it seems she actually went through with that ""joke"" as I'm recorded as female with them.

Edit: I fail sentences, fixed.

Edit 2: wow RIP inbox. To clarify ""suicidal"" it wasn't ""just"" thoughts, I was talked out of it by a random constable, he called for his seargeant and an ambulance, when they arrived I was sectioned and taken to hospital in the ambulance."
"One morning I woke up and went to the bathroom. There he was, perfect body, hair in a mess. Just so happy to have him in my life. That was the exact moment I fell in love with myself."
Angrily told her I would rather jerk off than ever have sex with her again. Not 30 minutes later we were having make up sex. Our issue was that we were having no/bad sex. It has since (two or three years have passed) improved substantially.

"I am not morally offended, but I am extremely selfish. I don't want women clogging up my nice clean fast tidy bathroom because

- That nasty pussy smell that's in every public women's restroom. Again, ask anyone who cleaned a public restroom."
"""Maybe some people are meant to stay in your heart, but not your life.""

"My wife and I weren't 100% abstinent before marriage, but close. When we first started dating we fooled around some, but then she felt like waiting was the right thing to do so we didn't do anything else until we got married.

Right when we first got married sex was alright. We did it pretty frequently, I guess. Not so much now though.

It was a mistake. Fuck abstinence. It's the worst."
"I'd really like to see the issue male victims of abuse raised.

 There are no shelters or help offered in Canada for male DV victims,* and that's just wrong. I understand at least some shelters always being gendered because the women and kids using them are often deeply traumatized, and many struggle to interact with men at all so they couldn't live with men there. But without shelters for men too, these victims have nowhere safe to go and get back on their feet. 

Also, I don't think we talk about male abuse victims in general, so a lot of men feel like they're less of men because they were victimized. There's this pervasive ""a real man..."" logic that's pretty toxic in my opinion.

*ETA: No shelters for men in Canada that I'm aware of; I think the only one closed when the man running it committed suicide. If I'm wrong, please correct me."
"They want that whole ""I'll love you no matter what babe"" shit. Logic is lost on these women."
"Yeah, I'd be pretty pissed. 

When I was at the opera, the line for the womans bathroom was quite large. So we saw a few 40 year old women sneak into the mens bathroom. We dudes were standing at the urinal and then suddenly two-three women came inside and looked around and stood in line for *our* stalls. 


Oh the line is a little bit too long for you? That's not my problem, that's yours. Get back to your line. What's the point for the others to stand in line when you can just sneak into ours? 

Besides, the hypocrisy that would exist if I entered their restroom would be absolutely absurd. I'd get yelled at as if I were literally Hitler. 

Use your own restroom and we'll use ours. "
Asked her to marry me. She cried. It was pretty mean of me.
Asked her why she wore bra's... She has really small boobs... Ouch
"Woke up and she was playing w. my junk. She was a friend but I didn't really want anything to do with anyone at the time. It was awkward.  She threatened to tell everyone some shit she found out about me unless we became bf/gf.  Insert 2 year relationship full of violence from her end, her lying about me to co-workers, having me arrested for bullshit getting a restraining order then killing herself because I wouldn't move back in with her.  Long story.

That being said yes the sex was the best.

Edit: I am really glad I posted this cause I got me playing google fu. 2 years after it happened I hired a PI to get the info (back in teh 90s and he found the obituary).  Today I did searches and found out she did die by suicide but in 2012 not 1997.  I have been living for years thinking I contributed to her suicide....  I feel kinda relieved but really pissed off at the same time."

"Girl from NYE was probably the dirtiest sex I've ever had and she hit me with a few similarly amazing lines.

It started with her saying we shouldn't have sex that night, which I was totally fine with, so I rolled over and tucked her into my shoulder and started just stroking her hair for a little while.

She grabbed my hand and bit on my thumb. She then started to suck on it a little which made me turn back towards her. She moved to my index finger and tickled the back of her mouth with it, then deep throated my middle finger like it was nothing. 

I was rock hard at this point and grinded on her leg. She grabbed my cock and said ""Want me to do that to your dick?"" to which I said ""Yup."" and she replied ""Good, I wanna make sure it's nice and wet before you put it inside me.""

So we fucked, and as I was about to finish she asks me to finish on her boobs. I pull out and climb over her legs to do just that and as I'm reaching to grab my cock and finish. She smacks my hand away and says ""Please cum on my tits, I wanna feel your hot cum on my tits!"" and starts to jerk me off. The look on her face as I finished made it one of the best orgasms I've ever had. The only way I can describe it is that it was like she had the world's worst sunburn on her chest, and my cum was Aloe. "

"Not exactly a response to them being gay but funny/cringey all the same.

We were out at a gay club with my friend Alan, whos a bit of a social idiot. He was chatting to two chubby camp fat guys when he asked ""i know your gay, but why do you have to talk like that?"".
 The response of ""we are deaf"" was so awkward i felt time stop."
Can i uh....can i add her on facebook? 
"Went out to drink with a neighbor and her best friend. My neighbor ends up getting hammered and I carry her back to her apartment toilet so she can throw up. Once there, her friend and I start making out.

Neighbor ends up passing out on the toilet but since we didn't want to stop, we continued making out as I carried and tucked my neighbor into bed, and then over her for like 10 minutes until she seemed fine enough to leave. We ended up fucking most of the night, but had a rule that the first one to orgasm during each session had to walk over to the neighbor's to make sure she was OK."
"My current gf was actually one of my best friends for a year or two before we started dating. As such, she knew a lot of things about me that gfs typically wouldn't... for instance, that I had never gotten off from a bj before. Our first time messing around, she suddenly gets all dominant on me and telling me what to do. This was a really big shocker because she typically she can't even decide if she's hungry or not. Anyways, she goes down, and does some serious business for a solid 10 minutes. She's going at it like her one goal on earth is to ruin this streak of bjs I've had with no happy ending. It was great, but didn't get me there. So she rolls onto her back and instructs me mount her chest and fuck her face. Shit got real. Streak over. The end.

Edit: word"

A1: No. - Why don't you love me?

A2: Yes. - So you would have sex with a horse?

Best way out: If you were a horse, you wouldn't be *you* anymore. Your physical appearance, your ability to speak, what you eat, how you walk, etc. is all part of what makes you *you*. Whatever that horse would be, it would only be something that has a few Things in common with you (like your sister), but it wouldn't be you.

"I hate getting tickled, but this girl that I'm with changed that up for me.  One day while hanging out, she started caressing my arm and she knows that I can't handle that because I'm way too ticklish for it.  As I tried to yank my arm away, she held my arm firmly so I couldn't yank it and just kept going.  I let her and then soon enough, I wasn't even laughing.  I was buckling at the the tickling feeling, but instead of laughing, I was getting turned on.  She went further up my arm, started tickling my armpits and sides (i hate getting my sides tickled), and next thing I know, I'm hard as a rock.  "
"It's an obvious double standard. If a man went into a women's restroom at a bar, it would be a huge deal and he'd probably get kicked out. 

Edit: my comment seems to be confusing people. I'm referring to extremely popular bars and clubs (mostly clubs) that have bouncers in every corner who WILL throw out a guy for using the women's restroom. I'm not talking about your neighborhood bar with two employees and no bouncers. "
"No. I don't.
There's a little more to the story after the plane landed.
We kept talking a few more days after the plane landed. I missed her so much.
Then one day, I called her number- and it was not reachable. I tried it again a few hours later, still the same, the day passed, and then another day, and then another, a few weeks passed and then a few months, a few years went by- and I got the news she got married yesterday.
We had no fights, nothing, but something went wrong, maybe some people are meant to stay in your heart but not in your lives.
The only regret I have, is if I knew it was the last time I was talking to her, maybe I would have stayed on the phone a little while longer.

In real life Ive never had anything super dirty said to me. Mainly just requests to be hit about 

Edit; Just remembered one girl i was sleeping with a month ago or so was like only 22 and still was in that self conscious phase. I complimented her arse or something and she said something like ""really? i dont like it"" so i said ""enough of your negative body image, keep saying bad things and my dicks going in your mouth"" so she looked me dead in the eye and said ""i hate myself"", it was more really funny than dirty which is exactly what i like "

The hope is that in time with work on myself and the relationship that we'll get back to the good old days of fun sex. "

"This was long in the past under another account and most of the thread was deleted by mods but basically: 

There was a woman in Oregon (maybe Washington) that threw her little boy off of a bridge to the icy waters below because she was ""stressed"". I called her a murderer in /r/news (literally there was nothing else to the story, no hidden context) and because of that I saw the ugliest side of Reddit I never realized existed until then. 

I had hundreds of down votes from the posts I made in that sub with people accusing me of ""being perfect"" and ""never walking in this womans shoes"" and then making threats against me! My mind was blown that people were defending her. 

Before the thread got cleaned up I posted about it, no one believed me that people were defending this woman, and when I showed them they were all horrified too and couldn't believe it. 

There is no hidden circumstance, this woman literally murdered her child (who I think was 6) by throwing him off of a bridge in the middle of winter because she was stressed. Police didn't know if he died when he hit the ice, or died in the water. 

That woman is a murderer. She drove to the bridge, took her frightened child in her arms, held him up, and dropped him over the edge. "

"Everything was going okay, with a couple of weird little flags. Like she would be overly aggressive in coming on to me if we were at a party or something like that. Then one night I wasn't feeling like going out because i wasn't feeling up to it (depression), and she went to a party by herself. She came back to the my room unannounced and tried to force herself on me, and I mean force. I really didn't feel like touching her but I wanted her to know it wasn't her fault, so I told her ""It's not your fault but I'm really not in the mood. I don't feel well today."" She replied with ""I get that, but I need it."" as she was taking my pants off. I told her to fuck off and I gave all her shit back the next day. "
"I started dating this girl. A few nights in we decided to have sex. She was on her rag.

But when men's rights issues are pushed solely as a kickback to women's rights issues it kind of defeats the purpose and creates an unnecessary devisiveness.

"IT'S GOING AWESOME. We didn't have *any* genital contact (or sight haha). He didn't even pat my butt. We decided that would be too hard not to push the boundary if that was allowed. Ya gotta draw the line somewhere, I guess. We also didn't talk about sex explicitly because it turned us on too much. We were pretty horny.

I think it helped us to learn how to work well together and know each other without adding in an element that can cloud the clarity in a relationship. It was also a major trust builder in each other. We accomplished something huge together, and stayed strong for each other.

We love having sex. We do it at least 2-3 times a week, and we've been together for over 4 years. It's cool that neither of us can compare each other to anyone else. Special, sacred, intimate, exciting.

It's really okay to fucking talk to people. If you're really *that* mad about someone beginning a conversation with you, maybe remove the stick that's deep inside your asshole tbh. "

Apparently one of my friends and his girlfriend are really into cuckholding and one of my really good friends is one of their go to guys. I've heard a bunch of stories about my friends gf getting trains ran on her, double penetrated, etc. Now it's not really a big deal, but my friend and his girlfriend have no idea that I know and they always drop little hints when my good friend is around them, which can be pretty funny.

Similar thing... at a party and a girl told me she learned how to pee standing up. Went into the bathroom and watched her piss into the shower. She had to use her fingers to keep it aimed but she covered some real distance and didn't get any on her. It wasn't exactly erotic but I was impressed.

"Was going to go out to a movie and a nice dinner with my ex, note the place has a dress code, asked her to get nice and dresses up for it. (Note I picked this place cause anywhere we'd go out she always wore sweats and a t, or hoodie.) she walks out of her house in the usual attire, told her she needed to change cause dinner has a dress code, she said no, told her to or else I'd go with out her, she said ""try it"" so I left her there. Went out then with my best bro. We broke up."
"Met a girl at a bar. She took me home. Started fucking almost immediately. Standard right? Would have been except we were strangers an hour before this and now she was having me choke her, smack her as hard as I could, and fuck her face...pretty violently...while she laid with her head hanging off the bed. The whole time a CD with Elton John and Tracy Chapman is playing in the background. The disparity between the vibes of Tiny Dancer/Fast Car and me choke fucking and smacking a strange woman is something I'll never forget. 9/10 would recommend. "

"I like choking girls during sex. A lot of it is from their enjoyment of it. Almost all of them have asked me to do it more. 

Anyway, recently a girl was riding me. She started to choke me with both hands and holy shit I almost came as soon as I felt the pressure on my neck. 

Definitely was an ""yup I'm into that"" moment. 

Pro tip: do NOT crush the wind pipe when you're choking someone. That's located in the **front** of the throat. Instead squeeze the **sides** of their neck to restrict blood flow. That's where the fun comes from. "
"My missus is quite self-conscious about her rack. When she moved in, a bit jokingly, I said ""Oh and you're not wearing a bra around the house, especially those padded bras.

I just wish she wouldn't hang them on the backs of chairs and on the dining room table. She loves to catch me perving down her top, puts a little spring in her step. "

"When I had my first couple of dates with the girl I'm seeing now.

She came over to my place so we could watch a movie. Partway through the movie, I chanced it by putting my arm around her- something I'd never attempted with anyone before because I was so sure of failure. Much to my surprise and delight, not only did she go with it, she *snuggled back against me.*

It was like a revelation. I did a fist pump. She giggled and hugged me."

"Sounds like this dude was probably just WAITING for you to be out of a relationship to make his move. If he sees this as ""his one chance"" he's probably not going to stop at anything until he gets a definitive, explicit no. 

He is unaware of or unwilling to accept social cues - you're not being subtle, he's just either willfully ignorant or totally oblivious. 

It's nice that you don't want to hurt his feelings, super rad of you to be considerate. There are chicks out there that would manipulate him and lead him on, or just smash his little heart into the ground with some shameful rejection.

There ARE nice ways to be rejected. I smile at every chick that ever gives me a ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend,"" because it doesn't matter if it's true or not - she's choosing to save me a public ""Nope, not interested, go away fucko"" by giving a kind excuse and an ""out"". If he's not getting the hint, you gotta be direct.

In this case, I'd be straight up with him before this goes so far that you have to angrily reject him. Be literal, ""I am not interested in dating you,"" and don't make it about ""I'm not ready right now,"" because in his head that will sound like ""keep waiting"".

You can be every bit as nice about it as you want, but it won't stop until you do. Being nice is gracious at this point, because he IS taking advantage of your unfortunate break up to try to get his foot in the door, even if he doesn't see it that way himself, which in it's own way is entitled and shitty - he's not being as considerate as you are."
"We'd be intimate behind closed doors but she never wanted me to spend time with her and her friends, and when we did see them when we were out she'd be sheepish that she was seen with me. ""You remember my *friend* fragilestories?"" 

Oh, and she only ever wanted to be fucked from behind.  That one hurt when I figured it out. 

After her I vowed that no matter how ugly I am, I wouldn't again date someone ashamed to be out in public with me. "

Since then I had no other GF and hardly a one good friend. I kinda got over her in about 5 years, though I still try to pretend she doesn't exist, avoid the area where her house is, avoid her family etc., just so that I'm not reminded. Unfortunately I developed other psychological problems since then, that's why I'm still not really happy. I'm working on it though, thanks for asking :)"
"I'm not sure if it's a rom com worthy but a friend of mine invited me over to her house a little while after a bad breakup. I was tired, had just gotten off work and was in a generally pessimistic mood. I drove an hour and a half to get there assuming we were just chilling and talking about breakup stuff-when I got there she had made frozen pizza, had two bottles of tequila with margarita mix and was cranking John Mayer. We just ate junkfood, drank and banged. Was pretty awesome, especially since I wasn't in the mindset to try and interpret signals or put together a really awesome night for anyone. It's the only time any girl I wasn't dating went to that much effort for me.

"This is one of the few memories I have engraved into my brain. In 8th grade I had a massive crush on this girl. And I was pretty awkward and barely spoke to the girl. But it was her birthday. 

So days before I'm getting ready to admit my love and buy her a balloon or two in the morning before school started. But I completely forgot, got dropped off and first person I see is her. 

I said happy birthday and then told her ""I wanted to buy you a couple balloons but I overslept so here go buy them yourself."" Handed her a crisp 3 dollar bills and she just laughed and said no thanks

I have never been more cringe/embarrassed in my life. "
Your game must be A1 if that's the most cringe worthy thing you've ever said to a girl.
When my fiancé first told me she loved me I wasn't quite there yet... I think I softly patted her on the back and told her that I want it to be real when I say it. I think maybe a week or later she woke up next to me and I was completely blown away with how beautiful she was. Thats when I knew.
"When I was in college, one of the guys in my department would sneak up behind people in the computer lab and poke people in the sides as a joke, myself included.  Naturally people got sick of his shenanigans, but never really bothered anyone enough to do too much about it.

We were cramming in the library one night and he happened to come by, I had just recently come out to some of the folks there, so we were on the subject and when he realized that I was gay all he said was, ""That fag's a fuckin' fag??"" and left pretty quickly after that.

Turns out he was a MASSIVE homophobe, and never touched me again.  My friends would even have me go try to give him a hug when he'd get on their nerves and he'd literally run away.

Strange guy..."
I don't like her hair.
"No I don't think so, she was pretty in her 20s but started to become chubby and skanky looking in her early 30s, right about when she met my friend, six months after they met they were married, she asked him to marry her.

Now she is not attractive at all, smokes, drinks every day and he does most of the cooking and cleaning.

Also she tells him off he is out past 8pm without her.

Sad shit really and I feel a bit sorry for him, though it is his fault for being such a dumbass."
Nope
"Driving a high performance super sports car is awesome. But when you own one you realize parking is a bitch, speed-bumps need to be driven over with extreme care, every carjacker out there wants to take it from you, it sucks fuel, has insane repair costs, insurance costs are outrageous, it has low utility value and those who envy you will happily key or dent it when you are not looking, which will immediately lower the shit out of that car's value. And you constantly have to keep it spotless and clean because a car like that demands to be in mint condition at all times.         

By comparison a decently maintained and cared for sedan or SUV still gets you where you need to be, is cheaper and more useful overall. If something breaks down you are more likely to be able to fix it yourself and speed bumps are much less painful to navigate. And if you accidentally slightly bump into something...well that's why those cars have actually functional bumpers and fenders that can be buffed out cheaply. And you are more likely to be able to stuff kids in there. It also does not mind getting dirty, which adds character and shows it gets the job done. "
"Prior to our wedding night, my future wife said to me ""I'm going to fuck your cock off."" Um, yes, please try."
Is she your ex-wife or just an ex-freak?
"Currently sitting on the floor, having margs, and watching Terrace House (that Japanese reality show on Netflix). I also listen to Carly Rae Jepsen and love paintings of flowers. 100% straight male, I promise. "

Anyway no that relationship didn't last long."

"When I realized I don't have to ""be"" handsome for some women to find me handsome.  I know that I don't look like Brad Pitt, but I've met enough women where it's clear that I'm their ""type"" to accept that at least *some* people find me good looking."
"I told her that I watch porn (because she asked), then refused to allow her to dictate how I masturbate.

She was devastated. I let her stay the night anyway (it was thanksgiving, and I didn't want to kick her out/break up on a holiday).

I didn't see her again til the following Tuesday.

I went to her place, made dinner, did the dishes, broke up with her, then left. "

"My friend has no boundaries.  He told met hey hadn't had sex for at least 5 years after getting married. Apparently she had a lot of stress and anxiety about sex (not sure if there was abuse or trauma in the past), and was working on it with a therapist, but....really slow going. 

Apparently mutual masturbation was the alternative. 

They've been married for...fifteen years now? Just moved back to the States, so I get to see them a little more. She's very nice and sweet. Don't know if they have sex or not."
"I once asked him if he had a favourite boob. Stupid question, don't know why I asked. He was a bit stumped and said ""no, but sometimes one of them is just easier to reach"". Which was when I knew he'd heard a very different question (or rather a criticism) than I'd asked. 

My new years resolution is to not ask stupid questions anymore..."

"Funny enough, my college friends and I went to a how-to-please-a-woman event, and while we were there one of them said ""well this is never gonna help me anyways"".

So I responded ""Ah no don't think like that! You'll get someone eventually""

And then he told me he was gay. At an event on how to give a girl an orgasm.

Evidently, he was only there cause my other buddies had lightly peer pressured him into following along, even though they knew he was gay."
"After my ex and I split, i tried to be her friend. After her current bf tried to hurt my dog, I waited until they had their next fight, and invited her over. I basically dangled us getting back together out there, got some sex, left some pictures on her phone and caused a shitstorm for them.

Edit-the relationship ended because she was cheating on me with the other guy. I should feel bad...but I don't "

"Because they have an unreasonable expectation of a person being able to love and marry an animated pile of spaghetti, which outside of some very weird fetishes, would probably be incredibly straining on a relationship.

Edit: The real deep lack of logic, is that they want their partner to unconditionally love them through absolutely anything, and tho we might wish that to be the case in reality it isn't reasonable. Outside of maybe parenthood where the hormones in your body force you to love the creature you pooped out, there really isn't unconditional love, love is a relationship built on shared interests and hard work, it is a partnership that requires each side to contribute something; it is not eternal and it can die, especially if one suddenly turns into spaghetti."
"My wife was 8 months pregnant at the time. I had worked 13 hours that day and came home tired and pissed off. We ate dinner and she made some brownies. They were kinda dry, but I powered through them. She was all depressed about it and started crying about how dry they were.  I looked her dead in the eye and said, ""We'll don't fucking eat them."" That was it, the flood gates opened and she went into the bathroom to cry. I let her cry it out and apologized. Then I went to the store and bought her some brownies. She was happy then. "

"ITT just socially awkward moments

Here's mine:

I was struggling with finding a person to date and my best friend at the time offered to help me make a match.com profile (provided I paid for the membership). This becomes a thing a few of our friends talk about, and they decide they'll help make said profile.

So come the day we make the profile I'm at my friend's place with a few of us drinking, myself included. The people present? My friend, his gf, myself and...a girl I was not too close to at the time. So we're taking our sweet time to create the profile mostly talking, joking around, etc. When the profile is finished and about to go live, the friend's gf asks if we think this will work. The other girl chimes in and says something along the lines of ""of course!"" and she blurts out she herself would be interested. So my friend perks up and is like, ""wait do you want to go on a date with Ksight3?"" She then turns to me and asks ""Idk Ksight3, do you want to go on a date??"" all expectantly. 

You'd think there's 0 chance I can fuck this up. And you're absolutely wrong. Cringe #1

""Do you watch HIMYM?"" I ask (I was a huge fan of the show at the time) 

""... No""

""Then no""

The room got completely silent and she left soon after. I didn't even realize until after she left what I even said/did. My friend just facepalmed and laughed.

Cringe #2-???

After that incident I would see her every where (I used to party a lot and she and I had many mutual friends) and any time I would get drunk I pulled a Schmosby and told her I loved her. (Or so my friend said since I don't remember, but apparently it happened multiple times).     "
"&gt; Do you ever go to the bathroom to piss and then decide you might as well take a shit while you're there?

Yeah, happens all the time. The worst is when I leave my phone at my desk because I'm just planning on peeing, and then I end up pooping with no phone."

Made my friend's gf cheat on him with me. Technically my most scumbag thing I've ever done.
"My friend's GF asked him if he would still love her if she got really fat. 

His rather epic reply was a straight-faced ""Guess I'll just dump you now""

They're no longer together, go figure "
For real! How can women demand equality and expect men to take care of them? I raised three kids with little to no child support. When my ex lost his job I told him to stop paying the $200 a month. When he went back to work I still didn't ask for it. That way he had more money to spend with our son. And he always chipped in if I needed. 
"That was pretty much it. He meant no harm by it and later introduced him to a potential gay partner, he was just dim as all fucks.

"OP didn't say it was your fault. OP said you have some responsibility.

If you are friends with someone, you both have a responsibility to each other to be a force of good in each other's lives. If your friend wants to date you, then he is hanging out with you to try and make that happen. By being aware of this and not drawing clear lines, you are hindering him from moving along and finding someone who is interested in dating him. As a friend, you should want him to find a partner that makes him happy.

This sounds pointed, but I'm asking this to get you to look at this from a different perspective: what good are you creating by not saying anything?"

First sex: I go to give her head, and she *apologizes* for having pubic hair. I understand societal expectations a bit better now, but at the time, I was just like ""You're an adult...you have hair. It's cool. I'm about to eat, though. We good?"""

I used to think I was gonna hold out til marriage.  Then my ex girlfriend shoved her tongue down my throat and I've never been the same ever since"
"The worst thing about this is when they think they're manipulating you, but you're just genuinely being nice. I had this with a girl in college, she was smoking hot but I had a girlfriend so I had no interest in her. Since we took classes together we also studied together, did homework together etc. Anyway, I noticed that when wanting help she kept bumping up this really fake nice personality like she was *really* trying to flirt with me, of course it ended when the assignment was complete. This just pissed me off and I stopped associating with her, I just assumed we were friends and mutually helping one another, I hated the idea that she thought she was dragging me along."

There's just a time investment that people make in a relationship that outside of a relationship most people don't want to make. "

"An old friend ""Brent"" was married to other friend ""Alice"" awhile back. They had a housewarming party and about 25 people showed up, including me. Alcohol was flowing freely and by the end of the night there were about five bodies passed out. Everyone else had gone home, but I was totally sober so I was cleaning up. Alice was passed out in the bedroom but Brent was somehow still conscious and was rambling about everything while I cleaned up. He revealed to me that Alice was into bestiality and he had watched her have sex with his mother's Siberian Husky a couple of times, there was a video tape of those events, and they planned to get a couple of large male dogs once the house was set up.

The next morning it was obvious that Brent had no recollection of that conversation and to this day neither of them are aware that I know their secret. It's been about 25 years since that conversation. To the best of my knowledge they've always had large male dogs at their home."

"If this is real, there'd be no way for me to continue because I'd just be laughing "
She patted him back on the head 
And one pillow to rule them all.
"Not to be mean but she was like a 3/10. Honestly, I feel 100%about my decision not to include her. "

"I wouldn't say I have a lot of tip offs which people usually pick up on. So most of the time people are surprised when they find out. I wish I had some fun crazy story but really most of my friends were really supportive albeit super surprised.

Some of my favourite moments with it happen when someone is being an asshole about it in general and doesn't realize I'm gay. I was traveling a couple years ago and there was a gay couple at the hostel I was at. I was playing pool with some random guy and out of nowhere he just starts bitching to me about how disgusted the couple made him and how he couldn't stand being around gay people because of various bigoted views that gay guys weren't even guys. His face was pretty magical when I told him he'd been hanging out with a gay guy for the last hour and didn't even notice. Didn't really want to talk much after that but fuck him frankly."
"""Don't be silly, darling.  Your body's what keeps me with you when you get neurotic and insecure.  Speaking of, damn, you're looking *fantastic* today."""
"(After about 2 months of seeing this girl)

""So, Anchezsanchez, I feel I can kinda trust you with this now.  When we're having sex I want you to just do what you want with me. Choke me, spit on me, slap me, make me gag on your cock. Basically just fucking degrade me. That's what I enjoy""

I mean, I didnt have it in me to fucking slap her but just being told by a girl to do whatever the hell you want with her. Pretty great.

"When I was a junior in college and my best friend's girlfriend said looks weren't my problem. Honestly though I still don't believe it. Even when unbiased third party internet strangers say it I still have creeping self doubt because it hasn't translated to validation in my immediate life. Either women aren't interested, I'm straight up missing cues of interest, or I'm not as good-looking as I think I am."
"Sometime after the Crazy Mary incident, I met another gal from online. Lindsey looked super cute in her pics and seemed like she'd be fun. I picked her up and we went to a restaurant for standard date fare. She was super quiet the entire time, it was pretty lame trying to drag conversation out of her and I kind of just gave up figuring she wasn't into me. 

So we conclude the date and I say I'll drive her home. At this she seems offended and says she wants to come to my place instead. I was surprised but glad she wanted to spend time with me. So we get to my house, I put on a flick and literally 15 mins into the movie she is buck nekkid riding me on my couch. Turns out she was a total nympho and we went at it for about 4 hours with a couple breather breaks here and there. I remember thinking it was hilarious as there were condoms all over my room just from that encounter. I took her home but she came back the next day and we did the same thing all day and evening on Saturday, just nothing but sex. She just wanted a penis in her at all times. She came over a couple times throughout the next week and honestly I was starting to get worn out from all the sex. 

We made plans for her to spend the next weekend at my house and I was looking forward to more tiresome gruelling but amazing sex all weekend long. Well Friday I text her and she says she's all about it, then a couple hours later says that she's changed her mind and is now getting back with her ex bf. I'm thinking... ""does he know what you've been up to for the past week"" lol. But no biggie, I was disappointed but over it pretty quick, she had some screws loose for sure. 

But wait.. .there's more! So my sister had been dating a guy for a while and they had recently moved in together. I liked the guy a lot and spent a lot of time hanging out at their place. So one day he says his brother is coming over to hang out along with his pregnant girlfriend. When they walked in my eyes popped out of my head, the girlfriend was Lindsey! She recognized me but we both pretended not to know one another. I had to take my sister aside and tell her as she knew all about the nympho story. Turns out Lindsey had gotten preggers right around the time we had our little stint and broke it off with the guy, fucked my brains out for a week then got back with him. "
"It all depends on your personality.

I've seen too many people try too hard to follow this quote when their heart just isn't in it.  Mark Twain was an adventurer.  Of course he's happy with the times he went nuts and explored the crazy unknown.

Are you?  If so, then yes.  Me... I'm more boring.  I'm very happy with my domestic life, with my kids, my steady career and my loving wife.  I don't really WANT a lot of wild adventures.  I just want to watch my kids grow.

The more important quote IMO is ""Know thyself"".  Know who and what you are.  It's okay if you're boring.  You get to define what success looks like.  Happiness isn't off the peg, it's bespoke:  you tailor it to suit yourself.  

Do what makes you happy.  Don't chase things you aren't sure about in the hopes they'll make you happy.  Look inward to find out what really brings joy to your life and pursue *that*."
"""Dude, as if anyone would ever hit on you."""
"Probably going from regular conversation to blowjob in 2 seconds. I was a little caught off guard, never really had it happen like that."
"Honey, I would spend the rest of my life figuring out how to become a horse too so we can run free together for all eternity. 
My wife also likes to get mad at me for the shit I do in her dreams. "
"Tried to explain to my ex that I needed some alone time, but it came out wrong. I think I said that sometimes I just want to play video games instead of hanging out with you. She started sobbing about how she wasn't good enough and that I didn't like her. Took me the rest of the day to convince her that I actually wanted to date."
And I'll show you a thousand other guys waiting in line.
I got temporarily banned from there once after someone posted this rant about how there are 137 gendered slurs against women but none for men.  I told her to stop being such a dick.  
"Do you remember that story of the guy who booked an around the world trip for him and his gf, then they broke up and the airline wouldn't refund the ticket or let him change the name on it so he went to the internet to find someone with the exact same name to go with him (as friends of course). The girl he found had a boyfriend. I recall reading her comments about how he wasn't thrilled with the idea, but she explained it was just friends.... She may not have been able to tell, but the rest of the world knew that relationship was over."
Good grief can we have one fucking thread about this where people don't group all Catholic girls as sexual deviants.
"Well, I would have alot of explaining to do..especially about the gay stuff, the shemale stuff, the handicap stuff, the painal, the rape scenes, the granny porn, and the incest stories. "
"I love my fiancée, but some days it's ""god, I miss being single.""
The biggest reason for that thought is that I miss having all of the free time to myself. I miss hanging out with my friends all the time. Now, the only time I really have time for myself is bowling leagues and when SO and kids are asleep so I can play my video games. I'm almost bitter about it, actually."
Chicken nuggets and his wife?

Lol shut up. Someone can give their opinion about a product without it being completely /r/hailcorporate
Is this really a thing? Oddly flattering. 
"When girl's have told me they love me, I've told them I love them back even though I never meant it. "
"she asked me to marry her. she took me on our balcony during our 1 year aniversery music playing while she sang a song. while i was at work she went out bought the rings and bought four goosebump books and in the first page she had little pieces of paper that said... will... you... marry.. me...? 

I love goosebump books and her soooooo i cried an said yes."
"For a second, I thought you were a girl and talking about a guy. Then realized it was /r/AskMen and you were just gay. That last sentence was a great twist."
I want you to cum in my shit hole
You should have made out with him. That would have taught her a lesson. 
"I asked my husband to help me count my breathing when I was in labor, he completely forgot how to count like a normal person and instead sang the [number song from Electric Company](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KDm0PqjAF78)"

"When she'd pull up in her car, and I stood in front of the window like santa clause himself was comming. 24 M"

"Yesterday, this happened.

Me: If I was arrested, what crime would you think I committed?

Him: *Pause.* Causing a multi-car pileup because you were rescuing a kitten from the street.

Me: Yes, this is the correct answer."
"This crap is why I stopped visiting /r/askgaybros. People in that sub have the unrealistic idea that every person should find everyone else attractive and that isn't realistic. 

Whats hilarious is when it comes to attraction, people are perfectly fine classifying physical characteristics such as weight, or hair color, or body type, but the second you mention skin color or characteristics unique to certain races people have a melt down. 

"
"Not my experience but my parents. They did not partake in premarital sex for religious reasons but they are pretty compatible in bed. Awkward for me to know but I still know. 

However, their marriage itself wasn't that great. They only moved in with each other after marriage before realizing that they weren't compatible as a couple. After 20 years of fighting and divorce threats...they are still amazingly together. "
