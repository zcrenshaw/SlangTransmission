"I've only worked in one office where pretty much the entire staff wasn't male.

The only difference I saw was around food.  Women all had a drawer full of snacks - like pretzels, candy or something.  Also, it was the first time I encountered candy bowls on desks.

Attitude is a guy that found a casually hot style, but is no longer preening. His handsomeness is effortless, like he's not worried about or trying in the way guys caught up in the dating scene are.

"Yeahhh I don't see this ending well. You may think you want to hear all of your partner's thoughts during sex, but do you really?

All of those names, images, etc. floating around in there. Imagine the conversations you'd be having after something like that. 

""Did you really just picture a VS model/friend/etc. while we were having sex?"" 

""I didn't even realize it! It was my subconscious!"" 

Yeah, no. This would be an absolute nightmare for both parties. See Limetown. "
"It makes no sense in my head. If the only reason you're delaying sex is because you don't want the guy to run away aftewards, then you're assuming he has no interest beyond sex. If that's so, you should weigh your expectations. If you're looking for a relstionship, waiting to have sex won't make him magically fall in love with you."

What do you think when you stare at women?
"Warmer and wetter. It's more pleasurable in general, because the sensitive parts of my cock are getting stimulated directly. Less stress (assuming that other contraceptives are in place or that you're willing to have kids), as there's no concern in the back of my mind about whether the condom has broken, and rather than pulling out after I come, I can just stay inside and we can cuddle like that for a while.

The increased ability to be spontaneous also is nice - if both of you wake up in the night and want to fuck, you can just go for it, rather than fumbling around in the dark for a condom."

"&gt;When you say some have trouble with dating, do you mean being in a relationship or actually asking girls out?

Both really. Basically, these types of guys have trouble escalating with girls past friendship.

Mothers raise their sons to be good sons (obedient), not really to be successful with women. A mother certainly doesn't want her son to treat *her* in a sexual manner, and so she may subconsciously erase or outright shame any sexual behavior by her son. 

Some things mothers say that inadvertently handicap their sons' ability to date girls:

""Be a gentleman."" -- Suppress your sexuality and expressing interest in girls.

""You have to respect women."" -- Not saying don't respect them, but flirting and teasing are *essential* to attracting girls. 

""You'll be a good husband someday."" Translated: meanwhile, you'll be a loser with girls now until they want a good provider to marry. I used to think that was the biggest compliment, until I realized it's a veiled insult. It says you're stable, not sexy.

""You're just like your father."" -- This one is *deadly damaging* coming from a single mother who was abandoned by a guy (or divorced the father). Used to control the son by shaming him into acting like the perfect husband she never had. He becomes a ""nice guy,"" or worse a ""white knight"" to prove he's better than his father. The irony is that the father may not really be a bad guy, but since he's not around the mother can twist the narrative and brainwash the son. 

If you're interested in diving deeper into this, the books *[No More Mr. Nice Guy](https://7chan.org/lit/src/Robert_Glover_-_No_More_Mr_Nice_Guy.pdf)* by Robert A. Glover and *[The Way of the Superior Man](http://ferryfalkenburg.nl/wp-content/uploads/The-Way-of-the-Superior-Man.pdf)* by David Deida helped a lot with undoing bad programming. I've linked to the PDFs for you, if you want to read them.

UPDATE: /u/spraypainthewalls shared the term ""Surrogate Spouse Syndrome"" and a relevant article:

&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; My Mom groomed me to be my (absent, alcoholic) father's replacement (aka **Surrogate Spouse Syndrome**, see bottom for link*). 

&gt; I'm not going to write my memoirs here, but it's taken me years of brutal, blisteringly-honest self-improvement work to reclaim my own emotional territory and define my own identity for myself. I don't think she did it out of malicious intent, but saying my family was dysfunctional is like saying that the siege of Stalingrad was quite a noisy scuffle. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've never had a long-term relationship or entertained the possibility of marriage because after living with Mom, I NEVER wanted another woman to take over my life and make it as horrible as it used to be. I've come light years from where I used to be, though, and I have no doubt that my full recovery is possible.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I think this pattern is far more widespread than most people think, and I hope anyone who reads the article below and identifies with it realizes that it wasn't their fault and manages to cure themselves of all the unnecessary guilt and shame they've undoubtedly been saddled with for years.

P.S. In contrast to mothers, I've found grandmothers and old aunts--often when drunk--are fountains of realtalk when it comes to what works with women.

&gt; ""Women try to break you because they're looking for a man who is unbreakable.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""A girl doesn't have to like you to sleep with you. But she'll never like you if she doesn't sleep with you.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Women feel comfort slowly, but attraction quickly. It might take a girl a while to get comfortable with you. But once she does and she's attracted, you have to act fast or she'll think you're not interested and move on."" The idea there were ""2 speeds"" at play was mind-blowing to me at the time. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Don't be insulted if a girl calls you a player. Some girls assume you're an asshole when they feel attracted to you. If she thinks you're sexy, she assumes a lot of other girls do too and you've slept around.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Don't teach your way into her pants. Tease your way into her pants."" Knowledge isn't sexy; flirting is.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Be a better flirter, not a better listener."" 

&gt; ""How to be the perfect boyfriend: treat her like a lady in public and like a hussy in private."" 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Attention is a reward for girls; silence is a punishment.""

I could go on but I'll stop. Could fill a book with those sayings.

"I want to ask a girl to help me with my appearance. I know I look like shit, but I have no clue how to look better. I carry weight in a weird way which means that clothes don't fit very well. My hair seems impossible to do anything with. Fuck, even basic hygiene stuff. I didn't grow up with dad that taught me stuff like this and my mom has been dead for a long time. I just recently found out people shape their eyebrows and still have no clue how you deal with acne. The acne isn't a huge deal anymore, but my face is already fucked from it.

I feel like if I had one girl I could just ask she'd get me on the right track, but when you're not attractive you're a creep.

Edit: I'm suprised at the amount of feedback I got on this. I started pming a few people. I will say I'm suprised at the amount of things I've been told about acne. It seems like a few people here are just taking shots in the dark as to how to stop it. (FYI I drink 95℅ water already. The occasional soda is nice though.)"

"Last year, I worked at a corporate travel agency. It was about 80% women in the office. Most older but a few younger ones.

There was never a shortage of office flirtations. Most of it was harmless but sometimes embarrassing. The older ladies don't give a shit and will speak their mind. On the days I dressed well, they'd make a point to tell me. It was nice.

 I remember one afterwork party where I was talking (pretty much the whole time) to one of the younger coworkers. She's pretty and we vibe well. The next day, most of the older ladies were saying how they noticed us hitting it off and whatnot.

So, yeah, just lots of gossip. I wouldn't even say drama. It was usually harmless but fun."

"Generally if you go to a nice barbershop they'll do a consultation and can tell you what would look good! A lot of them also offer eyebrow shaping, beard grooming, and so on. They're definitely pricier but if I were a dude they'd be worth it.

"Out of curiosity, are you close to your mother? Sometimes guys who get along well with their moms also have lots of female friends. Although they sometimes have trouble with dating girls.

Like with girls who date older men, I can't help but wonder what their relationship with their father was like. It could swing either way. She had a great relationship with her father, so she'd like to recreate the experience by dating an older man. On the flip side, if she had an absent or abusive father, she'd like to get the father she never had or ""do over"" it with a better father figure and get the love she never got. This goes awry when she's attracted to bad boyfriends and ends up recreating the abuse, not getting the love. 

Anecdotally, for both cases I've mostly seen those types of people grow up in single mother households (or mother-dominated households). "

"I'm a social worker, so I have spent my entire career in offices with a majority of women. I have at times been the only male in the building on any routine basis. I have no way to compare that any other office setting.

The one observation I can make is that they are very understanding of family issues. Being women, taking care of the children has traditionally been their role. So when I needed to take time off because of a sick kid, the response was, ""that's so awesome, my husband never takes the time off, I always have to."" So I never got shit over it, I got applauded for it.

When my wife was pregnant, they threw me a shower. That was a little awkward for me since I wasn't the one carrying the kid and all, but it was incredibly thoughtful.

Every now and then the conversations will drift to periods and such. Usually they just look at me and say, ""sorry"". I just answer back, ""I've always worked in offices full of women. I know more about the female body than I ever wanted to."" We all laugh and life goes on. I'm way past the point of this embarrassing me.

Oh, and because I was male, I got asked to do the 'heavy lifting'. change the water cooler jug, force open that stuck drawer....stuff like that. 

"
"This was exactly my experience having worked in an office with about 80% women, mostly over 45 years old. I would mind my own business if they were talking about anything related to female anatomy, but occasionally someone would look over and interpret my neutral facial expression as being embarrassed or awkward, and then they would loudly comment that these are things I don't need to hear about female bodies.

I've been married three years, I do happen to know a few things, and no it wasn't uncomfortable until you made it uncomfortable.

Still, these are the same ladies who often brought delicious home baking to work to share with everyone so there were benefits too."

"Things that require a readjust:   
   
- Scrotum sticking to the inside of your leg (balls don't stick to each other)  
  
- Testicle(s) being compressed by your pants, underwear, or sitting on them   
   
- Hiding an erection  
   
- Sometimes we're just itching the penis or scrotum    
   
- Something pinched in an underwear seam or zipper   
    
- Penis facing a weird way (sideways or up) that pulls on or twists the penis
   
- I think some guys separate their stick and berries, but like I said the problem is more sticking to the leg. The penis naturally rests on the scrotum; those sticking together generally isn't a problem  
   
Basically, we have a clumsy appendage that we have little control over hanging off of us in an awkward position. It requires readjusting every once in awhile for correct positioning and maintenance of comfort."
"If a woman sends nudes (not necessarily a SO, I mean like a fling/FWB), how likely is it a guy will share said nudes with his friends or post it on an amateur porn site?

Edit: Wow. Thanks for the responses and restoring my faith. I was under the impression that a lot of guys were fine sharing nudes. As an aside, I have sent nudes/snap chats to guys but I NEVER include my face, mostly because I'm afraid the guy will show it to someone. However....a few months ago I let a guy record me giving him a blowjob (we were both wasted). He said he deleted it but then last weekend he drunkenly joked about it being on YouPorn; I don't know if he's serious or not. So it made me wonder if it's something a lot of men do. "

I personally have always liked hairy guys (including body hair) but I've dated clean shaven guys in the past without issue, it's just not necessarily my #1 preference.  And when I was in high school, beards were considered weird!  Body hair was also considered gross.  The trends will flip again and beards will be considered passe and everyone will be all about the hairless face.  And actually, even now I know plenty of women who don't like beards."

"OK hear me out.  

I think a great superpower would be the ability to vibrate at certain frequencies. Gentlemen, we no longer have to compete with a vibrator. 

This also could be used for foreplay. I am quite good at massage but man, if I could make my fingers vibrate? That would be great.  

As it is I usually just attach a Hitachi wand to the palm of my hand and use my fingers that way. That thing has two speeds though: oh that's intense and GET THAT THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME. 

So I think that would be pretty nifty being balls deep in a girl and suddenly, ""How... Are... You... Oh....... Kay... Hbnnnnnnnggg""

Guys don't take stuff as personally as girls do.  We've been raised from a young age to insult and bug the people we care about.
"I'm the higher libido female partner, dating 6 years.  We went through many stages. If you're interested in a wall of text explanation, come on down:

* When I first realized he didn't want sex as much as me, I assumed it was because I wasn't being forward enough. I got even more forward, became pushy and pressuring for sex, which made the situation worse. He felt obligated which made it a chore, I got angry when he rejected me, then he started associating my affections with a lot of negativity because whenever he showed me affection back I tried to turn it into sex, which lead to awkwardness and anger. Due to that our non-sexual affection pretty much halted, as well as barely having sexual affection. We grew distant. Big mistake on my part.

* Talked about it seriously the first time. Lots of crying on my part. Its not something guys want to talk about, it makes them feel broken (and for the record, society and the internet really perpetuate the myth that if a guy doesn't want sex 24/7 there's something wrong with him.) 
It didn't really make anyone feel any better and didn't improve things. I stopped initiating to relieve pressure from him but we entered a dry spell due to that. 

* Like almost every woman in this situation I assumed it meant there was something wrong with *me*. I'm not hot enough, I'm not loveable, I'm not providing him with good enough sex.  I took it super personally.  Women aren't used to dealing with rejection the way men are, especially sexually, so we take sexual rejection like tiny little whiny babies.  I kept my dejection to myself so as to not make him feel bad and my self confidence plummeted. Around the 2 year mark things were the worst; we weren't close and both felt like shit.  He told me his libido would likely never change.  I contemplated ending things; instead we went on a romantic weekend getaway I planned as a last ditch effort.

* Decided that instead of wallowing in my own self pity I needed to build his confidence up because it was probably in the shitter too due to feeling like he wasn't satisfying me sexually (a huge ego kill for men.) I started giving him lots of compliments, both sexual and non-sexual, so that he knew I loved him for what he could offer me both in and out of the bedroom.  We started having some more spontaneous feeling sex. Woop woop. I could still go for much more frequent romps though.

* Moved in together.  I had some hope without room mates we would start to boink like bunnies.  This was more of a pipe dream for me though, and the frequency stayed the same. However it was nice to have our own space, and the sex we did have felt closer, more intimate and was really satisfying.

* A year of this passed and I started to feel my own sex drive waning.  I had spent so much of our relationship trying to curb my sexual desire that I now felt sexually burnt out. I had a lot of negative feelings associated with my sexuality, and although our sex was good it was very routine. Suddenly I became the lower libido partner in a way.  He still initiated sex about once every week or two, because I had stopped initiating years ago, but now it felt like he was initiating just to make me happy, and it didn't make me happy anyway. I'm a good looking chick with a great body and I felt gross and stupid. It sucked. Sometimes we'd have sex and I felt like I was just going through the motions and it felt so empty. I told him this and he said ""That's how I feel sometimes."" Big lightbulb moment for me.

* Another big conversation was had. He would have rather ignored the issues, but I needed to break the silence. I chose my wording very carefully. We discussed end games and big fears.  But you can't change someone.  Made some game plans to foster a more sexually inviting environment: don't use phones in the bedroom, go to bed at the same time, etc.  Had dope sex that night. Felt better, I felt understood.  I felt bad putting pressure on him again, but this was truly the moment I think he realized how badly it affected me after all these years. 

* We have gotten our bad habits back: using phone in the bedroom, for example.  But the mismatched libidos aren't an elephant in the room anymore.  We talk about setting aside time for sex sometimes.  We joke around sexually a bit more. Frequency is still pretty much the same, but I have stopped expecting it to change a long time ago.  Having my feelings recognized and acknowledged was what I needed.

* Recently got engaged. I'm in it for the long haul.  I have no disillusions about frequency changing in the future. I have become comfortable with that, its worth it to keep what a great relationship we have. Our communication is awesome and we focus on our feelings and needs instead of insults and accusations.  We both know that we arent trying to hurt the other, and that we're just two different people who fell in love and are navigating those differences.  It will constantly be a work in progress. It took us nearly 5 years to get to this level of calm and contentment surrounding it.

* Theres a lot of bullshit out there regarding sexual dynamics and gender roles.  People constantly joke about motivating your husband by offering him a blowjob, or cutting back on sex.  People think its super normal for a woman to reject a man, but if a man rejects a woman he's gay or sick or fucked in the head.  I've learned to disregard all that and we are happier for it.  I don't deserve to get sex whenever I want it any more than a man does. If its not okay for a man to be pushy then its not okay for a woman to be pushy. The internet has provided me almost *no* help navigating this issue, most advice has been bullshit and/or harmful. We figured out our issues solely due to my own soul searching and refusing to gloss over it.

TL;DR - I want sex more, I'm a woman.  Took it personally, got pushy, felt shitty, boosted his own ego for improvement, almost broke up, didn't give up, talked about it a lot, nobody takes it personally, its no longer an elephant in the room or shameful issue, its just us. Men aren't failures or fuck ups just because their girlfriend wants sex more than them.  The internet is stupid in providing advice (Except for my internet advice, I mean.. uh...) 

Edit to add: Lots of men will joke about ""Wow, that would be my dream girl!"" but the actual reality of the situation is that mismatched libidos are really frustrating for everyone involved.

Edit to add again: It is worth mentioning for context that prior to our relationship I was involved in an abusive relationship with often forced,  nonconsensual sex. This lead to a pretty fucked up mindset about sex for me, and in the beginning I was battling my own demons as much as battling our different sex drives. The only ""love"" I ever felt in the abusive relationship was sexual, so that's how I accepted and expected love and attraction to be shown (the ex would use love as an excuse for the coercion and forceful sex, in a ""It's because I love you so much/I'm just so attracted to you"" way.)  In the beginning, when my fiancé didn't want to have sex with me, alarms rang off in my head saying ""He doesn't love you! He's not attracted to you!"" As stated my sex drive lowered a bit as time went on, which is in part due to adjusting to him but also due to coming to terms with what our love languages were and that he was a different man than my ex."
So same as random boners then.

"A UTI doesn't impact a vagina, just the urinary tract. UTIs happen when bacteria enters your urethra. This can happen during sex especially when using coital alignment technique, but also if it's particularly rough or if there's a hygiene issue. Really a number of ways. Urine reduces bacterial overgrowth, which helps you get over the tract infection. Hence peeing after sex is an important safeguard for many women. "

"Yeah, usually a girl who is on the fringe of what I find attractive. She might be avg but getting to know that she's got a really good personality will bring her attractiveness up in my eyes. 

But that's if she's like a 5/10 already, 5 being avg where most people fall, and I'll say the point in which any lower and no amount of good personality could change it. If there's no physical attraction, like with a 3/10 then no matter how nice she is, she's not going past 5. "

"It's not so much that porn is important. It's more that arbitrary bans of things are ridiculous. I wouldn't call artichokes important to me, but if someone told me that I could never eat them, I'd kindly tell them to fuck off.

I also take issue with your use of the term personal preference. It's fine if you decide you don't want to go down on someone. That's your personal preference. But if you tell *me* that I can't watch porn, that's no longer a personal preference. That's you telling me what to do, based on your preference. It's hardly personal anymore at that point since you're imposing it on someone else."

Few people are interested in pursuing relationships with someone who wants to control their behavior in their personal time. You have no right to dictate someone'a masturbatory habits. 

Edit to add: Imagine if your boyfriend said ""Hey you can masturbate, but I don't want you touching your clit, I consider that cheating"" or ""I don't want you to masturbate, it makes me uncomfortable, but I also am not going to give you sex whenever you want either"" or ""I don't want you touching yourself, it just doesn't sit right with me. You can think about sexual things and if you cum from that it's okay but you can only have an orgasm in the specific fashion I agree with.""  If porn becomes a negative influence in the relationship vis a vis porn *addiction* then a conversation would need to be had. Veto-ing it from the get go is controlling and ridiculous, in my opinion

No seriously. I'm a really political guy and my views are on the radical left. Like the actual anti-authoritarian workers of the world unite radical left, not this sjw horseshit.

And I can't for the life of me figure out why but there is something unbelievably hot to me about getting with a serious hardcore right wing authoritarian bigoted blonde haired girl. 

My little brother is in college and is roommates with several young Republicans so most of his social activities are around people like this and I've had encounters with girls like that because of it in the past 

And it turns me on like crazy. I think it's the taboo aspect, knowing that we don't get along and in everyday life despise each other but having this secret tryst of angry hate sex. And the idea her being attracted to me despite not liking me so it's like neither of us *wants* to be turned on by the other, but do anyway.

Holy moly. It really agitates my class consciousness *if you know what I mean*. "

"Much more successful in person, but I don't know how/in what situations. I always find myself stumbling across girls that are great in person, we really get along/have great dates.

Online, I completely struggle. I've met a few and some are wonderful for sure. But it's a lot harder to get that initial contact (even if you're attractive), and you're much more likely to be ignored after a few messages.


The issue is, when I'm looking for a girl, I turn to dating apps as I don't know where I'm supposed to look in person. It's much more of an 'In-Demand' service... That unfortunately, repeatedly takes shots at my ego. "
"I think its slightly worse when the majority are women, because they're allowed to get away with it.  I worked in an office where there were 3 of us guys, and about a dozen women.  They would say shit like ""Ohh you wore your tight shirt, we love it when you wear your tight shirt"" or come sit directly on my desk and say ""I'm just gonna sit here for a while because you smell really nice today"".  

Personal boundaries don't really apply either, they would often touch my arm if I mentioned going to the gym or put their hands on my back if they approached me at my desk.

If a man did most of any of these things to a woman he'd be unemployed by the end of the shift."
"Among mature guys, this should never happen.  Though some men are pieces of shit, and you take that risk.

Assess the guy, if he's mature, reasonable, and you don't fuck his friend behind his back while dating him, nothing bad should happen.

"Seconding the ""not a chance in hell"" motion.

Women's number goes off physical attraction alone. We see a woman we don't already know, *BAM* number assigned. I've met women I considered a 4 that nearly every single one of my friends thought was a 9. Conversely I've met 10's who my friends have rated much lower. 

Their personality can of course affect this score, but it won't have a vast difference in *increasing* interest in a person. It can much more easily have a negative affect. "
"Guys - do you really not respect girls who ""give up"" sex ""too early""? 

This is one a lot of me and my female friends talk about... some girls really truly believe that if they sleep with a new guy too early, that guy will run away. 

Let's say you're dating someone and you have great sex within the first month or so. Does this put you off, or does it make you want her even more? What is ""too soon"" for you, if such a thing exists?"
Me and my friend tried it one time on this town whore we knew. I hit the ass he hit the vag. I was behind he was in bottom. Shit was nice till I was about to cum and my penis fell out and landed in his ass somehow idk but came in his ass been gay ever since 7/10

Also speaking of which if we have sex more than one time a day with a condom on my dick goes raw.  Without a condom it just gets softer like a baby's bosom.

"My main observation is that it's mostly fine, because they're people, like us. They have ups and downs, strengths and weaknesses, victories and failures. 

But there are differences.

1. We communicate very, very differently. This is a pretty broad topic, but in the context of work, I would say that a man should try to listen twice as hard, and be mindful of the delivery method. This is, of course, essentially true when talking to anyone.
2. Personality conflicts are frequent, and will run through the office with wildfire. Again, true of men, but it's expressed differently. Men are able to literally come to blows then go get a beer. Personality conflicts have much more fallout and collateral damage with women. They can be started over minor or nonexistent problems. As a man, you must not participate. Do not comment about what Becky did to Linda. Don't take sides. Don't even stand around listening when they talk about it.
3. Women in business generally have to work to be assertive. Men are often openly aggressive in pursuit of career goals or daily objectives. Men will ask for huge raises. Women will put in the work and wait to be recognized. 
4. That brings up point number four. Women will be better at recognizing your contributions and exhibit a greater concern for your personal satisfaction and wellbeing at work. 
5. They'll also be more prone to communicate *earlier* if you're fucking up, but they'll generally do so in a much more ... coachy way. Newer or younger female managers might generally try to soften the blow.
6. Group discussions have a different dynamic. If someone lobs a bonkers idea out there, men will often reply bluntly, without tact. ""That'll never work"" or other dismissive statements that might offend the idea submitter. Women, again, usually having a little better emotional fidelty and empathy, will look for ways to move the discussion away from the bad idea without antagonizing the submitter. 

Anyway, please keep in mind that generalizations can be correct because we're talking about broad numbers of people that *tend to do a thing this way* but that doesn't mean that every individual fits that pattern, or that the people being generalized will always act that way.

The main thing to remember when dealing with people is that we all wake up and want to have a good day, and our thoughts are mostly centered on the things we're looking to do, or looking forward to. "
"I want to chime in. I have a small dick and I have been rejected. I've got a 4.5 inch penis on a good day. Hell I'm a mod at r/smalldickproblems. 

Most people here want you to deal the blow gently, but I have the opposite opinion. 

TELL him why you're sexually incompatible. 

You know I have been with 7 people in my life, and the first time I was about to have sex I was bluntly rejected for my penis size. 

It fucking hurt. I wanted to commit suicide then and there. I wanted to fucking kill someone. I never did any of those things. Instead I tried to be better at everything else. Fitness, school, and anything else to get my mind off of my dick. At the end you become stronger to all of it. No matter what you do, the world will always fucking suck for him. 

Our insecurity is always blasted in media saying that all shitty fucking people are also people who have small dicks. Hitler for example is accused of this. Anyone who has a big car, or really good at something is accused of compensating for his small dick. No matter what he does that small dick insecurity and reality will come knocking on the door time and time again no matter how hard he tries to get away from it. 

In the end though it put me on a journey of self realization. It took a hell of a long time, but I honestly am so resilient to rejection now it does not bother me. No matter what the guy will always feel like shit whether you break up with him or not. 

Let him learn the hard way because that's the best way to get over something. 

I haven't fully gotten over it but I sure as hell don't let it get anymore. 

Telling him bluntly that you both are sexually incompatible will be the best thing for his own growth. Let him grow himself as a person to deal with his problem instead of dealing it gently. 

Dealing a soft blow actually HURTS MORE. Not only objectively but directly. He probably knows why you are rejecting him. 

He's going to feel like shit that another girl who he really liked and seemed nice decided to leave him for such a thing as a penis size.  

Let him hate you and get over you. "
Never. I even had nudes of a girl who ended up betraying me in the worst fashion and just deleted them because I had swore I would never share them. A man is only as good as keeping his word.
"If you are around a guy you like and want to have sex with him, how can he -- or how do you let him -- know so that he can help with making it happen?

I'm 40 and throughout my life I found about several women who wanted to get with me, but only way after the fact -- years or decades later.  I had no idea they even liked me, so either I missed the signals; or worse, there were no signals.  That makes me sad.

"Quite a few different things I could give as advice.

Depends on how ""low"" you want to go :P

My worst advice is to look at others, there are some fugly ass guys who get hot girls and vice versa. There are so many people out there who find love and relationships despite how they look and act.

My best advice is to make sure you think you're date-able and lovable. You don't have to love yourself, but if you hate yourself... why would some one else think differently?

I got in better shape and focused on my life, getting a stable career, finding friends and some activities I enjoy made me a lot more appealing to the kind of women I want to attract, while still being me.

Also, it's not okay to be yourself, if yourself is an ass hole. very few decent people want to date ass holes/losers/etc. Life is hard work, you often get out what you put in. Are you fat and want to be more attractive? Get in shape... simple answer, no other way around it."

The best thing to do is to lie your ass off, and hope that he doesn't guess the truth. Chances are though that he will know almost immediately.

"It is socially acceptable to talk to girls in public, just be aware of the situation and how she is responding. It's only creepy if you make it creepy.

Bars and clubs are an obvious place to meet women, and the women there mostly want to meet men there. However the types of girls there may or may not be for you. 

You can approach girls during the day, but obviously be aware of how hard it can be and don't let it get you down. 

The biggest thing for approaching girls in public during the day or the night is that you have to believe deep down that you are worth her time. Otherwise you're going to be too timid and basically reject yourself. I see so many guys approach women half assed as if they want to be rejected, and invariably they do. 

How old are you anyway?"

"When I started (at 12 years old) they were super duper heavy, sometimes leaking through 2 heavy duty pads at night. Now that I'm older, they have settled into a rhythm. First two days: heavy, so I have to change out tampon/pad/cup about every 4-5 hours. Next two days: medium, so I change my cup every 8 hours. Next day or so: minimal spotting. A light pad or a few pantiliners will do. 

Also, I bleed more during the day than at night. Some women are the other way around. By the time I'm on a medium day, physical activity can pause the flow/dripping for hours at a time. On a heavy day, physical activity will make the flow worse. Sometimes if you sit for a long time, it kind of pools inside, and then when you stand up it wooshes out and feels super gross. 

TL;DR: It looks like a LOT more blood than it actually is, especially when you spring a leak. It's also not the end of the world. "

Also, its not that the girls I meet from online are any more or less pretty on average, theyre just different.  Plenty of girls that would like me in IRL will say ""eww"" when seeing my online profile, and plenty of girls that like my profiles online would/will not be into me IRL.

"Step by step, man. 

1. Get a job. Gets you cash, a sense of purpose and allows you to do stuff you like.

2. Get a place of your own. Share with someone else if need be to split the bills if you're not earning a lot.

3. Look after yourself. Shower EVERY day. Brush those teeth. Shave on the regular or do a proper beard - don't have a nasty unkempt tramp-beard. Don't eat shit. 

4. Buy some clothes. Don't buy oversize t-shirts and a fedora. 

5. Do things that are challenging but doable. Hike a hill. Get your driving license. Learn to cook. Build something.

6. Make friends. (I know, easier said than done). Be interested in other people, ask them questions. People like to talk about themselves. Show an interest and it'll often be reciprocated."

"I'm gay, so take this with a grain of salt. Here's just a list of things I've observed other guy friends do and do myself in my own clumsiness:

* Ranty politics stuff. Like the stuff that comes across as critical first without much compassion. So, complaining about do gooders or going off about why vegans are annoying. You'll find women that agree with you, but it's more the tone that I think makes them wonder if you'll be willing to hear things from their perspective.

* Heavily politicized current topics in general.

* Gender war topics. Just avoid this until you know each other and have trust. Let them lead the conversation about anything in this area. Listen and ask questions more than giving opinions too quickly.

* Overly familiar sexual topics. Avoid these until you're closer. It really is different than what's normal with guy friends. Like don't be too casual about masturbation unless she's broached that topic and shown humor toward it. 

* Abortion. Don't be cavalier for or against on this. You never know if she or a friend has had to terminate a pregnancy. Talking about it as an abstract thing can hit close to home while you're just stuck in theory about this being something that happens to other people. The only worthwhile thing to say is that it's a tough decision that should be trusted to the person in a tough situation. Just defer to the fact that this should be left to the person dealing with the pregnancy without judgment or pressure.

* Details about videos games. Lots of women love games. However, lots of women and actually a lot of men don't want to discuss the details of the new Hearthstone card you got and why they make your deck 2% better. Men tend to get more into wonky stuff like statistics and stuff that make other people glaze over. If a woman does like this stuff, she'll bring it up. If she doesn't, it will be clear immediately that she's bored, but trying to be thoughtful and listen anyway.

* Past girlfriends if you're on a first date.

* Why the wage gap is a myth.

* Body confidence topics. Avoid abstract discussions of society's ideas of beauty unless she brings it up. It's too easy to say something clumsy that stings personally.

* Anything about 10-point scales of beauty. Don't talk about people being 7s or 10s or any of that nonsense. Bringing up how you think Scarlet Johansen isn't a 10 isn't gonna make her think you're more egalitarian about looks. It's more likely to make her think, ""If he doesn't think she's a 10, then what am I to him?"""

"My wife and I are pretty fashion conscious and will make sure we have our shit together before we head out the door. Here's my simple mental checklist for when she asks me what I think: 

**Does it flatter?** Is anything pulling weird or tight in the wrong places? Does it fit well? Does it show off her hourglass figure instead of puffing out or boxing in her frame in odd places? If it drapes off her bust in a way that makes her waist semi-shapeless, I'd definitely give it thumbs down.

**Is it appropriate?** Doesn't matter if flatters the hell out of her figure if it's not the appropriate outfit for the event we're going to. Even though it kills me, sometimes I have to say ""That's a bit much for the event.""

**Are the accessories on point?** Do the shoes pair well with the dress, does the necklace flow well with the neckline of the outfit, etc. 

**""But I don't want to say anything negative?""** A lot of men are absolutely terrified to say anything but ""You look great"" when a woman asks them how they look or what they think of an outfit. You should absolutely resist that urge. It's the equivalent of saying ""I'm fine"" in response to someone asking if you're OK when you're seething with anger. It's disingenuous and makes your input worthless. 

Instead you should offer a sincere appraisal that is focused on the tangible things that can be fixed. For example one should *never* respond to a request for input about an outfit or appearance by stating an opinion about some (perhaps temporarily) immutable feature the person has like their weight. ""You've gotten fat"" for example, even if its true, is horrible unconstructive. 

It's far better to make note of things that can be immediately changed and say something like ""Hmm, I like the color on you, but the fabric is binding across your back and bunching up. Maybe a different dress?"" 

In that instance you're tactfully acknowledging that the dress is probably too small and/or tight in the wrong places without giving a blockhead response like ""Yer fat."" You're also giving good feedback because you're describing exactly how the outfit looks (and how others would see it) in a way that your wife would clearly understand because she'd probably think the same thing if she saw someone else wearing it that way. 

Again, resist the urge to lie to someone and tell them that an outfit that looks bad on them looks good. Would you want her to say ""Oh you look great!"" when you were off to work looking like a god damn clown after all? Of course not. 

We should always want the people we love to look their best. Far better for your spouse to tell you something is unflattering then to go out in public and look like you can't afford proper attire or dress yourself correctly."

So now you have a boyfriend who not only watches porn, but also lies to you.

To answer your subject question though, if there were *any* chance that I'd be willing to date a girl and agree to not watch porn, then I would expect her to satisfy my every sexual need and desire at any time I asked her to - since she is prohibiting me from using porn for the times or things she isn't into."
