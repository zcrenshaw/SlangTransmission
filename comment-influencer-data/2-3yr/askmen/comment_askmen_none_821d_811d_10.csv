Look man I'm fuckin trying here​.
"Offices that are only for preventative care. They should be open when other jobs are not, get you in at your scheduled time, have testing available onsite or at least a phlebotomist on staff, and not be full of infectious other patients. An office just for timely, inexpensive checkups and referrals. 

Put it near a mechanic and I'll get my oil changed while I am being seen, and I'd go every 6000 miles. "
"Can you make healthcare less ridiculously expensive? 

*Holy shit, guys. Did you forget that there are other people in the world? Just because high health care costs aren't a problem for you personally doesn't mean that they're not a problem."
"I prefer the phrase ""happy spouse, happy house"". The former can put too much weight on the wife's happiness while ignoring the husband's, depending on the interpretation."
"He's 4.  After Halloween he would sneak unapproved candy out of his candy bucket and stick his head under the coffee table and eat it.  He thought because we couldn't actually see the candy going into his mouth, we had no idea what was going on.  Early inept deceptions are adorable.  My wife and I differ on how to respond though.  She doesn't want him to think he can deceive us, so she stops him from eating the candy.  I figure he's going to try to get what he wants by hook or by crook anyway, so I let some stuff slide and let him think he's pulling it off, because I want him to remain shitty at lying for as long as possible."
"No woman has ever hinted they wanted me to make a move on them and from my observation, unsolicited approach from strange men are not welcomed by most women.  It's just as well since I don't have the confidence to pull off a cold approach without it being cringey.

No luck on dating apps.  Never had a match on tinder and my standards aren't unreasonable.  Probably not as handsome a young man as Mama always said I am.

Don't want to risk ruining the platonic friendships I have with women, especially since every one of them has at least one story about how a male friend out acquaintance mistook their friendliness for romantic interest and made things awkward.

Currently going through the stages of grief that I am thoroughly undesirable and I'll always be alone.

"Complicated answer. You probably don't have the proper frame of reference, so there's no way I can explain what it's like to have three children who you simultaneously love more than anything, but who you also view as the primary obstacles to your life. Get used to contradictions. 

I resisted children for a long time, and my wife probably played a bait and switch on me since she was ""on the fence"" about children but fell to one side mighty fast after we committed. To be fair, I don't exactly suffer from ""baby crazy"" hormones and have no idea what it's like, and people are allowed to change; I enjoy that about myself, other people get that same courtesy. But yes, I did not want children and now I have three. It's strange to discuss. They have absolutely caused me to get my shit together even more than I thought I already had. But at the same time, I recharge by myself and can't do that except early in the morning, or after orchestrating some complicated system of babysitters and Rain Checks so I can take the goddamn dog into the woods for a long weekend like I'm asking for a massive favor that can never be repaid. But having kids got me to shed all of those hobbies that I was doing only because I was killing time, really. I wasn't driven to do them. Now I only do the stuff that is most meaningful to me. So less hobby time, but higher quality. 

Regrets? My only real regret was that my relationship with my wife changed permanently. She became, almost overnight, a supportive rather than assertive person and became sexually submissive pretty much immediately. Her entire attitude shifted to become ""I want/need someone to take care of me,"" and so now I get to play at being the big strong man in addition to everything else I do. I now view it as a blessing, kind of, as her allergy to making decisions basically means I have a huge amount of control and influence over my life. But we are no longer equal partners, for sure. That has paid sexual dividends, by the way (I'll keep this G-Rated), so I'm not saying she's a non-participant, it's just that since we were both switches before, things needed a little recalibration in order for the New Us to settle in. 

I would say that children don't get fun for me until about 3 years old. Prior to that they are needy little fuckers who are a total drain on my energy. Once my kids got old enough to actually do things and go places and were at least somewhat independent, yeah, things got good. "
"I dated this ex for about a year. When I was born, I got an ear infection and that resulted in a hearing loss. Sometimes, I would wear the small hearing aids just to hear better. Anyway, one day, after 1 year of dating, she started ignoring me and I was trying to get some answers. She finally texted me saying it's over and I needed explanation. She said she didn't want to get married to me if we got serious because she didn't want her future kids to have the same hearing loss as me. I was shocked. 2 months later she got married to someone else... "

"Assertive is using the authority and respect of your position. Bitchy or bossy is making demands you don't have the authority to make.

Being a leader is a skill, being a dictator is a great way to lose respect. This is independent of sex, I have women as bosses/co-workers that are great leaders, and I have men as bosses/co-workers that are bitchy. I hate the hypersensitivity around calling a spade a spade. If your leadership skills suck, you'll lose my respect. Your genitals have nothing to do with it."
"I was mistakenly labeled a stalker in high school, lost most of my friends. The girl who gave me the label is now one of my closest friends in adult life, but damn that was a serious blow to my social development and it comes up a lot in therapy.

Talk to her. I personally am ok with her giving me the least attention because I get a ton of attention from her anyways and it's nice to know she has friends besides me. 
"Honestly, I'd end it now. The relationship is already dead - you just haven't switched off the life support.

The closer you get to the finish line, the more miserable you're going to be and less you'll end up liking each other. If you call it quits now, you can finish on a friendly note and both get on with the rest of your lives."

"I thought I was being sneaky when I told my parents I had to stay late at school to work on a project, but it was really just to hook up with a girl I liked. 

Turns out my lack of details about the project and being glued to my texts gave it away. My dad let me do it like three times though before my mom called me out. Dad being a bro."
"Might be worth bringing up again. But before you delve into the topic ask yourself some questions first:

* Why does this bother you? Are you simply feeling neglected? Do you feel like she's disrespecting you in front of your friends? Is the lack of attention from her an issue for you, or an issue for your ego?

* Is this issue just covering up a deeper issue of not getting enough affection and attention from her at home? Discuss that instead then, not this scapegoat issue.

* Is this stemming from jealousy? Are you distrusting of her? Would you feel this upset if she was only conversing with female friends instead of male friends? 

Whenever you bring up a problem to a partner: Know what the problem is, know how it makes you feel, and know what you need your partner to do to fix it. Otherwise you're just plopping a problem down on your partner's plate (p p p p p) and saying ""Here, you fix it."" You'd also do well to acknowledge how you may be contributing to the problem as well (ex: In a group outing to you tend to be shy or sulk, which makes her not want to give you attention?) 

Edit: From reading your other comments it sounds like you may have some insecurities and need your girlfriend paying attention to you in public to bolster those insecurities. You say you want people to know you're a couple, but your friends already know. Do you see your girlfriend's affections as important to boost your ego around strangers? That's more your problem, not your girlfriend's problem.

You could try approaching the conversation from a positive place like ""I'm really proud to have you as my girlfriend and I like to be able to show that when we're out together. When you don't pay any attention to me on group outings I feel like I miss out on the chance to show how proud I am of you"" or something. But *personally*, I'd find that sort of attitude really stifling and it would make me feel a bit uncomfortable that my boyfriend was trying to control who I gave attention to on a group outing. "
"I'm a soldier, so I think I was bred for this."
"Without a condom- my college girlfriend, around 21.  She was on the pill.  It was awesome.  Life changing.  Even though I had to really train myself not to finish in thirty seconds.  

Without any protection- hasn't happened yet, even though I have kids.  But I'm getting a vasectomy this year, so my wife can have her IUD out next year.  Looking forward to shooting blanks, especially because we had two sneak past the goalie already.  "
"Most deliberately offensive things people could say to me won't actually get to me. If it's obviously designed to be offensive, I generally just find it pathetic and laugh at the insecure prick.

Really offensive stuff has to be stuff that somebody genuinely means. Telling me that I'm not allowed to have an opinion on something because I'm male/white/foreign is always a good way to piss me the hell off."
"Cultivate individual friendships with multiple people in the same social circle. The more people in a group who have a personal relationship with you, the more logical it will be to include you in group activities.

Build your own social circle. If you have friends who you think will get along, introduce them to each other. If you become a key social connection for people you will naturally be included.

Have multiple social circles. If you are on the periphery of multiple groups, you are not reliant on any of them, so being excluded from certain activities is less important.

Most importantly, stop caring so much. Most groups are wheels within wheels, right down to pairs of best friends, and everybody is sometimes excluded from something."
"You don't, ever. I have a son and two daughters and I am making everything up as I go. *Everything*. I do not feel grown-up so much as I feel like an 18-year-old with entirely too much responsibility and no way to outsource any of it. 

You have to get comfortable with improvising, you have to get comfortable with making mistakes (and either owning them or shrugging them off), and you have to get comfortable with projecting the air that you know what you're doing. You will never reach a point where you're like ""yeah, I can handle this, that must mean I've finally arrived."" There's no scheduled arrival. It's a perpetual journey. "

"Growing up fat and labeled a creep basically conditioned me to believe the act of finding a girl attractive was somehow offensive.  Consciously I know this is bullshit, but it still prevents me from making moves in the real world even though I'm supposedly more desirable now.

"This sub needs a ""Sundresses"" flair for these types of posts. "
Pretty good actually. I had a son and it turns out he doesn't like kids either so we got that in common. 
"I'm always a little heartbroken when I see guys make posts like this regarding their height. It's literally something out of their control, and men are constantly judged on it. 

My husband is the same height as me (5'6""), but I absolutely love it because we fit together like two puzzle pieces. I can whisper in his ear while we're walking without him having to bend over. I don't have to crane my neck upward to talk to him. The cuddles are great, the sex is awesome, and since he's small I can pick him up for laughs. 

Having been with a tall guy, an average height guy, and a short guy, I found that I actually greatly prefer someone closer to my own height because hugs/kisses/life in general isn't so awkward.

I wish so badly that you weren't teased/laughed at because of your height, and that goes for all men. I hate that so much and I wish it weren't something you had to go through, it's complete BS. "

Change into leather boots, pants, and a long sleeve blouse no matter the weather. Take every single thing out of your garage and line it up perfectly. Stand next to it for a few hours. Have someone start to inventory it and the kick it all over the place. Line it up again, stand there for another couple hours and have them inventory it again. Eat an MRE for no reason other than going to get real food would prevent you from standing there. Once it's past dinner time, put everything away. Then, go clean your room. Get black out drunk.

"Speak to her about it and take the pressure out of the situation. It happens to all of us, and the more you pressure yourself to get and stay hard, the harder it gets (= the softer your dick stays). What always helps me is going down on my girlfriend or me playing with her in a seemingly non-sexual situation."
"As for 'getting over' unrequited affection, subjectively, I have no idea. To be perfectly honest sometimes it never goes away.

As for preserving a meaningful friendship in spite of it, I have plenty of advice: Keep that shit locked up tight. Do not pursue 'something more' at all, do not fantasize about it in your imagination, do not even remotely expect she will change her mind. She knows you have feelings, and she's said she doesn't share them, so any gesture in that regard (no matter how apparently benign or romantically grandiose) is not going to go over well. Keep it together. Do not get drunk around this person or you might get the nerve to ask a second time which would be super embarrassing.

Meanwhile, while suppressing your feelings towards your friend, get out there and try to meet people who *would* be interested in dating you. Go on dates, go to parties, go to orgies, get on Tinder, etc. If you have someone you can build that sort of relationship with it makes it a lot easier to brush off those nagging ""what if"" thoughts about your friend."
"I agree this would be a great setup. However I don't know that any practice could survive on preventative visits alone. Also if something is found in the preventative visit that needs to be addressed, you would then have to go see another doctor instead of getting it addressed right there. Definitely an idea to consider though. "

**Slappers** - I don't mean the pejorative term for lose women, I mean women who think they are allowed to slap people. Happens a lot more than you'd think. They wind up and chuck an open hand slap out there and then act shocked when something comes back at them. Girls seem to love starting fights with other girls via the age old art of the bitch slap. You will also see them throw hands at dudes for any numbers of reasons.

**TNs** - TNs are ""Tooth and nail"" girls...the time comes to throw them out and you might as well be carrying a a rapid badger. Kicking, punching but WORST OF ALL...scratching and biting. Lady, I don't know where the fuck you have been or what kind of nasty cooties you have...if you try and bite me it's gonna go from polite to stern really damn quick. TNs often start life as Slappers then evolve when the reality that you can't assault other punters kicks in.  

**Gooners** - Gooners are a special brand of woman...driven by violence and drama but smart enough or cowardly enough to not want to get involved in it herself. Instead she has herself a ""Darren"". Darren's are big fuckers with few brains and less sense, the goon in the scenario. The Gooner will flirt with another guy until he makes a move, then inform the Darren that some guy tried to come on to her. Working on vaguest concepts of social decorum the Darren feels the urge to tell the guy to fuck off, and when his words fail him the only other thing a Darren can do is throw some bones. It takes 2 doormen to remove a full activated Darren from a premise safely, it takes 1 doorman to shutdown a Darren if sense doesn't kick in and he takes a swing at a doorman. You don't actually need to throw out the Gooner, she is magnetically attracted to the hulking brute you are throwing out and will follow you to the ends of the earth, screaming at you the ""Let go of my fucking Darren he didn do nuthink"".  

**Flashers** - Flashers are girls who don't want to pay the door charge and think that by flashing their tits it just magically gets them inside. Flashers have seen too many TV shows and movies and call you a cunt when you tell them to get to the back of the fucking line.  

**Donkeys** - Donkeys are normally quite girls who are carrying something into the club for their boyfriend. She is always nervous and he is always a complete cunt. Could be a gun, a knife or drugs...she will have it in her bag, in the case of drugs often stuff into their phone which is dead because they take the battery out to hide the drugs. Sometimes experienced Donkeys will have it tapped to their body somewhere, which can be a shite side harder to catch. If someone gets stabbed or shot in your club it's because a Donkey carried the weapon in because the kind of guys who shoot or stab someone in a club are always too pussy to carry their own shit and risk getting caught with it. Probation violations are a bitch.  

**Rollers** - Rollers like to party. They have no idea of their limits and like to get fucked up on booze, whatever drugs they snuck in and whatever drugs they can find going around the club. They go from standing to lying down in about an hour but they don't pass out. They just kind of...roll around the place until you spot em and have to put them out. Strong likelihood of upgrading to Pukers.  

**Pukers** - clue is in the name...don't ever be one...the staff fucking hate you more than anyone else in here.  

**Stabbers** - Stabbers are a super special breed of lady that, when a fight breaks out, instantly break a glass or bottle and try and scar people. When you try and put them out they try and scar you. Stabbers are weird because they really seem to want you to have to remember them and will do everything in their power to scar or blind you with a broken bottle. Stabbers are exceedingly dangerous because they try and use the confusion most normal men feel when faced with an armed woman to really try and do and do permanent damage. I have hit exactly one woman in my 36 years on this earth and it was a Stabber...because she stabbed me and I didn't want her to stab me a second time.  

**Gaydars** - Gaydars know when someone is gay. The reasons someone might be gay is because they don't want to take to a Gaydar or sleep with a Gaydar. Gaydars are such perfect personifications of female sexuality that someone not wanting to fuck them means they could only be gay. A Gaydar, upon being turned down, will ask you 10 times in a row if you are gay. Sometimes she will ask if you are a faggot. She will never, ever shut the fuck up unlesss you tell her to fuck off. Gaydars walk a awkward line in that they are ignorant and often loud, but know when to stop in order to avoid being thrown out.  

After that you have your usual selection of thieves, thugs, wankers and wagons...but the ones listed above are some of the less desirable archetypes I noticed over the years.

"""Man the fuck up"" ""Don't be a little bitch"" ""Stop being a pussy""

Some years ago I underwent a routine surgery that went wrong, horribly wrong. The surgeon botched it and ignored my messages how my post operation site was bruised and spreading everyday for four days where it finally required two 911 calls to the ER and a hospital stay. I had to have two blood transfusions where the first one was pumped into me at a HIGH rate that it felt like my arm was going to explode due to the pressure it was being put in, plus it was cold! actually shivered in the hospital bed.

Finally when I was out of the woods, my body was a wreck. I couldn't feel my lower torso and my abdominal muscles lost so much muscle mass I couldn't stand completely erect. I had to relearn how to walk by using a walker then a cane for about four months. My legs worked fine but the middle section of my body felt like it was basically missing. 

I used to play football, basketball, soccer, all sports frequently with friends and acquaintances, as well as going out Friday and Saturday nights and when I couldn't make it they were okay whatever. But after a couple weeks (just 2 weeks!) they started saying those things, man up, you're a bitch, WEEEAK! , pussy, etc. and it wasn't just guys saying these things, it was the lady friends as well.

To add, at the same time a lady friend of ours was admitted to the hospital two times in two months for stress and anxiety and she received an outpouring of support. Flowers, balloons, get well soon cards, visits at the hospital and at home after she was discharged. I don't want to downplay anxiety because it's a serious health issue too, but geezus I almost bleed to death and I got shit from so many former friends where she received love and support.

Oh and I was also a ""bad friend"" because I wouldn't give people my Vicodin and percocet. I was told I was lucky to get morphine shots in the hospital for my pain like I just won some paradise vacation for junkies. I experienced and lived first hand what it truly feels like to be a disposable male when I compare my hospital stay with that of a female friend that wasn't even close to death.

"There were times when I wanted a kid but in the end I decided on balance I wouldn't have one. 

At the end of the day, kids are expensive and we live in what I perceive to be a frightening and cruel world. What maniac would drag someone kicking and screaming into it?

Then I met a woman who happened to have a 3 year old kid. Probably wasn't going to work for me but she seemed nice and we hit it off. Then we really really hit it off. So I decided to give it a go. Met the kid and he wasn't perfect and had a few behaviour issues IMO but I was a borderline alcoholic manchild who's only saving grace was having a reasonably good job so who was I to judge?

Just having a father figure around to help enforce the rules meant his behaviour increased ten fold. He went from being a tantruming constantly (screaming a frightening amount for maybe an hour at times) completely incontinent child (frightened of the toilet) who refused to go to bed at night and had to be rocked to sleep in the living room. To just being a really nice normal kid. His bed time is at 7:30, he doesn't even so much as wet the bed, he tells me he loves me and kisses me constantly. Which obviously as a man who isn't his biological father has been difficult to get used to. The health inspectors were due to investigate him just before I arrived. They left last week giving him a clean bill of health and remarking what a happy sociable boy he is. 

Fatherhood was somewhat thrust upon me but I've genuinely found it to be rewarding as hell and easy. Now don't get me wrong, I am well aware that I am just really lucky and happened to come across a nice kid. I have seen the loveliest people raise a psychopath amongst nice children so I'm well aware were lucky. 

I love the story time, I love coming home, putting down my work stuff and having him jump into my arms, I love the cuddles and the constant talking complete shit that makes me laugh. My life just feels fuller for it. And if I want to go out and get pissed from time to time I am allowed to without question. He has the odd tantrum from time to time but it just makes me laugh internally, just stick him on a time out and continue about my day.

When she mentioned another I decided to be selfish and drag another poor soul into this world kicking and screaming. He will be born in September and we're very excited.

Tl;Dr
Ended up with a girl who already had a kid. Got lucky because the kid was a nice one so like being a parent. Decided to have one of my own."

15 years old, in my girlfriend's parent's minivan. We'd dry humped for a good 30-45 minutes, and my thick, baggy jeans weren't doing too much in the way of pleasure production. She suggested we take them off, and who was I to refuse?

One thing led to another, and she made me a man in the local college's parking lot.

A good 60s later and I'm fixing my hair in the window, feeling studly, and turn to her with my most winning grin, ""Do I look like I just had wild, crazy sex?""

* 3 things happen when we say ""nothing"" when you ask us what's on our mind

1.) We lost our train of thought when you asked. It's not that we're thinking of nothing (we truly believe we were thinking of nothing) we just lost it. It's gone. 

2.) We believe what we're thinking about means nothing to you

3.) We believe what we're thinking will turn into another argument

* We follow the golden rule. ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" You got a dick pic? It means that that dude would like it if a woman sent him pictures of body parts. Man walked up to you in a store and started ""flirting"". Means that dude would like it if a woman who found him attractive walked up to him. 


* If you hurt a guy emotionally, he tells you you did so, and you get mad about it he probably won't tell you what you do wrong anymore. From then on everytime you do something wrong it'll fester into resentment.

* It is possible for a man to view a woman sexually while still viewing her as a person with her own thoughts/feelings/goals

* There's a difference between ""submissive"" and ""agreeable"". We don't want a ""submissive"" partner, we want an ""agreeable"" partner

"It wasn't that I didn't want kids.  It's that I didn't want kids ""now"".  They were always something I'd 'get around to' when I felt we were ready.  They were always some future concept. 

You can imagine that's a state that can go forever.  I never felt like I was ready for kids and resisted for a while.  I was never good around other people's kids, and often hated the brats.  I was never one of those guys who can just get down on the floor and goof around with kids.  There's a disconnect there.  But boy was my wife ever ready.  Eventually I relented.

I am **so** glad I did.  My kids are the joy of my life.  They're also the biggest pain in the ass of my life, but that's how it goes.  They make me happy in ways I never thought possible.  No matter how you feel about other kids, there is absolutely nothing in the world like little arms wrapping around your neck and saying in a contented sigh ""I love you Daddy"".  Nothing.  The pride I feel for every little thing they do eclipses any accomplishment I've ever had for myself.  They are the best things in my life.

It's hard.  You lose a lot.  Imagine getting up at 5:30-6:00 am EVERY goddamn day.  Even on weekends.  There is never a day off.  I once took a vacation day but still went to work and just shut the door to my office so I could get some time to actually relax.  You won't go out as much, or drink or party.

And where does this biphobia come from? It mostly comes from INSIDE THE LGBT COMMUNITY. So when someone says that bisexuality doesn't exist, not only is it offensive on it's own, but it also trivializes all the stuff we put up with. "

"Make it not a shitty experience. 

Finding a doctor that accepts my insurance is a pain in the ass. Are they stand alone or in a hospital? If the latter is it a pain in the ass case where the hospital accepts my insurance but he's a private practice doctor working there that doesn't? Regardless, are they the right one to see? Do I need an internal medicine specialist, family practice, or what? Oh, how about a primary care specialist (wait, shit, zero results for that within a 50 mile radius when I search my insurance website).

When I finally narrow down an actual doctor to make an appointment with, odds are good they won't have any availability within the next 2-3 weeks. Fuck, I may as well just wait it out. Maybe it'll clear up by then. 

Assuming it's bad enough, I'll repeat the process 2-5 times until I finally get an appointment with someone I've never seen before. 

At the appointment, I'll see a nurse who will ask me a ton of meaningless questions disconnected from why I'm here. Then they'll leave an I'll have to wait 45 minutes to two hours before actually seeing the doctor. 

They ask what's wrong. My shoulder/back/neck aches with a shooting pain or I have a nagging cough or a nonspecific pain/ailment I have trouble describing. They'll act like I'm just trying to get a pain killer. After they figure out that I'm not, I'll answer all the same questions the nurse asked me. 

Maybe 25% they'll diagnose me with something I don't have. That obvious infection is really gout. That post infectious cough is really acid reflux. High blood pressure is because I don't get enough exercise despite working out daily and obviously being in quite good physical condition. Those weird swollen welts that appear and vanish regularly are really the flu. I'll be sent to get tests that will confirm an incorrect diagnosis. I'll be asked to come back in but by then the problem has resolved itself. 

Maybe 75% of the time they'll tell me that there's nothing they can do. Maybe they'll go through the motions and give me a steroid shot or prescribe antibiotics that I probably don't need. They'll say it'll help a little, but that I should just give it two weeks and then try to see them again (their next availability that works with my schedule is six months out). Maybe they tell me to try an ibuprofen/Tylenol/benadryl to see if that helps like that's not my first response rather than coming to see them.

Three months later I'll see a bill for $600 because they coded it as something more advanced than it really was when it was submitted to my insurance so my co-pay is huge. Two months after that maybe I get a bill for another $200 because something was wrong in the first bill. 

No thanks. I'll take a OTC pain killer or cough syrup and wait it out until the issue I'm having is more unbearable than the process of trying to get it treated.    "

He's straight up threatening a kid's pet because the kid is bad at his class.  Unsurprisingly, the kid's absolute worst fear is Snape.  Out of everything in the world, he fears Snape the most.

"At the risk of incurring the backlash of everyone who enjoyed this sweet and heartwarming deconstruction of their fetish, I have to say that I don't really buy that.

When the girl is swallowing the cum of 15 different guys, as is so common in porn, are you saying it's hot because she's into all the guys?  Is there a level of warmth and intimacy in money shots that I'm not noticing?  Does the dissonance of her making the sacrifice for your pleasure while you don't make the sacrifice to avoid her displeasure not at least somewhat ruin it for you?

I wouldn't think so.  In fact, I think these factors play into the same narrative.  It is an act of submission.  That's why a girl swallowing the cum of 15 different guys is hotter, because it's more degrading.  It's an act of greater submission.  It's a theme that's quite common in a lot of sexual scenarios.

But I guess if a guy answered his girlfriend ""because I want to dominate the fuck out of you,"" he may not be confident it will be well received.  Who knows though, if she was actually into eating cum it very well might."

"Exercise caution. Here's my previous comment about a similar situation:

&gt;Women who feel that you're stringing them along or who think they've been rejected after giving you a green light (particularly older women who have a sense of urgency) do sometimes resort to this 180 degree change and try to turn the situation as a way to get back emotionally if not harm you and your reputation. At any rate, regardless of age women who have these sudden mood swings should be avoided at all costs. 


Remember some women are fickle/unstable and once their need for attention is satisfied or if they feel you won't reciprocate, they can attempt to play victim. Consider contacting HR about your female boss.

There's no way to guarantee that you'll get the result you want or that things won't be awkward if he's not interested or whatever.  You run the risk of getting rejected and that making things awkward when you ask someone out, because you can't control other people's actions.

"I think the bland and generic dating app profiles stem from two things.

"354 days ago. 

I was getting ready for my first day at a new job. Up early, optimism in my mind, and feeling pretty good. Looked at my phone after I got out of the shower and had a voicemail from my sister. Me and my sister don't talk much, and for her to call me at 5:00 in the morning made my stomach turn to ice. My mom had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in January of 2016 and my sister had moved in to take care of her. I had seen my mom a few days before and while frail looking from the chemo she looked better than she had. 

I called my sister and through a cloud of tears she told me that sometime in the night, the tumor wrapped around the artery in my mothers lung had burst. I went over there and come to find out Her husband was too drunk to hear her coughing up blood and feebly reaching for him as she choked to death on her own blood and ruined lungs. My sister found her face down on the floor next to her bed in a puddle of dried blood.

I was of course upset my mother had died, but the thought of her dying, alone, scared, and awake pushed me over the edge. I cried like I hadn't since I was very young. I knew it was coming, there wasn't much hope for her because of the size of the tumor and it's placement but she never gave up, she never gave in. 

And to this day I get angry and, even as I write this, tear up, because I feel she was robbed of a chance to beat it by some stupid incident that no one saw coming. I'm still angry, I'm still grieving, and I'm still going to be for a while.  "
"That was me for a while. Dating is stressful. Having strings of people ghosting on you, or quitting after the first date, gets you down. I needed a break every once in a while.

Him- huh no you didn't there's no way I've never told any of the family
Me- dude, you played with barbies until you were 16 and you were awfully ""close"" to you're best friend Matt. I'm pretty certain I've walked in on you wearing your mother clothes before.
Him- what?

"
"I didnt exactly get ""shafted"" but my kids suck. My wife got me a nice little gift bag with a few things in it, which is all I ever want, I dont ask for much. 

My 5 year old son said ""happy Fathers day"" as soon as I woke up so that was nice. I cleaned out the garage and he was my little helper for the day so that was nice as well.

 My 13 year old daughter, who primarily lives with her Mom, was supposed to be with me, as this was my scheduled weekend, but her Mother decided to plan their family vacation starting Saturday. Not sure what right she thinks she has to assume she can cancel my weekend (per our visitation agreement, she would be in contempt) but Ive learned over the years to pick my battles. She finally texted me around 2 PM sarcastically saying happy fathers day (she is mad at me because I wont buy her a new macbook and summer wardrobe. I pay $805 a month in child support and it is not Christmas).

I have a 16 year old unofficially adopted daughter. Kind of a long story. She was basically a friend of the family that had a very poor home life and I just kind of took over care of her financially and emotionally. Eventually she moved in because things got overly toxic at home. This has been ongoing about the last 2 years. As far as I am concerned she is every bit ""my kid"" as my other two biological children. I treat her exactly the same, she gets everything they get (sometime I even favor her because shes had it so rough for so long). About 2 weeks ago, her bio mom and dad had a blowout which resulted in them going to court to fight over custody. For some explainable reason, the judge preferred she leave my house, where she has been for months and is the only stable place she has ever lived in her life, and go to her adult brothers home. Because he is a blood relative. Ive barely had a chance to see her since this occured. Yesterday she made a facebook post tagging her real father, and her 2 adult brothers saying happy fathers day. If she had just tagged her bio dad, I still would have felt a little shitty about it because he has literally done NOTHING as a father, but OK. But since she was basically just tagging the people in her life that are fathers, and did NOT include me... Yeah that hurt pretty bad. I wanted to comment on the post asking which of those 3 paid for the clothes she is wearing, the shoes on her feet, glasses on her face, or the phone she just posted that status from. Which one of them paid for her school supplies and cheerleading gear. Speaking of cheerleading; she had mandatory practices that she had to be at or she would be kicked off the team. Who left work early to take her? She just got her hair done; which one of them took her to do that? Her mother had access to her checking account and was stealing her money when she got paid (from a job I got her); who took her and got her a new checking account? Where did she spend her Birthday? Christmas? Who takes her on vacation? Who got her a car and is teaching her how to drive? The only reason any of them ""want"" her is so they can claim her on forms to get gov assistance. But happy fathers day to all those dudes!"

"It's not a problem if you are friendly, can read social cues and politely go on your way when you are not wanted. I just like talking to people, and if there is chemistry, it will soon become apparent."
Nope she won't let me during Shark Week.
"I started asking out girls at the age of 14. I was rejected over and over and over and over again. It was incredibly depressing and terrifying and made worse by the fact that I couldn't make friends either. I would have been a denizen of /r/foreveralone if it had existed at the time.

When I was 22 and in my final semester of college, a girl said yes when I asked her out on a date. She became my first girlfriend.

Now I'm happily married (to a different woman, though).

Good luck, OP."
"I do more for my mom for mother's day every year.

 Both my parents work, but my mom was the one who did most of the emotional parenting (by a lot). 

She drove my sisters and I around, cooked dinner, taught us how to clean and cook, signed us up for lessons, she's the one who helped us with homework. Talked to us about school. Got to know our teachers....

So every year I do more for her, and I later realized it. And I don't really feel bad at all because I think she's amazing and she deserves it. 

Reverse: my roommate does more for his dad because after his parents divorced his dad was the one who primarily raised him and his siblings"
"Play with your daughter.  A lot. And if you're offered imaginary tea, you drink that shit with your pinky extended. "
I don't think a 60 year old dating a 40 year old is a big deal.  I do think that a 17 year old dating a -3 year old is a big deal.
"Mechanic, doctor, dentist, clothes shop that only stocks 4 different outfits, barber and guys who clean out your garage for a reasonable fee. Anything else I'm missing?

Edit: I thought we were making a handy place to get all our boring chores out of the way, we currently have more bars and strip clubs than actually shops."
"My mother had called the police on me just the other day and the next day I called my father's sister asking if I could stay​ with her for a while. She said she had to think about it because she didn't know if I was a criminal or had charges against me and she had her job and children to think about.

For my own aunt to think that I was a criminal broke my heart and I just cried after I hung up on her. I felt so alone and wondered if everything my mother said was true, that I was an evil little criminal or Satan incarnate."
"Yep. I've been at parties where women talked about how unattractive short guys are. I've been at work where women in the office talked about their disdain for short guys. I dated a girl (who was taller) for four years, and her family and friends brought it up all the time; it seemed like the only thing that mattered.

I can deal with the fact that most women aren't attracted to short men like me, but I chafe a bit that they are so cavalier in bringing it up all the time. I don't bring it up or make it an issue, so I don't think anyone else needs to bring it up, either."
"My girlfriend sometimes after sex jokingly asks me what would happen if she reported me for rape right there and then, and laughs her ass off at my terrified reaction. I know she's joking (plus she's French, so I guess they have a twisted sense of humor), but there's a shiver down my spine every time she says that. 

She hasn't done it in a while though so maybe she's realized how much it freaks me out...."
That means she's not into you.

"Always answering you in a passive way. It usually means you're SO is starting to get tired of you and doesn't even have the gall to tell you off. Usually leads to a huge bottling of emotions instead of talking problems through to fix them.

""So how was your day?""
""Fine""

""You wanna go somewhere today?""
""If you wanna go then go ahead""

""Where do you want food from?""

"We chatted on tinder/text for about a week (because of schedule conflicts). The flirting was heavy and the jokes about hooking up were dropped pretty often. It was a given that we were gonna hook up the first night. We set aside the whole evening for it.

When we met in person, we were back at her place hooking up within an hour. We must have gone at least 4 rounds our first night and about 4-5 the next two times I saw her. I think she wanted a relationship but I can't be swayed with just sex. She was lacking in other departments, personality-wise (for me). The sex was great, no doubt.

We would keep in contact for a few weeks after when I was dating someone else and she would ask to hook up and meet up. She said she was a self-proclaimed slut, didn't know how many partners she had, loved sex, would sext pics with other guys.

I wouldn't say I dodged a bullet cause she was kind of a sweetheart but I know I couldn't be onboard with that personality. Nice girl. Glad I met her."
"Back story: dating each other since 1995,married in 2005. Neither wanted kids when we married. She changed her mind in 2007. I did too in 2008. Kids born in 2009 and 2011. 

When they were born, I wanted them and allowed them to completely change my life. This is key. 

The baby years were relatively hard in terms of lack of sleep, fitting in 2 or 3 naps a day (the kids not me) and a temporary pausing of my hobbies. 

Once they were both at a speaking age and a wipe-their-own-arse age and no more daytime naps stage, the fun starts big time. 

They adore you. They have never heard your repertoire of cheesy jokes. You are the king. 

Once they are both in school age, you worry they will outwit you soon. Seriously. Your non  kid having friends will actually be jealous of these fun and witty kids of yours.

- Unsolicited butt grabs/spanks - at least buy me a drink first, damn

"Imo most doctors aren't worth visiting. They are inconsiderate and have shitty behavior. They only care about diagnosing and treating, but never care to explain why or how can this be prevented, or answer queries when asked genuine questions.

I went to the doctor with massive tonsillitis. The doctor didn't explain his diagnosis nor did he tell what it was supposed to be. Gave antibiotics which obviously didn't work. I suspected it was mono. I drove myself to the lab and confirmed the mono diagnosis (and paid for the test). Went to the doctor with the report and he went absolutely nuts. Said I did not trust his diagnosis and medicine enough. No shit! Why would I trust a false diagnosis?

Ps: this isn't the only bad experience I have. "
she's in the right spot then
"Things I remember from the first date with my GF

"You throw a shoe at them, which is why we walked without them. One for the way to school, the other on the way home."
The most common unhealthy stereotypes that I hear are that men are dumb and/or violent. I generally ignore people who are that negative though.
i would never have sex again with anyone who did that.  it is never worth the risk.
"I had a gf offer but as I was about to jump in. I had the voice in my head say ""no glove no love"" and I just backed out."
"I fell asleep halfway through. I was 19 and working on a bar in Edinburgh, one night (morning really) after work me and one of the girls I worked went to an all night bar after work to get a drink and ended up at my place. I was pissed out of my mind and been up for 24 hours so after a while grinding away with a half limo dick I passed out and was woken up by an angry Scottish girl shouting ""Hey, wit tha fuck ya dooin?' "
"Escalation.  Go from casual touching to a kiss to making out and work your way up to where you want to be.

Obviously escalation is easier if you're somewhere where you're both comfortable and have privacy, so try to go back to your place or her her place or something.  You're probably got going to get laid when you're out at the movies or the bar or wherever."
"If she flakes on you or is late on the first date, is she really that interested? 

I don't really have anything that bothers me; I just take it how it comes - if I don't enjoy my time, I don't go for a second date. "
"Yes, exactly this! I see my boyfriend all the time, at parties we should socialize with everyone else instead. If I was dating someone like OP, or the kind of person he wants, I'd feel absolutely smothered. 

My ideal is when my SO and I split up at a party or event but we regularly check in every now and then to see how the other person is doing. We're focused on spending time with everyone else but we still care about how the other person is feeling. It's the perfect balance."
"Stop talking to him, tell him you're not interested and move on. He probably won't get the hint otherwise"
"Man, 10 min the first time? That is quite heroic. I was almost done before we got to the actual shenanigans. 

And man, don't even get me started on when I first had sex unwrapped. Definitely was not ready for how much different that is going to feel. Bust the nuterino in first 5 minutes. Thank god she was patient and I was full of enthusiasm. Ahh, those were the good inexperienced years. "

Tell her to fuck off and stop trying to change you. Report back with how conflicted she is.
"Ya I had a girl grab my ass last night and I was shocked. Women are constantly taught to not let men touch them, yet a couple of ladies seem to think it's ok if it's a woman touching a man."
"This was hilarious; we were in a club decades ago, my buddy and I.  We were standing next to a kneewall, and this girl jumps up on it, turns around and does a trust-fall backwards. Out of the fucking blue. She was tiny, and I'm pretty big, so it wasn't difficult to catch her. I looked at her and said ""What the fuck? If I wasn't looking you would have fucking crashed!"" She said ""I've been trying to get your attention for an hour; I figured this would do it.""


The crazy was strong with that one."
You're in the dad zone. 
"Dinosaurs. I did date this chick who did a course on dinos at college. That was dope, I was jealous. "
"Do a nice date and end it. Then get back once the night before she leaves for good and go no contact after that. 

You won't be making any good new memories with her, so try to keep the good old memories intact at least. "
Usually just means be more decisive 
"I got a really angry reply from someone for saying this once. My guess was that he'd never been in a bad relationship, but he was tired of having no relationship. You are spot on though."
"How are you? ""fine."" You look great tonight! ""Thanks."" So, tell me what you do? ""work blah blah"" Tell me about your family ""parents siblings blah blah"" 



When it's more like an interview than a date. She never asks you any questions about yourself. The whole conversation revolves around her and her interests and she never makes am effort to get to know you. It's like I am expected to carry the conversation and if I don't keep her entertained, she will be on the phone with her friends telling them how boring I am, while she never contributed anything to the date besides showing up.



Thank God I don't have to date anymore."
" Actually, she did.

...dad?"
"First time only took about two weeks to get pregnant.

After we lost it to miscarriage, it's been about 18 months with no end in sight. 😕"
I hope shes ok now. Those creeping crys are the most cathartic. You didn't know you needed to cry until you were already a wet faced mess.
Once they realise they need us to keep the porn sites running they'll soon leave us alone and keep other people away from us.

"&gt; I know fathers for the most part dislike their daughters boyfriend.   

I thought this was just a trite, old, stopped-being-funny-30-years-ago stereotype from sitcoms and movies?"
I'm really fucking lonely and feel alone 95% of the time. I am a shy person and understand I'm difficult to speak to. Knowing that fact makes me feel worse though. I hate that about myself but at the same time socialising makes me *so* tired. All this depresses me and makes me feel like shit. 
"My stutter gets worse if I consciously try to avoid it. I've had to deal with my stutter for my entire fucking life; I've taken courses, seen specialists, self researched and talked to other stutterers on what techniques and methods are best to manage it. MANAGE IT, because there is no sure fire fix, it's a life long affliction.

So don't tell me to fucking slow down and think. Just shut the fuck up, have some god damn patience and empathy."
It hits me the hardest when I finally take a look at my other dating options/revive the online dating profiles and remember how bleak it is out there.
"My ex got mad at me over a lot of silly shit.

Today, I feel like the silliest time was when she asked me about my past relationships, I told her, and she got mad at me for people I had been with years before even meeting her.

So, I ended the discussion and sent her home.

About a month later, she asks me to tell her more. I refused. She then got upset at me because ""your past has closed doors that you get frustrated with me for knocking on!!""

Well, yea. You can't handle what's in those rooms. Quit knocking :/"
"I was overweight/obese from childhood to around 21 or so, and even though I have lost all the weight, I still see myself as the same overweight person and I have a hard time believing that anyone finds me attractive, to the point where I apparently (According to friends) miss obvious signals from women."
Thigh highs with short skirts.
"Number 5 so much. And it's not only men that think this thanks to porn culture. My fiancé never had slow sex and was kind of uncomfortable when I told her I wanted to have slow loving sex because all she had ever seen and had was harder, faster, rougher sex. 

Within a few minutes of starting she began shaking. She had never had a vaginal orgasm before the slow sex, but she came hard from the super slow loving sex, with no clitoral stimulation. Since then it's all she wants unless it's a quickie, and she almost always orgasms from it, even after having clitoral orgasms in the same session. 

Pace wise is about 2-3 seconds to fully enter and 2-3 seconds to fully withdraw. She enjoys me fully coming out and then re-entering because she enjoys the feeling of her vagina slowly opening and closing. 

I FAR prefer slow sex to fast sex because I can go for a long time without getting tired and sweating all over the place and it allows me to affectionately kiss her, pull her hands behind her head and pin them there while still being able to gently kiss her all over, etc. I can really focus on other things other than just thrusting as hard and fast as I can. I also have a lot of muscle so when I become winded the blood flows out of my penis and I start losing my hard on. 

She has talked to a lot of her friends about this too and almost none of them have slow sex, nor have they thought about it being normal. Obviously not all women will want it or enjoy it over harder sex, but try it! "
"Prefer? Tone. It's sleek and sexy.

But I am not a picky man and it is not near the top of any priority list I have. Also it's not like I'm toned so I need to stay in my lane "
"&gt; I don't care *that* much

Yes you do. And that's fine. "
"Saw a girl today tweet ""find a man who thinks Saturday's are for the boys *and* you.""

So don't get upset because some women reject you because of height, everybody has preferences, nobody is attractive to everybody."
I've talked with her about it before but it just seems to be a consistent recurrence.
"Ex wife would get mad at me for working out without her. If she didn't feel like going to the gym, or getting out of bed early to go run when it's cool outside, she would be upset if I did it without her. 

Basically she couldn't stand me improving myself if she wasn't too, like she was falling behind or something. 

She was a huge narcissist. "

She can't bring something up like that during a family vacation. Especially if it's HER family. She basically did it so you wouldn't throw a fit. Thinks she's so smart.

Get out dude.
