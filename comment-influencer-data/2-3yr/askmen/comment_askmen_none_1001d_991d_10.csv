"A friend of mine, a high school teacher, had this to say on the matter:

""Talk to one of them for five minutes. Your interest will completely evaporate."""
"Lots of people believe men can't be raped. I have a cousin in Ohio who was raped this summer by a girl and no one believed him. 

Kid went through hell for a while until she confessed to him and his parents. They wont press charges, though, because the girl is pregnant and manipulating a 19 year old into being a father of a child she raped him to concieve. 

Maybe I'm biased because he's my little cousin but I feel like there'd be national outrage if the genders were swapped. "
"If a girl has sex with a bunch of guys, everybody calls her a slut, but if a guy does the exact same thing, all of a sudden he's gay."
"At some point you'll look at a young girl and think to yourself, ""boy when she grows up she's going to be pretty"".  Or my personal favorite ""I wonder what her mom looks like"". 

You're just not there yet. "
"It's really great but like all things, you do get used to it eventually. There are a few notable points though:

* None of them are really interested in you, they are mostly in it as long you provide whatever it is they want. Some just want a free meal or attention.

* Even then they won't be interested in you too long, they'll get bored and leave. For times like that it help to have others you can be with.

* If you bring them home, there is hair literally everywhere. I find hair in all sorts of places, my clothes, in the dishwasher. Even the ones with short hair seem to leave hair everywhere they go.

* Sometime they will get jealous of each other (if you have multiple at once) and it's up to you to prevent a nasty fight. 

* Make sure you set clear boundaries early on, or you will get walked all over and treated with disrespect.

Even though it sometimes a lot of work, I love my cats."
"Look for a girl who reads. Seriously I can sit my fiance in a corner with a book and as long as I keep her fed, watered and with enough light to read her book, I can do whatever I want for the day. She's basically a plant."
"Reading.

Get brain."
"Quality of the BJ matters an awful lot.

There's a lot of people out there giving half-assed BJs."
No looking at wieners at the urinals.
"""Not financially ready"" is the reason most women give for wanting an abortion (Source: The monolith Planned Parenthood study). 

When men bring up the fact that they're not financially ready to have a baby, they're mocked and derided with dismissive thought that doesn't really help solve the problem.

""You were ready to stick your penis in her!""

""Better man up and learn to provide!""

""That's not a valid reason.""

...

How would women react if abortion clinics denied women who gave that reason? What would women think if their friends openly mocked them for that? How would they feel? Is it a constructive way to approach this complex issue? Does this kind of pressure lead to positive or negative results for everyone involved?

If ""not financially ready"" is a valid reason, then it's a valid reason for both men and women."
"You must be as swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon, with all the strength of a raging fire, and as mysterious as the dark side of the moon. "
"Independence.                        
Because a woman who is not afraid of leaving you and knows that she can make it on her own is with you because she wants to be and for so long as she wants to be. You’re forced to grow with her, to keep up with her, and to be a better man to her (and in general) or she’ll move on. 
"
"Work to learn, not earn.

Don't tolerate a shit boss, move on.

Time is as important as money. Does your pay rise come with more work, so you're actually no better off. Does saving $50 a week on rent mean you have a 1 hour commute instead of 20 mins, plus more cost in transport.

Under promise, over deliver."
"This is one I really wish would change.  In college I knew a gay guy that got roofied and raped by some girl at a party.  He went to the police and they literally told him ""haha I bet you liked it.  If you got hard it wasn't rape""


It's disgusting."
"Kegels.

Stronger erections. Better orgasm. No incontinence. Sure that superficial stuff might help you get ladies, but I personally want to hear my ejaculation hit her in the cervix when I finish. So Kegels it is. "
"Prison rape immediately came to mind.  


Edit: Male rape/sexual assault in general. "
Beautiful women with low standards.
"North Korea is widely known for its utter isolation, totalitarianism, nuclear threats, and most of all its ruling family and their weirdness. There are lots of jokes, memes, songs, and pop culture humor about the country and the Kim dynasty. 

However, the reality of the country is no joke. NK has arguably the world's worst human rights record, with people and their whole families being put into prison camps, where horrifying torture and biological experimentation occur. One first hand account of reality in these camps was published in a book called *Aquariums of Pyongang*, written by Kang Chol-Hwan, a North Korean defector who was imprisoned in one of them. In fact, the country as a whole might as well be called one big concentration camp. People get imprisoned for things such as insulting the Kim dynasty to even owning South Korean movies (which are often smuggled in along with other goods from SK and especially China). There is also endless propaganda and brainwashing about the regime through billboards, TV programs, speeches, and statues. The Kim dynasty has a cult of personality that could put Stalin to shame. 

Meanwhile, the regime deliberately starves its people, and a major famine in the 1990s killed perhaps over 1 million people. There have been anecdotes of people resorting to desperate measures to get food, such as getting grass from hillsides. The country also utterly lacks electricity [compared to its neighbors](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSbcQ1aSZNYm_wRyZYleFu79w_TCOYY6LioqWmSpl5JTPqovMtMEt-tbvKD). My personal experience with this was when I once went to the Chinese city of Dandong, which is on the Yalu river, separating it from NK. The NK city of Sinuiju can be easily seen, especially a strange ferris wheel that dominates the view. However, at night, the contrast is painfully evident: Dandong has several highrises and a waterfront which are all lit up, while Sinuiju is pretty much pitch dark (with only a dim light here and there). 

North Korea is pretty much the best real-life example of the society described in George Orwell's *1984*. In fact, it may be [even worse](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2005/05/worse_than_1984.html)."
I second this. A few years ago there was this super cute girl in my store and I could not help but stare. Problem was she was probably like 17-18 and I was 29. Well all that magically vanished when she came to the register and talked for a minute or two. Jesus Christ I don't remember people being that much of a dingbat in highschool. 
"I really like it when a girl is able to brush off the bullshit. An example is when they get home and don't immediately start complaining about their day. Instead, they can just chill for a minute and relax."
First time my gf blew me she decided to be adventurous and try taking my whole dick in her mouth. She ended up gagging and then vomiting. I didn't expect her to throw up but I still admire her bravery in that aspect as she was pretty hesitant to go all the way at first. 
Lack of social media presence.
"* ""Wow, Sarah, you're such a great mother! Your kids must be inspired by the example you set.""

**vs**

* ""Oh look- **Mr.Mommy's** looking after you today! It's nice to see Steve *take care* of you this time- I bet he doesn't do it often.""

There's:

* ""You won't date me because I'm overweight? Body standards much?""

But you can call men out for their height. That seems fair. 

The disparity in domestic abuse (which in any form or direction should not be condoned):

* ""Look-that woman over there is hitting her boyfriend!

* ""I bet he cheated on her or some shit like that.""

* ""He deserves, it, if you ask me. Way to go sister! You show him you're not to be messed with.""


Then there's:

* ""You slept with a guy on the first date? You slut.""

Sex is a mutual activity- the male partner is equally responsible for this and yet they always get glossed over favourably. It's a choice that can only be judged by the two participants alone.

"Whatever you do, don't just do it spontaneously."
Welcome to the club every man hates to admit he's a part of but restrains from fully committing to.
I mean it's a college temp job nobody gives a shit just do it and see what happens.
"Here are three double standards that I hate:

* Play video games for 5 hours? You are a lazy slob with no life and are wasting time. Watch TV for 9 hours, even if it is a pointless reality show? You know how to spend quality time with family.

* Getting upset at someone of your race who dares date interracially, but then having no problems dating interracially yourself. This is common among Asian guys who bitch and moan about Asian girls dating white guys, but the very same Asian guys are open in expressing their preference for white girls.

* The way many Redditors, especially on /r/worldnews, interpret news in Western countries vs in non-Western countries. For example, a crime in the US or Germany is treated as an example of an isolated bad apple in a by and large benevolent society of good people. If a crime happens in China, India, or Russia, it is construed as an indication of how evil, barbaric, and fucked up the country and its entire culture is. Also, victims of terrorist attacks in Western countries are shown greater sympathy and solidarity than those of often more deadly attacks in non-Western countries."
"Recently I was mugged on the street.  Luckily, it wasn't serious, but we got in a fight and I have some noticeable scratches.

"""... I would never allow myself to hook up with one.""

Apply that same self-discipline to not looking them up online.

Biggest surprise was a woman that actually passed out due to an orgasm. Came to in a few seconds but you have to warn a partner about that!

Yes.  She's stopped taking the pill because we had concerns about it affecting her mental health.  I would absolutely take it once I'm happy about the extent of the side effects. Condoms suck.

"Two surprises;

I've only been with two girls, the first had a very wide vagina. The second (and still current) was so tight I had to slowly work in over time like it was a butt taking dick for the first time. That was surprise number one. 

Surprise number two, I've never been into blowjobs. Just don't dig em that much. One day my girl was like fuck this and just dove down on my nuts, flat tongue and sharp tongue on alternate, hitting the perineum casually as she went. I about seized, grabbed my dick and came immediately. Hit myself in the face and shit. 


Guys, if you've never jerked it while your girl tongues your balls, get to it. Changed my fucking life. I'm a nicer guy after that. 

**Edit**

Surprise #3 is that it's been almost ten years and it's still exactly that tight.

My girlfriend finds it strange that I think her financial responsibility is sexy. She saves well, has a great credit score, and doesn't revolve credit card debit."
"This is such a hard question to answer without more context: 

Do they lick the balls and deep throat? 

What position are we in (doggie, missionary, prone, cow girl, reverse cowgirl)?

What time of day is it? Am I just getting off from work?

How wet does she get? Conversely, how much tongue does she use?

There's just no way to answer until these basic questions are answered."
I think the main problem is that most women who perceive themselves as curvy are actually fat.

"A few times.

1. I realized she was more drunk than she seemed. (Law or not, I figure that if she's too drunk to drive she's too drunk to fuck.)
2. I saw something that looked like a chancre or a herpes sore.
3. She did something during foreplay that turned me off.
4. I decided I didn't want to have sex with her that badly."

"So fucking clueless.  I count my first real one at 18 and even that one was clueless, the shit-shows before were just terrible ideas.

At 18, we fucked, which was nice.  She taught me a lot about pop culture, being an adult.  I fucked up quite a bit near the end, becoming needy and being too clingy.  I acted petulant.  She cheated on me anyway, near the end, and kind of was the first girl to break up with me, truly.  ""I just need to do other things now, I don't want to do this anymore.""  We became very good friends after that, she's still one of my best friends even now.  Helped me with girlfriends and dating with some pretty insightful advice.

Need to shake off this addiction to instant gratification from the Internet.
I left a date sitting in a restaurant after she spent 45 minutes doing stuff on her phone and only acknowledging the waiter while I tried to make conversation. Two hours she called me screaming about how I owed her for the four $15 cocktails and appetizer she ordered. Later on that year she accused a guy she worked with of trying to rape her at the company Christmas party and didn't drop the accusation until she was shown video that proved it couldn't have happened. 
"I've found that you can get around this by using the words ""goddamn"" or ""fucking"" with it. ""That video of a bear cub sleeping with a puppy is goddamn adorable."" or ""You should see my kitten, she's really fucking cute."""
"I'd take the Gur-Breitbart pill, which is non-hormonal (basically a protein translation inhibitor that leads to zero sperm motility) and orally applied, if it came out.

The reason is simple: Such a preparate as described above would be less invasive than any other method of contraception existing today, and I'd be as happy to pop a harmless little pill for both our sake as she has been happy to get a much more invasive IUD."

"I used to think that there was no difference between Friendship relationships and Romantic relationships.  That they were the same kind of relationship, just at different levels.  That being a good friend was the first step on the path to a romantic relationship.

I didn't realize that there needed to be that romantic sexual spark right off the bat.  That feelings would be and remain platonic if they start that way.  

This made me a bit of a 'nice guy' for a while.  Don't get me wrong, I never felt *entitled* to a romantic relationship with someone, but I didn't understand why none ever formed around the friendships I built.  There must be something wrong with me, I must just be incredibly undesirable for all of these things I've done still haven't been enough for a relationship to move beyond this stage.  

I saw people who did demonstrate that sexual spark right off the bat as people taking advantage of others, skipping past all the meaningful relationship building in an attempt to satisfy their physical wants.  

It took a long time and a woman who accused me of lying to her about what it is I wanted to really begin to understand.  Lying?  never!  I was always very honest.  I wasn't being a friend to trick you into falling in love with me, or to make you owe it to me or anything like that.  I was being a friend because I thought that's what you *do*.  I *enjoyed* the friendship and thought that more naturally came of it if the friendship became deep enough.  But the idea that someone thought I was the deceitful one opened my eyes to the fact that maybe this isn't how things work after all.

It was very confusing.  How are you supposed to know you want to be with someone romantically if you aren't friends first?  Why do you have to make that decision right off the bat or be labeled a liar once you do fall for someone who has been a friend because you didn't tell them you wanted them from square one.

Eventually the division between the kinds of relationships began to come into focus and cleared a lot of these misconceptions away.  It's also left me with an appreciation for the frustration of some of the 'nice guys' out there.  To be clear, I have ZERO time for anybody who feels owed anything... and even less time for people who blame others for getting ""Friendzoned"".  Son... you did that to yourself, just like I did.  The key here is to learn from your mistakes instead of blaming others from them.  "
"You basically figure it out as you go along and hopefully don't make the same mistake twice. Issues will arise, but if you're good together then things should eventually get sorted out. 

As for the biggest thing I was clueless about during my early days that would be having respect for myself. Good relationships are give and take. If you don't stand up for yourself, then you'll most likely end up with people who will do a whole lot of taking and not much giving. "

"Look, I'm going to utter an unpopular truth:

The human body doesn't have a chronometer built in.  We can't tell age with 100% accuracy by looking, and secondary sex characteristics (which we are evolutionarily driven to notice) often develop before young people are mature enough to handle adult relationships.

Relationships with people who are not of age is absolutely wrong and you cannot and should not pursue them; no question there.

But it is perfectly normal for your biological systems to react and send you data about what you see around you.  Men and women will both be able to recognize post-pubertal attractiveness regardless of age.

Our bodies send us messages all the time.

When I go for a run, mine tells me it's exhausted and wants to stop after 100 yards.  I ignore it and go three miles.

Right now, it's telling me it wants a large chocolate malt.  Gonna ignore that too.

When the message about an attractive young person comes through, recognize it as data from your body, don't get disturbed about it, just see it for what it is and filter it out.

As others have said, if you talked to them you wouldn't be attracted anyway.  They're children.

Our impulses don't make us monsters.  Our actions could.

If you feel a compulsion you are worried you can't control or you start chatting these girls up, seek help.

And quit Facebook stalking them.  "

Because what am I supposed to do?  Yes I am bigger than her and could lay her out if I tried but it's a losing proposition.  Either get beat or defend myself and land *serious* domestic assault charges.  We were in a parking garage in San Francisco after a concert.  Fuck the people that just watched."
"Was in a social situation with my boss who was trying to pick up some women at the bar during a recent trip.

Ended up scoring with one of them, which sorta cheesed him off a bit the next day when he found out. :D"

Lay your head on my chest when we sleep; not all night, but long enough that I get that comforting wave over my body. Randomly sit on my lap when we are watching TV. Let me have the last scoop of Half Baked Ice Cream. Hold my hand when we walk the dog. Hold my hand in the mall. Hold my hand around your friends.

"I'll start with my story

I met a girl, who we'll refer to as Nora, on Tinder. I had never actually gone through with a Tinder date before so I was kind of nervous about the whole thing

Well Nora, by her pictures appearances, was a cute irish looking girl. Red hair, bright green eyes, freckles, all that good celtic stuff. So we got to talkin for about a week or so before I asked her out. Usual dinner and a movie sort of thing. She had mentioned that she liked disney films so the plan was to get some supper then go watch the new Jungle Book. 

Well I meet her outside the restaurant, and if she hadnt come to find me, I probably would have been there waiting all night for her to show up. This girl is a giant and has a face that looks like a bat's ass flipped inside out. I was half disappointed, and half impressed at how good she had to have been at photoshop.

I had already decided that since she had lied to me, there was 0% chance at a second date. I struggled a bit with my shoulder angel and shoulder devil on wether to drop the date or not. Well my lighter side won and I decided to play the part of a gentleman that night.


So we sit down to eat and she starts asking me, ""What kind of music do you listen to?"" Typical small talk sort of question. No problem here right? Well I told her im kind of a hipster and listen to some weird shit (introduced her to Caravan Palace. If youve never heard of Electro Swing, try them out theyre awesome) But anyways, she replies with ""Well pretty much all I listen to is Taylor Swift, I hope that doesnt bug you.""
The shoulder devil peaks his head up long enough for me to mumble ""It sure doesnt help"" 
""Why dont you like taylor swift?"" She tenses up at this point and I wasnt sure wether she was more scared or angry at my responce. Probably both
I told her I personally think she's one of the pop stars that has kind of ruined the old school way country was done, and even after she became just a pop star I thought her choices on stories to sing about were too similar.

Nora loses her shit. 

Right there in the middle of the restaurant she start semi yelling, ""Well those songs are important to me and they got me through some really hard times and Ive memorized every single one by heart!"" 

At this point there are people staring and Ive decided this date is over. I got to experience one of those ""check please"" moments you see in sitcoms, as we sat there in silence. 

We were both embarrassed, and after I paid the check (figured it was still the right thing to do) we walked out. And she asked ""So are we still gonna go see the movie""

I just started walking to my car and said ""Nah""

"Saying ""Yes"" to everything that comes across your desk.

If you are not 100% in love with your job (but do like it), learn to say ""No"" when you are super busy. If you do not learn to turn things down, you will get burnt out, and you will regret it. Real jobs are not like school. There is no set amount of work with an end goal of a final paper/exam with a final grade. People will just keep giving you more work if you say you can take it. Working 60+ hours in a week on low visibility projects is a waste of your time. You will likely not get paid any extra, and you will never get those hours back. Go join a gym, hang out with friends, or go take a night class. You'll probably actually do better at your job if you work slightly less time than you think you ought to."

"A tall guy who sees women's dismissiveness over height, this is the most blatant form of shallowness that's shared by the vast majority of women, and it's ugly. Women apparently have every right to not only dismiss guys shorter than them, but shorter than their ""ideal"" height of usually 6', without appearing shallow to most of society. It comes off as an understood preference because how could you possibly feel girly around a guy who isn't taller than you? But a man with a preferred weight, cup size, even hair length is shallow, ""She can go from long hair to pixie cut and you not liking it makes you shallow,"" but a woman with a guy shorter than her gets questionned about how much money he must have, since it couldn't possibly be his personality.

It's a dating death sentence, and I see fewer women accepting of a short height than a small dick, despite height having almost nothing to do with sex. I completely understand all the short guys who spend so much time and money at the gym and on flashy clothes, cars, and a sexually aggressive personality - they have to."

I have no use for such services myself but many do and don't seek it out for fear of that sort of stigma. I wouldn't go so far as to say causation, but I do believe this has an effect on why we have things like school shootings."
Don't romanticize your career. Everything has pros and cons no matter how much you think you'll love it. Make sure whatever you decide to do is the right decision for you. 
"I stopped initiating for a while and it turned into not dating for 2-3 years. When I wasn't focused on dating, I had 7 nights a week to myself, all of my income was available for what I wanted to do, and despite sleeping alone every night, I still had a very fun and fulfilling life. Eventually doing that long enough (and trying to be mindful about my inner wants/needs), I was happy with who I was and the kind of life I was living, I felt more motivated to go out and initiate contact with the women. And once I did, I only went on a couple of dates before I found the woman that I've now been married to for the past 3 years. 

So I guess, if you don't feel it right now, then don't do it right now.

"I want a girlfriend but can't seem to get one. 

During work today I was texting some girl. We made a plan for her to come to my place after I finished at the gym. She brought a bottle of wine. We drank it and chatted. Then we had sex, she got dressed, and left. I have a couple of other women who'd do something similar for me. 

A few years ago I'd have thought that such an arrangement was living the dream. But I'm here alone and I just feel hollow. The instant gratification of a hookup is nowhere close to the feeling of sleeping with someone you really care about. "
"For context... we dated for 3 years, then got married, then 7 years later she had an affair and we got divorced. The affair was her out though... she wanted the marriage to end and knew that I'd keep trying to make it work as long as I saw hope.

Early in the relationship things were great... we were young and in love and idealistic. We were best friends, talked about everything, loved spending time together...

Over time that changed though. Careers and stress, finances, life as an adult... it started to slowly wear us down. We stopped communicating, started spending more time doing thing separately, spending time apart from each other.

The emotional intimacy died. We tried to fix it a few times, but after a few weeks we'd slip back into the same patterns.

We stopped having sex, and I started to resent that. Once every few months wasn't enough for me... I passive-aggressively decided not to push for it and see how long our drought would go... 11 months later we still hadn't had sex despite sleeping in the same bed next to each other every single night.

We didn't cuddle together anymore, didn't really talk... both were bitter constantly keeping score about all of our little pet peeves.

Things got really awful in the months before the affair. We started couples counseling and she would just cry whenever it was her turn to share... she never actually said anything in our counselling sessions, but I could see how miserable she was.

She could see that I genuinely wanted to try and work on things, try to make things better and I think that just made her feel trapped...

Anyway... TLDR: I learned not to take my partner and our relationship for granted. Intimacy needs to be nurtured daily. If you're not actively trying to make the relationship good, you're probably allowing it to get worse."
"M21 and GF19 here. Did it, liked it, will continue to do it. It feels like taking a poop at first, but that goes away after a while. Helps to have actually pooped at least half an hour before so you don't accidentally shit yourself in bed (anal is essentially pooping and un-pooping over and over, your body WILL notice and WILL try to help you out). Also use lube and go slow, invest in some butt plugs, etc. Overstretching your butt is REALLY REALLY painful, like curl into fetal position painful, so don't rush it. But if you get there it can be lots of fun!

If you're really into searching for the prostate orgasm, a prostate vibrator might be a better bet. Pegging feels good but in a kind of different way. It's definitely a bit more mind-fuck-y.

"One of the things that people don't realize is that ludicrous, unbelievable propaganda can be just as powerful as its more insidious sibling.

From Theodore Dalrymple:

&gt; In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to *humiliate*; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.

------

Of course the propaganda is ridiculous. That's the point. The DPRK knows full well that its people don't buy its bullshit. That doesn't matter, and in fact the smellier the bullshit, the better, because it makes an even stronger statement. ""We can force you to reject reality in favor of bullshit. We will do it with prison camps, terror-famine, and death. You will repeat this bullshit, this obvious, ludicrous bullshit, and you will pretend it's true for every moment of every day because *we own you*."""

Secondly, there's no baked in political party line for this. The GOP definitely falls into the ""law and order"" sort of attitude, and prisoners are at worst subhuman (so they ""deserve it"") and at best, well, gotta appear tough on crime, so what can you do? The left, on the other hand, isn't going to win by acknowledging this problem, because they're spent decades framing sexual assault as a women's rights issue. If they talk about prison rape, which is largely a men's issue, then they're going to start a broader conversation about male rape and sexual abuse, which is going to retard the strength of sexual assault as a women's issue. Things like women's shelters will become less about women, or may lose money, etc.

It's a losing situation for basically any politician. "

"It's pronounced pho, duh. "
"To me this is a big one.

People can have whatever vices they want, as long as they're aware and in control of them. I know people in perfectly happy relationships with very needy people, but they're aware of themselves and the neediness is an indulgence, not a compulsion."
"Sitting on the couch, hi I was reading about mens g spot, want to try it?"
"The fact that you felt the need to clarify that says it all. I don't mean that meanly, it just shows how having a small dick is so universally seen as a bad thing, not just physically but even *morally*, where people will ascribe a small penis as karmic justice for being an asshole, that to acknowledge that the situation is fucked up, pretty much any dude would feel the need to add that they don't actually have a small dick, they're just defending it. 

The good thing is that having a small dick is not as bad as popular culture makes it out to be, but it's fucked up the way it's portrayed, and the way it hurts people."
"These are great, especially the bit about a shit boss. 

Regarding time, I'd actually say it's more important than money. Money, while hard to come by, is a renewable resource. Each moment of time that slips by will never return. Ever."
My best decision this year was not to travel.  I paid off three credit cards and a student loan.

Men are allowed to show emotions: happiness or anger. 
"As a darker skinned Hispanic guy who is dating a tall beautiful blonde of mostly Scandinavian background, will explain the beautiful part later, it's definitely been an eye opening experience.

Growing up, I always wondered why I saw so many Latinas with white guys but hardly the other way around. I witnessed the same thing for all minority groups except black guys when I saw it. No matter where in the USA you go, it is rare to see white women (especially if they are attractive) date anything other than white or black guys in my experience. After being with my girlfriend, I slowly learned why such is the case.

I've had countless encounters where aggressive guys have made moves on my girlfriend in front of me, she has gone over to my side to get away from them, and then the guys have wanted to fight me for it and I've almost had a few confrontations that led to fist fights. Hispanic women who have seen us out together aggressively try to make moves on me and when I reject their advances, they reply saying ""you wouldn't do it if I was white"" in a hostile way. Guys of other minority groups make it a subject of discussion, constantly asking me what I am doing with a white girl and make me feel like there is something wrong with me for it.

My white friends who have dated latinas, Asian women, and women of various other races get a far more warm reception. 

I feel like in American culture, there is a double standard towards interracial relationships. Interracial relationships are all cute and ""progressive"" when white guys and women of minority groups mix it up and in some cases when white girls go for black guys but when any other minority group goes for white girls? They're an issue. The guy is insecure, he hates his own race, the white girl is desperate, and you name it.

It's like interracial relationships are perfectly fine when white guys get to date attractive women of various backgrounds but not when white girls date guys of certain backgrounds. I don't think any area of the USA is an exception to this rule because tbh, seeing attractive white girls go for latino and Asian guys is even rare as hell out in California!"
"I don't get this. If there's only the middle urinal, I'm not waiting. Are other men that terrified that other men are looking? If they are looking, what are they afraid they're going to see. Have some self confidence about your pecker."
Girls who know technical jargon. Tell me about database isolation levels baby. 
"My SO is supposed to be my best friend. I get drunk with my friends.

I don't want to date an alcoholic, but my girl should definitely go out drinking with me. Actually some of my best nights with my fiance have been spent just having some drinks and shooting the shit. It just wouldn't be the same if she was drinking water. "
"At what point does it become gay? Like if I get a blow job from a guy am I gay? What if he makes eye contact while doing it? 

I have some questions I need answered guys."
"See but here I'm getting conflicting input. I hear guys say this,  but then I see guys who say they need to feel needed or they are put off by women who don't expect them to fulfill a roll like mechanic or provider. I guess kinda like they don't know what to do with themselves around a woman who doesn't fit that mold? I know everyone is different but it always surprises me to see otherwise put together guys who want a woman who is emotionally and fiscally dependent on them. "
So you are saying the [front fell off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m5qxZm_JqM).
"Being a (male) virgin. It's especially obnoxious because it's mostly women who make fun of it. Like, if all you have to do to get laid is exist in public and look mostly acceptable, I'm pretty sure you have no room to talk. 😂"
"In Britain the study of gait and proper walking has been the subject of some study for some time. See this documentary on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZlBUglE6Hc

do guys feel super grossed out when that happens or do they just view it as a acceptable risk of getting a bj?
"This is an incredible idea. One problem with my last relationship was that she wanted to do something with me every day, regardless of my work schedule or previous plans. 

Maybe I'll start looking for dates in the local library lol"
"Well, my strap-on experience probably isn't really what you're looking for.

Once my wife donned a strap-on and laid on her back on the bed while a woman we used to play with climbed on top of her so she could be DPd, with me entering her anally.

It was pretty fucking awesome."

"I watched a documentary on NK and it made me so uncomfortable. At one point the camera guy laid down in front of a statue of Kim to get a good angle for the picture and the guides with him got extremely pissed off and nearly kicked him out of the country. At another point they were visiting a regular family there, and this little tiny maybe 4 or 5 year old girl was singing this song that sounded upbeat, but when they explained the lyrics it was about destroying America and loving Kim Jong Un/wanting to worship him. So fuckin weird. "
"The HR woman at my company has recently been very sexual towards me. At the company Christmas party she kept showing me her cleavage, grabbing my ass, and trying to grab my dong. Today she walked into my office, gave me an vitamin C supplement and said ""since you won't look at my tits, put this in your mouth yourself!"" then proceeded to hand it to me and said ""oh, it's too big for your mouth, isn't it!?"" - I reported her to the CEO (nobody else to go to and it is a very small company) and was told they would have a meeting about her behavior. Now imagine if any male were to do this to any female. Let alone the fucking HR person."

"Dude, you're 17 there's nothing you can do to stop it. Your body is convinced that you're about to get laid. In a few years and with some experience it'll become way less pronounced.

As far as how to stop it, rub one out right before you guys hang out. Also, if that doesn't work, wear darker colored or looser fitting pants, it won't show up as much.

Funny anecdote-when I was 18 I was working overnight with a friend I had a massive crush on. One night she came in from a really bad breakup and gave me this really long, drawn out hug while she unloaded her problems. This chick had massive boobs and, as shitty as I felt, I couldn't stop focusing on it. When she went back to work I had to sit in the bathroom drying my pants for 10 minutes with toilet paper to try and get spot to go away. It was the worst conglomeration of different types of shame I've ever felt.

TL;DR-being a teenager sucks ass, your body is an asshole."

"""Prank"" Videos and ""Social Experiments""

The social experiments because they have an interesting premise but are almost always faked and the pranks because even if they weren't faked which they almost always are, most of the time they arent pranks"

"There's a god damn monthly ""box"" for everything. A monthly box that ships you dive bar t-shirts, a monthly box that ships you a few snacks a month, a box that sends you a few dinners a month, etc.

It's getting to be quite annoying and frankly most of the boxes are people overpaying for stuff they could buy much cheaper if they bought themselves at the store.

Blue Apron? Just find recipes online that catch your interest and buy the ingredients. 

Those snack boxes? Just go to the grocery store and buy a few new snacks a month.

I honestly haven't seen one that made a lick of since to me."

"There was a girl in university i got with who was super aggressive in bed. Before that girls had been really passive just letting me be on top and take control but this girl jumped on me and started riding me saying to grab her breasts hart and pinch her nipples, used to claw the heck out of me too I actually to this day have some small scars on my arm from her grabbing them and digging her nails in. I told my SO they were from a cat. 

The first time experiencing a girl squirting was a surprise, she was super wet while I was fingering her and I grabbed her breast give her nipple a pinch and that was enough to push her over the edge I guess because she moaned and suddenly exploded. It was a surprising amount of force that this stuff came out of her and it kinda splattered on me and made a big puddle on the bed. Learned to put towels down after that when we got down to it. "
"OP's penis.

Just kidding, I don't want it."
"The only way I can think to describe it is when a woman looks comfortable - like that Sunday morning + t-shirt and sweat pants + messy hair combo. 

There's an easy, natural confidence to looking comfortable that really gets me going."
"I've said this before here.  Professionalism and competence are genderless.  Whether male-majority of female-majority, the good teams I've worked on were very similar in many respects.  Only cosmetic differences.

It's when we fuck it up that we do it differently.  It basically comes down to conflict.  Healthy teams manage and minimize conflict through communication, accountability, defined roles, and good leadership.  When any of the above falls apart, you get conflict.  And men and women have different tendencies for handling conflict, and the more Male- or female- dominated a group is, the more masculine or feminine the group culture is.

There are a lot of things to point out about these groups, but a sage co-worker of mine summed it up nicely:

*Asshole men want to trample you, asshole women want to drag you down.  Either way, you're getting a faceful of mud.  Good folks want you to help each other rise together.*"
"You're still fairly young, they are women that have hit puberty, it's understandable to feel attracted because your male brain sees it. It's hardwired into your brain even if you don't like it, but there's nothing to be so ashamed about. Maybe something happened in your life that's left you a bit focused on high school girls subconsciously. You are obviously attracted to women your own age so as long as you aren't trying to hook up with high schoolers, you'll be fine. Eventually your mind will get out of being attracted to them. "
"Thanks, Stannis. "
That gets me at half staff. 
Expect hypocrisy. The same people who tell you gender roles are dumb will nonetheless think you're less of a man if you don't fulfill certain manly expectations for them.
"Girls who put a lot of effort into school and studying. Like always sitting in the front row, asking a bunch of questions, highlighting their notes in about 100 different colors, etc. Something about how excessive it was just always seemed cute to me. They usually weren't even at the top of the class or anything."
"Yes, a few times. In college, this happened with girls I met at parties who I hit it off with, got some alone time with, and made out. However, when things began to move towards sex, I backed out. This also happened one time I was making out with a friend (really a FWB to some extent), and with a girl I was briefly seeing.

In all of these cases, something in the back of my mind told me ""Stop! No further!"" I didn't have strong enough feelings for them to become more intimate, and having sex without that would've felt forced to me. Since then, I have realized that I am only comfortable having sex with a girl who I am in a relationship with, or at least have strong romantic feelings for."
"Just had a similar conversation yesterday with a former fwb. She was complaining about how hot Ben Stiller was but too short at 5'7. I mean, at her height (5'2) wouldn't anything above 5'6 be ""tall""? Wtf. 

But ""there's a difference"", she said."

"That's actually super painful for most women in the future, and can lead to tearing since the body isn't allowed to stretch like it would naturally.

Was able to do something really nice for my mom. Her car got stolen and so I bought her a 2000 Honda C-RV with a bad engine for $300 dollars and I put a remanufactured engine in it. I did all the work with my own two hands and fixed it up nice for her and I only had to spend a total of about $1500. It was a good birthday present for her and it was the first engine swap I have ever done. It felt good. 
"No I mean like I will straight up finish my orgasm and then eyes roll back, I hear a loud knock in my head, and I'm unconscious for about 15 minutes before waking up with the worst migraine of my life.

"Caviar. I have actually tried it a couple of times, with toast and garnishes, and it tasted... bland. Not awful by any means, but for the insane price it often costs, the taste is a huge letdown, in my opinion. I have eaten much better seafood for a tiny fraction of the typical cost of caviar.

BTW, I am of half Vietnamese descent, and I am disappointed in you thinking of pho that way. "
"Well, one very cute girl who I liked and who liked me seemed to be in a dead relationship, but rather than ending it she thought she'd have me on the side and I noped out of there."
"It's far more acceptable for a woman to tell a guy that he's too fat and needs to diet and hit the gym. It's also perfectly acceptable for a woman to reject a guy based on his weight. Meanwhile, there are entire mass movements that tell overweight women that they don't need to change anything about themselves and that men who don't find them attractive are fat-shaming, shallow pigs."
"Being a normal human being. It seems like a lot of guys try to put on their ""cool mask"" when first hanging out with a girl. It's really annoying, and it makes me trust you less. It's ok if you're nervous. I'd rather you be a little nervous and dorky than act like Mr. Too Cool for You. "
"I saw a social experiment where a man and woman went out and she abused him, no one did a thing. He yelled and pushed her, everyone came to the rescue. "
"If a girl calls me by name very shortly after meeting me for the first time, she's got me. "
"You're probably overestimating the genius is takes to escalate things. If she's flirting with you, or even just having a decent conversation, you're not going to ruin it by touching her arm. Imagine if things were reversed, you're having a good time talking to a lady pal and when you say something funny she brushes by your arm. Are you going to mentally grade the smoothness with which she escalated? Are you going to say ""weeeell I was totally into her but then she touched my arm weird so I'm not interested""?

You don't need some brilliant plan. Step it up bit by bit, if she backs off don't escalate any more. If she escalates or matches, it's game on. "
"Baldness. We're told to ""rock"" it and move on, while simultaneously being told to put up with the immense mockery people direct.

The reality is, a lot of us can't simply ""rock it""; we might have funny shaped heads, bad skin, less than desirable facial hair. We might be a little overweight, meaning we end up with very featureless, very round faces... I know from my own experience of losing my hair, it's a very, very difficult pill to swallow.

I just wish people, especially other males who haven't ever had to experience hair loss, could understand the fundamental knock of confidence it brings. For me personally I felt very scared, very alone, very ugly and it took me a long time indeed to accept it and work with it, it's worth mentioning that acceptance is NOT the same as ""rocking it"".

So, bald/balding men! You're not alone, /r/Bald and /r/Tressless are great places to discuss and unload.

Non-balding men (and women!) try and be even just a little understanding that some of us don't have a very easy time about our hairloss."

"Tried using a butt plug with my girlfriend at the time. Used lube and work it in slowly, and she was enjoying it. Decided I wanted to fuck her while it was in her ass. A few seconds later I looked back and saw the butt plug was gone. Scariest hour of my life as we tried every possible method of getting it out. Pro Life Tip: if you use a butt plug, make sure it's flared out at the end"
"An ex gf of mine once just stopped breathing after sex. We were done so i rolled to the side, she smiled at me, also rolled to a side, and just stopped breathing. After a few seconds of being scared and shaking the shit out of her she came back to the land of the living with a big gasp and told me to let her enjoy the moment. You gotta understand here, she didn't pull a single breath in more than two minutes, I was terrified. She didn't even realize she basically suffocated."
"I'm a tall girl whose dating someone shorter than me, this sentiment is also shared by some men too. A lot of the guys I work with question me for dating a guy shorter than me, as if I couldn't possibly be attracted to him because of the difference in height.

"Yep. dropped her off home as she didn't have a car. She invited me in and I said no, I was too tired and just wanted to get home. She huffed and then put her hand down her trousers and masturbated in front of me. When she was finished she just got out of the car and went into her house.

Made me realise that she didn't give a shit about me and was only in it for herself. She had already been doing emotionally manipulative stuff and almost downright blackmailed me before but I always forgave her. 

Another girl who was interested in just casual sex would never give me a good time to meet with her and I called it off before any sex happened. She responded ""What the fuck kinda man are you"" and basically just decided to attack my masculinity saying she was going to find ""A real man."""
Are you aware there are hot singles in your area? A website told me
"I wonder why these people would think they'd make shit like that up, because the societal backlash is massive. There is nothing to gain by lying about being raped."
"The worship of stupidity and ignorance in American culture. Also teaching to the lowest common denominator (participation trophies, no child left behind, standardized testing in general). No matter how much coddling you do, Some kids will not make it through your system. Some square pegs will not fit through a round hole. For those that do this coddling builds entitlement and frustrates those who actually want to learn. This culminates into the colossal bitch slap that is real life, in which achievement and drive determine much of your life, no one is going to pay your bills for you, and no one gives a shit if you believe you are owed something. Our schools do not prepare students for life. And apparently we are ok with that"

I am attracted to girls who wear dresses. Not fancy dresses or ""I'm going clubbing"" dresses, the kind of dresses where she looks like she bought them at good will. I like conservative quiet types. "
"I'm black. I didn't think race mattered all that much until I noticed the women in my mostly White and Asian friend group all chasing white dudes. It was non-stop around the clock chasing white guys. You'd think one Latino, Black, or Asian guy would fall in there. Not one. I was pretty close with a few, so I asked them point blank and they confirmed they had a type, and it was white. The Asian women would accept an Asian guy.

Even still, I thought it was a thing with that circle. I wouldn't have that kind of trouble in the rest of Los Angeles, would I?

Well, I started dating online with OKCupid, and I found dates and shit. Despite messaging people about 85% or higher match percentage, I didn't get a great response rate - about one in thirty - but enough to think that maybe I could in theory get something going online.

Then I read that infamous OKCupid blog post about message rates and race; specifically the part where 54% of white women actually answered that they wouldn't date outside of their race and changed my answers all to be irrelevant or low value except questions like that. I also excluded Asian women entirely as I was 0 for a million in messaging them. To that point, I'd had more replies from lesbians online than straight Asian women.

First off, the people I had been messaging no longer matched in the 90ish range on average but instead were down to 60ish. Then when I got back to messaging, my reply rate skyrocketed to 3 in 10. That's from 3% to 30% with no other changes and stayed right around there for the next 6 years I was on the site.

After noticing that I couldn't help but back and think about all those times I was softly excluded from parties, or was just the friend, or why friends were trying to play matchmaker with all the other guys in the group and not me with wonder if my race played a factor.

Look, I know it's hard to believe because it comes across as if people are saying somehow you roll out of bed, start walking down the street, and you'll have women jump out of still-moving vehicles to blow you. Then you look around and think, ""gee, that'd be nice, but that's not my life."" What's actually being communicated to you is that people are out there doing the same work as you, possibly even more, but aren't getting near the results you get in their dating life because they're not white."

She got things started by running her hands over me and we started making out.  Next thing you know, clothes flying off, intense making out, boob grabbing, etc. Then I stopped.  My nose flared a few times as I tried to make sense of what the hell this rancid death fish smell was.  I started kissing her tummy and went down a little more south.  The smell became even more pungent.  I knew whatever is causing that smell, I don't wanna stick my little guy in there.  I slowly stopped and told her I'm not feeling good, and she left.  

That was my first experience with a smelly vagina.  I'll never forget that smell.  "
"Personally, the main rub for me is that men's solutions in such a circumstance doesn't do anything about the child that still has needs that have to be met. Abortion undoes the child and render's the responsibilities and obligations of both parents simultaneously null.

Bastardizing children doesn't do that. Throwing up your hands and saying ""I'm not ready for this!"" doesn't change anything about the situation. It's just begging the state to let men off the hook.

It's an unfair situation, but biology wasn't fair to the sexes in the matter of pregnancy. Men need to stop trying to ignore living children, and instead seek technological solutions that provide us greater control over our reproduction to prevent these problems before they exist."

It was a long conversation but it essentially boils down to ""We really shouldn't, I've had too much to drink"" But it's college, that's what you're supposed to do ""Yeah that's true"" You should have some water first though.

For any girls who do have PCOS, don't be too worried, it's not likely to put most guys off all that much past the initial surprise if it does cause you to have extra bodyhair. "

"(**EDIT:** Aaaaand the white knight brigade has arrived to breathlessly tell me how guys are the actual sexists because they avoid dating high-partner-count women. No little snowflakes, that isn't shaming, that's called having different values and preferences. If I don't date a sedentary women I'm not shaming her for sitting on the couch. I'm not insulting her lifestyle.  It's just contrary to the kind of life I want to live. If I avoid a girl who parties every weekend, same thing.  A girl who's been ridden by every frat boy, same thing.)

----------------------

I'm gonna be honest here. 90% of the slut-shaming I've seen comes from young women. The last time was a few months ago when my colleague, a mid-20s girl, was advising me on how to get with the ""right"" type of woman - she said ""Girls who spread their legs in high school and college for every dude are damaged and probably compensating for something"".

My grandma says similar things. The middle-aged women at church say similar things.

It's stuff like that I hear from women all the time and **occasionally** from elderly men. But never, not even once, from a man my age.

Guys don't make a habit of loudly talking about hating promiscuous women. The most I've seen is men not wanting to *seriously date* a promiscuous woman, but that's more of a personal preference and doesn't intrude on anyone else's life. Yet this is the thing women seem to get super pissed about all the time while ignoring instances of fellow women talking trash about them."

"The male of the species uses various grunts and body movements to surreptitiously communicate with other males, in plain view of the females. 

In particular, note the ""up-nod"", which is is for signaling that one male has made not of the other. Generally used at large gatherings. 

Similar, and yet profoundly different, is the ""down-nod"". Males who have never met, or have only met once before, and are outsiders to the females' pack, will often subtly exchange this behavior, as if to say ""we are in this together."""

Dogs aren't prey and kangaroos aren't predators. The dog was probably acting submissive in the hope that the kangaroo simply gave up. A lot of animals that aren't motivated by hunger are motivated by fear. Demonstrating their superiority is enough -neither wants to get injured and end up dying for no reason.
"I don't think that thought is wrong, it's natural.

It's only a problem when a person starts thinking, ""she looks older so she must be mature and know what she wants"". Teens are still maturing into adults, seeking them to date would be predatory, but admiring beauty isn't bad- we all have eyes, even women notice when teenaged girls are pretty/hot.

Also, OP you might just like women with lower body fat percentage. These days the average size/bodyfat of women in Western countries is higher than the past, and teens develop younger these days (even getting their periods as early as 3rd grade), so technically the teens you ogle probably look like 20-somethings from back in the 70s/80s. Maybe try checking out more fit/thin ladies that you don't feel guilty about? If this really is bothering you that much."

So I lived in tokyo until recently and my friend came to visit and brought some of her friends.

All sorts from full body dolls to small pocket ones. 

I came back downstairs and the girls wanted to know what it was and i told them.. The moment i said it one of the girls was like ""men are fucking gross"" I was like... This is exactly why women aren't allowed on the floor and called her on it. She ended up understanding in the end. "

"Lets talk about how fucked up mental care options are in the US.

First, lets assume that you are actually living somewhere with options. I know people that would have to drive multiple hours to see somebody.

If you're living somewhere with actual choices, you have to figure out what you need: psychologist, therapist, etc. 

Lets assume that our seeker of mental help is of average means in the US. Perhaps their employer is generous enough to provide insurance, you'll get a limited number of visits covered. If you don't have insurance, be prepared to shell out a ton of money per session.

Now you've found somebody, they either take your insurance, or they don't/you don't have insurance and you'll just pay out of pocket. Hopefully it's an expense you can manage and it's time to make an appointment.

Whoopsy, they're not accepting new patients.

On top of that even at it's best school only teaches crystallized intelligence, which is basically summed up by knowledge/experience how to do a particular thing and completely ignoring fluid intelligence which is stuff like problem solving and reasoning skills which in an age where any information you want is at your finger tips I think is far more important and useful in today's society.

"I went on a date with a woman with a wonky eye. She asked me if I'd noticed her wonky eye. I said it was what the Japanese call 'wabi', a small flaw that makes her unique. You know, the Japanese fill cracks in porcelain with gold, so they stand out more.

She didn't want to see me again.

I did turn up dressed entirely in leopardskin. The pattern, that is, not the actual fur. I loved my leopardskin parachute pants. She didn't see them as wabi.

It's a shame, because she was gorgeous. She had such a deep, gravelly voice. Like Matt Lucas impersonating Liz Taylor. Or Gimli.

"Yeah, twice. Once when I was really drunk and went home with someone really obese who I was just not attracted to. The second time I took things further than I should have with someone when I was in a relationship and didn't grow a backbone until the last minute.

I felt terrible about it on both occasions. But women have done that to me 4 or 5 times for various reasons, so it's difficult to feel too terrible about it. If consent is to mean anything, we have to accept that it will happen. In almost every instance however, it's better to prevent the misunderstanding before then."

"twice.

First time I met these two girls and we were all tripping balls. Touching and being touched felt amazing. We started to get really close and clothes were starting to get removed. I then remembered they both had boyfriends and I couldn't do it. Maybe it was the drugs that heightened my morals, idk, but I couldn't ever willingly be the other man. I also didn't want to lose my virginity in a bad way where karma would definitely kick my ass in the future. We did all stop and had a great time afterwards. I met one of their boyfriends at a festival when i ran into her again.

second time. I was with a good friend who had been going through a lot of shit and being super reckless. We had gone drinking and she got wasted, i.e. throwing up, couldn't walk straight, etc... Well I let her crash at my place because there was no way in hell i was going to let her drive home. I let her crash on my bed because i was also very drunk and I've had female friends crash on my bed and cuddle with me without it getting weird or escalating. Well i did and I woke up with her trying to kiss me. I was drunk but not drunk enough to do it because i remembered that she has had herpes and has fucked both my best friend (he came out clean) and roommate (not sure on the results there). I told her no and that nothing was going to happen. She started crying and I calmed her down and went back to sleep.

Then i woke up to her trying to get me naked and stuff, I told her no once again but she wasn't getting the message. She tried to get on top of me and i pushed her off. Then i physically turned it around her and pinned her down on the bed and then got up and left and fell asleep in the tub. I woke her up the next morning saying that she had to leave and I never talked to her again.

Had the genders been reversed this would've been seen as sexual assault since I clearly had not given consent. I would've gotten into a shit ton of trouble and my reputation would've been ruined. Whenever I tell this story people laugh up until i mention the herpes then it gets real for everybody and they stop laughing about the matter.

It sucks because in both scenarios I was seen as an idiot who didn't go through with having sex. I will admit that part of me does wish i had a threesome with those two girls while tripping since it would've been amazing, morally I feel like it would've fucked with me for a while. the time with one of my best friends at the time, would've fucked with me in various ways. Super glad i didn't have sex with either of them."

"I definitely think the hatred against being offended by everything is beginning to swing back the other way, in that people are too quick to be assholes and using the ""stop being so easily offended"" thing as an excuse.

Hopefully it'll balance out and we can live without being offended easily but quit being obnoxious about everything as an excuse to combat that sentiment."
"People have the capacity to care about more than one thing, but only have a limited amount of time and mental capacity in which to physically demonstrate those things. You wouldn't ask someone who does cancer walks why they're ignoring alzheimer's; and all questions like that do, often, is undermine the original issue. I sincerely doubt (and if I'm wrong, that would be highly problematic for obvious reasons) that she'd have disagreed, if it were phrased in a way that just asked if she thought it was important to recognize that men are also capable of being raped, though far less likely to come forward and seek support when it happens.

Also, I know the CDC study was flawed in its methodology, but unless he was specifically speaking about men in prisons, I'd want to see some kind of source about there being *more* men raped than women.

Finally, this pissing race about who has it worse is extremely counter productive. If Redditors spent half the time it does debating who has it worse on actually helping victims, they could do all victims a hell of a lot more good than they are, currently. "

Once we started living together things became routine and the fun wasn't the same. I still loved her and enjoyed everything about her, but I didn't show it the way I should have. This, combined with deteriorating mental health fucked it all up. Don't make that mistake, don't give up on the dating stage just because you are a couple.

Reminds me of [this scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmwVcIFrgw8) scene from Friday: ""talkin about she look like Janet Jackson, bitch got out of the car lookin like Freddie Jackson"" 

Girls like [this] (http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/17/22/2F786C0100000578-3364774-image-a-41_1450390520147.jpg) are calling themselves curvy..."

"I went home with a girl from a bar. We were in her bed and started to 69. Between all of the alcohol and the fact that her ass smelled like sewage, I ended up throwing up all over her bed. I picked her up and turned my head. 

I cleaned it up and blamed it on the alcohol. She wanted to continue, but I told her I would rather just go home. "
"First time was by accident, and after discovering it was just the same as normal sex but with a bit of extra blood I was cool with it.

Plus there is something kind of primal about fucking with blood for lube.

"Lotta people here just love jerking each other off with their victim complexes. 

Somehow every guy here is broke after the mandated divorce, gets called a creep for having a daughter, gets assaulted by parents demanding that he and his SO marry and have children, are personal victims of blood diamond conflicts, and is a virgin ONLY because they're 3'5"""
I'm gagging at the thought of this. Are you for real?
"The amount of time and health men are ready to sacrifice for their families. A lot of family sitcoms shows men working some kind of “masculine” physical jobs, but they never seem to show how those jobs affect life.

A lot of men drain themselves in their jobs, working very long hours, coming home late and exhausted. While the stereotype of a guy coming back from work, being cranky and just wanting to drink beer, watch TV and be left alone is shown quite often, it’s almost always portrayed as a dick move, never explained the reason behind it.

Cultural Appropriation. Culture is meant to be appropriated it's not there for you to keep your special snowflake status and it fucking annoys the shit out of me because I keep hearing it from people using it unironically.
"I really to work for Microsoft and live at Seattle WA.

Sadly their rejection rate is 90% and my interview is coming up soon. I am scared!

**EDIT:**

Whoa, thanks for support everyone!

It's not the money or big brand that attracts me to Microsoft, it's the opportunities of growth. I respect the fact that they have the right focus, in comparison to their competitors. Plus, they are very proactive about inclusive hiring and diversifying their workforce.

Not to mention the fact that I am very daring and ambitious.

I'll do my best on the interview. It is an all day interview event with engineers, and program managers. It's going to be very tough but I'll put my best fight to be the 10% that succeeds. "
"Take it off the fucking pedestal man and treat women like people. Live your life, do your thing. Do be desperate as fuck. "
"Oh man, all my notions were misguided. Off the top of my head-

-That any girl is ""the one."" People change and what works today is never guaranteed to work tomorrow. Also, it's an unfair burden with unrealistic expectations on the person you're with to assume that you're somehow spiritually tied to them.

-That being single is a mark of failure or that it's better to struggle to be happy in a relationship than to be without one.

-That you give up all privacy when you enter a relationship.

-That you need to combine all of your hobbies and friends right off the bat or, conversely, that you throw out all your friends.

-That good communication = communicating every thought and emotion you have to each other.

Loyalty and honesty. The problem is you won't realize that they don't have them until it is too late.
"When women wear men's clothing, like trousers, are they doing that to make a statement? Is it a sexual thing that they're expressing masculinity by wearing trousers? 

I imagine those two questions seem really odd to you, am I right? If those do seem odd to you, then you understand the reasoning behind my wanting men to be able to wear all clothes, including dresses, skirts, frilly things, jewellery etc. And they could do so for exactly the same reason women wear trousers: because they're nice clothes that can look good, compliment their features, and/or be practical.

Tl;dr: I don't want it to be ""a statement"" any more than women wearing trousers are ""making a statement"". Instead, it could open up whole realms of new fashion and comfort for men to wear such clothes."
"Meditation.  Improves your concentration, willpower, and the average baseline of your moment-to-moment mood.  

Basic meditation instructions:

* Set a timer for 5 minutes.  Don't start it yet.
* Fold a thick pillow in half and set it on the floor.  
* Sit on the pillow with your legs folded in one of ""burmese"", ""half lotus"", or ""lotus"" positions.  Google image search them.  Don't cross your ankles as this gets painful very fast.  If your knees don't come down to the floor, put other pillows under your knees for stability.  
* Sit with a straight spine, trying to use balance rather than muscle power to stay upright.  The spine should rest like a tall stack of coins.  
* Put your hands on your knees or something - doesn't matter too much.  
* Look at the floor a few feet in front of you.  Put your visual attention on the whole visual field rather than focusing on one point.  
* Start the timer.  
* Each exhale, put a number on it.  Count 1-10, over and over again.  
* Try to think no thoughts other than the count.  Use the count to interrupt other thoughts.  
* Don't worry if you can't keep other thoughts out of your head.  Like weight lifting, meditation is about repeatedly going to the point of failure.  Meditation is not *sitting there with an empty mind*.  Meditation is *sitting there emptying your mind again and again*.  Trying and failing at this task, and trying again, is meditation.  
* When the timer goes off, stop meditating.  
* Don't skip the timer, and don't go over.  Don't stop when you ""feel like you're done""; don't put that job in your brain.  Use the timer for it instead.  

**The above is enough to get started; you can skip the rest unless you're curious**

It's more important to do it every day, and hence develop the habit, than it is to meditate a lot at any given time.  After you've got say 30 days straight of 5 minutes per day, maybe go to 6 minutes.  

Lots of people recommend 30 minutes per day, but in my experience this does not lead to a long-lasting habit.  People do it for a few days then start skipping because 30 minutes is hard to fit in.  Do 5.  That's enough time for your brain to start learning the technique and being able to apply it throughout life.  

There are other types of meditation where the idea is to run specific images through your mind.  There are guided meditations.  Kundalini yoga has all sorts of strange meditations that have to do with chanting and moving in repetitive ways.  These are all referred to as ""meditation"", but IMO the best thing to do on a daily basis, the one that gives you the attributes I mentioned above - concentration, willpower, improvements in baseline emotional state - is this concentration-based meditation.  Sometimes it's called ""shamatha"".  

In the long term, shamatha and vipassana are the peanut butter and jelly of the PBJ of enlightenment.  Shamatha is basically training yourself to concentrate better; vipassana is basically like a guided exploration of all the various layers of the mind.  People recommend doing them both, and that makes a lot of sense - to make a rough analogy shamatha is like basic conditioning whereas vipassana is like martial skills training.  

The one supports the other.  Doing your basic strength and endurance training will enhance your martial skills training.  Boosting your powers of concentration will support all other mental activities in your life, including vipassana meditation.  

source:  I've had an on-and-off daily meditation practice for about 13 years now, and have spent about 3 of those years living in a zen training center with lots of daily practice, long retreats, and instruction from both resident and visiting teachers.  It's had an incredible effect on every area of my life."

"&gt; Didn't know she was a squirter. Brought her to climax orally.

I don't get this, isn't it common courtesy to warn the person? I'm a squirter too, I wouldn't just cum all over a guy without a heads up. And, well, not destroying his bedding is also generally appreciated - towels are great.

 To me, not warning the guy is equivalent to him not giving a heads up if he's about to cum during a bj and you don't know each other's signs yet."
"Had sex with my wife on the wedding night. Put in a butt plug, as we do. We were really drunk, couldn't find it afterwards, assumed it fell out at some point. The next day she found it when she went to the toilet. (It was flared, but a bit too soft.) "
"Working out. Never expected to be so turned on seeing my 100lb SO deadlift twice her weight, but there you have it. Boner city."

I think a lot of guys (myself included) see Mr. Too Cool for you get all the female attention so we try to be him. What I realized that I missed though is that he actually is that confident. He's not faking it like I was. Which is why that didn't work for me but the same shtick worked for him. 
Fuck my mother
The ability to explain her opinions. 
"My view of relationships was pretty fucked up even as a younger adult. I guess it boils down to, I just didn't think women liked men. Like, at all.

I thought men wanted sex, and therefore had to put up with pretty much whatever shit a woman felt like throwing at them. Men get married because the woman will eventually withhold sex if they don't, then once they're married they're even more screwed because the woman can divorce them for no reason and take half their stuff. I thought women wanted someone to do basically all of life's heavy lifting for them, both literally and figuratively, and recognized that sex was a mechanism for them to get that.

There was lots of circumstantial evidence on TV, etc, I observed growing up that seemed to point in that direction. Mostly, though, I was just flat-out told this by older men who were in unhappy marriages.

And that's pretty much how I thought the world ran, for a long time. Actually, I still think it's how a lot of relationships *do* run, and I really think it's what some of my ex-girlfriends wanted, which reinforced my theories.

Fortunately, my views softened as I got older and I finally changed my mind 100% when I found myself in a relationship with an equal partner who doesn't use me and likes sex just because she likes it."
"Didnt find it that great. The lack of emotional rapport or connection made it feel really different for me as if it was some kind of different act. Almost as if I was masturbating but with another person.
"
"&gt; I honestly feel so empty and unwanted. How can I feel happy without having a woman in my life? 

Get a dog. It isn't quite the same as having a woman in your life, but having a dog sitting by the door and perking up as soon as come home is still worthwhile. You treat a dog well, and it will give back all the love you give it tenfold.

A dog will never, *ever* judge you. You can tell him everything, pour out your heart, and he won't think you're weak, or a pussy, or less of a man.

Best of all, a dog can be a great wingman. Women more easily warm up to men with dogs, and if she doesn't like your dog then she probably isn't right for you.

However, if you don't like dogs or aren't in a position to have a dog, **a cat is fine, too**. Hell, I prefer cats myself, and I've had them my whole life. But if you get a cat, it won't be the same as getting a dog. Some dogs will accept you as their master without any trouble, and some need gentle persuasion and training. 

People used to worship cats as if they were gods, and mother cats pass the memory of those days to their kittens. Because every cat gets a belief in its own furry divinity with its mother's milk, you aren't a cat's master. You're its priest, or at most its friend.

That's not to say that cats can't be affectionate. The more love you give a cat - the more you pet it and play with it and talk to it - the friendlier and more affectionate it's likely to be. And if a cat is exposed to positive interaction with lots of people as a kitten, it will remain a friendly and sociable cat.

Just like dogs, the shelters are full of kittens and older cats who could use a good home. You can adopt one for less than $100 at most shelters, and this covers spaying/neutering, some vaccinations, and fees."
"Then there's no ""shaming"" going in if you're quietly keeping it to yourself. "
"I really like this comment! A lot of people have this ongoing conversation about how annoying and sensitive people are. I agree that there is a tendency to get overly offended nowadays, but this mindset has made it impossible to talk about a cause like minorities/ politics/ rape/ etc without being another overly sensitive SJW ready to attack anyone who disagrees with them."

If it's true, HOLY SHIT!"

"To be fair, while your sentiment is true I think sadly it will be lost on a lot of men. Because the guys who idealize and are awed at the ""player"" lifestyle are usually the guys who are looking from outside in. They're the foreveraloners, men who get 0 dates ever, get ignored at parties, etc. They don't have the luxury or experience of making the distinction between lots of hookups and one committed partner. The guys who manage to get into loving relationships rarely talk about how great it would be to be a playa. But for the foreveraloners, it's such a pedestal because those men have 1000x of what FAs can't even get one of.

It's like seeing a starving homeless man looking at a buffet and telling him ""don't be stupid, buffet food is high-carb an greasy and bad for you! Protein powder and fresh vegetables are much better, believe me"". Dude he doesn't give a shit about nutritional differences, he just sees people walking away with 5 plates of buffet food and desserts and he wants to be like them."
"Women can reject men because of height, but men rejecting women because of fat is superficial and an expression of the ""beauty myth"". "
"I actually enjoy the shit out of pho.

I find sushi to be overrated. I enjoy it, but it's not a transcendent experience, and it is *expensive* for what you actually get on your plate. I find myself having to go home and eat more afterward because it's just not enough.

The most overrated, in my opinion, is the Hipster Pub that sells overpriced microbrews and serves a $15 burger on a plank. Here in Oregon, you can get perfectly good beers at Red Robin, and the burger is $10 and is actually likely to be better than the hipster joint.

It's not bad, and I'm happy to eat at a hipster pub, but it's overrated and a little silly."

"Milk isn't exactly a common drink to be ordered at a bar. I'd probably bet you're the only one who's ordered that drink in the entire week, if not month. Are you actually ordering ""Ill have a vodka milk please""? Perhaps this is regional, but a common vodka and milk drinks are a White Russian or a paralyzer in my area of Canada (and when I visited Las Vegas these were well known drinks as well so that's a pretty vast region.) I've never heard anyone in my travels to order simple ""vodka milk,"" and this may be part of the surprise. 

In any case if that's your poison then continue on. Some bar tenders will inevitably get a little annoyed when people order complex or unusual drinks; my friend insists on ordering Blue Hawaiians whenever we go out and I cringe a little every time, perhaps undeservedly, but what's wrong with just getting a liquor + a soft drink or beer, man? 

Regardless: I'd personally be wary of the quality and freshness of the milk a bar provides and not order them. Hopefully you never get some curdled!"
"There seems to be a lot of research on average penis sizes throughout the world. Many of these either implicitly discussing sexual ability or subtly shaming based on the average penis size.

And yet there aren't studies on the average vagina size of women of different nationalities or ethnicities. Why is that? Surely there is some variation of vagina size worth studying. Or is researching vagina size variance on the basis of race/nationality insulting?"
"You, sir, just discovered the physiological trait which makes some women natural size queens. These are the girls to whom size matters most."
