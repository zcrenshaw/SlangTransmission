"I have recently set up a phone system for a client that provides a 24-hour emergency callout service. Callers are told what the costs will be for an after-hours callout and are given the option to press 6 to agree to the charges or to leave a message to get a call back in business hours. Only if the client presses 6 to agree to the charges does the call get sent to the on-call phone. This way the on-call staff do not get woken up unless they are going to get paid.

Edit: a wrong word"
"That's fucking awesome. Wouldn't be surprised to learn she's successful in her career, she clearly has a mindset of ""see a problem, fix it"" "
Those 'incentive' systems always seem to fail in the end.
Shouldn't she be banned for that? That's way beyond what any retail employee should tolerate. 
"There must be a book somewhere that says, ""If you want something, be an ass. You don't need to be nice and ask if you can have it, just ask how they will make it happen. They will be so moved by your authority, they will *have* to give it to you."" There are to many people like this in the world for that not to be the case."
"&gt; ""This is ridiculous.""

""Yes, sir, you are."""
ummmmm yeah i bought this like huge television but returned it. it cost 2000 bucks but the only gave me 100 bucks. can you just wrangle up that remaining 1900 and ill be on my way. Receipt? i lost it but you can trust me this is totally on the up and up.
"&gt;It really would be much more sensible if I could just take them and pay for the pair I want afterward... ""

No, it would not."
"I.. Don't understand how people do that.. I mean, where I live we don't really have coupons, just a card you can scan and you get a discount on set items,  but still. 

I already got mildly annoyed today that a guy in front of me in line didn't have his wallet ready when he had to pay. "
"$60? Goddamn, son.

I do pro AV and our emergency callout is $120/hour with a minimum 4 hour call, and that's before any equipment charges."
"""Haha I though you were an actual human being like myself! Not a lowly retail slave! Hahahahaha""
Blah. "
Fuck your manager. Lady should have been thrown out. Literally. With like a fucking trebuchet.
"""Here's your gift card M'am. There's zero balance on it, but if you'd like to put money on it as well as compensate us for destruction of property; we'll be inside."" (Slam her car door)"
That gave me good feelings. Thank you for sharing
Well we sell that television at the other store.... actually we don't sell televisions here at all but here is your $1900. Thank you for your business 
"""Guess what snowflake..? You actually did just buy it. You break it, you buy it. Full price."" "
10/10 retail customers would pour wine on the belt again though. 
"I don't get why people would want to buy an opened item, just to get a discount. If you want a discount because you believe there is something wrong with the product then don't buy the open box!"
"To my parents, anything video game related was/is a Nintendo."
"So I am near the Mall of America, the largest mall in the country  For Thanksgiving, the Mall left it up to the stores to be open.  As of today, there will be three stores open.  Out of 522.

  A sign things are moving back to the way they were?  I hope so.  For everyone in the industry, I hope so."
"I've incurred systems where, if you prematurely press a button, it will either pause or restart the message.   You must listen.  Those are fun with repeat calls..."
that and it's assault and battery.
I would be banning that bitch straight up. And explaining to her what a library is.
"Yeah, I worked retail in 95-97.  Best employee in the department in terms of stocking and helping customers, but I refused to push the store credit card apps.   I'm sure there would have been repercussions of the company didn't go under shortly after that."
This is absolutely EPIC. Loved reading your story man! I don't usually even bother with stories this long but this is something else! Hope to see more to come. Cheers!
"She was terrible.  Me and her butted heads constantly.  As LP I had to be the last one out of the store with the manager. If it was a female manager, we needed a second female employee there, since I'm male.

I can't tell you how many nights the store closes at 9, everyone else was done by 9:30 and then me and some poor associate are sitting there till 11:30/12 waiting for her to do her paperwork because she spent her entire shift eating in the office.  Literally have cameras and I can see you and your supervisor sitting there talking, or eating.

I have another story about her I posted long ago where she tried to get me fired after she called the police on suspected shoplifters after I said we aren't stopping them.  I couldn't confirm what they had,  she called the cops, from the office which she never left, cops stopped the couple in a rough way for what turned to be out a free sample of photo paper. Corporate launched an investigation for the bad stop.  She blamed me, I blamed her.  Came in one day to find out DVR was wiped, conveniently the same night she sent the LP home early and she was alone in the store.  But I had back ups of the incidents and reports and that was enough to clear me. Still not enough to fire her ass"
It sounds like she stole the paperweight in the first place. Why is she complaining?
"&gt; Then she knocks the sign out of my hand, grabs the hat off my head,

&gt;it's assault and battery.


Assault and *hattery*.

Much worse, especially when it come to a head..."
"It's definitely in some negotiation book somewhere. It probably goes something like ""if you ask for permission, they can say no. If you ask how they can make it happen, you take away no as an option."" 

Because how you word the question is the only thing standing between you and getting what you want /s."
With this face: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Oh man, I wish I could link to an epic story I read once about a person who works in an arcade that uses a cleaning chemical with a strong citrus smell.

She just manages to stop a toddler from sucking on a chemical soaked rag when mom storms up and demands the employee give the rag back to her baby and refuses to believe anything that smells like oranges could be dangerous.  Eventually had to throw the woman out because she kept trying to get the rag to give back to her kid.

If I recall the woman then went over the employees head to the owner and got banned.  The same employee later caught the woman in the arcade trying to steal one of the cleaning rags.

"
"It's called ""If you want me to miss my sleep you better pay well""

They don't owe him anything, if they think it's expensive then everyone is free to pick someone else"
"Wtf is corporate thinking? They're not making any money off this woman and in fact she's bringing the quality of customer service down every time she's in the store. Every once in a while, it is a *good* thing to fire a client!"
"No.  but since all the cashiers were new, she was running around constantly to and fro, and she was so frazzled she cried.  Personally I think she was just sing it as an excuse because she was in terrible
Shape and not used to standing for more than 5 minutes without getting winded. So an entire day just seemed like the worst thing in the world to her."
"Oh. My. God.

Did she have to do that shift she tried to make you do?

This is a glorious tale."
"&gt;Because I'm special and deserve to get things for free.

Hasn't this subReddit taught you anything?"
"Even if it had been candy,  who eats unwrapped candy at a store?

And did she have any intent to pay for it?  I'm guessing no. "
How tf do u scan seductively.... 0.o
She would be the first person to bitch and complain if you weren't open on Thanksgiving too. Some people just want something to bitch about. 
"You're assuming they actually listen to anything after ""Thank you for call----"" *customer mashes buttons on phone* ;) ... Once they get a human and actually *listen* to him confirming the charges, I imagine any not in an actual emergency would likely hang up before giving their payment info, unfortunately. Hopefully, before they start screaming into the phone about not getting warned about any charges."
"Especially eye makeup, you can spread bacteria that way. If a mascara wand had been opened I would absolutely not want to take the chance that someone had decided to test it out on themselves.  Honestly, considering the product, I would have taken it away and told them that if it had been opened, I could no longer sell it and would have to write it off as damaged product, for health reasons.  And it would have made me really happy to do so, as I'm 95% sure they were lying and opened the packages themselves to try to get a discount."
"Same problem that old people keep having with their flip phones.

""Why doesn't my phone tell the correct time?""

*Rips sticker off outside of phone and hands back.

I have far too many old people that are regularly looking for me and ask for me on my days off, to fix problems of the same level."
Sounds like a manager reply right there
The Front End manager should have gotten sacked over this as well.
My store has an incentive going on for credit cards right now. Five dollars per card sign up and you have to sign them up on a register if you want to be acknowledged for it. This is a process that takes half an hour and we have two registers. I just laughed when I saw the poster announcing this 'amazing opportunity'.
DISGUSTING! ARE YOU EXPLAINING SOMETHING TO ME AND EXPECT ME TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND?! *DISGUSTING*
SIR I AM NOT A ROBBERY PERSON! YOU ARE REFUSING TO SURRENDER TO ME SO I AM GOING TO HANG UP!
"""this is ridiculous"" to which I answered ""yea I can't believe you started this stupid of a conversation with me either"" my daughter-in law never asks me to babysit her storefront anymore."
"Yeah, it bugs me to no end when people wait until everything is rung and the cashier gives them the total, THEN they start looking for their method of payment. Are they surprised that money will be exchanged? You should have it out and ready from the beginning."
"Could also be one of those people who were also once in the same work position and simply understands how tough it can be. I got tipped 5 bucks by someone the other day even though all I did was take their order at my fast food job because they were ""also once a server."" "
College
"""Hello Mattress store"" ""can I sleep on one on display in the store for the night and if i slept ok I'll buy it the next day?"" ""uh..."" ""also do y'all have showers?"""
"Had a lady ask about dye lots on some flooring. That type of flooring she wanted doesn't have lots. She kept asking me to check lots and I kept telling her they don't have lots and there is nothing I can do to make sure they do. When she came to pick the order up she asked again (had to be the 10th time)

 ""can you make sure these are the same lot #?""

 I told her again ""ma'am I am the same person you spoke to on the phone and when you came in to order and when you called back after the order and are now standing in front of loading your order. I have told you every single time we have spoken that there are no dye lots on this product. You ask at least 3 times every time we speak and I give you the same answer. So no I did not check dye lots because. There are no dye lots"" 

It's like if she just kept telling me to check dye lots it was just going to happen."
"I used to hate this when you'd been waiting for a bus for like 20 minutes, some old woman gets on first and everyone else queues up behind her. Driver says ""That will be $1.50"" like he does every single day.

And only then does old woman go ""Ah ok"" and start fumbling in her bag to find her purse, then fumbling through her purse to get the correct change in 10c pieces. 

*BITCH YOU'VE HAD THE LAST 20 MINUTES TO DO THAT*"
"""Yes ma'am. Every 1 out of 1,000,000 bags includes a free dead squirrel as a fertilizer boost. We find that squirrel carcasses boost growth of desired plants while keeping away weeds. Congratulations on finding the Squirrel Surprise!"""
Who the Fuck returns pie?
"Sheesh, what a pretentious ass. You see thousands of people throughout the week, how the hell does he expect you to know?

I'm awful with names and faces, even when it comes to my co-workers. I heavily rely on name tags."
"Lady's logic:

Person forgot thing therefore they are high.


I wonder how she would react to someone with memory disorders."
Years later he will be asking himself why he can't hold down a job for more than one month. 
100% chance she stole them.
"Soooo....she waited 9 whole minutes, and now she's going to take twice that time to go to another fast-food joint, stand in line, order a bunch of food, and wait for it....

Makes perfect sense?"
The gasoline customer got his change AND a reality show!! How can you beat it?!
"My parents try not to shop on Sundays for religious reasons. They think that everyone should have Sundays off, and by shopping on Sundays, they are forcing some poor individual to work. However, they would *never* demand that a sale be extended because they don't shop on Sunday.  They know that's not how the world works. 

Also..does this guy also not shop online for religious reasons haha?"
"Nice.

A lot of customers would have called you names for implying they were dumb lol. 

I've done stuff like that myself though..lol"
"""I don't shop on Sundays.""

""Sounds like not my problem."""
Some heroes don't wear capes. 
Most people would have pretended to check the lots and confirmed they all matched to get her to go away quicker. You took the high road which has brick walls you must smash with your face along it.
