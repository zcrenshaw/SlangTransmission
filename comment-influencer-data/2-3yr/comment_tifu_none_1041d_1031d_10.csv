Don't feel bad --  I once drove 13 miles home after work to a house I had not lived in for 3 months.

"OP, listen, this is very time sensitive. 

Now we have all heard how call center jobs can be shitty jobs, pun intended. So, the question is, do you like your job, and is your boss a dick?

"Haha ouch. Muscle memory really can get you! I woke up this morning, went to work for an early meeting which lasted all of an hour rather than all day. Went to get the train (going back home from customer site), train was delayed so automatically went into the pub and asked for a vodka cranberry, sat down and realised people around me were eating breakfast...was 9.50am rather than the 5pm is assumed , interesting way to start the day"

"Fire on a plane ain't no joke. 

&gt;On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer skin and the inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that knocked out most of the instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to an alternative landing field. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers who had yet to evacuate the aircraft.

"Bear repellent is serious stuff.  It's pepper spray.  The stuff cops use.  Same thing.    In Canada it is considered a prohibited weapon if used against a person, even in self defense.  There are no personal defense pepper spray for civilians here.

anyway... the bear spray stuff is generally better than most ""put in your purse"" type jobbies.  So anyway...  I ended up finding some in the street a year or three ago.  Plastic wrap, orange safety clip still zip-tied down on it and all.  Very grenade like.

On the can it says it has an EFFECTIVE range of 18 feet.    It has 0.857% capsaicin and 0.753% capsaicinoids.  It empties the can (think spray-paint sized) in 8 seconds.  That's a LOT of hot stuff.

Doing this in an enclosed space would be a very very terrible idea.  It would SERIOUSLY endanger the lives of the people on board, no question.

Also they're extremely flamable and explosive.... being aerosol cans and all.

oh and you gotta show ID, and the store you buy it from keeps you on file, how much you bought, address, etc etc..  dunno why but I looked it up when I found the can of spray.  Better me find it than some kids.

"Dude, your father will be fine. Stay focused, relax, take things one step at a time. Go see dad, give him a hug, if that's allowed in a British hospital, and don't fire up a joint in his room; there's oxygen and stuff there and rules about that sort of thing. "
"Don't feel too bad.  Clock was ticking for a long time on this.  She could have easily hired someone to follow him or put a tracker on his car.  Or even just use ""find my phone.""  In fact, she may well have done some of that before she approached you with an all too plausible story.

In any event, she was clearly suspicious, and rightfully so.  

This is John's fuck up, not yours.

"They're two different drugs.

Cannabis vs Alcohol is a dead debate, it isn't logical to compare them since you behave very differently on them.

**But I totally understand your point and here comes some words to all work smokers**

I live in a place in Europe where it's allowed to smoke weed at home and buy it at dispensaries. It has become quite a bad habit because I've lived here for 5 months and I've probably smoked at least one time everyday except one or two.

While I do enjoy smoking it and I'm aware I smoke way too much but still. I would never, ever in my life come into work stoned and everyone of my friends that smokes would never do that either.

I know you probably don't do this but to everyone else, please do not assume that everyone that smokes is like OP, that we forget everything and smokes before work.

This is a completely unnesserary post but I just feel like the loudest cannabis smokers are often the douchebags who treat it like some miracle medicine and smokes it before work and keeps arguing that ""It's not like alcohol so I can do my job at the same time"".

Well yes you can, but you're not 100% focused and efficient. You do get paid to do your best work after all, so respect your employer and do your job. Smoke when you get home instead.

Also we (me as well) who smoke pot should stop joking around about it as soon as we do stupid shit. Way too many ""I was stoned so I did this"" stories.

It's not interesting, not funny. Quite sad when you think about it. And yes, you do stupid things when you're under the influence of all drugs. But just because it's pot doesn't mean it's OK, cool or funny. It's a drug and if you can't behave without hurting yourself, anyone else or even your wallet then you might have a problem.

Also we who smoke pot have to learn and accept that other people do not like Marijuana for their own personal reasons. Please stop questioning, arguing or even accusing people who don't like it. I mean if someone at work would talk about any other drug it wouldn't be okay at all, what makes pot so ""okay""?

"Sorry to sound like the resident bore, but you should never put a hot oil fryer on when you're inebriated. It's so easy for you just to fall asleep, forget about it and that'd be that. Used to know people it's happened to. 
Glad you got off without much of a scratch though. "
Did you get the hoodie though?
"Careful there, almost didn't see the sarcasm tag."

You may want to take him to the doctor.

"he was upset, but he laughed about it- i feel bad because he has a little kid"
Grrr... have your upvote already.
My little sister did the same exact thing when she was 8. She took it off my dresser and ate the entire bar which is multiple doses. My mom just thought she was really sick but I knew the truth.
She would have laughed but I panicked.

some companies totally would. I went back to a restaurant I used to work at and they kept telling people I'd been with them for over 10 years lol 
"OP, look [at this](http://i.imgur.com/K3MTTwE.gif), you'll be fine after the doctors."
"A guy once posted [""TIFU by paying $1,608,743.67 to the wrong company""](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4qnu4m/tifu_by_paying_160874367_to_the_wrong_company/). Since s/he was so specific, commenters (and I think a mod) warned that the company would find out. OP was far too smug about it, and the next day posted another TIFU about how s/he lost his/her job as a result of the TIFU. Some chimed in to offer apologies, some mentioned it was coming, and OP again was very smug about it"
The way this is worded makes me imagine you cupping his balls for 10 seconds while you stared into his eyes until he told you to go home.

The FBI won't send you a warning.  They'll just show up at your door and raid your house.

"I love the people in here telling you to mind your own business and not call the cops lol. I'm a dispatcher. Yes, we get our fair share of calls that we bitch and moan about, but I think all the guys on my shift would agree when I say we'd rather check and find nothing. 

Sometimes the only reason we even find out about a domestic is because of concerned neighbors. There's nothing at all wrong with calling the police because you're legitimately concerned. You did the right thing. "
