The creativity for the roasts in this comment section is on par with the creativity on your channel.
"Judging from the quality of this thread, I think you're going to struggle to make this video 10:01 minutes long"
"I don't know why you want to be roasted, Pewds. Surely watching your own content during the editing phase is enough torture for one day."
You've ruined more 12 year olds than the Catholic Church. 
You channel  peaked when you didn't have face cam 
"Fuck, you really are running out of ideas"
"As you get older and your face settles into your adult looks, you're going from ""cute young Swede"" to ""Lurch from the Addams Family"" at an incredible rate."
"You make fun of people who have switched genders, but you look like you're on your 12th one or some shit."
I loved you in Ice Age 
"I've noticed over the past two months that he's really desperate to find new ideas and more often than not they end in shitty videos (He will post this /r/roastme thread as a video in a few days). People above are joking about his gender transition but the roughest transition for him was going from a gaming channel to a comedy channel. 

I bet he would really like to make a 10 minute and 1 second long tear-filled video stating that he'll only post three times a week instead of seven (who the fuck posts seven times a week anyways). But the adsense apocalypse fucked him so hard that he can't do that and he's slowly dying inside. Renting a huge apartment plus an ex-Disney (just like him) two-storey office in Brighton ‚Äì which has no use for the type of content he makes ‚Äì has to be paid for somehow. Feeding several totally overbred pugs isn't cheap either.  

 I'm rooting for you and I like your new direction pewds, but you really need to change something and make better content instead of these half-arsed videos. Making a drawn-out video about cringy interent videos and pretending you've never seen them before is not good content. "
"""No thanks."" 
   

-tentacles"
"I miss 2006 Pewdiepie, when you didn't have a youtube channel."
You look like the only man in the world who's actually managed to grow his virginity back.
"This has been the worst r/roastme in the history of r/roastme, maybe ever"
low budget filthy frank
"I want to say something, but all I can think to say is thank you for your service. I appreciate how clean our restrooms are."
You will never be k-pop
I don't blame him. I wouldn't be able to handle that much self-loathing either.
Nice of the homeless shelter to let you use their camera.
"Higher budget, still worse"
"Fuck me, even hitler is a liberal now."
I'm not giving you free content you lazy cunt. Go scream at some shitty flash game or something.
Chef is a fancy word for pot head who barely graduated high school. 
"He's going to read it slooooowly

**edit**: my comment made it in the video :D"
Could you at least floss your teeth before you post a selfie?  Did you eat a fucking pepper sandwich?
"No offense, but you kind of look like Pewdiepie"
You look like an advert designed to put people off heroin
Nice pic! Post or pre transition?
I figured your bed would be made because it looks like you have lots of practice tucking it in. 
If you girls ever do porn in Japan they might start censoring girl's faces too
"""Hey guys! Omg I'm like so excited to be here! I brought wiiiiine cooleeeers! Is the throwing game on the tv? Omg you have a dog! I could literally die!!"" - you"
Thank you for taking each other out of the dating pool.
You look like a failed test tube clone of that vegan guy from Scott Pilgrim 
"Your content reminds me of IKEA simple, cheaply made, and put together quickly with no real effort. "
I've never seen a pic of 2 people looking in 4 different directions before.
I would but it might give you flashbacks of all those kids you roasted back in Nam.
I think your eyebrows are getting farther apart to clear the runway for the plane that's going to take off from that massive ramp you call a nose
55 million subs yet you still get less views than Spiderman and Elsa channels
This guy is better at roasting himself then anyone of us.
"Note to self: if you're gonna have lunch before asking to be roasted, at LEAST brush your teeth first. I roasted myself. "
"Art student and chef? 

Your Asian fathers must be so proud. "
He doesn't edit his own videos anymore mate
"I like your eyelashes, all 5 clumps of them. Too often girls try to make their makeup look nice and even."
Is the purpose of the green screen to make it easy to Photoshop people into your pictures so it looks like you have friends? 
"You just fucked your comment with that ""Thanks for the Gold"" bullshit buddy‚Äã"
And repeat at different volumes and levels of zoom

"Of all the creative comments, this is my favorite for some reason. "
If Bollywood remade the Hobbit...
"While you're taking notes, show some cleavage next time.  It makes it easier to objectify you."
Popeye the trailer man.
"I know it's important to you to protect, but you don't really need a sword to guard your virginity. You've done just fine without it."
‚òùÔ∏è very sad I tell ya ‚òùÔ∏è very sad üëê
Slob the builder
Here I thought the worst Asian roast occurred in 1945. 
Hitler didn't die for this
"Oh yeah? Try me. I fuck trees. Not because i find them sexy, but so that i can establish dominance in my garden"
"Congrats, your future kid's forehead will have its own zip code."
Pulling out your penis at a children's party is not what a clown should do as a birthday surprise.
The accuracy of this comment is a little unsettling. Bravo
"[AMA REQUEST] The blind, dumb and deaf guy who edit's pewdipie's videos. "
"Ever since you bleched your hair you look like a lesbian.
"
Finally some masculine Final Fantasy characters.
"You didn't need to include the ""single"" part, dude"
"Make sure to remind your dad to wash the reverse ""r / ROAST ME"" off his penis.     "
"It's cute that you think you need a hard hat. What are you protecting, really?"
"bullshit. you're not even a 20 year old ukulele *speller*, let alone maker. imagine being so fucking dumb that you can't even spell your life's passion. "
Best roast here
"I tried that a week ago. I got called ""Faggot"" and ""This violates Twitch agreement, you aren't allowed to rub your nipples on stream"""
I am already bored of the drunken stories you say each night at the bar just by looking at you.
Ice age: eyebrow drift
"When hobos look at you, they give you money."
Well at least the roads are safer now.
I like how your roast is just a recycled comment from the Markiplier roast. You gauged the amount of effort PewDiePie is worth and made the right call.
You look like One Direction if the direction you're going is virginity. 
You could fit one of your eyebrows in between your eyebrows.
"There's a lot of ""your eyebrows are too far apart"" comments here - but THIS GUY somehow figured out the cause behind it. Amazed. "
I'm just curious which of you lost your anal virginity first.
Thanks sid 
The cast of stranger things grows up and turns to heroin.
Someone call this guy's mom and tell them it's not a phase
"I thought chopping the hair off would make me more attractive, but the only people approaching me are other autistic guys, asking me how much my magic deck costs"
And throw in some random meme editing to appear funnier than he actually is 
"Comes from Sweden. Lives in England. Tries to speak like an American. Dresses like a Korean pop star.

Still uncultured enough to write /r/oastme on his tablet."
You're a cat person? This roast is writing itself.
Ellen Degeneres
People have told me i look asian before. That stops once i tell them i have a 2.4 GPA
Theater girls: helping gay guys realize they are gay one sloppy blowjob at a time

They're just lucky they weren't born by the river.
"Let's give him something to speak about. Hey pewds, try making a video on how you felt when WSJ and Disney made you cry on camera. To 12 year olds. For their support. "
What did Lurch ever do to you? 
"Your fan base is comprised solely of 10 year old boys, just like your porn history"
"You should drink the bleach, not put it in your hair "
Who the fuck taught you to put on lipstick? Your dad?
"Good idea chopping the hair off you blend seamlessly into the autistic, ADHD, not good enough to drum in the marching band club"
I will not contribute to your fetish
"I'm more of a cat person, but you nailed it otherwise!"

Bleach and Chong
"I'll take ""reasons Trump is president for $100"" Alex"
The best roast is the constructive one.
This is a weird way to try to get people to watch your Magic the Gathering Online Twitch stream....
And that's assuming he somehow lost it in the first place. 
"You look like the only reason you 2 are dating is to ""prove"" that you're not gay"

I'd be angry too if my robbery kept getting foiled by Macaulay Culkin.
"Ya I agree, oops, brb."
"no matter how much she tries, she'll never get that nut."
It's like putting legwarmers on a paraplegic.
"Doubt this is your first roast, but there are definitely fewer dicks involved this time. "
People could blindfold you with dental floss.
You look like PBR's harrowing attempt of 'The Most Interesting Man in World' ad campaign 
"You played video games and some kids found your fake reactions entertaining. At the age of 25 you finally realized how childish your Let'sPlay‚Äã Cancer was. Now you have millions of subscribers but zero talent creativity or humor wich leads to your everyday-struggle to find a video idea. The results are reaction videos, copying filthyfrank and a roast-me on Reddit. You will record yourself reading insults, pretend to laugh and make a 10 minute video out of it.
 IRL you are rich but have no friends because of your childish and annoying character. You even once pulled 2 random guys in front of the camera and tried to tell the world and yourself that you're not alone. You remind me of the rich, spoiled kid noone wants to be friends with.
 On the internet you are the clown of some antisocial children but outside you want to be taken seriously. 

Some evenings you ask yourself why you ended up here and because you are the only one to blame you get drunk until you fall asleep. 

Even your pets hate you.


Sincerely, 
Slippy
