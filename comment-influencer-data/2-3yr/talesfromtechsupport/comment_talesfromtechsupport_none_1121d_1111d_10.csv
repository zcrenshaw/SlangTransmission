"Wow, I was expecting a story about a customer telling you to eat shit and die, where your super fired you for not selling the belegerent customer more service.  
You're doing a great job, and your colleagues should rally around your example. So many call center staff (based on my experience) would have told the grieving mother to find someone to help her with that, at a rate of $100/hr and ended the call there."
"The normal workflow would be:

Good on you though for handling the situation appropriately. I wouldn't want to be thrown in a brig, drawn and quartered, hanged for treason, or whatever they do where you are."
"Because you actually HELPED the client, you instantly built loyalty with him. Now he'll gladly pay the brightest of houses more than any competitors who may or may not exist, because you made sure his problem was thoroughly fixed.

Not to mention you helped him. That's more than most would do in that situation (clearly).

Good on you. I hope you've moved up to bigger and better things where you can make even more of an impact."

"&gt;Two months later, $CU and several of his colleagues came by to begin the next phase of their expansion and stopped by the operations center.  When I asked him about how everything had gone down, he simply replied,

&gt;“Do you realize how often things break during a move? If your company had been honest with us from the start, we would have just filed an insurance claim and moved on. Instead, my bosses wanted to prove a point.”

THIS. Enterprise level companies have insurance for a reason - their insurance would've paid out, and then sought subrogation from DC's insurer - all a normal course of business.

But only if everyone's willing to be honest and upfront.

I once witnessed a brand new IBM zSeries Mainframe fall off the forklift as it was being unloaded from the truck because the forklift driver didn't realize that the forks weren't fully under the center of gravity.

Immediately he called his boss and our DC folks, they called IBM who immediately shipped a replacement (we REALLY needed this system), and called the insurer.

No one lost their job, same forklift driver unloaded the replacement, but made damn sure that he had the load where it needed to be this time and life went on.

Because everyone was honest and knew that shit happens."

"Anything could have worked.  I don't care what you do on company time as long as you're not endangering the network or your PC.  Your performance is your manager's problem, not mine."
"I counted six occasions where I wanted to either tell her that I couldn't help her anymore or kill myself, I don't do sad things very well. I can't pass her over to a supervisor unless she specifically asked for one, and putting her back in the queue is call avoiding (you can get fired for this) and would have absolutely ruined any shred of a good day she might have been having."
"I once had a guy who was complaining about something or other, Outlook not working, I think. I asked him if he had rebooted, he said a few times, the latest being just before the call. I remote over to try some other troubleshooting, but check the uptime first. 
Uptime was around 6 days, if memory serves.  

He was just logging off instead of actually rebooting.  

Also had a lady who, despite working with computers all day every day, thought that the only correct way to turn a computer off was to push the power button, and had never seen the shutdown menu before."

I asked if I could have an old one to play around with at home. I got it home and tear it apart to see what it looked like. Everything was covered in a thick layer of black dusty grease. It smelled absolutely terrible. The damn thing booted right up though. I had to throw it away shortly after because of the smell.

If it were someone with less moral scruples than /u/Kell_Naranek, he'd probably would have left a little something on the other side that will *maintain* the connection both companies had at specific timeframes, and leeched sensitive information off it.


Therefore, boys and gurls, always keep an eye on those who ""use my personal device for work rather than my company-issued one, for no better reason than because I like it better"" and the ""can you set up my personal computer to access the company network so that I can do my work"" people."

"Reminds me of a management lesson of sorts.

Is it better to fire someone who makes a big mistake, or keep them on?

Typically, it's better to keep them on because it's likely they learned from the mistake and won't do it again.

Naturally, this isn't the case all the time, but should be taken into account, depending on the incident. In your case, it makes sense, the forklift driver learned a hard lesson in making sure your forks are fully underneath what you're lifting.

Conversely, in the OP, $DTECH deliberately went out of his way to avoid responsibility, an undesired trait (unless you're in management)."
"Nice catch! :D

Phones can take an amazing amount of abuse. About 10 years ago, my phone (my last flip before I joined the smartphone circus) accidentally went through the wash in the thigh pocket of my cargo pants. I couldn't afford a new phone, so I pulled the sim and the battery out and left it on my dashboard while I was at work. Six hours in the Virginia sun in August. Put it back together on my lunch break and it booted right up. The screen was never quite right, but worked fine. "

At first I was nice-ish, requesting he stayed while it reprovisioned. 

&gt;Sir, that's going to take up to 20 minutes. I really have other jobs I have to get to. 

I commiserated with him. I completely understood, but begged him to see my position. 3 techs out...3 new modems. Same repeated drops. Hours of my time on tech support. 

He assured me everything would be fine.  I assured him it would not. 

He finally called his supervisor and told him I wasn't allowing him to leave...which was true. But it hadn't gotten uncivil. 

After some conversation of which I only heard one side, he ran to his truck to get the line testing equipment.  BINGO. Shit lines. He tried to leave. His temper was getting short. Mine did as well in return.

Nope. You're getting this handled or scheduled to be handled before anyone goes anywhere. I had a nice talk with the supervisor. Dates and times were set. And there was a backhoe and a concrete truck in front of my house the next Monday morning. They had to tear up a chunk of my driveway.

"Try ten times for high profile stuff. As I recall, the training process went like so:

&gt; 1: Watch the instructor do it.  
2: Watch the instructor do it while they explain each step in the process.  
3: Listen to instructor explain it.  
4: Explain it to the instructor.  
5: Do it, while the instructor watches, instructs, and provides corrections.  
6: Do it while instructor instructs, providing corrections.  
7: Do it while the instructor watches without instructing, but still providing corrections.  
8: Practice without supervision on test systems.  
9: Do it while explaining to a watching instructor, with instructor providing corrections.  
10: Do it while explaining to a watching instructor, with instructor providing NO corrections and assessing competence on completion.

Only after having completed the entire ten step process, repeating any steps as necessary, that I would be prepared to say ""I've got this"" on a live system.
