"I believe ""Do you think I'm stupid?"" ranks near the top of ""Things you should NEVER ask or say to your IT support person"""
"&gt; Me: You know I can help with that if you like?

This is a very, very, very dangerous thing to say to a non-techie... 

You've been extremely lucky (so far)..."
"&gt; It's off, why didn't you say that in the first place? 

Because you lied about the webmail. "
"Well, [it's like with some dogs.](http://i.imgur.com/q46L4QH.jpg)"
"Well, a paid 4 day trip (two for travel, one for work, and one because ""I need to make sure the fix took"") sounds pretty nice to rebuild a mail profile..."
This is gold! haha nobody care when it's working.. 
"&gt; I blame the previous IT specialist

I know management material when I see it"
That's a HoIT who knows how to handle the users.  I hope you learned a lot from him.
$USER most likely thought hitting the power button (to put it in sleep mode) was the same as rebooting.
"This is why I prefer desktops to laptops - way easier to get into the guts. But the mind boggles. I'm trying to follow this guy's chain of logic and it hurts. Did he even have a hard drive to swap to? (Never mind it being the right kind, or having an OS...)"
"&gt; COULD I TALK TO SOMEONE MORE COMPETENT? MAYBE A MAN?

Wow. Fuck off, $Buttpain."
"Because that's how you ruin your life. 

Once you volunteer to do simple downtime stuff at 3:00am, it will be smooth as silk for the users, and a PITA for you. Pretty soon, everything should just be done at 3:00am because it's oh-so-convenient for staff. And if you think working from 3:00-5:00am means you get the next day off without constant calls and interruptions, you got another thing comin'. 

And besides: if access to the MS Project server is so critical, then why can't IT staff move the server at 4:00pm and the affected staffers can wake up at 3:00am and remote in and finish their work to meet their deadline? Hmm? Oh, because that would SUCK ASS? Thought so. "
"To be fair, I prefer plans with specific rates because of this ""unlimited"" being not true anyway. ""Fair use"" and ""within reason"" are spongy terms and can easily be abused to get rid of customers you don't like. No offense, OP."
I think you should just never say it to anyone. We can all be pretty dumb sometimes. And it does make one stupid to assume mistakes won't happen. 
"We simply do not accept ""deadlines"" as an acceptable reason to reschedule downtime. They were informed of the downtime weeks in advance, there is no legitimate excuse for not being prepared. Extenuating circumstances will be accommodated of course,  but their lack of preparedness is the opposite of that. "
"&gt;In an effort to save money, they lose more money.

The bane of IT departments world wide. "
"I always wished the Insert key would get it's own light, up there with CapsLock and NumLock and ScrollLock. Actually, for most people, you could probably just replace the scroll lock light altogether. Or maybe rename the key to Overwrite, which is how most people use it."
"No, it was a very Inspironing machine. There must be at least 7400 of them out there ;)"
"We were using the older image, which, for some reason, had all the accounts as admin. Didn't realize that in time.
I blame the previous IT specialist"
"Ya, I wish I had a dollar every time they Said  they rebooted the computer"
"See, this is what I hate about the current power model, particularly in smart phones. Most users never turn off their phones (unless it dies), many can't while charging (AFAIK iPhones power on when charging). 

Edit: I was going somewhere with this rant, forgot where. I'll leave it."
"""Waiter! There's a problem with my food! I can't seem to pick it up off the plate.""

""That's the menu."""
"Next time you're in a situation and you want to make it sound like you were happy to do it for free just say ""are you sure?""

Makes it sound like you're being even nicer than you were and they aren't going to say ""actually no"""
Nobody cared who I was until I put on the subnet mask.
This guy businesses!
"im glad you were able to humiliate her in front of her class when she was acting like a fucking fool / child. 

Bet you she wont do that again"
"&gt; In the end, I didn't escalate the call. Because I want to keep on IT's good side.

Thank you sir/ma'am, you are a good person."
I remember the day one of my coworkers caused our vSphere cluster to have a complete spazz attack by configuring a new host's iSCSI address to be exactly the same as one of the other hosts. That was a fun day.
"&gt;That's not what I signed up for

Sir, what you signed up for and what you *intended* to sign up for are 2 different things"
"I almost transferred her to our security officer. I mean, he IS a man, and quite competent.

Edit: I should say, I had not heard that before from any of our end users. Other women have, and 9 times out of 10 it's a woman saying it. Very peculiar. "
"I prefer a well-designed laptop to the standard desktop case when it comes to swapping RAM or hard disk. It's usually just one screw, and the cover pops off leaving you with very easy access to those components. My hands are fairly big, so it's easier than trying to reach around a video card or large heatsink inside of a desktop case.

But then every now and then, an engineer comes up with a design like the Vostro 3450 that requires removing *everything* to get to the hard drive, motherboard included. And the keyboard is held in place by four delicate plastic tabs - of the several dozen 3450s I've worked on, only once have I managed to remove a keyboard without breaking a single one of those tabs. Two of which promptly broke when putting the keyboard back in."
"So let me make sure I understand.

You guys:

* Sold an ""unlimited everything"" plan that actually had limits
* Called a customer ""petulant"" and ""childish""

And I'm meant to conclude that the customer is the bad guy?"
Ah the old a lack of preparedness on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine method. 
Of course he is. Do you think he's stupidâ€½
"Yeah well she tried to make him look shit in front of everyone, so fuck her."
"&gt;Apparently he hadn't cleaned his laptop since he bought it.

You make it sound like users normally clean their laptops out."
"&gt; and is now owned by Oracle. 

Found the problem here. "
Was this one of those books that are tough? That is really impressive.
"I wonder if she licks the power cable, too?"
"&gt; Please input a password

A password? Let's try ""password""

&gt; Password needs at least a Capital letter and a number.

Uhm. ""Password1""

----------

6 months later

&gt; Your password has expired. You need to input a new password

Really? Ok, I guess... ""Password2"". 

------------------------------

And that's why mandatory password cycling does not work. Even if you have a smart system that dictionary checks permutations, or requires X characters to be different, the user will just resort to writing it down somewhere. Why? Half of them can't remember their regular passwords, let alone a new one every X months."
Lying to get to the next step of troubleshooting. Classic luser move.
Sometimes the error is not due to a space in the user name but the empty space between the user's ears. 
"user refused it support, ticket closed."
"&gt; You're telling me you wasted all of (company's time)?

No, I'm telling you **you** wasted all of (company's) time because you couldn't be bothered to save your work."
"&gt; bus crash that killed 4 people 

That escalated quickly"
"This is my dog. 100%. We've tried many, many times to train him to let the fuck go of that ball so we can throw it. He loves it when we throw it. He loves that ball so much, though, he doesn't want anyone to touch it.

Our cat, though? Instantly figured out that if he brings us the milk ring and drops it, we'll throw it and he can go pick it up again."

"I have to ask...

You made a change. It didn't work. Why didn't you undo the change?"

"If you schedule it, they will complain for days leading up to the move.  If you just move it, they complain for the 30 minutes it's down, and you can tell them ""we're already on it""."
"Precisely - give me a limit I can plan around, not some vague term that the provider can redefine as and when they like."
I guess that's one way to store cookies locally.
"Ah yes, the ""I just learned a term and I'm now an expert!"" user."

"No. The OP changed the printer's IP address to the same as the gateway. The gateway is the default path all traffic leaves the internal network to head out to other networks and the internet.

So by changing the IP address of the printer to the same as the gateway, the entire network said ""I dont know where to go?!?!!?!? WTF am I to do!?!?!??!"" and the network connection outbound of the internal network crashed."
"Probably: ""people forget that things need to be rebooted"".

"The Chrome tab extensions may have been a background sync from him signing into Chrome. He may not have realized it was a thing. Beyond that? Ya, he was a dumbass. "
"&gt; ""It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."""
"True.   

The real question is what did the service provider salesman say they were selling?     ""Sure, that's included, trust me!   You don't need to read the fine print, I'm telling you get everything you want."""
"&gt; Yes, it's called my fee. 

Did you really say that? Please tell me you really said that. "

"I honestly felt a bit like strangling the luser. She had 2 fallback solutions. Get her coworker to do the PIN transactions or use a diffrent desk.

Neither of which she wanted to do. At that point really it's no longer my problem but her own."
"I'm surprised he didn't just schedule and do the move. Things like I want to work over the weekend, would be met with OK. The server is moving over the weekend at 9am. End of discussion."
Lol $Hitguy looks like shitguy
"The admins weren't just admins. I think they were also nurses or something. I never got all the details on all their roles, but at least one was an office manager specifically, and they were busy enough to justify all of them whenever I was there."
"Back in the early days of my career(early 90's), I was working for a device manufacturer that was pretty small(80ish employees) to have as large of a customer base as they did(global)

One of our dealers in Japan had a customer with a problem that required a specific tool to fix, and shipping via UPS or FedEx would mean that it would spend an extra day or two clearing customs once it got there, which would mean something like $500k/day in lost revenue to the customer.

I was the only one available on short notice, so I carried the tool in my carry-on, cleared customs at Narita, and handed the tool off to one of our dealers techs and then turned around and got back on the same plane and flew home.

Minneapolis-&gt;Tokyo-&gt;Minneapolis wasnt bad for my first trip in First Class, which they sprung for since I was staring down the barrel of about 30 straight hours of flight time.

"one of the directors was also a director for an airline, so we got air fare pretty cheap.  As they had several production plants in each continent, they had high-level corporate accounts with most hotel chains and car rental companies.  I had a blast, but for the guys I was supporting, this was their routine."
"""Do you think I'm stupid?""

""M'am, you can probably answer that question a lot better than I can."""
"My first dog would get the ball, run back, and not let it go. 

My next dog runs to the ball and then runs back. Never picked it up. Looks at it at least. 

My latest two puppies chase after the ball but don't always make it over to it. Sometimes. But other times they'll run halfway and just wander off. 

I fear down the road my dogs will just watch and sit there. I need a fetching protege. "
The thinkpad is powered by innocent souls.
"See - you're willing to work with IT, it sounds like these guys for 3 months couldn't find 30 minutes of downtime that was acceptable, which is clearly ludicrous. "
"&gt;Me: Have you checked the cable.  
Her: No.

At least she wasn't lying..."
"With the stories I've been reading I'm beginning to understand that xD But he has minor technical know-how. Like the ability to install a new hard drive, RAM, what have you. Just doesn't understand maintenance."

"This is what forced me to schedule paid time off before and after all paid holidays.


Big VP: ""Hey, we need to upgrade the software on that server.  It's probably about a day's worth of work.""

"&gt; Me: That's not going to be possible. That part of the code is used in at least four other locations that feeds other reports and so on. If we change it, it's very possible that we'll cause larger errors down the line.

&gt; Boss: But I can't see how we can't just fix the existing one?

Sometimes I wonder if management job interviews should be accompanied by hearing tests."
"""IT department, have you tried turning it off and back on again?"""
"&gt; *One* doc and *three* admin staff

Isn't that mildly excessive?

I think this would solve IT's problems for a while.
"There should be an acronym for that how about, Obsessive Tech Support Disorder, or OTS-D."
At least you were dailing 911 on purpose. That alone is an improvement.
"Unfortunately a lot of charities are like this. I know an unnamed one who have literally zero security (sql injection, passwords in plain text, admin permissions provided by a client-side reverse-engineerable cookie)... and that's just what I picked up in the 30 minutes they had me unofficially looking over their code.

And none of it has been fixed - eight months later - because their web dev assures them that no one would ever target their website."
"*ooooh*

So OP accidentally *made* the network go through a printer, or at least confused it into thinking that was what it was supposed to do, and since printers can't do that, we got no internet?
