"Once Malaysia's biggest telco/isp had an outtage in my area. I called support to inquire because I had no idea why my internet access was dead. This was the conversation:


Sp: Click Start

Me: okay?

Sp: Click Run

Me: Okay...?

Sp: Type in C... for China....

Me: Uh... kay?

Sp: M... for Malaysia

Me: You mean open up command prompt?

Sp: No no... just cm and d

Me: *oookay.... sure...*

Sp: Now type in Ping, as in Ping Pong

Me: Why do you want me to ping?

Sp: Now type in http://www.google.com

Me: How could I ping anything if my net is dead?

Sp: **just try it!**

Me: It says Request timed out, what else should I expect?

Sp: Well.... that means you don't have internet access....

Me: Well thanks captain obvious. That was what I brought up when the call was picked up.


It wasn't until later I found out the entire area was out, and that was what I figured out since all of my friends had no connection. But yeah, sometimes supports are not helpful as well."
what the fuck kind of keyboard doesn't have a backslash?
"They knew the steps, not what they do. Sounds like a checklist support to me."
"one that Phil orders, of course."
Husband does not sound very sophosticated.
That's a great story!  Well done.
"I once answered the phone ""Department of Miracles and Magic Tricks, Chief Wizard speaking"""
"Sounds like the caller is actually decently competent and comfortable with computers (perhaps more so than the husband), but the husband has told her she's not. :/"

"Just repeating other user's comments here.

Basically because people don't *understand* computers. They remember exact steps to repeat ad infinitum. If it's different, it's obviously broken."
"Using some napkin math it sounds to me like if the owner replaced the computers at the beginning of this ordeal, a lot of time and money could have been saved. "
"""IT Liaison"" was how I started down the path that led me to where I am now.

Not much has changed."
Fuckin' Phil.
"""I HAVE A DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE I KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HARASS ME!""

Where'd he get that Degree? Probly bought it on ebay"
"Well, to be honest, I understand his confusion... Office 2016 is the latest and it's a part of Office 365, but it's not ""the latest Office"" per se. 
For the non-tech savy, it can be hard to understand."
"What, you mean you didn't put on your robe of wizardry and sprinkle fairy dust over the request in order to get it done ""now""?"
"&gt;it’s probably tucked away in a department that isn’t printing constantly.

You definitely were not wrong!"
"I see this crap all the time.

We will receive a ticket saying ""*I moved my PC last week but it's not working, I can't connect to the internet. Send someone urgently as I've been unable to work for an entire week now!""*

Really? Who'd have thought since you blatantly ignored company wide policy, carried out an unauthorised move of company hardware and connected it to an inactive network port; that it wouldn't work? What a surprise!

We have a template response for these tickets which basically tells the user to move EVERYTHING back *themselves* else IT will not assist and then after moving everything back, log an office move request and wait. It's glorious. "
"Thanks!  Oh, and the issue with his phone was a bad SIM card.  This was when iPhones were all carrier locked to AT&amp;T.  He was on Cingular (I think?), and he thought he could just swap SIMs."
"&gt;&gt;Doesn't have time for a 2 minute ticket

&gt;&gt;Has time to let it allegedly sit for 2 weeks

Sounds about right"
but but but **READ THE EMAIL I SENT YOU THAT EXPLAINS IT**
"Which is exactly what I told her.

HDD replacement for them was $200 a computer.  Cleanups were normally $50 but took so long I charged them double that.  If she had just replaced all of them she prolly would have come out a goo $2k under what she spent anyways, and that's not even including the HIPAA charges."
"&gt;Phil: Well that was a waste of money, you could have just told me that in the first place.

""Why yes, Phil, you certainly COULD have asked me in the first place, couldn't you?"""
"I just looked around work here. We've got dozens of keyboards, all US layout, every goddamn one of em has a backslash, even the old ass weird NEC 8201a we have floating around for some goofy reason."

"And some people have simply counterfactual beliefs about computers.

They'll believe that if they pay a lot of money for a computer today it should be a good computer forever.  After all, they paid a lot of money for it, right? Things you pay a lot of money for should be Quality, and Quality stuff lasts forever.

They'll believe that computers are basically magic, that they should run forever with no problems, and that therefore if one isn't working right it's because someone broke it.  IT must be breaking them to justify their existence.  Things don't just stop working on their own, especially not Very Expensive things that must, by definition, be Quality due to their price.

Therefore the logical thing to do, given those starting assumptions, is to never buy new equipment, and never hire IT people because they'll break stuff to keep leeching money out of you.

And, since most computer failures follow a bathtub curve, by the time such people are forced to call an IT person, their computers will be creaking antiques all verging on total failure.  So the IT guy comes in, fixes one, and shortly afterwards more start breaking, thus proving that it must be an unscrupulous IT guy breaking stuff to get more business.

The fact that there are incompetent or unscrupulous techs out there makes things worse, because they're usually cheaper and so by the time the victim finally decides to call a real tech in they've often been burned a couple of times and have a real experience with a bad tech to justify their positions.

Which doesn't make such people any less obnoxious to work with, and some are just cheap assholes, but many such people are just starting from bad assumptions and proceeding logically from there."
I would print out that email just so I could burn it.

FTFY

TLDR I got put on hold by one of these people for about 10 min, he picked up the phone and said ""You still there? Ok hold again"" 10 more minutes pass, he picks up and just kept saying ""one second sir I'm working on your problem, please be quiet."" With no clue what my problem was. He was literally the first person the routed me to, so I could describe my problem. Finally I started blaring really loud music in the back ground and he put me on infinite hold, stating ""I hate taking calls, I'm just going to put him on hold until he hangs up."" to someone in the background."
I'd suggest telling her it's even cheaper to email a PDF but she'd probably then dump the black and white copies.

I wish I could go in their head and see how they perceive computers. I just don't understand their thought process. It makes it hard to help them. 
"It's just lack of experience or understanding. That's like asking someone to fly a plane. You show them the steps, tell them this is how it should work. Then they come in and some of the controls have moved around. The controls are still labeled, but they only know how to fly by the hopefully memorized instructions. They don't really know how. They don't know how to adapt in that situation. And then completely changing OS is like changing the plane they're in. A lot of it's the same, but it looks and feels different. One can get a bit lost and very frustrated. I'm not excusing not learning to work with something one has to use on a daily basis. I'm just trying to explain that a lot of these people aren't stupid. They just aren't familiar with the controls."
"Sorry, I'm not computer literate. What do you mean by 'walk over to'? Where do I click that?"
"Well you see it's a technical thing, with all of this science and logic behind it, so women can't possibly understand it because they're brainless shells driven exclusively by emotion whose only purpose is to reproduce. Saying otherwise is an insult to my masculinity so don't you dare argue with me.

/s, although I'd hope you figured it out before you got to this line"
"As long as you can generate appropriate momentum to do so, yeah"
"Yeah, best leave that one for lost - a user like this would surely plug the damn thing in wet if they did manage to fish it out.  Sure, they'd dry it off, never thinking that it's only drying the OUTSIDE of the case... and then you're not just replacing the receiver but potentially their PC too."
"I play around with my clients like this all the time, they seem to really dig when you're just natural with them."
"I once rang for pizza and the guy answered with ""Thanks for calling Dominos, what's your favourite colour?""
I got free garlic bread because I blurted out a random colour before I placed my order.
Must've been a slow evening for them "
"It gets even better.  My doctor friend (truly an intelligent person) grasped that IT can only ""diagnose"" situations the same way a doctor can ""diagnose"" an ailment:  By observation.  So if his colleague has a problem with their computers but clears the error message, my friend will try and repeat the steps to get the error message again.

He says that 9 times out of 10, the error message doesn't come up and the colleague is able to complete his / her task.  So there's a double boon of IT seeing reduced workload."
"If that was me, that line would still be open to this very day somehow. "
"I'll email it to myself, print it out, post it, then burn the post when it arrives at my door. Best be thorough with this dangerous stuff. "
"It's not just a lack of experience though, because there are plenty of people who can jump into a completely new system and learn it through experimentation. I think the root of tech illiteracy is a fundamentally different approach to understanding the world."
and networking is straight up magic
"The typewriter in my grandma's closet has a backslash.

I know because I had to type out specific command line instructions to mail to someone once. That was not a high point in my life.

STORY:

Copied from my other comment-

I remember we were staying at my grandma's house the whole summer, and she didn't have internet. I got a call from my friends about the server we were running (I don't remember what it was for) telling me it kept getting a memory error and crashing (it was some weird text-only flavor of Debian) I was familiar with the error, so I tried to tell them command over phone but they didn't understand, so I asked my grandma if she had a typewriter because it was a long set of commands and I didn't want to write it out, so she got it out and I had to type the whole thing out. I filled almost three pages with instructions, stole a stamp from her letter drawer, and mailed it to my friend's house.

~~I have no idea what we were running on it, but I do remember almost all of my friends were using it for something, and~~ we were trying to launch something new open to the Internet that week for our school. I was the designated server setter upper and it would've been embarrassing if we'd gone live with it crashing randomly.

It was a forum server that sideran a custom cs1.6 map AND a nethack server. We'd set it up to launch for our whole school,(but maybe 15 people ever used the game servers at a time tops, the forum was pretty helpful, people could ask for help with math, English etc) at the end of that week, and it would've been really REALLY embarrassing if it hadn't worked.

You'll be wanting to introduce yourself to the computer *engineers*.

"&gt;A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.

Have used these exact words. All the hurry up and wait nonsense is exhausting sometimes. I had (until recently) an extensive backlog, and I have users who's issue is very minor calling every 4 hours to escalate a P5 ticket. You call them back, and magically no one is in the office. Send an email, don't get a response for hours, sometimes days. I literally had a user escalate a ticket while she had me on hold, because I guess she thought it would go to someone else. This is the end of the line, honey. "

"Au contraire, I managed a coffee shop years ago where one of our regular customers would empty his colostomy bag into the trash.  And being very elderly they frequently had *very* bad aim.   

Also, one of my first jobs ever was cleaning Tourist passenger train cars.  Including pumping out the waste tanks.

You have not known horror until you discovered the previous nights crew did not empty the pump truck and you just tried to pump 100 additional gallons of sewage into an already full tank, resulting in a mountainous geyser of foulness spraying down everything in a 20 foot radius, including but not limited to you, the truck, the mechanics, and the train car you just spent 5 hours cleaning."

Reminds me of one case i got in a while ago from a case which perfectly fit the ""knows enough to break stuff but not enough to not do it"" stereotype. 

He had been told that his hard drive would have to be replaced because it was failing and i was going to transfer the data over to a replacement HDD after getting the HDD out of his laptop. When he came by to drop off the laptop he was holding his hard drive, almost ripped to pieces in his hand and handed it to me with the words ""i took the hard drive out at home to make your work a little easier"". Turns out he had tried to get it out of his laptop and had gotten impatient and decided not to unscrew it and insteas just rip it out of its place. Needless to say that laptop was no longer usable and the data took a bit longer than expected to recover.

"Inspirons. Ugh.

Many years ago a neighbor bought 4 low-end Inspiron laptops for her 4 oldest kids (middle/high school ages at the time). This was in the days of WinXP, just for reference. Within 2 years, every one of those laptops was broken in multiple ways.

As a favor (during a time when she was struggling to support her family while her husband was in rehab), I took the 4 laptops to see what could be done. If I remember correctly, they had:

* Laptop 1 - broken screen, missing several keys from keyboard

* Laptop 2 - would not power on (probable hard drive failure), charge port connection breaking off of system board

* Laptop 3 - broken keyboard, system board failure

* Laptop 4 - shattered screen, would boot but misc hardware errors (not worth investigating)

I took all 4 laptops completely apart, and learned that *the LCD screens in the lids were structural*. There wasn't even anything to stiffen the lids and protect against the screens twisting. I was told that one of the screens broke when a book was set on top of the laptop, and I completely believe that story.

Still, I was able to take the parts from the 4 dead laptops and assemble 2 complete and functional laptops for the family to continue using. In all honesty, it was kinda fun because it was all reward and no risk (they had written off the laptops as trash)."
