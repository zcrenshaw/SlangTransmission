I would be completely smug in that situation too.
10 to 1 the wife told him he needed to bring the computer.
Hard guess why someone would slander him
"As someone who just finished up a CS degree, this does not surprise me at all. Some of my professors really did seem stuck in the 90s with regards to technology. "
"In their defense, I can see the appeal of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""."
Nothing. It's just a funny story.
"I caused a friend to have a similar encounter with the local police once. We had just left a bowling alley around 1am, and the brakes on my car failed at low speed, so I pulled off in the middle of town, and called my friend to come back and pick me up. An officer pulled up shortly afterwards wondering what was happening, and I showed him the puddle of brake fluid under the car. He went on his way after I explained that my friend was coming to pick me up.

About 5 minutes later my friend pulls up and explains that after he turned around, he got pulled over for doing 85 in a 55. The first thing the officer did was to ask if he was on his way to get the guy broken down in town (me), and let him go with a ""Slow it down please."""
"This is why IT management needs to have a spine and force people to use the ticket system.  Taking cold calls because ""nobody bothers anyways"" is a shitty way to ""resolve"" that issue.

We had this exact same issue where I used to work, and we would just refuse to do the work until a ticket was in.  People bitched and managers complained, but we stood our ground and outright refused service to anyone without a ticket, and lo and behold, tickets started coming in.  

You've gotta put your foot down as management, then things like this don't happen. "
I don't really believe there was slander to begin with.
"Well, since he claims that the actions are illegal, that means the case must now be evaluated by your legal team. nothing you can do until they have gone over it, and that can take months... "
"After reading that I actually lost a bit of what little I have left of my will to live

"Why would he speed, though? You're not going anywhere. "
"I tell family my hourly rate - stops the conversation instantly.
"
"But the cop was just doing his job, if I understand this right, so what exactly did he do wrong?"
Maybe he was in a stabby part of town?
What did he expect you to *do* with the power cord?  Put it in a thaumaturgic circle and wave your hands over it while muttering mystic words?
"There's also smugness of extra knowledge. The other person may not have done anything wrong, but you still get a little smirk knowing that you've got all the cards. 

"
"What I was thinking.  Wife probably told him before they left the house.  And was telling him on the drive to the store.  And on the drive home, will probably be telling him ""I told you so.""

As to the ""all I need to bring is the power cord"" line?  Whoever he spoke to probably said ""we'll need you to bring your power cord (with the computer)"" and he only heard what he wanted to hear.
"
"Engineering 102: if it's broke, fix it. If it ain't broke, fix it till it is. "
"I'm curious, why didn't anyone work on her machine while you were out? I would presume if they saw the ticket was open and assigned to you, knowing you were out sick, they could complete the job? We try really hard not to let tickets go stale where I work (management *hates* that), so we'd have picked it up in that situation.

&gt;See I am the kind of person who will try quick fix solutions without actually testing as they generally work.

So am I. One of these days the other techs may beat it out of me."
"You can also make the bill for $550, then add a ""family discount"" of $-550. The bills ends up at $0, which is what they would have given you anyway, but now they know how much it would've cost them having this done elsewhere. This makes your time seems a lot more valuable than not having a bill at all."
"I can top that. One of my CS teachers only had old, mainframe experience from back in the day. Punch cards and all. Try to explain virtualization to her was an hour long process and I still think she believes it still to just be dual-booting different OSs."
"i love people like this, where are they getting this information. They obviously have no idea what their talking about but still think they know exactly whats going on."

"For some people, I will *absolutely* take a meal in lieu of payment.

For others, not so much."
"Wow, that's bad. I'm in IT management with 30 people under me and that's no good. Is there an open door policy where you work at? Maybe consider taking it to to manager once removed. Maybe work can provide assurance that there will no retaliation. He is after all, causing an issue to you and the customer. "
Should have just installed HP Audio Drivers. That would have done the trick.
I dunno... if he's going that fast it's probably a shooty part of town.
"next time you get someone like this, turn into the sloth from zootopia."
"Many companies it does. The moment you threaten or have threatened legal action, the lawyers take over "
"Once time I was talking to a customer and told them to hit the backspace key.  It was met with ""WHAT key? I've never heard of that!""   After some long, long discussion she eventually told me ""Thank you young man! Every time i typed a wrong letter, I was clicking that little X in the corner and starting over!"" 

This story literally happened to me and it STILL seems a little impossible to me"
Instruments and the software to run it are often what causes this problem. Old and unsupported it is left on the OS it was installed on. Expect to have issues moving out to a OS.
"&gt;Client attempts to grab the security guy

Oh boy, got a winner here."
"Can confirm! It makes sense if you think about it. Unless you're trained in the law (or how to properly research the law)... hand it off. It's what the legal team does and you no longer have to deal with the situation.

On no fewer than 3 occasions have irate (and perhaps irrational) people threatened to sue my company while I was trying to help them. Being able to say ""I'm sorry, but once legal action is discussed I do need to escalate this to our legal department"" ends the hassle. One time a lady seemed shocked that I would say that, I reiterated it, she attempted to take it back, I told her it was now out of my hands."
"Well, that, and spoken. Written words are libel."
I work in the telecom industry so we have all sorts of outdated stuff in our network.  Yesterday I found a device on our network where the ems was being run on an old Unix box somewhere.  I go to open up the program and am greeted by Netscape Navigator for unix.
"You know the funny thing is, I bet there's some DIY Arduino/RPi thing that blinks a light or something when you have email."
"Wow. Good work.

Not many people would be able to MacGyver a solution like that.

The fact they pulled you on salary etc shows that they can identify and appreciate a good employee when they see one. "
"For it to be slander, it has to be a lie"
I bet he saw a big black monolith on his desk next to his monitor and started hitting it with a bone.
"I was expecting a different ending:

---
$Cop takes license back to motorcycle and speaks into radio.

$Hero: It's not going to help you any, though.

$Cop (with no reaction): What do you mean?

$Hero (teleports behind $Cop, blade at the ready): nothing personal, kid."
Some of them seemed to make a point of using old tools just to brag about being about to use a command line ðŸ™„
tbh pretty much everyone in CS needs to know their CLI.
"I firmly believe that people need to respect IT the way they respect HR. If you don't fill out HR forms, you don't get paid. If you don't follow IT issue reporting requirements (ticket or specific number to call or whatever) you won't get help. If you complain or make a scene about how there's no time, you can get forwarded to HR.

I'm lucky enough to have worked the last few years at two places where there are a lot of cold calls, but I tend to know almost every employee at my clients. We tend to try to train users to be skeptical of us as well, and I love (when I'm the cold caller to a user) to hear ""Can you prove you're with IT company?"" It shows they actually listen. One client I worked with even adopted a secret pass phrase that wasn't written down directly anywhere in either of our documentation so that if they got a call they could verify it was one of us."
"The best part of working with the guys I worked with when I did in store tech support was if a client demanded to speak to a dude, I'd get one of them and they would be happy to listen to the client then go, ""Um. I'm not sure. But she would know. Have you asked her yet?"" Admittedly I probably wasn't the smartest/most knowledgeable tech we had but in that type of situation they'd have my back."
"Open door policy = trap.
I once did the exact same thing, went to my bosses' boss for a ""confidential talk"".

The next morning, my regular boss called me into his office to chew me out for going over his head. I had repercussions, he did not."
"Heck, I'd have gone straight back to the boss's boss and had a chat about how his subordinate was deliberately and explicitly interfering with the open-door policy."
So what is the word count on a paper like that? One word per paragraph?
"Well, isn't that what tech support is? Some weird voodoo black magic or something? "
"Engineering 103: if it's broke, use duct tape."
"That is ... surprising, since virtualisation has long been common in the mainframe world as a means of supporting older programs."

"I got yelled at once in some dude's office. I gave him a flat stare and walked away. Got back to my desk to a ringing phone. Picked it up to more yelling. Hung up. 

Fired up an email copying my boss and his boss. It read something like this:

I do not come to work to get screamed at for stuff outside of my control. If you still need assistance, I'll be back by your desk in 10 minutes. I suggest you calm it down a bit. "
"I worked at a place that was way worse than that.

Phones were banned. All computer activity was recorded. All calls were recorded. Any talking in the office was expressly forbidden.

Barracuda."
"The person probably said ""You'll need to bring your power cord"" since people would normally bring their computer without it i guess. 

That's assuming the person isn't an idiot though."
"There are three guesses we came up with from my office.

1. He is having on going connectivity or speed issues.  Either he read somewhere online that the one ip assignment was specific to his area (which was incorrect and doesn't mean there is a server there), or he has been tracing to a business with that assignment (and didn't realize we hand off traffic from residental to business in z-city).

2. He ran a speed test that referenced z-city and thought that ment we assigned an ip that is located in z-city. In this senerio he likely found the xx assigment from searching online.

3. He is having trouble sending email so he ran a traceroute to an email ip.  That traceroute came up with z-city at some point.  According to my boss xx assignment was a common ip start for our smtp servers out of x-city about 10 years ago before when changed them.  Somehow he might have been thinking that he needed that ip assigment to send mail faster or prevent our spam filters from blocking what he was sending.

I decided to reference a version of guess 1 in my notes."

"&gt; at first glance the machine ""appears"" to have finished imaging. By this point it's already joined to the domain, so it's simply sitting at the login screen, our login wallpaper in the background, as if all is well.

It seems like a solution to this would be to modify the task sequence so that it changes the login wallpaper at the earliest step possible to make it something that obviously indicates that the computer is broken, and then have the VERY LAST step of the process change it to what ever the final wallpaper you want is."

"Why the fuck does management always think they need to blame people for things? Why can't both companies just act like adults, realize it was a simple mistake and no harm was done, and just drop it???"
"When I worked 911 I watch something similar go down on my computer. We dispatched for several departments that all neighbored each other and one departments area sat on a major highway and they loved to set speed traps. Well 2 officers from the main department ended up being a bit late to work so they get caught by the speed trap. We all had a laugh when we ran the plates saw one of our guys names then suddenly the traffic stop was ended with no citation. The first time it was gold, the second time made our day."
That's exactly how it is at my work too. It's a great environment to work in. Unfortunately when this went down they were to busy hysterically laughing in the backroom to come out and have my back. If the tables were turned I would have been in the back laughing too. So I hold no grudges.

Giant block of text: THIS COMPUTER HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY CONFIGURED! PLEASE RETURN TO IT!
"Many years ago in central California I had a janitorial job that included cleaning the offices of the local police department (vacuuming, emptying trash, swabbing toilets, etc). During one particular early in the morning shift my cleaning partner and I decided to take a little break, drive a few blocks away, and partake in some of mother nature's finest in the form of a rather generous marijuana cigarette (aka ""joint"").

Half-way through this delightful bit of heaven we were mortified to be lit up by Johnny Law. It seems one of the neighborhood watchful had noticed our suspicious vehicle parked there glowing from within as we passed the joint back &amp; forth and called 911 to declare an ""emergency"" as somebody was clearly having more fun than she was.

After a bit of conversation the officer came to realize that he could 1) bust us for possession and suffer the consequences of being the officer responsible for the police station not being cleaned that night or 2) let us go with a stern warning so we could do our job. He chose #2, but kept our roach.

I now live in Texas, and sometimes really really miss California."
"Somewhat. He was calmer, but still fuming.  I made it clear that I do not deal with people that scream at me. I don't care what the problem is. "
