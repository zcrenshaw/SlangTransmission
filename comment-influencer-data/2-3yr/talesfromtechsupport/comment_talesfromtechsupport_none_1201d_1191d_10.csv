"What the shit? I've seen some pretty dumb users on here, but this has to be in the top 3 for sure. That'd be like wondering why your car didn't work because your wife crashed it. It makes me so frustrated when people refuse to apply basic logic to IT related stuff because they're not a ""computer person""."
"I instantly though ""wrong type of paper"" when I read the title. I must be more fluent in customer-speek than I thought."
"Never, ever delete files from someone's computer without backing them up first. I have a pair of 1TB USB drives that is their sole purpose, to back up users files before deleting. I keep them for 30 days after cleaning their computer - if they call me back in a panic about missing files, I have them."

"Ah, yep. I've run into a few people who do this in outlook

JG: ""Ok so I can clear your deleted items?""

User: ""What?! NO! How would I go back to find any old email?!"""

"This happened to me recently, with the new chip card:  

&gt;me: Do I just put it here in the bottom?  

Cashier- yes.. (As the reader beeps) it's a little sensitive. You'll have to take it out and put it in again.  

&gt; (trying hard not to laugh) um ok.  

Cashier- oh push it in a bit further.   

&gt; I just smile and push it in.   

Cashier- leave it in for a little while.  

&gt; barely holding in laugh, comply, quickly finish transaction.  

Cashier- ok you can take it out now. "

"I had to miss Y2K NYE in NYC so I could babysit stuff that I'd already tested against a roll forward...All because I worked with some guys who didn't understand the problem well enough to be confident that they'd fixed it.

They were saying stuff like, ""Well, okay the application works, but what if the server has problems?!""

And I said, ""It's unix.""

And they said, ""IT CAN STILL HAVE PROBLEMS!""

I said, ""Yea...In 2038."""
At least the guy was honest and apologetic. That's a rarity.
"&gt; No, they were the guys complaining. The new head of QC had ""fixed"" the CoC problem by having his immediate subordinates, who were supposed to be managers, start cranking out CoCs manually. 

I had to read that last sentence twice. *Managers doing regular people work?*"
"1. saw the problem

2. acknowledged the problem

3. didn't blame someone else for the problem

4. said sorry for wasting time

5. told you you could close the ticket

I mean, it doesn't get a lot better."
What happened to the two guys punching the stuff into word? Did they got fired because you made them obsolete?
"Oh my gosh that sounds absolutely horrible to deal with.

Good for you for handling it so well."

I know right?! What a blessing that was. She may have fucked up super bad but she wasn't accusatory about it :)
"I've noticed that as a small company we're a sucker for high-profile hires. And then when we land one and they have no idea what they're doing, no one wants the egg on their face that comes from admitting the guy is a moron. So there is pressure to make it work, and the managers who have been promoted from within the company are team players and usually end up doing the heavy lifting.

But they are also the guys and gals who get you fired if they don't like you. In this case, I turned out to be their instrument of disgruntlement."
"I like how they laughed about it, just perfect"
"Reminds me of one of the rule at my university, which said not to use ""excessive force when plugging something into the usb port""
When i asked one of our IT guys, he told me it happend ALREADY A FEW TIMES that someone tried to plug in a usb-stick the wrong direction, and instead of turning the stick, this genius just pushed harder and harder until the port . . . gave up"

"This.

My mom has dish, had it for more than 15 years now. Always has problems, firmware, receivers crapping out, outdated software, etc. 7 or 8 years ago switched to another provider, better software, signal, support etc. Basically 2 months worth of troublefree service. Paid the price of a small car to break the contract and switch back to dish. Why? 

The interface was different and she didn't want to learn how to use it.

Some users, you just have to sit back, watch the train-wreck, and tell them to deal with their own mess."
"&gt;I didn't lose my job over that. 

Wow.

&gt;They all had a good laugh, 

WOW.

&gt;and admonished me to be more careful in the future.

Okay, that makes sense...

&gt; I suggested that they find a way to lock the cable down, but they rejected that idea.

You know what, that place deserved to go out of business.

"I guess quite a large number of us just read the headline **""Why did you delete my files!?""** and immediately thought: *""You emptied the recycle bin, you poor fool, didn't you? Don't you know, that that is where many users keep their most important files?""*

It would be funny if it wasn't so sad how predictive some behaviors are."

"Reminds me of a few weeks ago. We use a third party company that looks after all power related things on my site. I'm also on call 24/7 (I get paid extra for it, thankfully) and have a 1 hour SLA. Anyway, so I was sitting at home one fine Saturday afternoon chilling, watching movies, when my phone rings. I answer it. It's the monitoring company saying a bunch of switches and routers were down (so I was unable to remote in). So I rock up to the site to check things out. Guess who I find? Yep, the third party company shut power down to the site to do some testing. Thanks for telling me!"
"The delete icon on Android Froyo looks sorta like the front of your typical greek temple (google the Temple of Zeus, Olympia) so that was sorta understandable (once she pointed it out. Before then we were wondering what the hell the 'temple icon' she was talking about was). She's a history teacher, so we understood how she'd reached that conclusion too.

As for biting her phone, the first time she broke it was on the train (standing room only), the conductor asked for her ticket, but both her hands were full. Phone in mouth, looking through purse with the other two, until there was a bump on the track, and yeah, one cracked phone screen. So we got her the Motorola DEFY, which at the time was advertised as being 'invincible' (which, retrospectively, should have been a red flag). She took it out of the box, and without even *powering it on* put it in her mouth to joke about how the screen won't break on this from biting it, which was pretty much the exact moment that the screen broke because she was biting it.

I know."

"In your home, regardless of whether it's a recycle bin or a trash bin, don't you guys still have people that come by and take it away from you? Or at least some system where you drop it off?  To a house resident, the only difference between the recycling and the trash is what the disposal company does with it AFTER they take it away from you. Either way, you still don't have it anymore. 

PS I think recycling bin is more accurate because the OS actually just labels that disk space to be reused, not that it actually destroys the data. 

TLDR the user is thinking about ""reuse"" not ""recycling"""
You have to do it in such a manner as to allow them to save face. Pointing out the obvious would make him look bad in front of his crew.

"Just to be clear, did you buy another TB of storage from your own paycheck? "
"Oh yeah, I´ve seen this one before.
Worked as the lonely SysAdmin of a small company, with really small storage on a lot of old servers.
The exchange server was always full, and everytime I looked up who was hogging the storage it was something like

1: CEO at 10x anyone else (6 year old emails in the inbox...)

2: Sales Director at 5x anyone else

3-45: Everyone else."

I wouldn't be surprised if there was some symptom that she hadn't mentioned that fit the results you were implying. The 10 seconds of silence were thus her mentally connecting Cause A to Result B.
"I used to work in auto parts, and my near-retirement manager loved to tell the story of the guy who came in trying to figure out why his car sounded weird. The manager went out and had him start it. It was chugging, knocking, and pinging while smoke bellowed from the tailpipe. What was weirdest of all, was that the car was fairly new, maybe only two or three years old at most. (This was back in the late 70s.)

The manager asked when was the last time he gave it a tune up? The guy looked at the manager funny, and then beamed, ""You don't have to tune up this car!"" The manager asked him why. He replied that the dealership told him that the car was 'maintenance free'. Apparently the guy took it literally. He never changed a single fluid or tune up part, and put about 70k miles on it!"
