"Better locked out than locked in...

In university, I was working late together with some other students. When we did this, we usually just walked trough the lobby to an exit-only door in the other building. But that night, we left the elevator - and our way through the lobby was blocked. Someone had set up moveable walls across the corridor.

As we did not intend to stay there overnight, we moved one of the walls to pass through - only to be greeted by an angry, barking guard dog. Finally, some security guy arrived and angrily asked us why we were breaking in. We got that settled, but he did not want us to pass through the exhibition in the lobby that he had to guard. In the end, we had to threaten him: Either we can pass and leave through a non-armed door, or we take an armed exit and leave him to explain the situation to the fire fighters and police that would be alerted by opening those doors.

So, in the end, after a lot of grumbling, he let us pass..."
"The second someone even mentions the possibility of a lawsuit, it instantly becomes an issue that is way above my pay grade.  I would be happy to forward you to our legal department who can discuss this issue further.  If they deem that a technician should continue to assist you, they will let me know.  Goodbye!"

"Administrator needs to regroup. You can't unring a bell, and a school with no dictionaries is idiotic and anti-educational. The teachable moment here is:  

1. Words have multiple meanings.  
2. Dictionaries unlock hidden knowledge, and learning things is fun, and that is ok.
3. It is not OK to make a joke out of someone's name, because most people don't choose their name, and you should have empathy.

"This is also a good opportunity to remind people that [rfc661](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761) lists valid test domains as 'example.com', 'example.net', and *.test

"We don't which is a double edged sword really as on the one hand, it'd be useful for reporting assholes like this to management, but on the other hand it'd be used by quality to enforce pedantic rules such as empathy and other such bullshit which ultimately would make our lives (as agents) more difficult.

As it stands the lack of recording means we can be fairly harsh to these people (within reason) and not have any repercussions. If our calls are recorded it would have likely resulted in an hour of back and forth with the caller trying to pander to her and tell her everything is okay with the world and she is indeed a special little snowflake (in some sort of potty attempt to please quality/upper management) - instead of simply being able to hang up on her ass and move onto the next caller."
"I have an issue with the casual usage of ""ASAP"". For me I consider that urgent. Not urgent like *pants on fire get out of here* but *do this once you've finished whatever you're doing*.

"3 AM.

Doing minor OS update on AIX that runs a major hospital pharmacy system.  Have proper change control for the downtime.

Running backup, or verifying- not sure.  But, step out to restroom while it's running.

On return, the doors won't let me back in.

Find out all of the card access doors are not working.

Call cops.  We have a hospital PD and they manage the door access.  

""Of course you can't get in.  We are running a system update on the machine!  We're going from DOS to a more secure Windows XP!""

Well, you locked me out of the computer server room and I'm in the middle of an upgrade.

""Of course!  We're doing an upgrade.""

I am too, and if I don't get back into the room in a few minutes, the system will be down beyond my downtime window and phones are going to start ringing.  Did you guys announce this outage?  Was this in change control?

""What's that?  No, we don't announce it.  We don't have to.  This is a SECURITY FUNCTION AND WE DON'T HAVE TO ASK IT FOR PERMISSION.""

Ok.

So, I go and call and wake up the pharmacy director and he calls the CEO of the hospital.  We're initially told it will be about another hour before they're done and our downtime is increased... until.

We then get a call that their update did not work.  The card access system is down.  Being non-IT people, they did not back-up, they have no back-out plan.  The vendor won't be available until 8 AM pacific time and it's 4 AM Central time.  

And, great- the way they took the system down left the doors secure for our area.  They were wide open for patient care areas like operating rooms and the like.

They called our facility manager and they had to use a giant jack to crack the fireproof door open where I could abort my update and bring the system back on line about 2 hours late.

They then removed the police from managing that server at the OS level.  They retained application control, but we managed the OS and hardware.

"Legacy/backwards compatibility. When it was conceived, it was good enough (IIRC, the function works by encrypting 8 nul bytes with the given password using 56-bit DES encryption; when it was made, it was thought to be so secure that the passwords ""hashed"" this way were left world-readable, since the computers of the time were so slow)."
