"Oh great, caller just emailed over a complaint about why *we* allow ""donotreply"" addresses as it ""prevents"" caller from carrying out ""urgent"" and ""business critical"" work - caller is a part time admin assistant! I'm going to leave that for someone else to deal with, I've had enough stupid for today."
"unplug the display (vga/DVI)  cable from tower (the on show one)

     hey where'd the picture go. 
     That's why you need the tower"
"Bill for an hour, and for the cost to ship it back."
A /r/talesfromtechsupport story where everybody is happy in the end? What the hell?
Yeah I don't see why OP didn't try this.  First thing I thought of while reading the exchange
To be honest - I don't mind helping people who are clueless but cooperate and are nice. The caller mentioned above however was spewing venom acting like her stupidity was my fault - those people deserve a special place reserved in hell.
"Ah, that old old tale of ""I want this done faster than I am willing to pay for the SLA it would require to accomplish in that time."""
"Did you write a set of instructions for proper insertion of DVDs? He probably isn't a computer person, how can you expect him to know highly technical details like that?"
"&gt;$Intern, interrupting: I have a user on the phone who is asking what the difference between 67 and 56k

&gt;$Me: 11k

$Webmaster: Matherfucker."
I can understand when people get mad but this just seems odd. Surprised to hear your HR department actually cares about these kind of things too.
The range of effort customers will put in before resorting to tech support always astonishes me. Some of my customers apologetically confess that they haven't been able to get their computer to work after *two days* of Googling the problem themselves and trying everything under the sun. And then there are the ones like this.
I'm sure the answer for Catch-22 is 'If you are that close to bankruptcy we certainly aren't going to be giving you credit.'
"Ah, if only.  Unfortunately it's help desk for internal support, so that wasn't an option."
I can understand not wanting to upgrade.  It can cost a lot of money and manpower.  But purposefully building poor systems so you can fix them... I hope he gets blacklisted or something.

"If they're older, you can compare the monitor to a TV and the tower to a VCR. "
"This ""Use It Or Lose It"".. I work at a big, international well-known hosting company. When we rolled out the new version of our eCommerce products for Small- and Mid-size businesses we were really thinking about keeping the old platform running. Why? We had 90,000 dormant accounts. Each account paying like 20 to 60 US-$ per contract, depending on the tariff being ordered.  
Yup, that's right. 3,6 Million US-$ (in average...) EACH FUCKING MONTH! for nothing. Some customers had 1 article in their webshop. Some didn't even configure a domain. And so on. Our product management thought long about it. But, and that's what I like about my company, the board members decided to inform every customer that they are compulsorily migrated to our new eCommerce platform.  
And of this, based on how our contracts are written, have the right to immediately cancel their subscription. Still.. Only 50,000 of those dormant accounts canceled their subscription. The others still don't care."
"The funny thing is, the customer who wants the SLA changed is an office manager. That's it! Nothing special! No one of power just a grumpy older woman who doesn't let her team wear headphones or have conversations because they should be working. "
Maybe stroking it should be higher on the IT flow chart?
"""Hey you broke it!""

Or

""Plug the power back in!"""
"I'm amazed no-one has broken out ""Sir, I am NOT a DVD guy..."" by now."

"Those are usually the people who throw around stuff like this the most.  Their favorite word is ""unacceptable."""
Nice!   my invoice is in the mail.
"&gt; Customer: But without the service, I can't make money and won't be able to pay you.

But with the service you weren't making enough money and you weren't able to pay us last month when we gave you extension..."
"&gt; I can understand when people get mad but this just seems odd.

I just really don't understand her logic or reasoning behind what she did. Then again, we get this sort of thing an awful lot (I find people will do or say anything just to avoid having to reset their password).

I'd love to be a fly on the wall in that HR meeting and listen to her reasoning behind this."
"&gt; **Caller:** DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? 

The correct response is ""You said it, not I"""
"In the last 6 hours, I've dealt with ""Down for Days"" (6 months before they noticed and decided to get very angry...), two ""Use it or lose it"" (must start keeping track of record holders - capital idea!), and a side of ""If it Ain't Broke"".

As Cable TV isn't as prevalent here in AU, our go-to metaphor for ""Use it or lose it""-type refund requests is slightly different - ""If you lease a house, and choose not to actually move in to it, would you not be expected to still pay rent?""

But yes... these small tales are all far far too familiar :)
"
"huh, that's a lot more ethical than I'd have expected. 3.6 million a month for nothing is really tempting"
"First of all, congratz on the nice job. Second, the salary negotiation is always a hassle. You don't want to offend them, but still want enough. They want to go as low as possible, but don't want to offend you..

From personal experience:

* Start big! Your first offer can be way higher than what you actually expect, because you know it and they know it; there will be a haggle. (So don't feel outrageous)
* Practice! Imagine the situation; you sitting in front of HR or your boss or whatever.. Think about why you're valuable to the firm and tell yourself these points in the mirror. For two reasons: First, you practice how to sell yourself and second, you have to know these points in your sleep, to bring them in at the rigth point in time. This is important, since you will probably be a little nervous, especially if it's the first performance review (ever).

Hope this helps and good luck!"
"That sentiment pisses me off. Everyone has a business unit. You look up his charge to information and book that hour to his BU plus shipping.

This isn't a FU to him. It isn't petty getting back. It's how business is done."
I would 175% keep duplicates if not for the cost. The lighter I can travel the better. If somebody else is footing the bill? Fork yeah.
"That would be setting a precedent people wouldn't be too happy about.  We get so many stupid questions that it's barely a bother - they're just things my co-workers and I can laugh at, and also a way to get our ticket numbers up.  I try not to take it too seriously, otherwise I'd probably have a serious drug addiction and rage problems by now."
Their computer doesn't therefore it applies to everyone.
"Oh hey, I never realised that this only happens on my lenovo laptop. I always thought it was the webpage I use at work, that was wonky.

Thanks."
"&gt;Then there's Engineers. When Engineers try to fix their own problems, mayhem ensues.

The only thing to fear more than a hardware engineer with a software patch, is a software engineer with a soldering iron.
"
"""Nope, that's Don O'Treply. He was downsized last year, but we had to keep his email address live or things broke."" "
"just to be clear, do we stroke the computer, or do we stroke the user?"
"&gt;Today I get a resume of the situation, turns out DM shut down the computer because he thought that was how you logged in, and then to turn it on again he was using the DVD drive eject button. Since it didn't work he tried punching it until the brackets broke and then proceeded to push a needle in the manual eject hole.

What in the fuck?!"
"You have to be thankful that people of those kind exist. They are your source of income. If everyone tries to fix their own problems, there won't be as many tech support people as it is today."
"Not your fault, honestly.  Sure, you were *technically* mistaken, but what kind of idiot builds their configs in the sample directory?"
"So... did you get paid for an hour of work? I'm assuming they didn't just say they weren't paying for such an easy fix, or you'd have said that in the story. "
I think she's sad that she's stuck working in the same job she's been in for the last 15 years. 
"speaking of deleting.. almost 20 years ago now on NT i had one window open that had a bunch of temp files .. probably about 10k files or so.i was planning on deleting.. but another window opened that was the user directory listing ( about 10k users ).

CTRL+A, Delete, Clicked yes.. deleting XXX of 10,000.... walk away.

come back 5 minutes later.. see the directory names slowly going.. .. ""Awe, shit""

For some reason right before i started that adventure i made a backup... so no major harm done."
"&gt; **That One Rockefeller Quote**

"&gt; I thought they had good sales people here.

Maybe the customer was on to something after all."
"That, or explaining that ""the monitor is like your TV, and the tower is like your cable box."" 

It's simple, and gets the point across in terms that the customer will likely understand. OP did not explain it well. "
"well, he kind-of has a point it seems like he was really looking for an All-in-one unit. You should have pointed him to some should your store stock any, other wise he needed to go elsewhere. "
"Sir I already told you I am NOT a DVD guy. You're refusing to help me so I'm going to hang up!

FTFY"
"Then there's Engineers. When Engineers try to fix their own problems, mayhem ensues."
"""The TV thing, the modem (that's what they call the tower), the mouse, and the typewriter thing.""  These are the parts of a computer."
"""Let me show you what I mean""

 *unplugs monitor from tower*

 ""ohhhhhh""

But yeah pointing them to an all-in-one would have probably been the best. Although I'm not quite sure they would have gotten it still."
Then he would have complained about the price difference and wanted just the monitor anyways.

"Some people, when something isn't working and they are stressed, they behave like a deer in headlights. 

You don't get those calls because they don't know what to do (unless its one of the ""hey, i was having problems last week but everything's fine now... just wanted to report it"").

Then there are people who at least kind of know what they are doing and they try to troubleshoot the problem. They tend not to call because they are like us techs and don't want to give up once they've gotten so far on it.

The left overs are the people who just flip out. The world isn't working the way its supposed to, so the only logical thing to do is exact revenge. They can't yell at the computer, so the person trying to fix it is as close as they can get."
"&gt;Now put it on the lid. 

&gt;No, the lid. 

&gt;The. Lid. 

&gt;LID. 

&gt;THE LID."
"To me it sounds as simple as.. hmm, something like this?

'Look, I have been here three months and found problems none of you noticed that cost you millions, be it in revenue, bad PR and lost business. And when you did notice, it was little more than a feeling you could not quantify. Instead, you are now saving those millions. Now imagine what I can do working for this company in a more structured fashion whilst feeling more appreciated and valued.'

And from there to continue the conversation into actual numbers."
"That's kind of a shitty attitude, IMO. Why should I have to babysit who knows how many people, checking in multiple times to make sure that their part of a project is on schedule? If I drop off my car at the shop and they say it'll be done at the end of the day, do I need to call them multiple times during the day to make sure that it'll be ready when they said it would be done? ""Oh, we didn't hear from you and another customer came in with a rush job, so your car won't be done until tomorrow."""
"&gt; For some reason right before i started that adventure i made a backup... so no major harm done.

I think my backups have saved me from my own accidental fuckups about three times as often as they've saved me from malware, hardware failures and every other kind of fuckup.

It's ok to be a fuckup if you backup. Usually."
I'll gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger today.
"&gt; the modem (that's what they call the tower)

Don't be ridiculous - everyone knows the tower thingy is called the CPU!"
"Was the initial call recorded? If so, email your manager explaining the situation, and attach an MP3 of the recording. If this caller's intent on kicking up a fuss, you should engage in a bit of CYA just in case."
How the hell else do you use an electronic?? I'd think turning it on is something anyone can grasp...
Exactly. Ignorance I can understand and will gladly help we are all ignorant of many things. Stupidity however is another story.

"Do you not have any remote access solution? Something like splashtop or TeamViewer? Saves all the time and hassle of walking over, plus you have access to your network tools since you are still on your main workstation. 

Still, sounds like someone is being overly demanding. "
"Correct answer: I don't see anything out of order here, you received the automatic replies for all your emails to the do not reply address, everything works perfectly as it should.

"Does your department have a budget? Metrics is how your budget gets funded. Write tickets for *everything*. Then when budget time comes around, your director can say ""we averaged $X hours per week resolving tickets for this business unit and we need the budget to hire another tech to cover it."
And I'm just sitting here using ethernet because I can't stand WiFi. 
"Well ... I wouldn't say ""never"". For instance: If you've just been fired and there's a network switch next to your desk ... be sure not to leave any loose wires laying around ..."
"Bill them for this.  Including emergency priority one call out fee, with whatever minimum you have for emergency visits (should be at least 1.5 hours, standard is more like 2-3 hours at the emergency rate).  

So make up your bill for like $600 or whatever, and take it in person to their boss.  
First, explain calmly that this issue could have been fixed over the phone for free in 30 seconds, if the user had been willing to cooperate with some simple troubleshooting.  However rather than cooperating with your requests, the user simply demanded that you come out immediately.  This wasted a bunch of their time and would have been very expensive (at this point hand over the bill).  
Then explain that *this one time* you will either be charging them a nominal fee ($50-$100) or giving them the visit for free, but you want them to understand that next time this happens they will be getting a bill like the one you just handed over, solely because the employee refused to listen and cooperate.  Point out that 5 minutes of employee time is NOT worth $600, and suggest they remind their employees to cooperate with tech support when they call.  

If this works, great- you've made a friend with the boss who now knows you're a reasonable guy/gal because you cut them a break and suggested a way to reduce their IT costs.  
If not, then next time it happens, send them the stupid $600 bill with a smile and if they complain, remind them of the meeting.  "
"Yes, I have VNC installed on all of our desktops and use it as much as possible. However, certain people like to throw hissy fits and must be appeased. Most end users here think that if they don't see IT staff doing any work in person that we never do any work. And in at least 75% of cases, when I remote in via VNC, I have the problem resolved in a shorter amount of time than it would have taken to walk over.

Another thing that doesn't help is my boss's perspective on things. He is in a different time zone and visits the office once every 5-6 months or so. He threw a fit when I tried to get approval for a helpdesk ticketing system and a standard guideline for IT issue reporting (email is the first point of contact, phone if email/PC is down or several users are affected/urgent issues, walk-ins and ""while you're here..."" need to be reserved for upper management and urgent issues only).  I was met with ""you can't expect people to follow procedures"" and ""we're supposed to be available and willing to help"". We really needed a system like that implemented as some issues were falling through the cracks due to poor communication and non-existent issue tracking. It took going over his head to get it approved and things are so much easier now, but he's still really passive-aggressive about the whole thing. Makes no sense to me at all.

So, there's a balance I try to deal with as each issue comes along. I try to fix it in the most efficient and effective way possible. Sometimes that involves putting out other fires, like management having ""no time to explain"" even if it's something really simple. This job would be so much easier without all these end users..."
I eagerly await the followup post where you are called in to troubleshoot why the rocket isn't working.

"was the customer satisfied with the answer?

Did they end up getting it? How much did it cost?

Quite interesting actually, I never noticied anybody every offering 67K back in the 90's I would have jumped on that! Sounds amazing (for back then, obviously)"
