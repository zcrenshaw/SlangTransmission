"The interesting take on this story is that your admin had a ticket for 4 years and had he even just taken a few minutes to find out why they even used the system, the company would have saved about $250,000 or more over that time...and you saved them another $250,000 over the next 4 years and they gave you 100€ as a bonus.

"I used to do board level repairs on laptops and once upon a time I was working on a board using a scope so I was less than ten inches away from the board.  I put the heat pump on it and it there came the worst smell imaginable.  Turns out it I inhaled evaporated cat piss.

OK its official.  My most up voted comment of all time is about inhaling evaporated cat piss"
"I know that smell way too well. My mother is a bit of an... idiot. Some 6 years ago I was staying on her couch, She amassed a collection of 16 cats in a 1 bedroom apartment (Everyone who knew me back then is absolutely shocked I have only 2 cats now and want no more) We had a total of 2 or 3 litterboxes. So EVERYTHING got peed on. She had some shitty little tracphone and a cat peed on the booklet. For reasons I do not understand, she wanted to keep it and figured microwaving the pissed on booklet would dry it out. I was NOT aware of this. Once the smell hit me I asked her what the fuck was in the mircowave. She told me and I believe I screamed at her so bad I lost my voice. I ripped that thing out of the microwave, threw it out the window and told her to never even THINK about doing that again. The smell was there LONG after the incident, I believe for the rest of the life of that microwave. I have smelled many terrible things in my life, Microwaved cat urine is the absolute worst.

Edit: To the random stranger who gave me gold for my comment about microwaved cat urine. You made my night and my week. Lol, thank you.

Edit 2: I never thought my top comment would be about microwaved cat urine. I love you, Reddit!!!

Bonus: Second worst smell I've ever experienced. When I was 16 I was in a group home. Boy and girls lived in ""Pods"" which consisted of about 5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms on opposite side of the large house. Each week you had a chore. This particular week my chore was the bathroom. The girls bathrooms had their trash changed once a day in the morning. Trash cans were inconveniently next to heaters. You can probably see where I am going. Feminie products in a metal trash can next to a heater didn't exactly smell great. One time I took the trash cans out of the bathroom to change the bags. There were about 5 other girls in the pod just chilling out. When I opened that trash can the smell was so bad that the girls scattered like cockroaches, retching the entire time. Every sunday during community group (The group where we bring up household problems so they can be solved) us girls BEGGED to get new trash cans. I was there for 6 months, those trash cans were still there when I left.

"Actually PCI is hot-pluggable.

You just need the mainboard, the PCI-card and the OS to support it.

Since so few actually do, this is a very rare thing.

I remember some older high end IBM servers (like the x3850 x5) have hot-plug PCI slots.

I don't know of anyone ever making use of this particular feature outside of testing to see if it really worked.

This may be one of the reason why it is no longer there in newer models."
"I have a theory. Back in the day there was a game called System Shock 2, an RPG which included the skill ""Cyber Affinity"" - a character's overall affinity for computers. Some people develop this skill. Some people are born with it. And some choose a class that locks the skill out for them. Forever. That class's name? ""User""."

"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the goal in tech support is to get the user back up and running and able to get back to doing their job. Reinstall the print driver and they're back and happy vs. make them sit at their desk and fume (or vent to their boss) while you waste a half hour troubleshooting the issue, which will 99% of the time be that the printer driver needs to be reinstalled."
"All I could think of the whole time was ""oh no he's going to get them fired and they're going to blame him.""

Glad it worked out otherwise.

"Evolution is a messy process, I think the analogy is apt."
"So annoying.

Had a similar one recently 

U: what does this pop up mean?

Me: I go to the desk, 'what pop up?'

U: I closed it

Me: what did it say?

U: I don't know.  Are you doing anything that would cause it?

Me: (in my head). Lady, I'm doing about 7 different things at the same time.  How the fuck am I supposed to have any clue what you're talking about when the only info you gave me is 'a pop up appeared'?"
"But.... They gave you cake, and you wanted to get rid of them?!?!"
This is amazing. More. Please more.

"There's a [great study on perception/attention](http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html) that has people watch a video of multiple people in different color shirts passing basketballs in a room and they ask you to try to count how many passes of the ball from people with white shirts occur in the short video.  At the end of the video they ask the participants what their totals are, and ask ""Okay, and how many of you noticed the guy in the ape suit walking through the middle of the room?""  Even though there is in fact a guy in an ape suit that does wander through the room, almost none of the people ever notice it.

To me that's an excellent parable for how much people pay attention to IT.  We're the invisible gorillas weaving through their midst doing god knows what and they can't be troubled to notice us."

"""IT has a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.""

When you're burned, you have nothing: No PC support, no access to the ticket queue, no new upgrades... nothing.

You're stuck with whatever machine they give you...

&gt;IT: emachines.

...you take whatever software you can scrounge: an old license of WordPerfect for DOS... a spreadsheet that reports your keystrokes to the KGB... floppies from your mom, if you're desperate...

Bottom line: Until you buy the IT department pie, cookies, alcohol or cake... you're not doing anything.

He managed to do a fuckup of this magnitude almost on a weekly basis, yet every time he did so he got a promotion to a fancier title.
