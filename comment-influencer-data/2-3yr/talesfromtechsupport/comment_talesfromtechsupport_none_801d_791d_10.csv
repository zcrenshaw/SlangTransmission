"Not a Mac user, a University user"
"&gt;Also please see ticket # for terminating user A's network access.

&gt;We killed user A's network account with pleasure. 

User A deserved it. 1,000%.

Happy endings are nice."
"Well, her boss *did* hear about it."
Best Buy sold him the cable AND the extended protection plan.
"Just give her the God damn UNIVERSITY
IT never understands what people really need.... "
"&gt;She called back TWENTY-SEVEN times.

Okay, so let's take another read through this...  
&gt;queue would still max out every day

So, she probably called back like four dozen times, but only got through 27 times."
God forbid the equipment to deal with a flood be rated to withstand getting wet...
"I can't even comprehend how a lab tech, likely someone who has had plenty of experience with computers and technology at that point didn't think that a magnet wouldn't do anything to the data stored on the floppy."
"Why...
""Nothing works!""  
""Did you change anything?""  
""Yes, but that didn't break it!""  
""Did it stop working as soon as you made this change?""  
""Yes it did, but that's completely unrelated!""  
""I'm going to put money....that it is...""  "
"dear IT Intern, Welcome to the daily life on a SysAdmin, dont worry you did everything right. I'be been a Jr SysAdmin for about 2 years and this is a daily occurrence dont let this put you down, it comes with the job but you seem super optimistic and willing to help thats all you need :) "
How did logging out turn into restart in their mind? TFTS just fills me with questions...
Both sound extremely expensive and have competitors offering the product free elsewhere.
"Indeed :]. We always CC user's boss when we send the ""stop doing dumb things(in a nice professional way of course)"" email. Yet they still seem to think they're in the right and if they told on us to their boss we'd be the ones in ""trouble"". "
"Hmm. If H already has a password to use his computer, it may be worth setting up a secondary, restricted, user account for grandson.

I don't even use my wife's computer without switching users and logging into my own account, because I don't trust *myself* not to change something that she depends on staying the same."
"Did the old computers auto login and open up the university homepage? Other than that, she doesn't deserve to use anything higher than iOS 3.1 to do stuff on a computer..."
Plenty of people have jobs who are not qualified for them.
I too like happy endings. I try to post mostly happy ending stories on here cause we IT have to deal with some really bad endings a lot of the time. 
At that point I would have recommended the enter key instead of trying to find the button.
"In their mind, restarting the computer resets everything. See, there's even a ""Log Out"" option, but just to be careful, let's ""Restart""."
Or just other people in general. If we'd all just be nice to eachother...oh well that's a fantasy world that could never happen. 
"No doubt.  I worked there from 6 pm to midnight, three nights a week.  They would cut off the phones at midnight, so no more incoming calls.  But the calls in the queue at midnight would have to be answered and the queue emptied before we could leave.  That meant usually around 2 a.m."
"It has what students crave
"
I don't know why people think it's OK to treat coworkers like that. 
"If you've been here long enough, you'd realise that ""recycle bin = where you store documents you later want to reuse"" seems to be a disturbingly common misconception.  What they keep in their recycling bins in their back yards doesn't bear thinking about"
"Users have done this (and continue to) with me. 

Caller: ""Hey, the mapped drive says it's disconnected.""

Me: ""Log out and in again. It will remap when you sign in.""

Caller: ""Um, ok then.""

**Dead air for a short while and then I hear the windows startup sound in the background**

Me: ""You rebooted the computer?""

Caller: ""Yeah, you told me to.""

Me: ""No, no I didn't.""

**Proceed to explain the difference and the reason there is the option to Log Off**"
"Nononono.

An Etch-a-sketch."
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
"It could be worse.

They could have sold it successfully and the new owner of your stolen hardware might decide to give you a call to ask for tech support, because the number of your IT service desk is on the computer next to the asset tag label.

The the new user gets angry and threatens to sue you about the not-working pc they bought from the thief and about how your customer support is so poor that you don't want to help them."
"So, any bets that instead of learning something about professional behavior, User A blamed everything that followed on the help desk ""peons"" who dared to go over her head and CC her boss?"
How were you able to last a *year* there after this? I would have likely quit afterwards if not before...
"How did someone have the *emergency* IT on call number to hand, but not the *security* emergency number?"
Plot Twist:  The Test that's failing is the one that validates the markov chains running the chatbot you've been talking to
"Holy crap, your boss was insane. What kind of madman thinks it's a good idea to wade into filthy floodwater in an environment with exposed battery terminals to recover SERVERS that should have a backup solution in place already?! Let alone the whole ""yes, you have to drive through flood conditions when the police and fire department are advising all residents to stay indoors"" thing."
How does someone like that get into uni? Is the cleavage tactic this effective?
As someone sitting in a basement under hundreds of thousands of gallons of water. Ha
"Me: Man life would be so easy without users. Our application would work flawlessly. I could work on all these feature enhancements instead of fixing things users break...

Co-worker: You'd also be out of a job. 

Me: :("
I imagine somewhere there is a data center under a swimming pool just waiting for a crack.
"Simple enough.. We were just after buying our place and there was a brand new mortgage to worry about.. That was also part of the thinking in my head when the boss said how in or don't turn up for work. 
It tends to concentrate the mind a little. "
Reminds me of https://xkcd.com/1854/
Maybe she expected a custom login and desktop background with the universities' logo? Our lab PCs have those. I can't imagine any other explanation.
Leaving them on hold without telling them the staff have left...
"I TOLD YOU I'M NOT A WINDOWS PERSON AND YOU ARE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO ... wait, what am I supposed to do now? "
"You will learn in IT that anyone who has a problem believe they are the world's most important person, and if their problem isn't fix immediately, hell will break on Earth and kill humanity. Sometimes, you gotta learn how to put people in their place. "
"As it turned out, the backups were all tape based.. And all the tapes were in the room with the servers. Pure laziness on the hotels side. 
And yeah, I didn't move them (they were in a small fireproof but not waterproof safe) so the backups were lost. 
As for the emergency services warning.. The flash flooding cost two lives elsewhere in the city. There was a reason for the warnings. "
"&gt; You lazy tech people never seem to want to earn some money by making a sale!

Wait... i don't understand... He's mad at you, because you *don't* try to sell him something?? 

Edit: grammar"
Damn... You shouldn't have pried the plastic open. Now all the idiotium gas protecting the doctor has flown away.
"Your queue time is now: 7 hours, 59 minutes."
I want you to picture the most stereotypical blonde woman. Thats who this girl embodied in every aspect
I always log into guest accounts when using someone else's phone/computer; I think it's just basic decency.
He should've given you a free meal. Not just half off lol. 
How would a guest account keep other people from getting her info?
"Yeah I really enjoy this, and as I said most people are really nice. I am a really service oriented person, so I will keep my optimism up! Thanks!"
"""Yes, let me just call Bill from my speed dial."""
"Once a narc always a narc so...yeah for sure that is what happened. I'm so waiting for the /r/legaladvice post about how ""I was unjustly fired for telling IT how to do their job how do I sue?"""
"In the small city my family came from in Russia they'd run networking cables through the metro tubes and bomb shelter tunnels bc it's already established and connects most of the city, occasionally old janitor closets were retrofitted into monitoring stations and server housing. 

With this, I can almost guarantee a server is running directly underneath a canal, if not a fucking lake"
"&gt;""I was unjustly fired for telling IT how to do ~~their~~ there job how do I sue?""

C'mon, let's be realistic here."
"We tried that in the first version of the matrix, but you wouldn't accept it."
When you log in on the computers it says your name (Which she also freaked out about). Thats about as custom as I think it gets. And yes our computers also have the university logo as the background
plop your boobs on the counter trying to show some cleavage?

I thought you were going to say they got the system to drop the queuing calls with a closed message at midnight exactly.  Not sure which is worse.
Classic Brad. :(
"&gt; we IT have to deal with some really bad endings a lot of the time. 

I've some happy endings. I've had some sad. I've some in the middle and everywhere else. However, I still like the tech world. I despise most users, but I like the tech industry. Damn you users!"
"Someone showed her what ""pictures"" to click on in what order to get whatever it is she calls ""university"" on screen. Updating to Windows 10 means things look different so she is completely lost. I imagine she types on ""university"" so thats why she knows how to use a keyboard.

Same thing happened to my mum when she went from XP to 7. I had to re-teach her how to use her e-mail."
"*Roses are red, my screen is blue, i'm sitting here thinking what did I do??*"
"You know what's a smaller list?
""Why are you qualified?"""
"For people who didn't know, I must say I'm much happier at my new job. It's no longer something I have to power through - fixing electronics wasn't doing it for me anymore. It's really something I feel like doing, I've always been more interested by union work and politics. I know I've posted here much less as a result but I have tons of drafts I will post sooner or later. 

Once I got out of tech, though, I realized I was writing so much about my job precisely because at some point I needed to vent. That's solid evidence you need a break :) 

Under leave for union work, though, I could at any time go back without penalties too. That's a pretty unique perk I really enjoy."
Is Best Buy like the American Curry's/PC world? 'Cause oh BOY are they awful
"At least you left his Bing alone.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold :D"
