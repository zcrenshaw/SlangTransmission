"&gt; We're now trying to work out what we need to request from $bigshop for them to send us some skewers, a bag of marshmallows, and a selection of fresh fruits.

There's got to be some pattern there. Faulty till = mobile phone, mobile phone = chocolate fountain... It's like one of those logic tests they make you take when you apply for support positions."
I sincerely hope Drew is doing better; but that last line is icing on the cake.
"&gt; IT lends helping hand. Whole arm promptly taken.

I like this. I'm taking it. Can you move it to my office for me?"
"&gt; I quietly exit the lecture theatre after that.

"God, it's nice when stuff like this happens.

This was years ago, but I was having problems with a department within the company.  They were always calling, screaming about little things that weren't my job and verbally abusing my employees.  Just one department.  They complained to the CEO, who stopped by my desk to talk to me about ""Being a team player"" and ""refusing to help others.""

While he was standing there, I was able to put on two different, live phone calls, of people in that department calling and swearing and screaming at techs.  One of them being that we refused to let him run Netflix and the other that we wouldn't let him install a game.

He was shocked.  Then outraged.  Then steaming mad.

Later that day, there were 4 firings and a company wide email praising us for our work and reminding people that abusing internet privileges was grounds for dismissal."
"holy hell the flood of call up tech support calls. No matter how refined I got with

&gt; ""You will need to do everything I say to avoid losing your work now first you mus..""

&gt; ""It's saying do I want to delete this, should I delete this?""

&gt; ""Ok do not do anything right now and please explain to me what it is it's asking you to delete""

&gt; ""I don't know, I deleted it, hey where did my work go?! What did you do with it?!""

"&gt;(wife) Go reset the router.
&gt;(me) NO!

I get the image that she is trying to feed you vegetables against your will."
Have you tried... rebooting it? 
"No, you did the right thing. If you jump and run whenever someone neeps, ""My printer's out of paper,"" eventually it'll get to the point where they're calling you because their chair's the wrong height, and they want you to come pull the adjustment lever for them.

From what I've read, in healthcare it's even worse, because then the user will exclaim, ""This affects PATIENT CARE,"" so you have to jump up and run over there *right this second* to wiggle the mouse for them so the screensaver turns off. In an office that never sees patients and has nothing to do with actual medical practice."

"I hate this too. People walk up to me and ask me for help when the solution is literally ON THE FUCKING SCREEN.

When will people learn to read, srsly."
"Me too, actually...I've seen a few mental breakdowns in person and they're not fun, guy was probably super stressed out about something entirely different and this was just the thing that tipped him over the edge"

"this. ""if you'd like, i'll call the CEO and tell him none of you have done anything in 2 months, since you can't be bothered to put paper in the printer and you can't work without a printer"""
"*""...it hasn't been working since May, and someone needs to get down here immediately. We can't work if we can't print.""*

So you haven't worked since May?"
"No no, the words on the screen mean something different because they're on a computer.

""Click next to continue?  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN"""
TL;DR: Undefined behavior was undefined.  Added definition.  The server fainted.
"&gt; ""If you prefer, I could notify upper management that there's nobody in your department who is able to fill a printer with paper."" 

**Since May**"
"Yes, it will stand up to AN acid.  Whether it will stand up to YOURS is confidential information.

"&gt; Unfortunately, the retiring works manager believes he can win every argument with me, so he gets me to do it every time. Only 3 more weeks until he goes.

Ugh, managers. I know, I know - TFTS has stories about great managers, but still, there's something to be said about the hellish ones.

(*Especially* the kind of managers who think they know it all.)"
Obligatory /r/maliciouscompliance
"Now you know that they are actually weeding out agents incapable of handling obtuse users.

User: 'I can't logon'

Me: 'what does it say?'

User: 'password must be changed after logging on for the first time with a button that says 'ok''

User: 'no'

Me: &gt;_&gt;"

"Deadlines are never an excuse to delay maintenance windows. If the deadline was that important, the work would either be completed in advance, or there'd be a redundant system so work could continue uninterrupted.  
These are issues for management to address, not IT."
"One the plus side, you get to point to that tech now and say: ""It's him! HE is why we can't have nice things!!!"""
"- 6 hours of physical installation and the initial software (which didn't really need much code work as we could reuse existing skeleton code)
- 2 hours to add the gauges, actually needed a bit of coding and testing.
- 4 hours of graphics work, we were nice and didn't bill for integration of the graphics to the software, on which the coder spent unspecified time and we agreed we'd reuse the code probably later on.
- 3 hours to build the web GUI.
- 2 hours to build the logging and reporting.

The hourly rates varied from about $60 to $120 depending on who was doing the work.

We tried to be reasonable with the time spent, we could have spent a lot longer finetuning and tweaking everything

So yeah, you could probably buy a boxful of Raspberries for the price, but I think the moral of the story revolved around specifications and the realization that Raspberry Pi alone out of the box doesn't mysteriously work as an environmental monitoring system. Oh, and as much as we'd like to build stuff for free all day long, money has to come in so someone pays our salaries.

Edit: The bill shouldn't have come as a surprise, as we always give an estimate for everything we do. The customer just yeah-yeah'ed it and was more interested in when it's done."
"*The requests for tech support are coming from inside the house!*

Literally screaming at people. At work. With people they work with. I'm just flabbergasted. 
"It was an IIS server, with a back end SQL database, like they didn't cluster it, and it wasn't redundant. You can't fix stupid.

EDIT: But you can charge for it."

"I have heard of iPads being bricked, but never a tower..."
"But now when I log in, it wants my *password* and not my *new password*! What is the password? Where goes the new password? HALP!"
I so hope you record calls and send them to the person's supervisor when they complain.
"I'm friendly enough with people in the office that if I'm not busy, I'll just play with them when they're being unnecessarily vague.

Them: It's not working.  
Me: It's not working?  
Them: No, it's not working.  
Me: That's terrible, why isn't it working?   
Them: I don't know, that's why I'm asking you.  
Me: You're asking me?"
I'm wondering about the newlyweds that just received a broken cash register...
"It bugs the crap out of me when a user can't articulate anything other than, ""It's not working."" One of the best tools in my arsenal is this simple question: ""What are you trying to do?""  
I've found it's useful for getting to the core of most issues. Especially for users who *think* they know what they're doing, but don't.  
  
For example:  
User: ""X isn't working.""  
Me: ""What are you trying to do?""  
User: \*insert life story here\* ""...so I'm trying to do Y but X isn't working.""  
Me: ""Ah, I see. X has nothing to do with Y. You'll want to do Z."""
Live.  Right then.  I could listen in on phone calls by other techs from my desk.  I could hear the shouting start so I switched the audio to my desk and put it on speakers.

"&gt; I asked them a few questions to verify what they're seeing: ACH# this, date, etc., the amount isn't $$$$$$? Oh no, it's different. And this one? This one? And this? no no no, all different.

I would have asked, ""So, what numbers do you see for that account?"" instead of just allowing the answer of ""it's different""."

Drew storms out and heads to the nearest bar for a drink. He orders a scotch and hands the barman his credit card. The barman asks him to enter his pin number to pay for it and is taken totally unawares when Drew leaps over the counter and attacks him!

"I work in healthcare and can confirm. I started on the floor and moved into tech. When I was on the floor the number of times that an agent was angry because their ""customer could die without this coverage!"" is astounding. 

The hospital is not going to just let a car crash or heart attack victim die because their insurance is a month out of date. We will have it fixed within 24 hours, chill. "
The server was overloaded with too much to do.
"The higher ups have a jet, and IT needs to cover servers with tarps to protect from rain? I'd say let the servers get soggy and let the higher ups then determine the priorities of the organization."

"I wonder if dialog popups makes them kinda subconsciously panic. Like, there's a popup, and they just kinda go ""Oh no, not again"" and because they ""know"" that they can't *possibly* understand computer jargon, they just give up completely. The words just kinda pass through their brain. 

""Are you sure you want to permanently delete this folder? Yes No""

Brain: ""I don't know what that says, I don't wanna know please leave me alone computer I just want to get my work done pls I don't know what to do theres this guy mumbling into my ear over the phone and I don't know why I have to listen to him computers are so hard ok computer I guess I'll do what the computer suggests **YES**""

Wait why would accounting ever need administrator privileges?
"That type of thing works surprisingly well. From my own experience, we've had several people open extremely high-severity tickets by claiming that, for example, the company would lose hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars for every hour they were down. Note that these were all for single-user workstations. 

Every time I would talk to them, I would start by asking about their disaster recovery plan and why they haven't implemented it yet. When I (inevitably) got complete ignorance in reply, I'd explain that any process which had that kind of impact on the company was required, by policy, to have a disaster recovery plan in place. If they didn't have one, no problem, I could let my management talk to *their* management, and get a plan in place (after I fixed their issue, of course... I'm not a sadist). 

Nearly every time I did that, I got them to allow me to drop the severity down to a reasonable level, along with dropping any need to talk to their management. 

There was that one time, though, where the guy was like ""That's a good idea, we definitely need that. So, can you help me now, or what?"" That's when I knew that one was the real deal. That was an interesting afternoon. "

"Google tells me:

"Old managers are about as bad as old teachers. Like the one guy I had who reminded us every day that he used to work for IBM. 

I always wondered what he did for them, why he wasn't just retired, and why (given his disposition) he decided to teach CIS101.
