"As if that wasn't bad enough, he then complained to $servicedeskmanager that I ""resolved my problem but in an unsatisfactory way"". What on earth? I'm starting to miss Google Bing Lady already..."
:D this is *the* story that is told in a thousand versions.
"I haven't heard of an intern blowing things that badly in about 20 years!  

That said, where are your checks and balances? Something should have caught the missing orders and sudden spike from Customer sooner..."
"RIP
Google Bing Lady

*December 11, 2016 - March 5, 2017*

*No one computered quite like her.*"
"Dude, implement 2FA.   What the fuck."
"""you IT guys always have some excuse to not do work and browse YouTube and the internet all day... Can't you just make the part and fix it now"""
"Call her and ask her about the Bing

Has it been acting up lately?

Try to sound as suspicious as possible while asking this ;)

I'm honored!"
"If 60 people didn't know how to get it to play, that may be on you guys for not making a good enough menu system. "
"Fun side fact, by the way: Sandy's wallet was found in the trash of the restaurant the day after the BlackBerry was returned to us, everything but cash still in it! We're still scratching our heads about how it got there, because the trash was emptied in between that day and the theft. Why return to the place of the crime and ditch the purse there, of all places?!

There's some connection between the cafe and those girls I think, maybe a sister or daughter of someone working there? The police mentioned that this was not the first theft in that cafe...


Edit: Substituted ""purse"" for ""wallet"" to avoid confusion. Switching randomly between American English vs. British English... sorry, not a native speaker."
You forgot the bit about why you often have a headache because the people Mummy has to deal with often drive her to bang her head on the desk.
"Ah kids, what 'master thieves', they are..."
"GBL still calls occasionally insisting we are still ""messing up her bing"" (despite the fact she no longer works here) - satisfyingly we are now allowed to hang up on her."
"""SIR, I'm not a GIF kind of person, what do you mean?!"""
"&gt; I haven't heard of an intern blowing things that badly in about 20 years!


Is this a goddamn Monica Lewinsky reference "

Or set the gif to not repeat.
"Yeah, she rebuilt that rule immediately after you disconnected. Guarantee she'll be calling back."
"Oh. Well, my friend told me this, said it was him. Have I been bamboozled?"
Why didn't you just strip the sound from the video and upload it again?
"As someone who has to design menus, if not one person out of 60 couldn understand how to navigate your menu, then, it's not their fault, it's yours. 

If the main menu doesn't do anything (and you can only press play from there, no settings to mess with), it should just auto pay, no need for the menu since it serves no purpose."
"Yes, my eldest daughter shadowed me for a few hours. She thought the 'turn it off and on' thing was a joke until that day. "

"Yeah, lemme just pull an LCD out of my ass and I'll get right on it!"
"If you haven't been, then cleaners in general have a world-wide lack of readily available power sockets.

I've been employed in IT since i was 14 years old, so i don't know if cleaning staff *actually* has that problem. ;)"
"Good idea, lemme throw the concept of logs at this person, they seem bright enough for that. "
"User performance abysmal.

Reminds me of the time my grandfather managed to ramp up the key input delay to maximum. I didn't even know this was a thing. Much less that there is a keyboard shortcut for this oO 

It was swiftly disabled."
"If by bang head on desk you mean drink, then yes, they drive me to that all right. :) "
This is deliciously evil.
"Yes, that is weird. I'm sure they thought they were offering you great opportunity that you'd be foolish not to take.

"No, because I'm currently dealing with three Microsoft license audits at once at separate clients.

And we all know my answer to this problem would involve a rag that smells like chloroform, 2.5mg midazolam IV (3mg IM) q1h, a roll of carpet, a 20-pound sack of quicklime, a shovel, and a quick car trip sans cellular phone out to west Travis County.

Alternatively, we'll accept a rag that smells like chloroform, 2.5mg midazolam IV (3mg IM) q1h, a set of 55-gallon drums, a friend's borrowed pickup, and a drive down to a concrete factory.

There are other alternatives, but those are the first two that come to mind."
"&gt; I was sweating like a fat man on a diet in a chocolate store.

As a fat man who has been both on a diet and in a chocolate store simultaneously, I can say I didn't sweat as much as you make out. Any chocolatier's shoppe is air-conditioned, so the pastries and confectioneries do not melt.

"$intern was let go at the end of her contract, no repercussions. She's welcome to work for the company again anytime. Sometimes I dont understand managment. Who am I kidding. Most of the time."
"Exactly, I can't believe that yours was the first post recommending Two Factor, this is exactly the problem that TFA is designed to solve.

Going Citrix everywhere won't help you if you don't put 2FA in as well, if you've got remote access of any kind with just a username and password protecting it then you're still vulnerable to phishing attacks like this. Ok, if you set your Citrix up properly the attacker can do slightly less damage, slightly less easily, once he's got into your network - but the attacker HAS made it onto your network!

Edit: autoincorrects"
Yes we should have definitely. But her messing up and getting the reports of her messing ended up in something resembling perpetual motion.

"Whenever I contact tech support I've already swallowed any pride I have as an engineer. I usually try to list what I've tried, and if they ask me to try something I've already done I *do it again anyways* because maybe I didn't do it right. 

Engineering doesn't make you good at troubleshooting something you've never worked with before. "
"Wow, it wasn't even a stupid user error..."
Is the info sec consultant coincidentally /u/tuxedo_jack ?
"I think your first mistake was ""hiring"" an intern. Interns are not temporary employees; they are students whom you supposedly agreed to have work with you in order to learn. If the intern could not/would not learn, you should have dismissed that intern, not ignored her. I would have ensured that you never got another intern from our program again.

ETA: You wrote that your company got an intern because ""training a new employee would've taken far too much time."" This was entirely your lazy-ass company's fault."

Since we're being irrational can we also throw pi?

It would be a joke if users could realize they should restart their computers before calling us or just restart once in a while.  But I've run into users whose computers have been running for 90+ days and they claim stuff hasn't been working right for 30 (and are just now calling)
"I think the most impressive thing about your posts is how you can make me care deeply, for a brief period of time, about the technical details of sewing machines, which I've literally never used."
I don't understand why you're getting downvoted. It's literally one of the standard features of the GIF format.
"Also, ""Doesn't work how?"" Should have been asked around call 2. Still funny that no one pushed play."
Maybe trying to cover their tracks - the purse turning up in the trash makes it look like it was just dropped or misplaced rather than being stolen

"I'm utterly convinced computers work better with blood spilled. There have been so many anecdotal cases where I just could not get a computer to work until I accidentally cut myself on the case and drew blood, then suddenly everything is working perfectly."
"Or if that doesn't work, just try throwing logs. Anyone got a spare clue-by-four for op?"
"Well duh, haven't you heard that Facebook is sending balloons to pour WiFi all over Africa?"
Are you implying that my CPU being hot enough to boil water is a problem?
"Sounds likely. Still, if I was a thief and feel like I was almost caught, I wouldn't return to the site of the crime for a good long while and dispose of the purse in another way. There must be a hundred easier ways that wouldn't leave a track at all."
"When a drive properly powers down, the read/write heads swing into a parked position off the platters, so as long as the exterior circuit board doesn't get damaged, they're pretty hard to harm.

If they're running though, a large enough jolt can cause the heads to jump up and impact the platters. This will kill a drive quick."

"If that is true then I would guess they don't know much about the industry they find themselves in now and their wife's shop won't last the year.

I've dealt with people like this before and they come in two varieties, either they know nothing about the industry they are hiring for, or they are hoping you don't know much about the industry you are in. Nothing like getting yelled at by a recruiter because you laughed at their ridiculously low offer. (Nearly minimum wage with no benefits for a job that required multiple Cisco and MS certs and usually started out with low six figures) "
"For the sake of my own amusement: yes I should have done so. To make up for my oversight, I decided to file a random incident form which really isn't necessary. 

I chatted the IT guy, asked him a few follow up questions (for hr documentation purposes) and this is what he said: ""the light shines out from under the mouse. and when she picks it up and looks at the bottom it hurts her eyes."" 

So by ""the lasers leak"" she means: when she picks up the mouse and looks at the bottom of it, the light shines into her eyes."
Yep. It had copied the folder and one file then filled up.

"I find it funny how people who have only worked in one environment don't realize what it's like outside of that environment. Whether you're big city, or small town, you often just don't realize how different the other can be.

My knowledge and certs don't get much application in the economically depressed small town area I'm stuck in, but it's funny when I get calls from sales reps, or someone tells me how I should do something, and I'm like, ""Yesterday, my 1 service call took the whole day. The task took 20 minutes, but the chartered plane ride to the island [where motor vehicles aren't allowed], and the horse carriage ride, took forever, oh and did I mention the building I worked in was built in 1881?""

Server room? lol. I wish. I'm lucky if a horse doesn't kick the server over.
