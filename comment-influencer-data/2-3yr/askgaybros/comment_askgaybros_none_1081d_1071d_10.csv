Everyone in this story is in the wrong 
"1) Your wedding night wasn't a great time to try and address this

2) He needs to address his trauma. 

3) Y'all need help. "
"You dont need to mention what you saw on your son's cell phone. Question the lying bitch Michael. Ask him why he seems so distracted lately, why does he look at his phone so often (maybe say it in a smooth way that welcomes more chatter), then drop the facade and say you know he's been texting your son, and that you know your son is gay. Hard look him in the eyes. Watch. Don't blink. Be calm, but cold at this point...he has been lying to you in this conversation, and yeah I do believe he is going to lie to you. He is having an affair with a boy 31 years younger than him, one who is not out of high school.

I dont like how this smells. I dont like lies. I dont like charlatans. I dont like manipulators. He is all of these things."
"Have you considered drugs? Your cool neighbour might be someone your son knows sells or uses and he could be buying or selling or using with him. It might not always be a sex thing, sure it could be, but maybe just talk to your son in a non judgemental manner and see what he says. Be sure to frame it in a nonaccusatory way; if he thinks he's in trouble he will be defensive and shut you out."

"""Yeah you like that, you fucking retard?"" "
"Update: After reading a number of suggestions I told Dan that he was welcome to talk to me at any time if he needed. Lo and behold a couple later when everyone else was in bed he came into my room and sat on the bed with me. He was silent for a bit then just said ""I'm gay."" I must admit impact of that statement is incredible. He did go on to say that he wasn't ready to tell anyone else. I told him that I loved him no matter what and assured him that I'll keep my promise. We went on to talk for quite a bit including his struggles, especially those of going to an all boys catholic school where there's rampant homophobia (I also attended an all boys catholic school and knew exactly what he meant). Overall it was an amazing conversation, needless to say we've become a lot closer."
This is the drama I live off of
"I don't think anything unless they start dropping words like ""papi"" and ""spicy"" which cause my eyes to roll so far into the back of my head I convulse and black out. "

He liked the attention.
"Whats the difference between a bottom and a microwave?

They can both make meat hot, but only a bottom can brown it."
"Tell him this story one day pleaeeee

It'll be something to laugh at 

"
"It never ceases to amaze me how some people have such unadulterated hatred. I mean Jesus, it sounds like she didn't even bat an eye spewing out all that bitterness. "
yep this post is literally american beauty right now.

"&gt;I want to tell him that no matter what his sexuality is his family and friends will love him

How about you just tell him that *you* love him no matter what his sexuality is. That is the best you can do right now. You can't make promises for how others will react. But you can do a lot by just telling him that you love him and will be there for him any time he wants to talk."
"Thou shall not out another homo unless that homo is harming other homos. 

Thou shall not bottom shame 

Thou shall not twink or femme shame 

Thou shall not pursue thy hetero homie "
"Question: is it worth it? You're a bouncer at a gay club. You're probably hot. You can probably get whomever you want. Is it worth the risk of embarrassment?

On the other hand, fucking go for it because that will totally make a great story for him. 

On the other other hand, he's young. Is there a chance that he could become infatuated? Speaking as a 34 year old who fucked 20 year old for a year, it gets really really messy when they're that young. They're always looking for something more. They're looking to an older guy to provide stability and give them a shortcut to manhood (not everyone, so skip the whole downvoting me and telling me I'm wrong, I'm speaking from my experiences). 

Also, when I was 20, I was getting fucked by a 40 yo Doctor, and yeah, all those things I just said, I did. I got messy. I got attached. It didn't end well. 

So, is there a chance he could make things difficult? You're describing this as a hookup. Is he? Or does he want to date you? He's probably not on the same page as you. Can you remember being a freshman? I can. I was obsessed with finding a Boyfriend. 

Not everyone is like that though. So I ask, is the risk worth the hookup?"
Good luck man. I hope the PEP and future testing comes out in your favor. 
"Uhh, probably the first time I bottomed.

 I grunted and sounded like I was in pain and he said something like, ""I hope it's hurting so good you dirty little slut."" I was actually really into it but I felt too shy/weird to admit it to him lol"

"My boyfriend and I went to a restaurant with another gay couple a few weeks ago, they're our closest friends and we go on double dates a lot. One of them is quite flamboyant. He got up to answer a phone call (it was super loud in there, so he went outside). The waitress came back with our drinks and said ""I think it's so nice of you guys to include him like that.""

Everybody was just stunned. She clearly thought she was being progressive and nice, offering a bunch of straight guys (or maybe a bunch of ""good gays"", I'm not sure) a compliment for being inclusive. It was like she was congratulating us for bringing along a special needs friend, or something. I don't know, it just *felt* offensive, like it was super condescending.

There were a lot of ""ums"" and ""uhs"" and glancing at each other, but no one really knew what to say, so nothing was said. We all really regret not saying anything to her, but we didn't even know how to respond. She obviously had good intentions and didn't mean to offend anyone, but we obviously couldn't say ""thanks"" for something like that and no one wanted to make a scene. 

I guess somewhere along the way a line was drawn, and it's a clear line both in and out of the community. It's massively fucked up, but what can we do? I wouldn't have a problem calling out another gay guy for shitty behavior, but a waitress in a restaurant, who clearly didn't have any idea what she was actually doing? I wouldn't know how to handle that."

"Woah, why is this post being reported? It's a legitimate question guys. 

I've had a terrible experience with a white guy recently on Hornet who wanted me to ""fuck him hard like we're in the jungle"" he kept going on about wanting the BBC. It was really unpleasant and caused some hesitation for me when talking to other white guys for a bit. I think it just shocked me as it came out of nowhere. 

I mean It's obvious to say that it will be a small minority who acts like that but hey that's what the block button is for! "
There are 31 gender identities?

"This was a guy from West Virginia, and if you're not from the US, you have to know that there's a whole genre of really horrible jokes about incest in the isolated back woods and mountains of West Virginia. 

As we collapsed in the afterglow, I said, ""So, was I as good as your brother?""

He rolled on his side towards me, ran his hand across my chest, grinned, and said, ""Almost."" "
"When he came hands-free, just from getting the dick. "
Well it's gotta be kinda thick if you mistook accent for ass XD
"High level ghosting where an actual relationship (platonic or other) has been established and there's been back and forth for an extended period of time is totally shitty and I'm in agreement with you there.

However, ghosting just comes with the territory when dealing with the insane amount of forever alone, socially awkward, severely depressed, highly anxious, insecure, emotionally unstable and oblivious men that exist in our dating pool."
"Just FYI like 95% of gay guys go through the same thing with the ""I can't imagine kissing or a relationship, just sex"".

So be open to experiences with dudes. In a few years down the line, this mindset will probably change."
"""And then my boyfriend tells her to get the fuck out of here""

The only thing you guys did wrong was not kicking her ass out of the apartment earlier. I'm sorry for you guys and for the girl, two horrible experiences in one night.
Good for you guys you stood up for her and for yourselves."

"Surprised no one shared this one yet:

Two deer walk out of a gay bar. One turns to the other and says, ""I can't believe I just blew thirty bucks."""
"(While moaning) ""You look so fucking sexy with my dick in your mouth."""
"Personally, I'm not really comfortable having sex with someone whose judgment is impaired."
You are not at fault for your brother kicking the shit out of that guy and breaking his stuff. That is not your fault. That was entirely your brother's fault and you should not feel guilty for it.
"""You're so big.""

""Slower! Slower.""

""I'm down to make this a regular thing.""

""You like that ass?""

Biting my arm when I go super deep is always good too. My favorite is when I hit their prostate and they have a delayed moan, they're just so shocked that I hit it and it feels so good. They look at at me so surprised and happy hahaha."
Race and money. 
"Don't be one of the straight guys working at a gay bar who are constantly clarifying that they're straight. So many do this, and it's really obnoxious and off putting. Good luck with the job!"
Thinking about the (lack of) meaning in life and/or masturbate. 
"Your husband needs counseling. Not to help he bottom, just to help him deal with his childhood trauma. After he is doing better you two can talk about this issue."
"Man the fuck up and tell him exactly what you're mad about. What other option do you expect? If he continues lying, dump him. Problem solved."
I can't understand them with the gag in their mouth. They could be saying anything. 
Then its time you topped him back. He wants penetration...well...give it to him.
"A few years after we moved in together he was telling me a story and I gleaned from it that he had an interest in bondage. So he went to work and I bought all the basic stuff. Leather cuffs,gags,rope,etc and just left it on the bed like a present. The reaction I got when he got home and saw it was priceless. I have never seen anyone go from tired and just wanting to go to bed to slack jawed lust so quickly "
"In the past, people used to write poems, sonnets, and music to profess their love. Now they use Internet gifs. 😐"
Anti-gay sentiment isn't as strong as it once was; sexism and violent defense of antiquated gender roles are as strong as ever.
Wash your ass every day regardless of whether you are a top or bottom. A surprising amount of guys do not do this!!

I don't see why you feel lost you aren't the one who did anything wrong. Also you aren't dumb for believing a verse guy would bottom for you plenty would this guy was just a fuckin creep no matter if he was top/bottom/verse w.e 
"Dude. Sorry you went through this. Ugh. Don't feel weak or gross about it. 

You need to go to your Human Resources Department and report this ASAP. (You have at least one witness who I'd hope would vouch for your side of the story) 

If you don't have an HR Dept., you should probably talk to a lawyer. That's just a fucked up situation, and you shouldn't have to go through that. "
"This raises lots of red flags in my mind. I think it's great you're understanding of your son's sexuality. That's number 1. And I think assuring him of that would help this situation a bit.  The neighbor texting is odd. I probably would be texting my neighbor of cell phones were bigger when I was his age. But only because my neighbors and my mom were very close. And even then,  my mom would most likely know I was texting my neighbor probably about babysitting or cleaning something or just something like that. 

I personally do t think it's even cool for your neighbor to be texting your son without you knowing. Let's pretend the 7 o'clock meet up was for something completely innocent. I still think I should know what my 48 year old neighbor needs with my son at 7pm. 

I don't know the best way to approach this. I feel like the best way to start is by talking to your son about his sexuality and work your way from there. This has to be nipped in the bud now. Age of consent or not,  the other dude is still married and possibly taking advantage of someone much younger. "
White gays are teeming on this subreddit and a lot of them feel like their safe space is being threatened with a grown up discussion of race.
"Sorry. He's probably gay and in denial. He was bottoming in a gay relationship. It's just convenient for him to blame you for his dick not getting hard for girls, rather than admit to himself that he's gay. It's not your fault."

"Can everyone on the subreddit stop misusing the word ""straight""? Your dating him, the guy isn't straight. Liking rugby doesn't make you  want to fuck women. 

Anyway, try new things. If you want to learn about sports give it a try, you might like it. I did not know anything about sports until my BF told me about his football playing adventures. Stadiums aren't as scary as your making them out to be. They are also why more diverse than you're thinking. Not everyone is a straight dude bro. If you don't like rugby, go with him occasionally, as long as he is doing something for you."

"penises

"Thank you! A lot of guys seem to struggle with the concept that I don't like to have anal sex on the first, second, or even third date. In the community I live in, that's seen as a largely religious objection, (""wait until marriage""), and I'm not religious. I don't judge guys who like to fuck the first time meeting someone, by all means have fun! Just be safe and make sure everyone is consensual haha. But we also have a right to say that we DON'T want sex, and I hate that the concept is so hard for some people to grasp"
"Q: How do you know you had gay burglars?

A: They re-arranged your furniture and left a bitchy note about your window treatments.

A: Wipe your dick on the curtains after."
"A lot of people find women who act like ""valley girls"" to be very annoying. Likewise, gay guys who act like that will be considered obnoxious. Most people who have an issue with ""flamers"" find fault in their flamboyance... not their sexuality. It's the loudness, pettiness, and need for drama that grates on people's nerves. "

As for being too young, that's a fallacy so blatant I can't believe she actually said that. If a boy is 5 and says he has a crush on a girl, everybody's proud and happy for the stallion because one can never be too young to be straight."

But.... It's ultimately up to you to decide if it's worth the time and effort that would be needed to get over the social/economic differences that exist between you and him though I'd say you should probably do him a favor and move on to someone you think you can relate to on a intellectual and financial level..."

Because they don't just want sex, they want intimacy. They are horny and that causes them to initiate it, but afterwards they realize that they want more than a sexual act - they want the emotional connection. "
These aren't the ppl you want for advice on a healthy sex life.
"I'm pretty sure you're the only one who feels this way, most people *love* it /s

You have to learn not to take it personally when it happens. The person who is ghosting you is, ironically, probably scared of having to hurt your feelings by straight up rejecting you. In a digital culture, we're less accountable for our actions, so it feels easier for them to just drop contact, even if it doesn't actually achieve the goal of making it hurt less for you. It sucks but it's probably not a phenomenon that's going away any time soon."

"This is going to be tough, but it's turning out to be very common. You still need to come out. Getting a fake girlfriend isn't going to do anything but make you miserable, and the hurt the girl by using her. Your parents can still have grandchildren. Especially with your generation going in the direction it's going. You owe it to your brother to come out too. Do it. It won't get better until you do. "
The guy could keep up a conversation and we were both interested. Always a win. 
"I've been there. It's extremely overrated, for what you get. I prefer NYC, Chicago, and the Twin Cities. In contrast LA is very unpleasant, bad traffic, poor public transportation, hot weather, intermittent smog, rude gays in WeHo, it's the capital of superficial consumerist celebrity culture and where Kim Kardashian lives. "
"The fact that you're thinking about it already puts you ahead of other people.

As cliche as it is, just be yourself. If you're genuine, you'll eventually come off as genuine. If you're not, people will see right through you."
"I can't really tell you what to do, but I think you might need to take a step back from the situation and see that him being gay probably isn't the only answer for everything that's happened in his life. I know it's tempting to want to rationalise people's behaviour, especially when it's shitty and you love that person, but people are complex and for every secret you find out about there's likely ten more you'll never know.  
  
I really question whether in his situation from what you've said about him, coming out would be something that would bring him any kind of happiness. Fear of other people's reactions is only part of the reason a lot of guys remain closeted. There's also internalised homophobia.  
  
I don't know if talking to him about it would bring about anything positive, or bring the two of you closer together. This is the life he chose for himself, after all. He's had a long time and plenty of opportunities to change things and he hasn't."

Exactly four years minus ten days later we got married, about three months after moving in together.

Admittedly we only got married because it was either that or get a cohabitation contract to have the mortgage and such legally taken care of, but my very Christian grandmother has a fund for each of her grandchildren to pay for their weddings, on condition that they get married right away without ""living in sin"". 

Joke's on her thought, since the first grandchild to get hitched was me, with a fabulous big gay wedding paid for by her. She even attended, since my dad told her a few years earlier that she could accept my sexuality or GTFO our family life.

"I realized/found out my current BF has a secret dominant side through our texts/flirting to each other last night.

It was a bit surprising to me because he didn't seem like the dominate type - loving/friendly/extrovert personality, slightly shorter/smaller height and weight compared to me, smaller 'down there', etc.

It's actually a bit of a turn-on for me since I'm already pretty submissive  by nature in and out of the bedroom. I just didn't expect him to be the dominate type."
"I'm not a lawyer, but right off the top of my head, I'd make sure that you document all of your injuries and make absolutely certain that **no one** says anything to your ex (or to the police, for that matter) that could incriminate any of you. Make sure to save the texts where he demanded the money from you under threat of calling the police, since (and once again, I'm not a lawyer) it sounds like extortion.

Besides that, block **every** form of communication with your ex and leave it at that. I'd bet dollars to donuts he's more interested in regaining the control over you that he lost when you dropped his ass than anything else, but at least if things do escalate (and once again, you may want to get the advice of an actual lawyer and not some random asshole on the internet), at least you have evidence that will work in your favor."

For whatever reasons she wasn't around when her daughter was in need, but your bf and you mucked in and actually did a good thing.

She's mad because now she looks less competent or capable as compared to yourselves and she would grasp at anything to belittle you, in this case, unbelievably childish name-calling. 

Again none of that is an excuse because it betrays that she's a hateful bitch in the first place.

Your son is closeted. You've never have been closeted, so I'll tell you that it is a state of constant fear of discovery and total rejection. Hiding being gay is tantamount, because discovery is the end of everything. In that setting, your son has probably found an outlet for his desires for closeness and sex with your older friend. I'm not saying what they are doing is ok. It certainly is not acceptable behaviour. I just urge you not to go in all totalitarian. I imagine your relationship with your son is more important than being in the right to put your foot down.

Sit down with him and talk open and honestly with him. Tell him that you might have accidentally have discovered that he is gay. Make sure he knows that you are ok with that and that you won't tell anyone if he doesn't want you to. Tell him you didn't mean to pry, but you know he is texting with your friend. Ask him if they are seeing each other. If they do, don't judge, but state your concerns. Your son needs to know that he is probably facilitating an extramarital affair (your friends may have an open relationship) and that it may not be without unpleasant consequences if the wife finds out. There is also the question what future this arrangement can possibly have.

You could go the route of confronting your friend, but that has the chance of unpleasantly blowing up. It's better if your son realises that he is better off not seeing a married man. Let your son break things off. Your friend is probably not in a position to protest, as he problably has an unsuspecting wife.

Also don't freak out over your son's sex drive. When he is ready, he is ready. Sex drive doesn't automagically wait and turn on at the strike of twelve on his 18th birthday. Just make sure he is acting responsibly out there and he is using protection. Make sure he knows he can always count on you if he needs you."

"There was this one guy in college.  We were in the same program, worked on a lot of projects together and I had THE BIGGEST crush on him.  I was always kind of flirting with him but he never let on.  I was sure he was straight but I think he was also oblivious.

Years later I find him on FB and he's in a relationship with an older man.  Maybe I just wasn't his type? :'("
"Great list. 

Now back to overthinking...."
Oh relax drama queer.
