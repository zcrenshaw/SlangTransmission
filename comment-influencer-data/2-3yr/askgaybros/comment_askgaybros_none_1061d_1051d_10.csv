"I do, and I feel it even more when I see all my straight friends being in a relationship when I still have some random ""middle schooler crush"" on guys I've never talked to :•(

It's really weird, I think my teenage self grew up faster than my friends did, because of my struggle with my family's homophobia, yet at the same time, I'm still a 13 y.o. when it comes to love "
"You think about fucking guys and you jerk off to gay porn. And you had fun jerking and sucking a guy. Me too! It's like we're twins or something!

Let's unpack this:

When you're really horny your desire to fuck a guy comes to the surface. When you're not at all horny, it's way easier to suppress it.

Given that you're 18, I don't want to bust your chops to much, and I'm going to say that you don't have to rush to label yourself, except that you did, and we probably need to discount that one.

You're not straight. Straight guys don't have fucking men at the top of their list when they're horned. You could be bi. Gay seems more likely. But it's 2016. It's ok.

Once you get the mantra of ""I am straight. I am not gay"" out of your head, you're going to advance from ""all I want to do is fuck a man"" to ""hey, that's guy's attractive"" to ""I'm forming an emotional attachment with a guy.""

Don't feel ashamed about jacking off to porn."
"Any time I hear something in casual conversation like ""what are you gonna do, just bend over and take it?"" or ""you really got boned in that situation"" it reminds me how we're constantly told that taking a dick is being in a position of weakness, whether you're male or female.  Fucking pisses me off."
Someone just had good sex. 
From erotica to disappointing.
From erotica to reality.
Wow that started getting off the ground then just fell down and caught fire
Makes you realize how homophobia is just an extension of misogyny.

When I sleep on my hand and it feels numb when I wake up 
He knew what he was getting into. You even tried to compromise (strapon). He is looking for excuses to fuck strangers. Only positive is that he's talking to you rather than cheating. 
I once ate an entire gallon of vanilla ice cream then got on a public bus and threw up all over the guy sitting next to me. He wasn't too happy about it but then we made up. 
"After about a month of dating me and my BF had the following conversation:

BF: You know I really like you fbtome. (He said this out of the blue while we were cuddling.)

Me: I really like you too. (I was a little taken aback by the suddenness)

BF: But... I mean... (He made a disgruntled sigh and started stuttering.)

Me: Do you love me?

BF: Sort of. Yeah I do.

At this point I broke out with laughter because of his ""sort of"" response. He later told me that he was too nervous to say it at first, which would explain all the sighs he was making lol.  "
"What surprised me was when we were kissing and he grabbed my crotch and I felt embarrassed that I got hard. 
I explained to him ""I'm sorry, but I'm just so excited right now and this is just so magical""
And he said to me ""I'm excited too"" and he smiled, kissed me, and took my hand and placed it on his crotch, which was also hard as a rock. 

I think the reason it was so surprising was because I felt so alone in my sexuality for so long. I was finally able to explore that with someone and that they felt the same excitement I did...i was speechless out of pure happiness and shock. "
Much respect for starting therapy. 
"I didn't became more flamboyant, I stopped ruthlessly suppressing a small flamboyant side of my personality that was always there."
"Fifth date, while cuddling, started stammering and then crying, then told him I loved him. 

It was 2010, we are married today. "
"Apparently, monogamy."
"Because society conditions you to find them unnatural?

Honestly, I feel the same way."
On the flip side I always feel like I'm disappointing my partner if I don't climax.
You're gay. Hope that helps!
"I've never really understood guys who feel that bottoming makes them somehow ""less of a man."" Getting fucked in the ass isn't for the faint of heart. It requires physical and mental strength, and is incredibly pleasurable. I get that it's not for everyone, but offering your ass to a top is an act of generosity every gay man should appreciate and respect. "
"""Are you feeling it now my krabs?"""
"I'm a gay guy and they used to scare me too, but then I realised I don't have to reflect that energy too. I just say hey and chill, and listen to their stories, they tend to have many stories"
"Hang out and keep your head out of your ass. He could just be acting nice because you're friends. 

Don't get worked up on possibilities. Just enjoy the event and if anything happens, it happens"
"This was about 2 months into my current relationship. I have a problem with night terrors that's mostly under control, but I will occasionally wake up frightened or I'll burst up in bed and say something really weird and outlandish. It's usually triggered by a stressful day. 

Anyways, one night we were sleeping in his room as 3 of his friends from out of town were staying in the living room for Pride. It was one of the hottest days of the year and I didn't know these people well and I was generally stressed and having weird nightmares. 

CUT TO:

Me: (*bursting up from sleep, turning to my boyfriend and loudly saying*) DON'T YOU TRUST ME?

BF: (*groggily*) what? 

Me: (*suddenly awake and very embarrassed*) oh god, I'm sorry I was having a weird nightmare. 

He comforted me and held me close and in my sleepy stupor I said ""I love you"" and was instantly shocked by what came out of my mouth, not because it wasn't true but because I had been waiting to say it. My dumb sleepy brain couldn't help it though. 

He held me tighter and said ""I love you too"" and we happily went to sleep. 


"
"We were both hot and sweaty. My hands were tight on his shoulders and he suddenly stopped moaning and started this low whimper. I was super turned on so I grabbed him by his arms and pulled him up to me a little ways and then he turned around and whispered to me ""Hillary knew about Benghazi"" and I shot my load "
"*Even in gay porn it doesn't seem like the bottoms are degraded THAT much.*

Apparently you haven't watched the right type of gay porn then."
"Yes! 
My little niece and nephew call their Father Daddy. 

Nothing kills a mood faster. "
"Yes. As im only 18 now my friends are still doing the whole puppy love, ideation thing, its cute and I wish I could have that. 

The lowest point Ive had in a long time was last July at my year's Debutante's Ball. On the bus home all my friends were kissing and cuddling someone, I felt extremely jealous. To top it off the girl I was sitting next to was cuddling into me and saying how great I was, blah blah blah. I remember feeling so hollow. I would have loved to feel something for her, It would make things so much easier, but unfortunately its not on the cards. 

I often find the last hour or two of nights with friends the most lonely and depressing, as they start to pair off with each other and Im stuck either alone or feigning interest. "
"""I don't want him to sleep with someone else.""

I feel like you've answered your own question.  I understand his frustration, but I also feel he's being insensitive.  He married you knowing the situation you're in. 
Since you compared it to being disabled I can sort of relate being disabled myself. I would not want a boyfriend let alone my husband telling me he needs to go outside of marriage because my body isn't enough. That would sting... a lot.
He needs to be open-minded to other alternatives, such as dildo, strap-on, ect.. And be more sensitive to your feelings. I understand sex it important to most people, but you're in a marriage and that means compromising.  
Have you considered threesomes?
"
"I've never been able to get off with a partner. I'm perfectly fine not cumming though. They try to find some reason as to why because I must be some sort of crazy if they can't do it but I don't like receiving blow jobs, i can't cum from anal, receiving a handy feels weird and I'm a bottom so I have zero interest in topping. 
    
It's 150% fine.  I like intimacy, I like cuddling, I like the warmth of another man, I like sucking dick and I'm real ok at it. I used to feel bad about it but just before things happen I'm just like ""if you want to do things to me that's fine, but just know you should do it for your enjoyment and not to make me cum because it won't happen."
Dogs trying to lick your ass while you're fucking.
Don't think with your dick. If he's interested in anything he'll make the moves. 
"Even if you were broken up, eight years is a long time together. I can't imagine what you are going through right now."
"“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb

You still have a lot of time to enjoy your life. I only started enjoying mine 3 years ago (I'm 28 yo now). I switched office, traveled, etc. I suggest you to take a break from your daily routine. Go traveling. "
"I'm Asian myself, I've never really exposed myself to the dating scene, so I can't say from personal experience how bad it may be (especially for queer PoC).

However, I have heard much about discrimination within the gay community. I can't say much other than the fact that it... sucks (pun not intended). 
I can't change how you feel (about the desire to be white), and while this may come off as a bit too optimistic (especially from someone as inexperienced as I) - please, please, please don't give up.

It honestly must hurt (and debilitating) to see yourself as nothing more than a stereotype.
I can sort of understand why you may want to be a white man. But seeing another gay PoC is honestly really comforting- since I'm mostly exposed to (both media and around me) gay white guys.

So I'm grateful that you're here, and also sorry that you're struggling as well. Coming from someone who has never dated before (let alone have sex)- my words probably don't mean much. 
But I do hope things get better for you. 
"
"Update #2: ""They've started to do it together guys! This is crazy""

Update #3: ""I asked to join them tonight!! Here's what happened!"""
"&gt;We broke up but I want to get back together.

No."
"Just because it wasn't rape, doesn't mean it wasn't a shitty af thing to do. People break up with people when they don't treat them with the respect they feel they deserve. "
"Start him/her a college fund, and then when they find out they've got educational help eighteen years from now your sister will have to explain why they've never met the cool uncle who set it up, if they don't decide to make amends with you."
"Sorry, but you're probably not going to get many serious explanations from the trolls and the haters. 

I suspect that many of them are teenagers who are still in their angsty phase. I know I wrote some stupid shit online when I was younger."
"First boyfriend said ""hey you know I love you right?"" just randomly while we were driving. I simply said ""I know."" Which in hindsight is horrible but I had heard it in Star Wars and thought it would be funny. Not the time to be funny. 

I said it back as soon as I realized I had fucked up. From then on, whenever I'd say ""I love you"" he'd say ""I know"" to mess with me haha."
"Got me half-boned, so it gets a point. "
"For context, my boyfriend is about 8 inches taller than I am, and he's got a good 80 pounds on me, I'm 5'2 and weigh 110lbs, but I am also the top in our relationship. When we first got together, I made the mistake of slipping it in with no lube during the heat of the moment, I'm not kidding when I say this man literally launched me off of him. I went flying thru the air butt naked and landed on my bedroom floor, giving me a little rug burn, and I fucked up my elbow a little. Looking back it's funny now, he felt bad after, it was just an instant reaction."
/r/thatHappened 
Power bottoms are the backbone of the gay community
"This guy is mostly right. The common prob with straight guys is their obsession with being 100% straight. Any sexual desire that deviates from a girl to a guy, they think GAY! Well that's for you to decide, not anyone else. So thread here, lightly. Most of the ignorant and unfounded replies above and after are just that, ignorant. Guys should be more comfortable with their sexuality and not insecure or paranoid about what makes them hard or who they're attracted to. When I was a kid, I never saw guys as straight or gay. I just saw them as attractive or unattractive. If I was turned on by him it didn't matter what he considered himself, if we both were interested in each other then so be it. I never told a guy that he must be gay if he likes me or is attracted to my body, or my dick etc. I've met a lot of straight guys who found me to be good looking, sexy etc. it's not important for me to label anyone. Sex is sex. Sexuality is human, not just straight or non straight . I can tell y'all some  stories about straight guys that I've been with in ways that they never imagined was possible."

"I've seen enough porn to know how this ends....


Make sure your friend doesn't catch you sleeping with his step-dad!"
He's being ridiculous. You're definitely not selfish to prefer being monogamous. 
"A guy acting like a little kid or juvenile like. Talking about pokemon etc haha. I like having sleep overs with guys, nerf gun fights water gun fights video games. "
"No.  That's actually like... completely normal.  Not weird at all.

Liking sweaty armpits and crotches and all that is about as weak-ass of a kink as you'll find in a gay guy.  On the mild end of it I'm not sure it even counts as a kink so as much as just part of normal sexuality.  Enjoying the smell of your partner surely makes as much sense as enjoying them visually or how they sound.

I kind of miss not having air conditioning in summer, because nuzzling my face into my boyfriend's sweaty stinky armpit while falling asleep was deeply soothing on some basic, primal level."
"Earliest attraction to an image of a man definitely happened in the underwear aisle at Walmart. I got my mom to buy me the underwear with the hottest model (ftl boxer briefs) and secretly kept the cardboard insert lol. 

Actual porn, in 8th grade my best friend (we had recently come out to each other) handed me a floppy disk at school and when i took it home there were like 5 pictures of guys fucking. God I wish I could find porn as exciting as I did that day."

"How incredible and ""right"" it felt, after a lifetime of only having sex with women (I'm bi). How fun it was to feel a dick harden in my mouth. The sense of masculinity I got from being able to make a man moan and writhe in pleasure. "

lol nobody wears condoms for oral. 
I've always heard that it was the right ear. But I also haven't heard anybody talk about ear piercing associated with gayness in 10-15 years.
"My husband has a hard time waking up in the morning, he's usually super groggy.  I'm always up first, so I make him a latte with our stovetop espresso maker and bring it to him in bed.  Often I'll sit with him and look through instagram or reddit while he nurses his coffee.   This has been our daily ritual since we met, it must be nearly five thousand cups of coffee by now."

"Wow, a love story in less than a paragraph.

"Normal, like straight guys watching lesbian porn."
I've had days where that sounds like the best thing in the world
"The right way to look at this is that you want to be treated equally, not that you want to be white.

I mean, it's an understandable desire but looking at yourself this way does nothing to undermine racism and only makes you hate yourself more"
I was just surprised by how much warmer people's bodies are than you expect.
"not tryna hate on anyone 

A lot of straight people/men/crazy churchgoers ( society) objectifies them as the worst kind of gay/man. These ideas are fed to us and we grow up to believe them, we arent't born to believe it..we are taught it through shit like


This is what a man does

This is what a Man looks like 

This is how a real man speaks etc. 

Now when you get anything other than that it basically  fucks up 

Another  reason could be  that they represent the worst of us. ( not my belief...but some feel like this)

Some just dont want to be associated to this and may see them as a personal attack on who they are, they feel like they could grow up to be like them when they're older which is something they may not want. They might be afraid of speaking to them or the very fact that men can be feminine and they cant bring that out of themselves, or have the urge but not the courage. it could be linked to your childhood or the lack of not having any feminineness(not a word i dont think) in your life, so being branded as a feminine person 'by nature' could throw you off. It could actually be anything!!

I really coudn't say  what it is for you because i don't know you like that, but as long as you are aware of the reasons why someone may feel weird around feminie gays it might help.

"Yep, I use my imagination more than I watch porn. "
"""Aaah, those hands are cold!"""
i think its really hot when a guy is a secret witch who uses terror magic to melt my eyes and rip my bones out
Not just the hand. The whole arm. There's nothing like rolling over only to have your arm flop next to you like a dead fish.
"I told my first boyfriend after three months of dating and him taking my virginity and he responded with ""I've been seeing someone else.""

And then a guy who I hooked up with three times over a year told me he loved me. I told him ""uhhh, I'm fond of you as well?"" Then a week later he texted me saying he had syphilis. I tested negative but still. 

"
"Sexuality is a spectrum. It's not black and white. 


Don't worry about labeling it. Do what feels right :)"
"Or bi? He definitely has gay tendencies, but it may not be exclusive. "
"I don't.

You are one of my favorite people here. Us tops have to appreciate these beautiful bottoms. We love you all.

"Cheaters gonna cheat bud. If you enjoy being a doormat, which it does not sound like you do, then stay.

You're young, the relationship is young, and the trust is gone. Move on, it's better for the both of you. "
Because we are culturally taught that being a receptive sexual partner = woman's role = feminine and feminine = the worst thing you can say about a man.

"Leave him?

I've seen people say ""only looking to chat"" but send me dick pics and wanna fuck. I suspect it's plausible Deniability if a significant other finds it.

Downloading those apps would be a deal breaker for me because I could only see it being for sex at that point. Sure many people use it to chat and stuff but the app is created for sex. So that would nag at me. 

Once you're in a committed monogamous relationship, those apps are off the table. If
You want to chat or make friends, join a bowling league. "
"Ditto. We're thrust into a world all by ourselves when we discover our sexuality. For whatever reasons, *most* of us all came to the exact same conclusion without ever having contact with anyone else or knowing much, if anything, about being gay- that is, we buried it, tried to change it, and hid it from everyone in our lives, sometimes to a detrimental effect on our mental health. 

Developing that kind of mentality, a deep sense of shame or guilt for some uncontrollable preference, and feeling the need to hide it from the rest of the world (in my case even going so far as to work out a plan on how to kill myself if anyone ever found out- at 12years old mind you... Trying to figure out a quick and painless suicide plan isn't something any child should feel the need for...) forces you to mature a lot quicker than your peers. Then going on to lead a double life or hide a core part of yourself from everyone forces you to second guess and analyze *everything* as you audit every word you say and carefully construct every sentence so as to not tip anyone off. Now, as an adult, I can't get out of my own head. I wish I could turn it off and just run on autopilot like everyone around me, but unfortunately that just doesn't happen and I can't help but continue to analyze every interaction I have, wonder if I said the wrong thing, etc. It's embarrassing to even say it here, but I genuinely feel like a childs mind trapped in an adults body (*a fat one*, to boot!) and I go through life feeling like a fraud, like one day someone will discover I'm not a real adult. 


And like you, while I feel like I grew up rather quickly at the time, by my second year of college I felt like I was already falling behind my peers. Everyone seemed to be pairing off, enjoying more grown up things, *being* more mature not just *pretending* to be mature, and settling into their lives, blissfully unaware that life *isn't* that simple for some of us. 


I used to wish I were straight as I thought that would solve all my problems, but at this point I'll take any kind of normalcy. Oh how nice it would be to date, meet someone I genuinely liked (*and I knew it from the get-go*) buy a house, get a dog, go to work and *actually experience life*, not just continue to wait until some future time when I can start to *experience* life. That was all fine and dandy as a teenager, but being nearly thirty and still waiting for life to begin is both an embarrassing predicament and a depressing one..."
"You can take the Chief Justice out of Alabama, but you can't stop that state from being a complete pile of crap. "
"There is where I come from, but I was raised in Cowboy Country, so the difference is probably carved out in much more of a stark relief in that area than where most of the guys in this sub come from.

In my hometown in Texas, ""masculine"" men do not cook (except barbecue grilling) or clean, have never touched a washing machine or a dryer (unless they were repairing a broken one) and will only set foot inside a grocery store to buy one of two things: 1.) a case of beer, or 2.) a can of snuff.

There is also a very strict protocol for how men dress, there. No man over the age of 16 will wear a shirt that's smaller than a size Large, regardless of what his measurements are; even if he's drowning in fabric. Mediums and Smalls are considered to be for boys and sissies, because ""men"" are supposed to be big and strong, you see. At least once a day, every time I'm unfortunate enough to find myself back home, somebody snipes, ""You think you could find a smaller shirt?"" To which I reply, ""Fuck you. This shirt fits me. It just looks funny to you, because all the shit-kickers around here wear shirts that look like they came from Pablo the Tent-Maker.""

Oh, and absolutely, under no circumstances should a ""masculine"" man wear a V-neck. Got dinged for that one at a family function once, too.

Oddly enough, no brand of jeans that isn't Wrangler are considered acceptable and - ironically - they buy them as tight as they can possibly get them. It's a functional concern, tho. You don't want to wear loose fabric in the saddle, because it will rub and chafe. But, the term ""Wrangler Butt"" is a real thing for a reason, and I'm not particularly inclined to complain on that front.

An argument could be made that this is all outside the scope of your question, because unarguably, the things I've described here are symptoms of ""toxic masculinity"" which differs significantly from garden variety masculinity."
"been there done that.  There are days where I'll feel extra cute with how a pair of jeans fit or a shirt fits, and I think to myself ""ya I'd do me"""
"Despite the ideas you might get browsing this sub, gaybros, or anywhere else with a hypermasculine we're-totes-no-different-from-str88888888bros circlejerk, most real life gay men are ok with having a softer edge to their masculinity or mixing and matching  while still considering themselves masculine. "
"You can still love someone and not be happy with particular aspects of the relationship as time goes on and things change. Yes, he could've been fine with the arrangement at the beginning but now he isn't and would like something different or more. It doesn't make him a dick or asshole. And you can't just make someone be satisfied sexual if they want more. It'll seep out in other ways over time if the desire is strong enough. He respects his husband enough to bring this to him and talk it out. You can love someone and not get everything you need from them. Thinking that every single person will get everything they need from every LTR is setting relationships up for failure. Some people can and others can't. "
A guy told me he loved me after talking to him on Skype for like 2 hours. 
"Don't be a square, post the video!"
"I prefer moans, whimpering and grunts more than any actual speaking.

Although things like ""oh god..."", ""yes, give it to me"", ""harder"", ""deeper"", ""choke me"", ""put your arm around my neck"", ""give it to me"", ""Oh -insert my name here-!"" and ""cum in me!"" have all been things I have heard that turned me on."
"This is my mum, minus the gay thing.

She is a kind person, and I love her, but I won't deny she is a decent part of the reason I have little faith in the integrity of relationships.

"I'm kinda on the same page. I know that I'm gay and all, but I don't really care about sex that much. It's fun, but the fact that the pleasure ends so abruptly after orgasm makes it really underwhelming. It's the cuddling that I actually care about."

"Everything you have put in your thread indicates that the problem is not with you, but your family and friends who sound (from your rant) quite homophobic.

- They have the problem with gay guys 
- They are unable to accept you
- They are the ones who are causing you to feel bad about yourself.

So instead of changing a very basic part of you, perhaps consider changing your friends and either reaching an accommodation with your family while you're with them, or telling them to grow the fuck up and accept you or GTFO of your life."
This is still technically rape. You have the right to have boundaries and he has to respect them. I personally wouldn't see this guy anymore because you don't know what it could turn into or what he's capable of. You may even want to see a therapist to help you work with the emotional end of things. Hope this is slightly helpful. 
"Here's the thing about being outed: If you don't admit it and she has no proof, all you have to do is deny it. She can say whatever she wants, but if you say it's not true, then it's her word against yours -- as long as you've covered all your tracks.

"The first thing I thought of when I read the OP and the comments in response was that this is an extension of misogyny and is exacerbated greatly by porn. Way more often than not, bottoms in porn are feminine and/or feminized as a direct result of this. You can almost always tell in studio shit who's going to bottom after about 3 seconds and it's very rare your initial guess is wrong.

This crap needs to stop. It's very damaging to the sexual maturation of us all and largely why the only porn I watch these days is either solo stuff or amateur flip fuck porn.

You don't need to be explicitly told this. You were likely raised in a  culture that made this readily apparent even if was never said as such. "
"I remember my boyfriend at the time was topping me and the dog started to whimper, then started to growl, then full on barking. We had to stop and take the dog into the living-room so we could finish our session. Being in the heat of the moment you don't realize anything until you hear the dog barking at you. "

You seem to be grasping at legitimizing Fox News . Sit down plz.
I think it has to to with proximity and loneliness. Fully aware it's totally irrational.
Thanks man. It's helping me but I have a long way. 
"I think I was 12, it was the first time I have ever watched porn, and straight porn hasn't done anything for me. Suddenly I saw the gay section, and thought it's so ugly and funny, like, two dudes? yuck. Then I entered it, opened one video, got super interested and came before they even finished making out."
"A little aggressive but as a PoC I agree. People need to get over what they can't change. Maybe thier skin color isn't why guys aren't attracted to them but rather thier low self esteem and self hating, society blaming personality. 

What's worse are the PoC who are only attracted to white guys and still bitch. "
You are way too over dramatic. He has forgiven you. What else would you want him to do? lol
"My view on things like this, because I have done this with a close friend:

Again, he is a close friend, and still is after we had sex.  He revealed to me that he really wanted to try having sex with a guy.  He was too scared to go on a dating app for fear of being outed, because his parent/family have presented very hostile views towards homosexuality.  Plus I know the online dating scene for men4men (flakes, shady profiles, people lying about who they are, etc).  I thought it safer, even if we were close friends, to just do it with me, because we at least trust each other, and I knew that I would not do anything to harm him or make him uncomfortable, especially when it comes to consent.  I offered for those reasons, we talked over the details for a couple weeks, then did it.  It was amazing and better than I expected.

I think what is important is that you spend a lot of time drawing boundary lines.  Don't engage in anything until the ""terms"" are clearly understood by the both of you and you both have given clear consent to them and to the sex.  Then actually practice your friendship when you're done; make the two of you engage in your friendship like you always had, leaving out the sex portion, but also allowing time to talk about/have sex as well if you both wish to continue.  

Basically, agree about the schism it could provide, keep the sex life separate from friend life in conversation, and maintain the current friendship."
"""DO A BARREL ROLL!"""
"I would say just use a condom + prep especially when adding an extra person to the equation but lets be honest, quite a few people go on prep just so they can have a bunch of bareback sex "
Get absolutely shit faced next time 
"Can't remember what the site was, but I was on my PlayStation Portable (PSP) and searched like ""hot shirtless guys"" and got to a random porn site with Hispanic men all over it. Not disappointed by what I saw.

This must've been 2008/2009 when I was 14yo. I was long interested in guys before that, though."
"Agreed, but some people take on personality traits without even realizing it. I tend to absorb things like a sponge when I gang around certain people. I found myself picking up my friend's ""catch phrases"". It's kinda awkward."
"Female chiming in because I'm sick of the idea of taking a dick being called sissy. Straight men think less of us - look at what's running for president - because we are the bottom. I've always been of the opinion that topping is easier than bottoming for a lot of reasons, mostly that bottoms have to not only try to make sure you can accomodate what's coming at you, but to also try to find pleasure in it and give pleasure as well. Vaginas are naturally a hell of a lot stretchier, so kudos to anyone who is good at anal sex. Most women don't like it because most straight men suck at it (hell, they usually suck at fucking as well for that matter). From the videos I've seen I'd say gay tops, for the most part, rock the knowledge of what to do with it and with themselves. That man below you might be accommodating but he sure as hell isn't weak or less manly. It takes someone with a strong sense of self to allow another person to enter their body. This is as close as you will ever get to another human being and it's an honor to be invited in. For my money, we need Bottom Appreciation Day because you gentlemen fucking rock!"
"My mom enjoys outing me to family members she's feuding with. It's like her trump card. ""My son is gay! Look how great that makes me!"" I handle it by smoking weed and Fucking my boyfriend."
"An average to short dick on a top. Still fuckable in real life, but does not lend itself well to the audience's view, so you rarely if ever see it in porn "
So you cum almost instantly when I put my dick in you and then you finish me off with a blowjob? **What's your number?**
"slippers is weird, but gym shorts are hot.

IDKY, but with some garmets it's just like ""there's a dick under/in there"" and then that leads my mind down a rabbit hole of sex and tight underwear.

The reason I watch fraternity x or sketchy sex videos is because they keep their clothes on. Otherwise, pornhub is just a bland sea of pasty, white bodies."
"I always get rock hard when it goes as far as kissing a guy I like. Hell, I often start getting hard simply by physical contact with him. Never had any problems there and neither during sex. But I am a teenager and very, very far from my years of old age so thats a good thing.

Sometimes, when I am nervous, it has the effect of inhibiting my erections...Happened several times. But I just dont get as hard as usual, that's all. I would think its probably due to nerves, considering the fact you mentioned it happened before with different guys. in order to have good sex one has to feel not just willing but relaxed and safe as well. Otherwise you'll be unconsciously be distracted  by other things."
Be prepared for lots of rejection
Bedrooms shouldn't move.  That would mean an earthquake is happening.
"Celebrities?

Anderson Cooper is well educated, informed, and generally one I'd consider to be on the intelligent end of things. 

Ellen DeGeneres has shown great intelligence of being able to be herself while being somewhat subversive by taking attacks in stride and coming out on the other side stronger for it.

RuPaul Charles is really intelligent. He's been able to live life on his own terms while navigating the line between what is and is not acceptable in society in general. He's shown himself to be a shrewd business person even if you don't like what he's peddling. "
You are 27.  You still have your youth.  Go embrace now.
"A week and you've said you fell in love with him? Come on mate, relax. "
"Not trying hard to maintain an image.

I like laid-back guys, not the popular or classy successful ones. 

I guess I feel a lot more comfortable with guys who are just normal guys, but not low lifers lol. "
I hooked up with someone who literally just wanted me to lay on him. 
"In missionary I love to grab their legs or arms, grab his chest, or just pull him close to me and make out. There's a ton of stuff you can do to make the top go wild

It's not always about being in control. Just be into it"
Update #5: masc4masc threeway.
"It is actually incredibly normal. Not everyone is wired for hookups. For some of us, we need a mature emotional connection before sex becomes anything more than just ""nice"". It doesn't make you less gay, it just makes you less of a gay stereotype."
But a strap on isn't the same as flesh and blood for either party involved. Things change over time that's one of the major components of being alive and human. 
"Cant believe no one has said shit on a dick yet.  lol 

I mean granted you should be clean back there but alittle brown happens every now and then.  You never ever ever see that in main stream gay porn.  At least I havent.  Youd have to watch scat or something to actually see poop in an asshole. "
"Black, and fully agree. This whole begging for white acceptance and ignoring your own race is downright sad and pathetic.

The kill yourself part tho? [No mama.](http://static4.worldofwonder.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Michelle-No.gif)"
because they want to have tall babies... 
"And take an upvote to reverse it. I think conservative gays are a minority, but not super rare, so I'm curious to see how many answers show up. 
And to those downvoting, shame on you, it's a perfectly valid question."

Go to a bathhouse so that way you don't get arrested. 
This is not a bad fetish at all
