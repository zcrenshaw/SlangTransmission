"Nobody asks. Everyone assumes I'm a bottom since I'm an Asian. And sadly, they're correct. :("
"POV from someone allegedly attractive...my boyfriend weighs 60kg (~140 pounds) more than me, has depression, no friends, a history of being used and exploited badly and works a rough job. And despite all these reasons to say fuck you to everything, he is such a lovely, considerate, genuine guy. He is so humble and totally aware of his shortcomings and wants to work on them. He's expecting me to just get bored and ditch him someday and I feel great about it because I know how I feel and I'm excited to see him slowly believing in me and enjoying life again. And his personality shines through in the sex! He might not be the hottest guy in the room on paper but everyone is beneath him in my book. *TL;DR* there are more important, attractive qualities than simple looks. It's never that simple.

Edit - he cried when I asked him to be his boyfriend, saying it was the first time that anyone did, he was always the one chasing. My heart melted!"
I think that staring at Donald Trump has a better chances to do the trick.
"Break up with your bf and just delete him off everything. That day, go. To your ex and sit down and explain yourself. Also that day, draft a message to your friends explaining what happened. Send it asap before breaking up. You want to blitz this guy, get your side out first and then leave him to do whatever he's gonna. 

Even if your ex never takes you back, you need this current guy out of your life at whatever cost. He is toxic. Snooping is unhealthy. Breaking someone up who is in love is disgusting and would be enough for most people to hate his guts forever. 

Let me repeat, even if it costs you friends, get this motherfucker out of your life. If your friends are your friends at all, then they know what an ass he is. If they believe him instead, why would you want those people as friends. "
Link please so we can make jokes about fucking your dad.
I thought it was already known that he is a catholic?
well this one time when i was 13 i shoved a thick bottle of hairspray up my ass the wrong way so when i pulled it out the cap stayed inside me and my butthole suctioned it up deep and i couldn't get it out then my mom came home to take me to a tutoring session at her old-lady friends house where in the bathroom i had to push really hard and almost fist myself to yank it out 
"So, what now? Go over and ask if he can help with your plumbing?"
"Once I was messing around with my boyfriend at the time, and he was giving me a blowjob. He was bisexual and rarely sucked before, let alone to the finish line.  He was pretty rough, but I was OK with it. Until he went down a little too hard and it hurt. But whatever, he kept going and it still felt good. 

He started remarking about how much I was precumming, and I finally cum in his mouth. I notice him gulping a lot and realize that my dick still hurts. 

We turn on the lights and there is blood all over my crotch and lower chest. Turns out he tore a piece of my foreskin and I was bleeding into his mouth the whole time. He didn't know what cum tasted like, and it was in the dark, so he kept on swallowing my blood. He looked like some vampire with my blood all over his mouth and chin. There was a lot more blood than you'd expect from a simple tear. 

That was not a good night....."
"We had a date, and it went amazingly well. Anyway, by the end of it, I said I have to be home now, since everybody was going out and someone needed to stay at home. He said, ""cool, I'll walk you to your car"". 

So we're walking to my car and we're talking about previous sexual partners and he says ""I'm a freak in bed"". I sit down and lock the doors immediately (out of habit!) and start to drive off, and say bye to him and he just has this deer in the headlight face. 

I go like 20 metres and it fucking hits me and I reverse and I just say, ""get in"" and then we fucked in my empty house. "
"To me, it's kinda like the guy is saying ""you're not fucking me hard enough, so I'm gonna pull you to me harder."" At which point I'm like, ""game on you son of a bitch."""
And this is why no politician that Russia supports is worthy of LGBT votes.  
"I wouldn't say porn can make you gay, but it could make you *realize* that you're gay. 

"
"Seriously, if you had gone back in time and told 12-year-old me that as an adult he would spend all day fantasizing about sticking his tongue up another dude's ass, I'm not sure what I would've thought."
70% of this sub... lol
Only if balls touch does it become gay. 
Maybe the were taken aback by your hostile remarks? She just asked a question and you could have responded nicely that you have a date with a man rather than being defensive. Go to work with a smile and be pleasant and they'll likely be the same.
"Okay, this is beyond the scope of this sub and is probably best discussed in couples therapy with a licensed mental health professional."
"Ewww call him out. 

Talk about this with him.

You guys are adults, you can have a mature conversation."
"Tell him you are too, and you're relieved now that you can be honest with him.  Make mention of the fact that you know how he feels as closeted, and you appreciate the gravity of what is going on with him.  Tell him his bravery helped you out yourself.

As for the other stuff, you can casually mentioned you've crushed on him before, but the friendship is what you really value.  See what he says from there, but don't push.  Just tell him you're saying that to clear the air and to be 100% honest."
"&gt; I felt so stupid for not realizing it in the moment haha.

tbh this whole story sounded like you were intentionally avoiding him lol"
"Then again, you did avoid having to watch *50 Shades Darker* so that's a plus"
"I'm sorry, but this is /r/askgaybros and we downvote everything unless it's about hating Republicans or hot st8 bois"

"""Unintentionally"", your response was very wordy and deliberate hahaha. "
"No way, not since I was 16. I learned my lesson young and early. Since then I have never made the same mistake. That's ancient history at this point."
go ahead. download it again in a few hours. you'll find that nothing has changed: the same squares will have the same nonresponsive profiles. 
"The occasional new, interesting guy shows up. Tells you how cute and sexy you are, then tells you he's only in town for 2 hours and has to fly back to Spain and never return."
"It isn't terrible. Don't think that for a second. You are likely young and wildly unprepared to deal with this kind of situation which truly destroys families and relationships. 

Back away, be there as a friend. But I would not suggest being in a relationship with him at this point. Don't abandon him, just put a healthy distance between you so that you can be a friend without having to have your life destroyed in the process. You can't do this on your salary and without being trained for this. 

Please, regardless of what people might say, remember that the best way to help someone else is to do so when your own safety is not in question, much like putting the oxygen mask on yourself before your children. You'll be better able to help him as a friend than as a spouse in this.

He needs his family or state intervention if he doesn't have any to fall back on."
They're nuttier than squirrel shit. Best to just leave them be. Some of the shit you read in there can make a sane man have a stroke from anger.

"I'm a masculine man in his early twenties. I pass off as straight very easily and people have a hard time pegging me as gay. I'm not sure I like butt stuff, but yesterday I was gang banged and now I'm confused. I always saw myself as a top but having something up my asshole made me feel things I had never felt before. Am I less of a man because of This? I love sucking dick too and eating ass... But it's ok, because I'm a masculine guy... right?.... RIGHT?

Stuff like this? "
"tbh, when my boyfriend falls asleep on the couch I leave him there so that I can go to bed alone and bask on the glory of having the whole bed to myself. so much blanket and it's all mine..."
Never shit on your own doorstep. Huge mess waiting to happen..
"&gt; are people really serious and do they actually get triggered if you ""assume their gender""

Ive never met anyone in real life who gets triggered, Ive only ever seen it on memes and online posts that have been over sensationalised and highlighted.

/r/askgaybros is not the right sub to test out your erotic fiction writing skills.
I hear there are these guys who are into banging other dudes :o

i genuinely get anxious when i make eye contact with a girl because i feel like she might think i'm some creepy guy checking her out. but im literally not!!! 😭😭😭
"Back in high school I was hanging out with this younger gay kid. He kept asking me to go back to his house to hang out in his room, which I thought was weird. I shoulda gone and gotten the D. "
Its alright i guess.  I do feel like I have a super power when I am walking through stores who have attractive women trying to sell you stuff though.  I see so many straight guys get caught at those booths learning about the benefits of switching to T-Mobile.  Not finding women attractive does have its benefits at times
"Just Don't.

I lived not just in the gayborhood, but in the gay apartment complex.  Everyone's husbear was fucking everyone else's husbear, yet every couple was monogamous with their soulmate and didn't cheat.  

You have no idea the levels of drama.  I'd rather go to a Beyonce concert with a sign that says she lip synchs and it's really Michelle's voice.  

And good lord, the crabs.  That point when you start going to the laundromat down the street because you get crabs if you use the complex's laundry room.  

That time you realize the one bear everyone says is a slutty whore turns out to be the only one in the complex that doesn't have crabs because he's actually not a whore and wasn't lying when he said he was celibate.

And fucking thieves.  When it's the end of summer at the pool and you suddenly realize that you've seen that one speedo with the extremely unique print on at least four different guys and you realize that's what happened to your underwear, towels, and your duvet.

Take my advice and don't go there. "
"You can *do* anything you want. ""Gay"" and ""straight"" and ""bi"" are about attractions and feelings."
A wife. 
"Yes, but there are many different ways to be smart/intellectually stimulating.

You may not have a PhD, but if you speak really passionately and articulately about what you do and what you're interested in, and you seem like someone who cares about learning and educating yourself (because as smart as you are, there's still something to learn)...that's what matters far more to me."
Baby don't hurt me
"Last year I went on a camping trip with some friends. I was bored while we were all trying to get the fire started so I opened up Grindr just to see who was around. There was a guy 10 feet away, who ended up being a friend of one of my friends. I checked again later in the night and he had messaged me saying ""Hi!"" with a few more pics of him. When we were all getting ready to call it a night he asked if I wanted to sleep in his tent. I told him that I had brought my own tent so I was good. On the last day of the camping trip he had to leave a little earlier than everyone else and he came up to me asking if I wanted to help him pack up. I told him that I couldnt since the rest of us were about to go hiking and I didnt want to miss out on it.
On the way back my friend told me that the guy really wanted me to fuck him. I felt so stupid for not realizing it in the moment haha."
as soon as you have relationships with other gay guys straight crushes just kind of dry up 
"Sometimes helping someone involves taking their hand, wiping away their tears, and saying, ""there, there, it's tough now, but it'll get better.""

Other times helping someone involves pointing out that if they're so masc they need to grow a pair and stop wallowing in the bullshit. I really believe that there are guys who are so invested in *not* being gay that they do want to know how often they can let guys breed their hole before they ""become gay.""

When he nuts up your ass, the first one to say ""no homo"" is straight, the other guy is totally gay. Right?

I think it does help to point to to the self-deluding guys who post on here that if you keep finding a cock in your mouth, you're not ""straight but when I get really horny, I need cock."" You might be bi. You might be gay. Not straight.

For you twenty-somethings, I've been fighting since before you were born so people could say ""I'm gay"" or ""I'm bi."" Pull your weight here, if you're having gay sex. Look in the mirror and admit to yourself that you're gay or bi. And cut the bullshit."
...I was told there would be shenanigans.
"Used my coat to shield him from the rain while we waited our group of friends (we hadn't met until this day, despite having friends in common) to a party at the beach. 
They never showed up, rain didnt stop and we were essentially ""locked"" under a bunch of trees as rain shield, plus I had to place my hand on hips and vice-versa, in order to make room underneath the coat.

After much awkward conversation, we realized we had the same interests, led to raging boner and we making out rolling on the beach (raining heavily), stopping to catch our breaths. We spent 2hours on this, afterwards we went to a 24h Burger king and back to beach to make out until the Sun rose "
"&gt; The only thing that's important in middle age is to be a top. If you aren't, then it's not going to happen.

This girl is the nastiest skank bitch I've ever met. Do not trust her. She is a fugly slut.
"He took me to the Yukon in a cabin he rented for the weekend. One fine night we went to a lake reflecting the Northern Lights in all their majestic glory. Nothing but us, Wagner, and wine (and some chicken lol). 

We were snuggling in a thick blanket, and one time after the convo died down, he stared into my eyes, and told me with utter certainty that he would never love anyone the way he loved me. He then gave me the most magical kiss I've ever had. One of only two guys who managed to completely take my breath away."
"""Wanna go see 50 Shades Darker together at around 9 pm?""
""No not really I haven't even watched the first one yet.""

He's bi-curious (and hot) and he knows I'm gay. Oh well."
stop I can't be crying rn 😥 this is the most wholesome post I've ever seen in this sub
only 100 more until i get 100! hahahahahahaha
"No, we're pretty easy going. Just don't be offended if he says no. 

If he does say yes, please be very, very careful you don't lead him on. Some of the younger guys tend to think any sign of affection from they straight friends is a sign of availability for a relationship and start swooning as a result."
"Only in that I was a lot less worried about having to appear as masculine as can be so nobody could figure out I was gay. I stopped faking a like for sports, admitted that while I love Metal music, Lady Gaga isn't too bad either, and didn't care if I talked like a ""bro"" or looked masculine.

I'm more of myself now, I haven't changed to better suit a stereotype or to better fit in to society, and coming out has directly helped me be me rather than somebody else."
You are my favorite person on this subreddit. 
"Tumblr actually. Whatever you're into, there's probably a carefully curated tumblr for it."

"Because double standards exist.

None of this has to be true as long as we stop pretending its true. Guys and girls experiment. It's a new day."
Yeah this was a really unfriendly response to her. 
"Being gay has made me an intelligent, open-minded individual. When you're put in a position where you must reconcile the religion you're brought up with and your sexual orientation, you must begin to think for yourself, and critically. At the end of that mental ordeal, you come out a little bit more skeptical, but you develop an intellectual toolkit that can be used throughout your professional and academic career. You also tend to be less judgemental, because you know what it's like to to be judged and you what impact it can have. So yeah, I'd say it's made me a better person.  As for happiness, I'm working on that. "

If he is trying to control my rhythm, then I'm going to teach him a lesson about who is really in control."
"Its deserving, down vote, move on. It always starts off with, ""Im a normal guy"", or ""Im masculine and not gay acting"", then followed by a sob story, and then about not fitting in.

 Im sick of reading the same damsel in distress garbage from a guy who claims hes masculine."
"Join an MMA club, learn to fight, and beat the ever loving shit out of their insecure asses.

In all seriousness though, bullies feed off of negative reactions.  Do you get visibly upset or lash out at them in return?

What about the school faculty?  Is this happening in front of them, do they care?  Are you the first openly gay kid at your school?  

If you REALLY want to do something about it, look at starting a club at school; gay-straight alliance or something like that.  Who knows, maybe you'll leave a legacy there and help a lot more guys and girls like you in the future."
That is terrifying

"My friends catch on rather quick. It's only human to check out others.

I'm gay but I pay close attention to both sexes as I appreciate the beauty in both men and women."
"We are pretty closely linked, both in history and in challenges and we're a small number of the population so it makes a lot of sense that we band together."
This happened to me before.  We hooked up too because we had one house separating us.  He turned out to be a psychological disaster area.
I must have done something wrong. I looked at Melania and became more gay.

"When I was younger, I assumed older people in relationships had their shit together, and knew what they were doing in life.

Now that I have a partner, and I'm 'older', I realize nobody really knows what they're doing, but it's easier to deal with the insanity of life with someone by your side."
"In highschool when guys started shaving one of my classmates asked me in private if I trimmed my pubes too. I said no and he asked me if he could verify and I was like no wtf. I didn't even know I was gay then.

Now he has a boyfriend and he is super nice."

"Nothing is wrong with you. Nothing at all.

Look, we're all culturally conditioned to see gay sex as an absolute no way no how. Every gay and bi person you meet has broken out of that conditioning.  When companies use heterosexuality to push product, they're also pushing product. 

They're all whispering at you, ""your only acceptable sexual partner is someone of the opposite sex."" They're also saying how their product will make you irresistible to the opposite sex, so we already know that they're bullshitting. 

The  porn has broken through your conditioning. Did porn do this? No. You did. You like guys. And that's a wonderful thing. Nothing is wrong with you. "

Also, that article was already insane by this point."
"&gt;  I'm all for it, but I can't actually KNOW how do you identify yourself unless I get to know you, and I don't think it's fair to scream in someone's face when they call you mr. or mrs. or whatever.

None of my genderqueer friends do this. If someone does it to you, it's not because they're genderqueer. It's because they're an asshole.

Now, if they let you know how they identify once or twice and you choose to ignore it/mock it, that's a different story. But every non gender binary person I know will gently let you know their story when you get to know them, and from that point on, it shouldn't be difficult.

Note: It also helps to remember that a lot of the things you've said here have been said any number of ways about gay people. too."

"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 6 years ago. It really does mess you up. I had forgotten my family and friends, thought they were plotting against me. I even failed to recognize myself at times. It was just me fighting voices and lost in some other world for a time. 

When I came back I wasn't really the same. Even though I'm stable, I still have a great deal of difficulty with things. I can't keep a job, I can't handle stress well and I depend on people an awful lot. And I'm one of the lucky cases, as I still had/have my self awareness. I saw I was making things hard for others so I fight against the pull of my mind. 

It would be pretty hard for you staying with him like that. I've read how it wears on caretakers and I don't think you should deal with that, especially if you're young. It might sound harsh to say, but when he...we get like that, in the middle of psychosis, we're not really here anymore. And not all of us come back when it's over. 

I wouldn't blame you for leaving. But I'm sure it'd mean the world to still be involved somehow. Just making sure he takes his meds and doing things to help himself. Schizophrenia can be really lonely, and that loneliness tends to make things worse. It did for me."

The things I focused on in straight porn. 
"That according to some guy I talked to on Whisper, I could ""turn a slut into a husband.""

It still eludes me to this day. "
"Wrong pipe, muthafucka."
"Its a stereotype, I've only ever had straight male friends growing up and they do the same thing, except now, they get together and bitch about their girlfriends/wives."
I've had a chick say I grabbed her ass last week. Showed her my enormous cache of porn on my phone. Calls me a faggot. Seems about right. 
"I mean, It depends.  
If they're extremely masc it's like ""ugh no you're like a brother dis aint right""  
If they're extremely feminine it's like ""yes bitch you look cunt in that swimsuit""  
I think a good mix of the two is always perfect."
"Yeah idk if I've ever been hung up on a straight guy beyond pure sexual attraction. Sympathies for those who have to deal with this, but I really can't understand it."
"He's a very sincere person and, in the two and a half years we've been together, has never once tried to play head games with me."
"Not really, but my boyfriend does.

He comes to me, sweaty and musky, knowing exactly that I won't be able to stop him, when his pheromones will be messing with my head... (-。-∥)"
Then there's the one who claimed to be straight and you sucked it up and got over him denying and decrying publicly your interest in him and later turns out the motherfucker was a big homo in denial. Good times.
"Someone who is rude to waiters, get away from me, I've always thought it's quite telling of someone's personality etc. "
"I'm trans so my body is a funny shape -- I have narrow shoulders and wide hips. I don't have a dick either. I've never had any major issues finding dates or getting laid. Been married to the man of my dreams for 5 years. He *loves* my body.

A lot of folks ask me why I don't have surgery to get a dick, why I don't work out to bulk up so that my shoulders and arms are bigger and my hips aren't as obvious, why I don't do this or that. Doesn't seem to occur to anyone that I'm perfectly happy with my body the way it is. Sure I've been rejected plenty of times, but everybody gets rejected, that's just life. Can't please everyone. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Edit: I have been shamed/mocked for being trans though but idgaf. Can't be bothered with that shit, life's too short."
"At a party, senior year of high school, it was a huge rager. Saw this guy from across the room, he said lipped somethig to me so I walked over there. He complimented my tattoo, and asked if I wanted to see his. It was on his abs and his chest, he asked if I wanted to feel it. I think I knew he was into me, I was just too shocked to do anything about it "
"Being a Trump supporter, thinking Milo is cool, being anti-trans. All deal breakers."
I don't think you need to explain that to someone who is trans and gay.
I love that guys butts are like more big and beefy 
I had a hard time finding a gay character I resonate with.
"I don't care.

I used to, but then I realized that feminine guys weren't *making* me uncomfortable. I felt uncomfortable around them because I wasn't fully comfortable with being gay, myself. I got over it.

Boning one of the hottest men alive, who was wearing culottes and body glitter when I met him, also helped."
If that's true then this is extremely awkward. (･ิ_･ิ)
That's actually really sweet
Being bisexual means I get to appreciate both the female and male ass variety. :D

"Tell him that your friendship with him has opened your mind, and you now are pretty sure you're bisexual, and would definitely consider dating guys.  Don't tell him you have feelings for him.  If he has secretly harbored feelings for you, he may then bring that up, or over time give off the vibe he is interested in more than just bring great buds.  Be aware though that dating him may risk everything if things don't work well."
Every age is welcome but youll have to just filter out a lot of the garbage that teens post over and over.

"I saw a horrifying video once, it fucking traumatized me and I thought about reporting it to the police or something because it was truly disgusting. The video was about a guy, he was in his bed and then suddenly he started touching...a woman. Good god."
10 minutes is a long time
Not nearly enough talk about dick.
"&gt;being alone and ending up as one of those creepy old men who messages 18 year olds on grindr

I think you've got cause and effect backwards there buddy - those ""creepy old men"" are alone because they're still messaging 18-year-olds and being creepers."
"my thoughts exactly. he came off as super defensive and went balls deep into reaaaally bringing the point home that he is, as a matter of fact, NOT, and under NO circumstance, a hetero, but a proud HOMO.

oh op, bless your heart."
"&gt; they should have this thrown in their faces. 

As if they'd listen. Most of those idiots would call it ""fake news"" or not reputable enough, refusing to accept it as a viable source. They also probably don't see LGBT youth as people, but as kids who are ""going through a phase"" or as ""sinners"", and as a result, they deserve what they're getting: a higher suicide rate. "
"The beauty of wearing sunglasses is that I can stare at who I want, for however long without them noticing. ;)"
"I was on holiday in my late teens with a group of friends, fairly deeply closeted, and this very well-built European gentleman was walking around in a speedo.

After about 30 seconds the closest friend hissed in my ear 'Jesus Christ, stop staring.'"
"&gt; he genuinely thought that being gay only meant you like putting things up your ass.

It's 2017. Who is this person."
"He worked at a restaurant I used to frequent. 

I know he's really only with me for the money, I'm sure once I finish paying for his college next year, he'll vanish. (I'm 33 he's 28) but I find him cute, and he's good company.  It beats being alone.  Even if he does disappear, I take solace in the fact that I gave someone an education, hopefully he does some good with it, and pays it forward someday.  "
"Living up to your name, but cheer up! Being a bottom isn't a bad thing :)"
"I'm a bottom, so I'm not really interested in butts, but when I watch tennis match and Novak Djokovic makes a squat before serve, then Holy Moly, I start dreaming about having it as a pillow..."
"I feel you so much. None of the guys in high school talked to me becase I was out. One of them called me faggot in my fucking face sometimes even in front of teachers.

You have to stop caring about them, you are alone and that's pretty much it. At least you have your bf.

If I could travel in time and give that 16-17 years old me an advice I'd told myself that it is no good to care about what people think. Specially when they are people that 2 years from then will have no impact in my life. 

Be ready to go physicall but only to defend yourself. I'm proud of you. You may be alone in that school but at least you have internet, back then this kind of groups where non existent."
"Whats the context, someone who is mentally healthy does not lash out for no reason."
No.  My boyfriend has a much better body than me.  I bring other attributes to the party.
"I understand where you are coming from, but I think you may be misinterpreting the semantics behind ""pride"". It's about making a statement about being comfortable with who you are rather than looking at being gay and black as some kind of achievement."
"*cracks speech pathologist knuckles*

Well this certainly brings me back. The phenomenon you are experiencing is called 'convergence' it is a form of social code switching where when you talk to a specific social group you adjust the way you speak so that it suits the social group and makes you sound similar to members of the group. People with migrant parents know this really well - when they talk to their parents they usually speak with an accent, but don't when speaking to friends who don't share that ethnic background. 

You can read more [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_accommodation_theory). This wiki is surprisingly in depth and accurate. "

If you identify as a Phantom Shapeshifter Wind Style Otherkin and your pronoun is the symbol that Prince used when he was TAFKAP, then fuck right off."
"This is one of the saddest, yet sweetest things I have read in a while. "
"People have their own taste in music, art, films, etc. Taste is subjective. Most clubs have stereotypical gay music because it would be hard to grind against another guy while Master of Puppets by Metallica plays in the background. "
"I didn't know I liked Sushi either until I had some. If you can only have Sushi on the down low right now, that's fine. Enjoy it. If you decide you want to have Sushi more often, do it."
"Lol, yeah, us adults are all stable and logic minded people /s"
"That doesn't happen as often, at least from what I've seen.  But I did upgrade my gym membership when I didn't need to because the guy was a stud. Felt stupid for a bit"
Preparation for anal sex.
"He did defend it.

&gt; In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men – the sort of ‘coming of age’ relationship – those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents."
Embrace the code switch 
"Sure man I mean hell i like getting my hole fingered while I'm fucking, sometimes for fun we'll have my bf riding me while he fucks me with a dildo."
"Yeah, straight people do that too. Turns out people in general are kind of shitty, not just gay people. 

Source; have many straight friends, and even my father does that on occasion. People were built to criticize other people, it's in our nature. "
Yep. 24th Valentine's Day spent alone.
Sitting around the house gets boring after a week. I've gotta have a goal. Something to you with your life is important.
"Ok so this happened last night to me. I was at a frat party dancing with two of my girl friends (read grinding), when another girl I know shows up. We do the whole, ""holy shit you're here"" thing and dance together, but she had also brought a guy friend. Lemme tell you, I was eye fucking him like nobody's business, but trying not to look creepy cause what if he was straight. Anywho, I continue some slightly sexual grinding on my friends and every now and then he would start grinding on me, but I was like nah, he's probably just having fun and straight. I did however grind back a little and there was no objection. Of course being dumb as fuck, I left the party without so much as asking his name. Got back to the dorm and then realized he totally wanted the D and I'm probably somewhere on the spectrum. So I did what any drunk mess would do and got his number from his girlfriend, asked if he liked dudes (he does), then asked him if wanted to get coffee or breakfast sometime (he does). Now I have no idea what to do lol"
"Saying ""I love you"" too soon. My last boyfriend wrote me a song telling me how much he loved me about a month into our relationship. The whole time he was singing it I was contemplating whether I could jump out the window to escape and still survive. "
Most guys are pretty versatile. But it's not the business of anyone who's not about to be intimate with you. Much less a girl who finds it funny to embarrass and demean you like that. 
"Drifting through the wind,
Wanting to start again.

Do you ever feel?"
"If you're cool, it doesn't matter. ;)"
"Cold as steel, would bang/date 👌"
"If they just don't respond, I stop messaging them. If they say ""not interested"" in a polite way, I say ""thanks for letting me know"" and move on. I haven't encountered a nasty rejection yet."

Good journalism comes out of all kinds of publications these days. A Rolling Stone article got a four star general fired.
"It matters a lot to me. If I smell it or see it, it's hard to keep it up. "
Just talk to him and explain your point of view. I think he just doing it 'cause you're not reacting enough and he thinks it's cool for you.
"As long as you say ""no homo"" after you're good."
Conservatives don't care whether gay people live or die. They wouldn't care. 
Sometimes I don't mind. I will admit I worry because I'm at a point of my life where it will become more difficult to find a steady boyfriend and yet I'm constantly questioning myself over my personal worth as well as fears I might have. 
"No, use it as motivation to improve your own."
"I'm slowly exposing him to language, food, festivals, stories, history etc. 

Good thing I make a mean Jewish chicken soup with matzah balls (Jewish dumplings.)

And yes, before anybody asks, he has put my matzah balls in his mouth, and yes, he does like my Jewish dumplings. ;)"

"Seeing a guy in public that's attractive, but the odds are he's straight. "
No it wasn't fucking different.  Anyone with half a brain saw all of this coming.
"I don't know how anyone can look up to this guy. He's trying to make political messages through trolling and hurting people, somehow in an effort to make them ""tougher"", or simply because he knows he can get away with it and enjoys hurting them.

Just be glad you caught yourself.
How invisible he is. 
"In high school I had a little crush on a friend of mine. He was a boxer with a nice ripped body. The guy was a total sweetheart too. All of my girlfriends were into him. Anyway, the guy was nice enough to give me a ride to one of our school dances. Afterward, the two of us went cruising and hit up a few house parties, nothing major. At the end of the night, we were hanging out in his car. At first the conversation was mundane, but then we started talking about sex stuff. He was complaining that he hadn't had sex in a while and really wanted a blowjob. Which was so surprising, because the dude was hot and had a line of girls waiting to drop their panties for him. It was funny, because he casually spread his legs in his seat, gave a few head nods and repeated that he really wished he had a blowjob right now. I just sat there in awkward silence, my eyes bulging out of my head, unsure of what to do. Of course, I wanted to dive headfirst and bury my face in his crotch. But I was hesitant because I was in the closet at the time, and most importantly I didn't want to ruin our friendship if things got weird. After a bit more nervous silence and laughter, he quickly changed the subject and drove me home. I'm sure we both had massive blue balls that night, ha ha."
Pro tip for you: put your bottoms in missionary and go to town. You will definitely have fans. 
"Our experiences may not be similar, but our situations with regard to discrimination and hostility *are* very similar, though. Homophobia and transphobia are both rooted in a fear of the breakdown of traditional gender roles. In both cases, we challenge the idea of gender essentialism that upholds a social structure/order. Both gay and trans people demonstrate that gendered traits aren't as ""hard-wired"" as they'd have us believe, and that it's not as straightforward as relationships being based on a ""masculine/feminine,"" = ""male/female"" = ""active/passive"" dichotomy.

Also, homophobes/transphobes don't make much of a distinction between gay and trans. They think gay men are more feminine for fucking men, and they think trans women are ""really"" just gay men. "
Maybe he likes to be told that he's great!
"So wait...he WAS supportive of you and helped you out through bad times and you guys have always been close, but you're still mad he chose not to share something so personal? And his reason was that people would think poorly of both of you, so he technically was STILL just trying to protecting you (and himself) by not coming out?

Chill out bro. "
"&gt;I thought it might emasculate me
&gt;&gt;I love you muffin

oh okay"
Lmao that's what we said about Trump
"Open relationships. If you wanna hook up with several guys, that's dandy, but I still don't get it in the context of a relationship. Like you can sleep around when you're single and it's perfectly fine, but the moment you're accountable to another person you should be with that person. I know it sounds old fashioned, but I don't really understand them. I respect people who have them though, they're just not my thing. "
"He was not a smart boy and he really wanted to please me. 

Apparently he did wonder why my cum tasted so metallic. "
