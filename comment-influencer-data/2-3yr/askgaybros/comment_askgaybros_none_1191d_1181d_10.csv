bad idea. wait until the temp gig is over. 
"In my last year of University, I met a guy. He was the friend of a girl that moved into a house I shared with some mates. He was bold, confident, loud, stunning, and SUPER masculine, and everyone said he was a bit of a player and all the ladies loved him. 

sidebar: I was out, and openly gay, and had been single for about 6 months at this point. 

We all hung out as a big group and I noticed that he started to come along to the bar or to house parties with ever increasing frequency. We talked a few times, but nothing that I would consider a real conversation.  

One day he came over and found me on the porch reading. I assumed that he was there to visit Val, the girl that he knew with whom I lived, and I said, ""Oh sorry, Val's not here, she'll be back from class in an hour."" To which point he said, ""Oh. I actually came to see you, I need help with an assignment and I hear you're pretty good with math."" 

I was surprised that he knew that much about me, but whatever a cute guy needed homework help...I'm down! So I tutored him three times and at the end of the third session he asked if I wanted to grab a beer, his treat for all the free tutoring. 

We went to the bar across the road from my house, we got trashed and he came back to my place. In our house, no one hung out in the living room (seeing as our student furniture consisted of a mismatched two person couch with a missing cushion and a TV from 1984). 

He came back to my room and sat on the bed, I sat by the computer and started playing some music. He came up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder and just sort of started massaging it. I was kinda confused since this ultra macho dude was just feelin up my shoulder, but having played with many straight boys, I just kind of let it happen. 

One thing led to another, sex happened that night, then every single night that week. By the end of the week he confessed to me that he had never been with a guy but found himself strangely drawn to me by the second time he met me and knew that he wanted something to happen. I figured that was his way of saying, ""welp it's been a great week, but my dicks bored and I'm off to the next conquest."" 

But it wasn't. We continued to sleep together every night, and he had no shame about it, and obviously me being an out gay kid, had no problem with it either 

People started to think of us as really close, but none of our friends ever asked us anything about it. About four months in, the school year was drawing to a close and I was about to move out and back to my hometown. The idea of leaving the guy that I had started to fall in love with was crushing. He hated the idea to. 

So, we decided to do what we could to save the relationship. He told everyone about us by just kissing me in front of my friends at a house party. It's funny because we had spent so much time together, and I'm SURE one of the 7 other people that shared the house with me definitely heard him and I going at it, that no one was even that surprised. 

That was 9 years ago. We got married 5 years ago and welcomed our lovely son into our lives just over a year ago. 

The point of that rambling story is to tell you: don't worry about labels, if you really like the guy then have a discussion about it and let him know. Your feelings are just going to get stronger and you really don't want to fall in love and have him think that it's just a fun ride. It's an uncomfortable conversation but you have to do it. The reward may literally change your life. 

It certainly changed mine

"I try to take a nuanced view on Islam. I'm familiar with the religion, its texts, and its history. 

One of the most negative views on Islam I've received was not from some US right-winger, but from a gay man I dated from Jordan. He can't go back to visit his family there because they would probably kill him. He described the religion he was brought up believing as ""the most fucked-up religion in the world."" 

It's not racist or hateful to be cognizant of major cultural differences on important matters such as basic human rights. On that subject, the 18th century European concept of human rights that developed from the constitutional tradition in Europe doesn't really exist in Islam, and that has real consequences in how both formal and informal social policies are created and applied. 

Do I hate Muslims? No. Would I be uneasy about Islam gaining a greater foothold in the United States? Yes. My feeling is that we've spent a long time getting out from under the heel of conservative Christianity, and that is still an ongoing battle. I don't like the idea of adding another front to that battle against a younger religion that hasn't yet been as moderated by secular values. "
Are you serious? Absolutely not. I can't think of a more stupid decision. 
"I don't think gun owners are insane, crazy, stupid whatever.  However, I also wouldn't want to live with a firearm in my home.  Period.  That's my choice.  And while I don't think the desire to own a gun is unreasonable, I also don't think the desire to be away from guns is unreasonable, immature, dramatic or ignorant."
"Stop thinking with your Dick. 

Want to end your temp job? That is a wonderful way to do it.

DO NOT EVER MIX ... EVER... WORK AND RELATIONSHIPS.

DO NOT SHIT WHERE YOU EAT."
"No, we don't hate **you.** We hate the ideology many of you seem to have. "
Yes. 
"I believe it is acceptable to hate someone for choosing a belief system that hates me for how I was born. 

I did not choose to be gay. You chose to be muslim."
"Yes! I was watching CNN and they brought on a local Muslim cleric, ex-Pakistani (?) President, and some lady who worked at an Islamic community center all to talk about Islam. They spent about four seconds a piece saying how awful they thought the events were, as an aside more than anything, then went to rumbling about how Islam is peaceful (lol) and that people shouldn't lash out and how hate crimes against Islam are rising. 

Last time I checked gay people have the sense to not go into mosques and shoot the place up. We don't hang you. We don't throw you off buildings or force you to convert (much like Iran forces gays to get sex changes). Why is this even being discussed? I don't care to hear about how important you are or your concerns that have no place in the sensitive subject at hand. Why don't they talk about how Islam encourages hate towards gays and ways to stem that?"
"I don't know if you intended it, but the way you write about him is so cute. You can tell you guys really love each other. :)

Congrats OP, so do you think you'll ever be ever to ""physically"" enjoy the experience? Also did he notice that he didn't physically do anything for you?"
"I have noticed this on everything from social media to news media and blogs. 

I hope this is a wake up call for people who thought gay marriage legality in the US meant that the hard work was done and we just needed to blend in and shut up. 

We're nothing more than political pawns to many people right now. The sheer amount of political posturing as a result of this is disgusting. 

Again, I hope this opens the eyes of some of the ""community"" members who felt that confident, visible, and speaking up are not important."
Check back with us in another 3 weeks bro
50 are confirmed dead :/
I looked at a guys butt once.
"What a ridiculous situation. Your boyfriend already has a boyfriend, it's time to go."
"Worst shooting in US history, if this is what their God thinks is good then I am PROUD their God considers me evil. RIP. Thinking of you guys from Sweden. "
Is it racist if I think black people kissing is disgusting? 
"A few things...

She was immensely talented... which is why she was an international star who everyone (more or less) liked / loved.

Also, many gay men have been particular fans of very strong (and strong voiced) and very stylized female celebrities (divas) like Barbra, Whitney, Madonna, Bette, etc.  And Judy Garland was certainly one of these women.

But perhaps most importantly, Judy Garland was widely believed to be a troubled woman who endured trauma and suffering during her life... but she kept making comebacks and triumphing over adversity which was inspiring.

Judy Garland's death was a precipitating event that set off the Stonewall Riots in Greenwich Village, NYC in 1969. Those riots led to the Gay Liberation Movement.... and subsequently to Gay Pride (literally).

But during her lifetime, far more than today, gay men were very closeted because they were intensely persecuted and endured huge discrimination.  

So the gay community at that time largely identified with Judy Garland's suffering, her struggle to survive, and her legendary talent...Which made her special and therefore very different from other people. In those ways, gay men found her to be inspirational.

"We get stared at all the time.  Maybe because we like to hold hands when we walk.  We're just foot-soldiers, doing our bit to normalize gay relationships."
If they stare I stare back to establish dominance. 
"Your answer to them is the right one.  It's those guys who have the problem.  Just keep on doing it like that, and ignore the bar/club trash who respond with an eff you."
I find it confusing how hating Christianity is viewed as empowering but hating Islam is bigoted. What am I missing here?
"I was hoping it was just me, but it seems all of the prayer warriors who are usually flooding Facebook have gone oddly silent. Strange."
"I finished my work out at the student rec, it was pretty late, about an hour before it closed, so the place was pretty empty.  I ran into the lockerroom to take a quick shower before going back to my dorm, while I was showering this other dude came in, I couldn't help but sneak glances since he was really muscular with a cute, boyish kinda face.  He busted me looking, smiled at me and started being a tease in the shower.  We snuck over to a blind corner and made out some, I ate his ass, he told me to meet him in the back row of lockers, so I did. We fucked around some, I ate his ass some more before fucking him on the floor and nutting his ass. "

"I was horny and my regular fuck buddy was at work, so I had this guy from Craigslist come over and fuck me. I got a text from my fuck buddy saying he's home, so 5 minutes after the Craigslist guy finished and left, I walked a block over to my fuck buddy's house and got railed again.

"
Swipe right!! They're gay and you're gay

Probably have sex with him, he's probably horny lol"

"Don't put pressure on him to talk about gay stuff, but if he does talk about gay stuff, try to treat it the same as your straight friends talking about whatever girls they are into. And keep on top of your parents to not be dicks about it. "
Anyone else pissed that Reddit is censoring the threads in r news about this?
"I don't see this as a right or wrong issue. He has every right to feel how he feels, however, especially after Orlando. I've had a few boyfriends who owned guns and it made me extremely nervous every time we talked about it or I saw it. That said, I trusted them enough to look past that fear and nervousness, but I didn't have to.

As for most of the responses in this thread, I have this to say:

Don't take comfort in absolutes."
"""In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."" - MLK. Those words are certainly hitting home now."
"This is bullshit advice. One has absolutely nothing to do with the other. You would have met this guy regardless of whether or not you kept ""looking""."
I honestly don't know. The news threads are getting locked because I guess insulting Muslims is worse than a hate crime and terrorist attack so severe that 103 people were killed or injured.
I don't think people are as masculine as they think they are.
That's the idea.  Should we hate Muslims? If course not.  But does that mean we have to accept their religious views if they include the doctrine that people like us deserve to die?  Fuck no.
"When I lived in SF there was a dude who lived maybe 2-4 blocks from me. I'd see him jogging or at the gym. He's 6' or a bit taller. I'm 5'6. One day after the gym him and I were both walking out and I couldn't help notice he was staring at my ass. So I looked at him dead in the eye (more like looked up) and told him ""dude. If you want it just say so"" he chuckled. He waited till we were both out of the gym and told me yes. My response was ""dude I'm gonna sit on your face. Now"" 

We went to his place and I shoved my sweaty jock in his mouth and I plopped my ass all over his face. A few minutes later I heard mumbling and he was squirming. I took out my jock and he was like ""dude, why'd you stop?! I *love* getting smothered by a hot bubble ass!!"" 

Needless to say, I was a dominant bottom. And I even got to top his sexy giant ass. ;) "
Why is there barely anything in Reddit about this!?!?!
"No, not irrational, I intensely dislike this too. And it's the fault of both 'sides' - the right push the xenophobic aspect while the left scream bloody murder at any mention of Islam. All it does is distort what really matters and dilutes the focus until the dead are all but forgotten :("

Make eye contact with her and keep going. Then bite it
"Another fun fact, from Wikipedia: 

&gt; In the early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service was investigating homosexuality in the Chicago area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as ""friends of Dorothy."" Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that there actually was some woman named Dorothy at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel, so they launched an enormous and futile hunt for the elusive ""Dorothy"", hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay service members.[6]

I agree.  Wait till your temp job is done.  Don't s*t where you eat.
The tops sword fight and the bottoms rub their asses against each other.
"😂 Oh how many times I thought I found the one after three weeks.  
Can't blame you op, it's better to be naive than bitter. "
Lol I'm 21 and the shit is already a blur. 
A man can't talk to his imaginary boyfriend without people trying to judge us. LOVE IS LOVE!!!!
"The problem is that half of us see Islam as an evil threat; the other half of us see Muslims as a persecuted minority. The reality is that both these statements are true. In the poisonous climate of American politics and the vicious culture wars, no one is willing to compromise on these issues. The left and the right stopped listening to each other long ago. This is how civil wars start. It's very tedious for those of us who don't care about the US and its politics. I wish this sub would just get back to normal."
This is why we march.  This is why we have Gay Pride. 
"i fucking hate the rules. but they exist. 

1. you can't respond to a text or message quicker than they last responded to you. so stupid, but if you respond instantly to a text when it took them 10 minutes, they'll assume you're clingy/desperate and lose interest. 
2. if you tell them they're cute/hot/handsome and they just say ""haha thanks"" but don't reciprocate, game over. 
3. if you're showing an interest and making an effort to learn more about him and he just gives you one-word answers ""yup. cool. New york. no. nice."" then fuck that and move on. 
4. no one is too busy to respond to someone they really like. if you're waiting a long time (like a day) just to get a response, you're not a priority, move on. 
5. if you are trying to plan a date, or had plans but he had to cancel, and he doesn't provide an alternative, or make any effort to help figure out a time to go out, move on, he obv doesn't really wanna go on the date that bad in the first place. ""sorry I can't do tonight."" ""oh ok, can you do Thursday night?"" ""nope."" - that's a no-go for me. 
6. anybody who just disappears for more than a day, doesn't even bother to tell you what's going on, don't waste your time, he obviously isn't that into you, or if he is, he's inconsiderate about it - either way, find someone else.

I'm sure there are more but that's all I can think of right now. Sorry to break it to you, dating sucks, eventually if you find someone who doesn't do any of those things, he's a real keeper.

EDIT: changed ""if you're waiting for more than three hours"" to ""if you're waiting for a long time"". three hours due to work or bad reception is okay once in a while. 24 hours, not so much."
White supremacists are piggybacking off a tragedy for gays whom they despise themselves. 
"Another fun fact, saying ""I'm friends with Dorothy"" to other people was code for ""I am a gay man"" throughout many decades in the 20th century.  This allowed gay men to identify themselves without revealing themselves due to the hostile attitude towards the LGBT community.  This all thanks to Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz -- Garland's most famous role."
"It makes me incredibly angry. Most people will trip over their own goddamn feet to pooh-pooh any of the shitty things about Islam but have no qualms detailing all of the evils of Christianity. There's a visible double standard that drives me insane - they're both awful.

I don't know why people act like religion needs to be treated with kiddie gloves, but people just don't want to have an adult conversation about how huge of a role homophobic religions play into violence against queer people. They'd rather just pretend that teaching children that god believes queer people are vile sinners who will burn in hell has nothing to do with there being people out there who think it's okay to murder innocent people in cold blood. "
"Got drunk with 4 friends. Once we were all drunk one of em mentioned ""dude I'm so horny"" and another asked *me* ""yo deviantproclivity, aren't you gay?"" I drunkenly answered yes and another dude whipped his out and said ""haha suck it ""

Ten minutes later I'm having a straight boy bukkake 

Only in college 🙄😘"
"Yeah, if you take care of yourself physically and mentally, getting older is awesome.  Even just in terms of sleazy sex with hot guys in their 20s, things are going better for me at 41 than they have in a long time.

Except for my allergies and my aching back and oh god I might need bifocals."
"Yeah. Called that one after I heard about it. ""Anti-Gay Feelings"" seems to scream ""Internalized Homophobia and self loathing"" usually for me. "
"- No, it isn't
- Just because you're gay means you can't understand any ""heteronormative concept"" (I hate these stupid words) ?"
"Are people actually doing that? 

But at the same time, I think gay people turning this into a chance to say how Muslims are all terrorists or jumping onto the Trump Train is really warping the issue. "
"The cause-and-effect doesn't work that way even if it feels that way sometimes. ""Stop looking for love because love will find you!"" is neither realistic nor useful advice. Sometimes finding a guy feels effortless and sometimes it doesn't. You got lucky."
"&gt;""Ha thanks man I appreciate that but I'm straight, I'm just here with my buddy over there.  But damn dude, you've got a nice build I bet he'd think you're pretty hot.""

&gt;""FFFFFFUUUUUUCKKKK YOOOOUUU

Ahahaha, that made me laugh so hard. Genuine kudos for being a sweetie, let me throw in a slightly different perspective. Part of the problem here, and why I have never been a fan of the ""wingman"" bullshit, is that these guys are approaching because they are attracted to YOU, not your friend. You mentioned in other comments it was a twink dominated establishment and you notice your friend is more uninhibited with his ""mannerisms"" which I assume means he is less self conscious about being effeminate when he is there. These guys all think they have hit the jackpot when they see a personal trainer with the straight dude aura in a gay bar, and they are coming over specifically because they are interested in you. 

Trying to pass them off on your twinky friend is a complete bait and switch. If they wanted to fuck him, they would go talk to him instead of you. The impression this exudes to catty drunk bitches is that you are there to be an eye candy tease and attract attention, then offload these guys on your less attractive friend because you think they will go for anyone as long as you get your foot in the door. This is why I would never take my straight friends to a gay bar, every eye and erection in the room would be on them. 

If you dont like going to the bar without a racket to run, there is something you could do that is pretty devious but could help your friend out if he is willing to play the long con. Say you are here WITH him. Suddenly everyone in the bar is wondering why hunkasaurus is so in to this guy. Can he suck a golf ball through a garden hose? Is he rich? Next week if he shows up without you and there is a crowd of regulars he will get a lot of ""where is your friend at?"" He can throw you under the bus and say you weren't good enough for him or something and be the talk of the town. If everyone wants you, and you want him, his market value goes up. If everyone wants you and you try to push them on to him, he just looks desperate and undesirable."

edit: sp"
"I dont understand why some call the now ex names here with  out knowing why this is a deal breaker for him.He ended the relationship ,he did not try to change OP and that is the mature and respectful thing  to do. I would personally not date or  live with someone that owns a gun, that is  just me. Gun culture is a very  Niche culture in the USA, and it  is hard for those who  did not grow in it to understand it. ( like me). I respect it but I do not want it  to  be part  of my life and that does not make me ignorant,Same with  OPs ex."

The most sickening thing I have seen is people trying to lessen the severity of this event.  Like its a contest to trudge up American history to determine which is going to be the champion event of ""Worst shooting's in America"""
"I've just seen the report about this on the BBC website. The police in Orlando are claiming that it was an act of ""Islamic extremism""."
"No it is not irrational. There is this big push to pretend like there isn't a problem there and Islam isn't a factor in radicalizing people. Including a hatred of gays in many cases. 

I look at what is happening to gays in lesbians in the middle east and make a comparison to what was happening to Jews, gays, and other groups in Nazi Germany. The world hasn't been vocal enough nor have we seen enough coverage of the slaughter of innocents that is occurring right now while the world seems impotent to stop it. There has been coverage of the killings of Christians, Yazidis, and others. The gay genocide issue isn't being covered enough and polls show there is little appetite for accept of gays in the Muslim community at large even in the west. 

Not all Muslims are radicals just like not all Germans were Nazis. The crime of many Germans was collaboration and being silent while atrocities were carried out. Too many Muslims maybe because of fear or believing they'll be killed too are not speaking out and standing up. We had to go to war with Germany to stop the Nazis and only in absolute defeat were we able to free the Germans who survived Nazi oppression and the war they brought. 

Islam has bloody borders, look at India, Burma, Israel, Africa, The Philippines, the former Yugoslavia, and Russia. Europe is on its way to being another battle ground added to that list. If the west accepts a sufficient number of unreformed Muslims into our societies to form a critical mass of people who don't seek to assimilate we will have brought these troubles home to our liberal western democracies. 

I lived in Iraq for 3 years and spent 6 months living with an Iraqi Federal Police Unit. I was on a military transition team so I lived, ate, slept, and fought with these men. They were Muslims and I had good relationships with them, many were great men. However many their beliefs and ideals were not compatible with our western way of life and that is just a fact.

So we in the west do need to accept that Islam as generally practiced in many places isn't compatible with how we live here. It can be and I hope it will be one day but there has to be a serious cultural reform from within to make that happen. My fear is though change will come only through more warfare and suffering. "

"Sorry to break it to you, but mainstream Muslim culture is a true anti-gay, anti-women, promotes all sorts of human violence, believes in martyrdom for the name of God, etc..

The good muslims you know, which are very very slim group fall in one of those categories:

1-Cultural/Modern muslims: Those do not take the teachings very seriously and follow just the good things in Islamic texts.

2-Normal mainstream muslims who hide their true opinions. I'd say most ""extremists"" fall into this category.

3-Reform muslims: those understand the islamic texts in a modern context, by force. Some of them are still ""extremists"".

So, 2 or 1 and a half groups (very small) are good and compatible with western values. Rest are mainstream and extremists. "
It's not wrong to be afraid. But it IS wrong to let that fear rule you. Pride is all the more important this year because of what happened. You have to overcome the fear and dance your gay butt off. 
"My Fiancé is overweight. He asks quite often how I could possibly find him attractive. And given my previous preferences sometimes I ask myself as well.




But it doesn't matter. I adore him. He is outgoing, the friendliest person you could meet, excellent with kids, thinks constantly of others, loves collecting things (especially hot wheels which I find just adorable), and he goes above and beyond to make me happy. 




But do I find him attractive and sexy? You bet your sweet gay ass I do. I can't get near him without wanting to devour him. My eyes are always on him. His little belly is just part of the package. He would be mortified if he knew how often I have thought or making love to it. 




Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder."
Perhaps you are the third wheel in this relationship.
"If you were going to have sex with him anyway, why not get paid for it?

Just don't let him know you'll do it for free now lol"
"Well, that's the thing -- I was hoping this could actually be a change for the better. It took a lot for him to share this with me and I'm hoping that by him putting that trust in me that maybe this can strengthen our relationship. Is that the wrong idea? Am I being selfish to want that?"
"Straight guys are such hypocrites when it comes to this, they'll swear up and down about how gross gay sex is but then get frisky with you when nobody is looking. There's a difference between not being attracted to it as opposed to finding it disgusting.

I remember reading a comment that men's fear lies more about them afraid of being turned on by it and I totally agree with that assessment. For many men, being gay is their worst nightmare so they will try to paint gay sex or kissing as the most horrible image ever just so they don't get that tinkly feeling."
Seeing that on a crushes profile is an absolute heartbreaker.

"I feel like a zoo animal on display. People have told us we're a cute couple, we've gotten a lot of homophobic comments, sometimes parents try to shield their kids eyes from us.

Push them harder into his nose and then have sex with him
"For my own at least, it's something in the act of masturbating and all the horny thoughts that come with it, I say I'll do.

Then after I actual cum, I think ""yea no I'm not eating this crap, fuck this is messy, shit did I just waste 30mins watching porn and masturbating, what the fuck am I doing with my life."""

You just need to find another asexual person. Anyone not identifying as such is going to have a problem eventually. "
You whore!!
"Make sure he knows you're a virgin, use a fucking condom no matter what, take things slow and use lots of lube. No, more lube than that. No, lots more. More. Even more. No, you need more than that.

Gun ownership and carrying a gun significantly increases the risk of suicide and homicide. ([1](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/) [2](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/01/111286/access-guns-increases-risk-suicide-homicide))

"Not single, taken!"
I tried it once to see what it was like. It's tasteless and slimy. It probably would have been a lot more hot if I hadn't just cum and thus instantly lost all sexual appetite.

"Not a gay dad, but I have a friend who's biological dad came out as gay after divorcing his wife. She doesn't get much hate from it, but she has told me that sometimes people will make fun of her dad, which I suppose is indirectly making fun of her. She says it doesn't happen often though, and most people are supporting."
The question was about Islam.  Your reply is what's called the fallacy of distraction.
I agree with you. I'm atheist and I wish all these people would call a spade a spade. All religious holy books justify some types of murder. It's terrible. Do away with it all. 
"Get your Gay Agenda OUT OF MY FACE!!! lol

where do you live at? Do people ever say anything negative to you?"

Nope. I have many relatives who would jump on this if it weren't for the victims sexual orientation. They must've used up all their prayers on Paris because they won't even mention that people in their own country have been murdered. 
Hardly surprising
"Hey, I'm a gay atheist of Muslim background.

&gt; No. The quran does not implicitly state homosexuality is a sin, this is up for interpretation and you can actually find openly gay sheikhs (similar to priests in Christianity) who debate this.

I think you mean *explicit*ly?  :)

This is kind of a breathtaking statement, I would be curious to see you debate this in /r/islam.   I suspect most would disagree.

Regardless of how the book is interpreted, here is some data for what actual Muslims believe in the real world.  From 2013:

97% of Egyptians polled believe society should not accept homosexuality.  
84% of Pakistani Muslims polled believe Sharia should be the law of the land.  
82% of Jordanian Muslims polled favor the death penalty for leaving Islam (although this number is only 17% in Turkey).

... and so on.

Islam is a homophobic ideology that espouses violence.  
"It's infuriating when people claim that Islam and homosexuality are compatible. They aren't and that's the end of it. No one is saying that all Muslims are murders, but Islam is just not acceptable in western society."

"People are understandably angry, but I think that given that there are LGBTQ Muslims we don't need to make members in our own community feel like the actions of one person are somehow their responsibility. 

I don't think this reaction helps anything. Turning it into an Us. VS. Them situation is what ISIS would want. "
You sound like you guys have a great relationship. That was lovely to read. 
"Not everyone feels the same way about firearms as I do, nor do I think that they *should* feel the same as me.  But personally, I would treat it the same way I treat other ideological differences in a relationship, and I know that the import of those differences will vary from person to person.  If a guy needed to have firearms in our potential shared residence, I think that would be a dealbreaker for me.  It is as important to me as shared political beliefs, desire to have kids, desire to be monogamous etc.  
  
That said, I would never say never.  Sometimes people make you look at something in a way that you never would have thought to before.  I think it's valuable to at least be open to the conversation."
"Just block him on everything. Block his texts, ignore his calls, etc. If you're not HIV+ then you have nothing to worry about from a lawsuit. If he did somehow manage to take you to court, all you'd have to do is produce a doctor's note saying you're HIV- and the judge will throw the case out."

"In general I would agree with stopping the hate. But the fact remains the fact that certain aspects of Islam culture can't exist in harmony with what we value as freedom. Shutting them out is not practical nor morally acceptable. However, modernization of religion is a painful yet crucial process, if we ever want to avoid such tragedies from happening again.

"Because, unlike heterosexuals, gay men are able to be attracted to body types that they also want to have themselves. "
"Adam Sandler and Kevin Smith playing two straight firefighters that try to get medical benefits by pretending to be a couple trying to get married. I'm not too sure if the movie was supposed to be pro marriage equality, or what would be a message against marriage equality? The type of gay men they had were over the top stereotypical. Adam Sandler movies just keep getting worse"
"Thank you! It wasn't intended but that's how I feel about him.

I don't know if I'll physically enjoy it one day. I don't expect it but anything can happen. He definitely noticed that I wasn't getting physical pleasure and that was one of the reasons he was very thankful. Actually at one point he wanted to stop since he thought I'm not getting pleasure but I asked him to keep going."
"I'm 5'2 and I prefer big brawny guys. My problem is that even if I was into other guys my size, I'd never be able to find one out of a elementary school."
"My oldest was 15 when I came out, he's 26 now. He's told me there was a few comments made but never anything beyond that, and never anything threatening.  I'm sure that my son being 6'-3"", 285lbs at 15 yo helped. 

My youngest was 5 when I came out. He's said there were some comments as well. I think there were more problems with the younger kids. Once my youngest reacued high school things seemed to be better. I think the main thing that made it better for the younest was the policy at his high school. 

Edit: I should add that we live in the Toronto area which is one of the most accepting places you will find. "

"The threat of Islam to Western Civilization *and to gays in particular* is on tragic and horrendous display in the Orlando slaughter of our gay brothers.

**This is the worst terrorist attack in the United States since 911. It was on us because we are Gay.**

It is time to admit that this kind of atrocity, just like the atrocities perpetrated by ISIS, is occurring  because these acts are **embedded** in the holy scriptures of Islam (the Koran and the Haddiths). These acts are a manifestation of devout Islam.

The willful effort to minimize or completely suppress this simple truth by the Obama Administration, the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton and the Mainstream Media is a mortal threat to the existence and survival of gay people (specifically) and to the Western World.

The political correctness of the gay community leads it to collude with those who seek to conceal these truths. This is self destructive because **we** are among the most endangered of all people by the threat of Islam. 

I fully expect to be massively downvoted for what I am saying here.
But those of you who do that are perpetuating the threat and protecting the perpetrators.

Instead, all of us should devote intense effort to changing the liberal establishment, beginning with Hillary, the Democratic Party and the Mainstream Media so that they tell us the truth and act accordingly.

I say all of this as a lifelong Democrat.

GayBros....We must insist upon the truth.

Not sure there was a moment that I realized that naked women did nothing for me. Just realized that naked men really did a lot for me and never really focused on the women in porn. 
"Was on vacation in Santa Fe, NM the summer before I started college with my boyfriend and his gay room mate couple. First day we were there, we stopped in this little coffee shop, and wound up chatting up the young man who was working behind the counter. Since it was Santa Gay, we were a little more open about PDA than usual, and he picked up on it and asked us if we were gay, too. We were picking his brain on stuff to do around town and he piped up that he was getting off in a couple of hours, we could grab lunch and he could show us the sights, to which we agreed. We got lunch, walked around downtown hitting art galleries, saw the bridge where the Russians used to meet the guy that sold them the atom bomb, went to a matinee of Jurassic Park, ate in this Mexican restaurant that used to be a train station, and finally went back to the house were were borrowing at the end of the day, where he had left his car.

My BF and I had already talked amongst ourselves and had decided that we were going to ask him if he wanted to sleep over with us and fool around, so we steered the conversation that way, only to discover that his 'Urbane Gay of Santa Fe' thing was kind of a front, and that he had just graduated from High School a few months before and had only been oral with a couple of guys. Well, there were a lot of knowing glances between us and our room mates (who were an old high school flame of mine and his affable big-dicked jock boyfriend, which I'm pretty sure had been involved with *my* boyfriend sometime a couple years before I met him) and decided to offer him a first time to remember. I think we did just about everything to that young man; I mean we railed the *fuck* out of him. Wound up having a repeat a few days later on, too. Still get tingles thinking about it."
That ass. 
Shiiiit that is...it's not right but it's not wrong. 
"I thought with my dick for all of my 20s. I can tell you this is not a good idea from experience. Mine was 2 different people that worked in the same building as me, not my boss.

I would keep it light or minimal. Just text him a day ahead confirming the time/place or any detail that could be ambiguous and just say you're looking forward to it.
"Why are people pretending that Islam is at all compatible with LGBT rights? You queens will scream all night and day about how Christians are oppressing you, and how you wish we could do away with it, but when someone from a different religion literally murders 49 people, when a culture cobdemns gays to death merely for existing, when a tenant of that religion is that you absolutely cannot be accepting, then it's time for understanding?

You people need to fucking get real."

"I'm sorry I stare, but I just think gay couples look so cute "
"I am pretty damn socially isolated, even though I consider myself a sociable, affable person. There are just a lot of interlocking factors that leave me mostly alone:

My coworkers are almost exclusively middle-aged women (I'm 27), so not much there.

I live in an apartment complex in a large city an hour or so away from my hometown. Probably 90% of my neighbors are families, and very few speak English as a first language.

Even if I were willing to brave the horrendous Bay Area traffic to visit home more, it's only my family that's around. My old friends are all getting married and having kids, or else moved away years ago.

I went to school across the country, so most college friends remain on the east coast.

Living in a Bay Area city that *isn't* San Francisco pretty much kills the gay scene, since most other gays seem willing to kill themselves working and live in a hole just so long as they can live in SF. It isn't even an option, with my salary.

The MeetUp groups seem packed with geriatric bird watching clubs and techie bullshit. I've gone to a couple gay men's social group MeetUps, and they were frankly depressing.

And in addition, people my age just seem... *empty*. Everyone just works, goes home, watches Netflix, goes to sleep, and does it all over again. People have a hard time sustaining eye contact, or holding a conversation, or making plans.

We're in a weird, postmodern stage of history. I think that young peoples' passionate (kind of cultish) support for Bernie Sanders is about more than just the rigged economy: it's about this vague but strongly felt dissatisfaction with a society socially and emotionally neutered by capitalism and technology.

I think of lines from Father John Misty's song ""Bored in the USA"": *Is this the part where I get / All I ever wanted? / Who said that? / Can I get my money back?*"
"Dude, why would anyone want to make you get a PDA? It's not the 90's. Just use your phone or get a tablet.
Dump the fucker."
"It's not only in the US, it's worldwide. Many media and politicians are refusing to acknowledge that it was an attack on sexual freedom (even in countries with same sex marriage). "
"I think it's just like you said in the title. It was just a really horrible coming out experience. You're not selfish by being true to who you are. Your parents, ideally, should love you no matter what. Your moms reaction was totally out of line, but could be somewhat expected as their generation was taught that being homosexual was a terrible mental affliction that needed treatment and therapy. You just have to try to understand where she's coming from and don't forget that you've done absolutely nothing wrong by trying to be honest with her. Hopefully with time things will work out. "

Congratulations. I'm glad you had a good experience. 
"Add Christian and Jewish gays to that list. To be fair, if you're a gay member of these religions, all you've done is ignore a few verses more than the next Christian/Jew/Muslim. "
"Is he still upset with you? If he's not then I wouldn't worry about it too much, we can all get a bit frustrated when we're...frustrated. Unless it happens again, then ask him what the frick his deal is."

"My boyfriend, my best friend, his first, and I took a week off to spend that week at my best friend's beach house in key west. On the fifth day it rained all day so we (best friend and I) just played Xbox while our boyfriends came running home from the beach. They didn't make it but we're still in their tight revealing speedos. They sat on the floor and watched us play some Fallout. 

My bf and his bf got along fast, and were giggling/whispering to each other. They ended up making out and frotting, getting naked, they 69 rimmed each other. My best bud and I looked at each other, and agreed. We all undressed and did a bf swap. I pounded his hot ass and it was hot seeing my bf take such a huge dick. We switched and fucked for nearly 4 hours. It was awesome. The next day we did it again!!"
"Armpits! I just love to sniff a man's musk and feel his hair on my lips and my nose and my tongue and my fingers. I love the way a guy's thick, bushy hairs tickle the tip of my glans! I love to massage the tender sensitive area below the armpit as well as the biceps/triceps!! I have a huge fetish for hairy pits on guys and I've licked, kissed, sucked, sniffed, massaged, petted, motorboated, and jizzed in armpits in the past. "
Enjoy it while it lasts. My imaginary boyfriend broke up with me.
"It's insane. I had to block a guy because in the middle of an argument about the Orlando shooting he said that all Black Lives Matter activists deserve the death penalty. 

Before this shooting, Donald Trump was campaigning on overturning gay marriage and meeting with the top fundamentalist Christian groups in America. Now that our own have been murdered, he's using those deaths to try and sway us. I don't think we should support someone when we're only good to him when we're dying. "
"I totally respect that and I'll be sure to talk to him about it.  We've been besties for a long time and he's kind of new to the bar scene, so he may not realize he's bringing a party pooper with him.  Also yes, I suppose twink club would the best way to describe it?  

Not even my friend's mom knows he's gay; it's hard to describe how happy it makes me to see him actually be himself and not hide his real mannerisms when we're at the bar.  Being in a room full of people who finally feel free is an amazing thing, it's like the best party on earth for just a few hours.  I would totally pretend to be gay and just tell people I already have a boyfriend to see my buddy in his element.
"
"Your parents make me angry. They are evil people who do not deserve your continued love and support. They are rejecting you; you have every right to reject them. They have completed the task of raising you, so now it's time to move on. 

You don't have to make a big deal out of it, but I think the right thing to do here is to cut them out of your life and build up a new life without them.

I don't understand why you haven't figured this out for yourself. They are abusing you, guy. Let them go."
"What you say sounds extremely familiar. I was in an abusive relationship for 2 years. TWO YEARS man. This guy cost me opportunities, jobs, separated me from my friends and family, beat me and psychollogicaly tortured me. I can get into details in IM if you want because he really put me through hell and did some seriously fucked up shit to me. One day I just decided enough was enough. I had tried so many times to push him out of my life, and he always found a way to sneak back in. These people are very manipulative, and they know how to use your feelings against you, especially if he's one of your first relationships. Don't feel ashamed of it. One day I just texted him, wished him a good life, and said I was never going to see him again. He went ballistic, and drove rushing to my house. I just got out, handed him a bag with his stuff over the window (I knew that if I got in the car he'd drive off with me against my will, as he had done many times before), and said good bye. I blocked him from everything, he had no way of contacting me. He'd call from time to time but I wouldn't answer, until he stopped. I had absolutely no contact with him and my life starting improving again. Once he texted me from a foreign number, but I didn't reply at all. And now it's over 2 years I haven't heard anything from him. I still haven't managed to rebuild my life 100%, but I'm getting there. Trust me, I talk from experience, GET AWAY from him, have zero contact, with time you'll let yourselves go. A relationship like that isn't worth it. I was fortunate enough to meet an amazing guy who taught me what love REALLY is like, and trust me, what you have now isn't it. I can't stress it enough OP, someone like that can really mess you up. You're young, don't waste your time on someone like that. Be strong, I wish you good luck, and have a happy, pshycho-free life.

EDIT: grammar"
"I sometimes jerk it, and then finish by going in the bathroom and using the door to get myself in a ball position where I'm upside down with my cock pointing at my face, then shoot in my mouth. I've also jerked it while driving before, and swallowed the cum because I didn't have any napkins in the truck.

I never thought it was that weird."
"It's strange even as a couple. My fiancé  and I had another gay couple as friends. They started looking for other ""friends"" on Grindr and now they are too busy to ever hang out. Who knew you had to fuck your friends to keep hanging out with them :("
"I'm 55, and, for me, the last 10 years have been the most fun in my life. Plus, I found true love in 2014, it's going on 2 years. Whether you're 25, 45, or 65, life is what you make it, not what someone else tells you it is."

"Pissed. Not only pissed about Orlando, but also pissed by what Orlando represents: Gay men aren't valued.  Our lives are not important.  In fact even in death it is way more important to have the story framed in a politically convenient way than to acknowledge that these men (and they were overwhelmingly men) were murdered because of their sexuality.  Because they ""transgressed.""  

I don't think this should just be a rallying cry for gay Americans, it should be a rallying cry for gays the world over.  The fact that you are born in Iraq should not mean you get hanged for having sex with another man.   Or Russia.  Or Uganda.  Or...well, you get the picture. 

So yeah, I'm pissed.  "
Finally.  I am the 1%.
"""he deserves whatever consequences he gets.""

-He's dead.  According to islamic hadith and quran, he did jihad (during ramadan), he is in the highest level of jannah.  in shia that is 7th level, in sunni there are 7 heavens but 100 degrees of standing - he is in the highest.  But ya, keep blaming us for not being accepting enough of islam, spreading ""hate"" by criticizing this awful ideology.

*if someone calls themselves a ""muslim"", I assume they believe in the quran, mohammed and sharia.  If they follow those things, they accept all the murder and hate that comes from islam.  No other way around it.  And remember none of these; quran, hadith (the words and actions of mohammed) can be changed - ever.  It is punishable by death in islam to even suggest changing them.  Don't expect massive reform from this ideology."

"No lie. I went to the San Francisco gaybros meetup and it was all ""gurl"", ""biatch"", and overdone campiness. Stuck with the SF Gamers after that."
"It's people being reactionary and ignorant. 

There are gay Muslims, and especially in this time the gay community shouldn't be making its own feel ostracized. "
"Or when someone used to put nothing at all, so you secretly knew that they were gay. Haha good times "
"&gt;Most Muslims also do not support violence of any kind, especially in America. So you're taking your anger out on one man on the entire community.

Im not even talking about if Muslims are violent or not. I'm talking about how somehow a homophobic attack is being warped into something about islamophobia.

Edit: Imagine if white people decided that the problem with the charleston shooting isnt the anti-black racism, its if white people will now look bad.
