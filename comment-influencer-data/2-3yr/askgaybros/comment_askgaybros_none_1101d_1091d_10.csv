"You know all these idiots here in /r/askgaybros who are like ""oh my God this straight guy is being nice to me oh my God does he want my D?  I bet he wants my D. That's why he's flirting with me by smiling and saying hi in the morning""?

Straight men are just as stupid and misinterpret civility as flirting the exact same way. "
"Wow, I really hope you were unconsciously sending him signals of attraction instead of him just.. attacking you with seemingly no pretense.

I'd also like to thank you for feeding the straight guy fantasies of this subreddit.

Glad you got head though. Good job."
Definitely apologize to your ex but don't expect to get anything out of it other than the satisfaction of having done the right thing. He'll likely have moved on by now.

You do realize there's also a 50% chance that things can get so awkward that the both of you don't want to be in the same room anymore right?

"Congratulations, you allowed yourself to have a genuinely intimate experience with someone you get along with well. You may have never experienced any same sex attraction in the past that you're aware of, but perhaps there was always something there and it just took *this* as the little nudge you needed. 

Sounds like you enjoyed it, and you're possibly looking forward to experiencing it again. It's cool, you don't have to label it as anything right now, just go with the flow. Welcome to the wonderful world of dude bonding, it feels different than being with women, it's almost like you don't need to talk about it- you both understand, you can separate sex from romance, but you can also enjoy them both as well.

Be sure to keep us updated on your experiences going forward, people here always like a good happy ending! "
"Watch out tho, some of them kill gays in their own countries btw "
"Honestly I can't really blame them. Normally, if a girl is nice to a guy regardless of their closeness, the dude usually takes it as a ""signal."" I don't normally mind it too much, unless the girl is too obnoxious. There's a girl I know who only started talking to me after she found out, but I was chill. I stopped talking to her after she told me she didn't support gay marriage but wasn't homophobic."
"Aww this is too cute!!! Congrats and let us know how the date goes. 

P.S. Dude is pretty smooth: ""wasn't the number I was looking for..."" I would've melted haha"
"I like all the usual trappings of being gay, but to be honest, I like it the most that I had to learn to be comfortable with who I am. I can honestly say that I'm much more aware of who I am and what I want and I am far less concerned about what people think of me. I can do me and I don't give a rat's ass if anyone approves or not. (Although I thoroughly dislike being discriminated against just for who I love.) I think that is a benefit of not fitting the mold and having to re-evaluate your place in life."
"No man. You're in an abusive relarionship. I'm sure none of the people who are tops here treat their partners like this. You deserve better.

"He's being a dick. Like, honestly, I want you to understand clearly that he is being a complete dick. What a nasty way to treat his own brother. Ofc he's coming from a straight perspective, and he's likely learned behaviour from his cunty best bros. I'm sure he still loves you just the same, but he is acting selfishly to try and vent the anger he has about the fact that a minority he used to be able to abuse unthinkingly, as a straight guy into sports, he now has to consider that you are his brother whom he loves, and you are gay, so either he has to own up to the idea that gay people can be excellent people we know and love and that therefore the homophobia he's been a part of was wrong and shameful, OR he can just treat you like a pervert and not face up to his demons. What would a teenage boy do I wonder?? 

You have two choices - one, let him know he is a twat for acting so childishly, give him the oppurtunity to apologise and if he doesn't tell your parents or your older siblings. They will understand how unacceptable this is. You should not have to deal with this, and your brother deserves the opportunity to become a better person. The other choice is to do nothing if you're not in a mental state where you can deal with the conflict, but you seem mature for a 16 year old and I have faith you will make the right choice. Im sorry this is happening. I promise you, ten years from now your brother will try to forget this completely, because he will be so, so ashamed of himself. "
"Yes.

"Men understand other men - emotionally and physically. I don't believe males truly understand females, or vice versa. "
"I don't know the right solution here, but I think, at 18, he needs to experience a very hard consequence for immediately breaking a rule that was extremely easy to follow in such an over-the-top way. If the importance of trust doesn't click in his head now, he's going to be an extremely untrustworthy person going forward.

I guess just keep talking to him about building and regaining trust. Depending on how well he learns from this, I might give him some homework and a way to regain your trust and then do a retrial in six months to a year. That could help him realize he doesn't have to be an untrustworthy person. You said he said that he understood your reasoning and that makes me feel like he already sees himself as someone who is just going to be untrustworthy and secretive. If it was my relative, I'd still want to keep working with them, but I definitely wouldn't let him stay in my house after such an immediate and stupid violation."

"Dude do not do the slow reveal/teasing Grindr thing. That is creepy and could backfire really hard. You have a few options, in order of my suggestion:

1. 'Hey man, FYI I saw you on Grindr the other day. Just so you know, I'm gay as well,' etc. etc. If he asks when you saw it, say you weren't sure how to bring it up but decided to be direct.

2. Come out to him normally soon and don't mention Grindr.

3. When you're both in the room together, act as if you just opened Grindr and noticed him on it for the first time. 'Woah, you're on Grindr too, cool'."

"Lose the ""straight acting"" thing. Real masculine mannered guys are not acting, they have always just been the way they are. Many don't hang out in or haven't had much exposure to gay society where a lot people pick up the stereotypical fem bit like it's a gay fad or something. 

I never compromise when it comes to who I am sexually attracted to and I have no desire to be in a relationship. If I don't find any of my type I simply do without until I do find my type, it usually doesn't take very long.

I just find it flattering so long as they don't push it too far. The girl who tried to pick the lock on my door to climb naked into my bed while I was sleeping... That was too far and I ended the friendship. 
But why male models?
"Maybe consider what about them isn't attractive to you. If it's because they don't act like straight guys, consider why that's considered a turn-off for you. 

The kinds of people who just happen to have feminine mannerisms is enormous, just like the facial and body types of people in a giver race are myriad. Which is why it's ridiculous to say ""I'm never attracted to feminine guys"" or ""I'm never attracted to black guys."" Painting with such a broad brush is really easily (lazily) explained as ""preference"" when it's usually based on rather unpleasant subconscious assumptions that deserve to be examined and sometimes challenged. 

EDIT: pretty hilarious to be downvoted for suggesting critical self-reflection and challenging your preconceived notions, as if that's a bad thing. That says all anyone needs to know about this sub. "

How he responds will give you your answer, so he might say me tooo...he might not..... he might say ok...  could mean he isnt out yet, and if he has a huge issue with it, he probabaly doesnt accept himself and you would wanna think about moving.

"It sounds like your nephew needs a kind of help you can't offer him. It's unlikely that he flouted your rules to intentionally hurt or disrespect you, and more likely that he did it because (a) he's a teenager and teenagers are self-centered assholes whether they mean to be or not, and (b) he has a shit home life and a history of mental issues.

It's admirable of you to want to help him, but the best thing you could probably do is encourage him to seek psychiatric help -- if he hasn't been permanently poisoned against it by his family's earlier actions.

If I were you, however, I would not let him back into my home unless and until he does find that help. If your ""less-than-legal"" lifestyle is something that a desperate, stupid teenager could use as leverage to manipulate you, be prepared for that eventuality."

I predict a predictable type/age/race/shape of guys will rise to the top, while those without such specific phenotypic privilege will be (*at best*) ignored.

Fucking guys
"lol - a recent buddy told me I ""overthink"" things during arguments.

But, he never said that about how I fucked him.

A lot of bottoms will tell you they want a pounding.  Now, I haven't fucked every single bottom, but let's say a bunch.  They're usually saying that because it's been the only way to get enough action going to that the prostate and other sensitive places get some signal.

A long time ago I only fucked deep and slow, and, more importantly, not targeting any particular spot.  Then I got a boyfriend who, sometimes, came right away hands free.  Imagine my shock the first time that one happened.

Turned out it was the same position that made that happen for him every time.  A couple months and I figured out that my dick curved up and in missionary i'd be hitting his prostate pretty directly.

So over the next few years I focused on doing that.  Tried some strange positions and saw what really made guys go crazy.

So, for a very long time I've gotten the idea (and run with it) that while delivering an actual pounding is what's wanted sometimes, most often what's really wanted is hitting those spots and keeping after them.  I'm a big guy and I target little guys.  So I can take them by the legs or whatever and move them where I want to make this happen.  That is the prime place where dominating contributes.  I can put the bottom in about the right place - but he has to help.  and I'll tell him to do that.

Not only that, but like most any other stimulating activity, to make it keep working well for a long time you have to change it up.  You first have to know to do this, and next have to be able to get the bottom to help out.  A lot.  This is the bulk of my ""talking dirty"".  I'm actually giving orders.

I've always thought that the entire point of the thing is to create as intensely pleasurable fuck for as long as possible.  If I sense that actual pounding is necessary for a particular bottom, that's what I'll do.  But it's not that common.

Since the top/bottom role system implies in some peoples minds that the top is responsible for running the show, I'm ready to do exactly that unless a guy really wants to do it a different way.  Usually the bottom is fine with me directing all the activity.  So this is usually what ends up happening.  If I'm doing this and I get the idea that the bottom is a guy who really likes giving up control, then I'll dominate.  Lots of small things can go into this, but the big ones, to me, are demanding that the bottom keep his eyes on mine, that I tell, not ask, him to change something when I want that done, and that I in at least some small way restrain his movements without doing anything painful.

It's a lot of stuff to do, and I still have the occasional minor disaster (dick pops out or I give an impossible instruction) because i'm paying attention to too many things.  And it is work.  If we're not both covered in sweat by the time it's done, something isn't right.

Bottoms who are getting the best out of all this are working too.  I'll check to see where he wants to go.  I dont' check by asking every minute - that doesn't contribute to anything good.  But if I see he's beat I'll slow down a little and maybe get my head next to his and whisper are you doing ok?

If he says yes, back to what I was doing until he eventually cums or indicates he's like a change.

Then I'll nearly always get us on our sides and go in from behind.  There's usually a bit of time spent ""fine tuning"" things so that I'm again in the best position to hit the good spots.  Once I'm pretty close to that I get an arm under him and put the other over the top and pull him in.  Not always but I'll usually turn off the aggressive stuff about now.  It's cool down time.

When it's done, the bottom knows both of us made that excellent fuck happen.  He handed over a lot of control for that, now he has it back, and nobody is the ""bitch"".

I've been asked a bunch of times once everybody feels like talking again what amounts to 'was that just lucky or can we do that every time?'.  Well, every time.

Whenever I have a vers partner or fwb and we get the bright idea to do a 3way, we invite a bottom.  Some of the time that partner is doing fuck duty I'll help out.  Some of that time I will watch and see what happens, making notes what I might want to try.

So in some cases, yeah, the guy literally does want pounding and that's that.  Not nearly always.  One guy will be different in some ways from other guys.  Great fucking requires a decent dick and a working brain, with some practice figuring out quickly what small actions a guy makes are trying to tell you so you can do the best thing next."
One of these days I might experience this. 
Top knots look dumb.
"Most of the bottoms I had sex with were the ""slower thrust, careful and with hip action"" type. That's the kind of guy I prefer, because if I'm taking my time I can take care of so many details that improve the bottom's experience. But, by talking with guys I went out with, it seems that most tops really don't take care and think that topping is just putting a dick in the ass and that's it.

I've even met tops who, proudly, announced that they always pounded their bottoms no matter what they wanted because that's the only way they found enjoyable. I even tried bottoming to a guy like that but quickly gave up because of how unskilled he was."
I'll actually start to respond to a post then delete it bc it's too much work and I forgot what the OP was about. 
"The alternative is having to moderate yourself to not offend random people. ""Oh no, we can't hold hands or kiss, there are *tourists* here.""

"Some queer theorists think marriage is by nature an archaic, oppressive, bourgeois institution that makes all involved miserable, and that the classic gay lifestyle was a positive because it transcended monogamous marriage. Gay men are or were more likely to accept poly, open, triad, and non-sexual partnerships, or just to live their lives as single men.

"Let's run this down step by step.

&gt;A genuinely straight man lives with an openly gay man for a roommate. 

Okay it's 2016, so I guess that's not too far-fetched but still not very common.

&gt;The gay roommate has supposedly NEVER made any advances or done any flirting with the straight guy, despite the implication that neither of them have been in long-term relationships while they were roommates. 

This is much more unlikely.

&gt;The gay guy, who has never made any advances, then suddenly goes from entirely platonic all the way to forcing a kiss and ultimately giving head. 

Also unlikely.

&gt;The previously 100% straight guy doesn't make a single objection to this turn of events. Even though they are both sober. 

This is extremely unlikely.

&gt;The straight guy then fully accepts what just transpired and rather than freaking out, continues to cuddle the gay guy on the couch. 

This is basically unheard of.

&gt;The straight guy then expects it to happen again and anticipates it going further, and he voices no issue with this. 

We have hit peak bullshit. **But wait there's more!**

&gt;The straight guy then tries to seek out advice. And instead of googling his problem and reading a bunch of dumb yahoo answers posts and blog articles, he instead goes to a subreddit that is so small and niche that it would only come up if you were actively trying to find it. Specifically, a subreddit that eats this kind of story up.

I'm awestruck.

"IKR, it seems like this guy didn't grow up from high school."
It's not a compliment to tell me that you didn't realize I was gay until I told you.
I would`ve creamed my spinach. 
"Yes, a single dad would be my #1 choice for a partner. I want kids and finding a single dad would take out the headache of adoption/surrogacy. "
that's fine as long as they stay there.
"Well hopefully if you ever have a son, you remember to spell Isaac correctly."
Just don't. 
"Rape fetish. A **lot** of people have some sort of BDSM/rape play fetish. As long as you don't actually get the urge to rape people, it's fine.

Edit: Could also be a power dynamic thing. You seem to get turned on by domination and either you dominating him or him dominating you. Nothing wrong with that."
"If we ban guys who let their ridiculous insecurities run away with them from posting, . . .

. . . what would be left? /r/askgaybros would dry up like a puddle of cum left on the playa after Burning Man."
"The experiment was planned to last longer, but sadly had to be cancelled after just 3 months due to the results being stupendously disappointing. There was simply no way to make the Female variable work under the relevant parameters of Life, and as such, all subsequent research into male-female relationships and sex had its funding cut. Removing the Heterogenous Gender variable significantly improved the results and I continue work under that paradigm to this day."
"Nah, I think the no fap sub is really pathetic 

More pathetic than I am

Grown men struggling and posting about not jerking off like they're some sort of survivor "

The quiet ones always end up being the nicest 
"the whole top/bottom thing is overblown. I don't know why straight people seem to obsess over figuring out which guy in a relationship fills which role.

the majority of gays are versatile to some degree or another, and some don't even engage in anal sex at all."

more like 10 min of anal play an lube...

pssht heteros :p"
"I always like soft-spoken guys. I find they are are kind, loyal, and fun to be with. They are very afraid of thunder and lightening though so it's best to keep them indoors during storms. "
"Yeah, hopefully he's cool about me not wanting to smoke anything other than his pole. 

Oh man. I did just say that."
Being able to play video games or other guy stuff with my S/O and having a best friends vibe while also being able to get dick w/e you want. 
Judging by the amount of drama posts we get here daily I'd say we have it (almost) just as bad. 
No you're not weird.
"Sounds like you were curious and you're still experimenting 

You don't have to put labels on experimentation "
"Pooped within the last **couple** days!?? I poo like once or twice a day, you clearly have a magic colon. "
Reading between the lines there definitely appeared to be signals... Or at the very minimum... A lack of stop signs. 
I used to. Then I had sex with like 300 people and now people seeing my body isn't that big of a deal. 
Tequila. Tequila will teach you how to dance.
"They aren't unfriendly to me, pretty friendly, but yeah the moment they find out, they become like ""Must be best friends!!!"""
Don't be a creep. 
Maybe they start a bunch of conversations at the same time and then go with the hottest guy that replies. 
"In my experience:

I'm awful at handling a big dick, and yet seeing one is still a big turn-on.  I don't know why this is.  It just really turns me on."
"Someone recently told me that my English sounds more masculine than my German.

 The only folks I spoke German with for the majority of my childhood were my mother, aunt, and (female) cousin so maybe that's part of the reason.  But yeah, there's more feminine intonations in German also. No idea about slang, diva worship, and stuff like that though.
"
"double the clothes, barely any drama (easier to spot crazy men than crazy women) Mens bodies in general i love them. loads more stuff."
"It's not different from making out with a girl. Well, fewer boobs and more dick, but you get the idea. Probably the biggest difference is the dick actually - it really is fun to grind up against a guy and feel their erection against you. Necks are good - half the guys I've met LOVE it when I suck on their neck. Ears and nipples are also sensitive. 

Also, I'm copying and pasting a comment I wrote recently in another thread:

In addition to what other people have said about balancing tongue and lips, I love varying the tempo and texture. World class kissing is like a symphony: you've got different movements with their own themes and instruments going on.

You can start off slow and romantic, with very little tongue. Guys love it when it starts off tentative.

If you get into it, you can push it with more passion and movement. Push the guy into a wall, grope his chest, feel his back. Change it up a bit - kiss his neck. Nibble on his ears. Use more tongue.

Tease him a little. I love leaning on for a kiss, and then pulling back at the last moment, hovering over his lips. If it feels right, be a little romantic. Talk about how much you love his lips, how sexy you find his stubble. Look deep into his eyes and make him melt.

Let him take control too. Let him press you back and let his hands explore your body. Open your body up. Make him want every second of it.

Have extremely passionate moments. I'm talking about tongues dancing for minutes, panting, low moans, pulling their hair lightly, grabbing their shoulders.

Slow it down again in the middle. Make time stop for them as you make your lips increasingly softer. Eventually, end up at a stand still, with just your lips touching, barely moving, eyes closed and transfixed in the moment.

Get sexual: if it feels right, start unbuttoning their shirt - but slowly! Put your hands on the buttons for a minute and play with the buttons while kissing. Or if they have no buttons, lift up the shirt a little bit.

So basically, mix it up, keep it sensual, and add some tension and anticipation. Treat it like natural dancing or music, because it is an art form."
"Yes OP, he's an abusive piece of shit, there are no two ways about it. Please get out. Dom sub relationships are particularly prone to this kind of abuse, please don't let anyone talk you into doing anything you don't want to. If you submit, when you submit, how you submit, YOU decide. Not that heterosexual couples should have to abide by rules, but one of the best things about being gay is that there isn't centuries of normative pressure on how to behave in a relationship."
"Pff i cant believe you! Giving us gays a bad name... I met my boyfriend in a threesome: not your disgusting apps and bars.

"
You can be good looking and not someone's type. 
"I just don't see myself in a relationship. My personality is too dull, I'm too quiet, etc. Plus, I'm conventionally unattractive so that's a big boulder that I can't fix. I'm learning to get over it and live life."
"The term ""young professional"" makes me cringe. If you live in a metro area... It's used far too often and doesn't really mean anything."
Did I just read the plot to Sex and the City 5 : Flashback to My Cunty Twenties
I remove the hair in the middle and that's it.
"I can't stand any of those -Ayden names: Jayden, Brayden, Kayden, etc. "
"Smoking. **I don't smoke** (before the anti-smoking fanatics *eat me alive*) but watching men smoke turns me on a lot. I don't know why this is, but maybe it has something to do with the fact my Dad smoked. "
septum piercing... ugh. And baggy jeans. 
"Consider this...

Go back to his store and when you see him, chat with him about anything. (Really try to not seem nervous).. Then, after a minute or two, stop talking about that first topic and say...

(Smiling)

""You know, everytime I run into you here, we always have a great time :) there's this new movie (Super Hero title or other) that just opened.  Would you like to go see it on (give day of week) ?....
Or maybe get dinner ?""

This is just saying - I like you...Let's be friends.  But if he's gay, he may take it as you asking him on a date... Which is fine.

If he agrees to go to the movie or dinner (or whatever) then on the ""date"" you can look for clues on whether he's gay.  Or you can *mention passingly that you are gay and see how he responds.

And/or you can tell him you're gay and tell him you were hoping that he's gay too.

Or you can wait until the second date to do one of these things."

"I saw the sharing clothes thing in another thread and never even thought of that when dating a guy. I need that in my life, haha!

My favorite thing about dating a guy is that ""best friend/bro"" vibe from it, if that makes any sense. Just two guys that have fun hanging out but happen to be a little bit more than that... The post where the couple rode their motorcycles and camped out for 3.5 weeks, definitely relationship goals."
Contact lenses.
"They're not actually homophobic though, just assholes, and either way they have a right to be that way. Plus one of the hosts on the radio show they love so much has a huge love of Trans women and openly talks about his experiences with em. "

"If you are stuck in there for a year, just don't..."
"My parents found porn in my room when i was like 14. They sent me to ex gay counseling for years, i went back into the closet for a while. It fucked me up pretty bad 

Edit: And things are pretty OK now. I still have some lasting issues that can ultimately be traced back to the nonacceptance of my parents, but I've come a long way from the days of acting out and not knowing why I was so miserable. My parents have come a long way too; they've gone from combativeness to a sort of ""agree to disagree"" mentality which is better than nothing I guess. I've never openly discussed it with them but I think when I went off the deep end they started seeing how badly they had fucked me up."
"Wrestling/body contact.

Noticed it heavily when I was like 7 or 8 years old."

RIP everything else I was going to do tonight..."
"16-20 I went after the bro types. Sex was great, finding anything in common was a disaster...

20-22 went for guys who knew what they wanted and were a bit arrogant. Dated a lawyer and a wall street type. Lawyer was too into me and treated me like I was on a pedestal and would argue with everyone but me, and it didn't feel like I was treated equally. Wall street type was super arrogant, not great in bed, and saw me as arm candy. 

22-24 went for full intellect to go with my personality. He was an astrophysicist who then wanted to get into politics.  He was constantly trying to contradict me, pick flights and make it seem like I treated him as inferior in intellect. Treated me like crap and I spent shit loads of money trying to maintain a long distance relationship. Started bashing on my friends and I lost it on him.

25 I didn't know what my type was anymore. Decided to just play the field. Hooked up with a lot of college guys... then a guy hit me up. He seemed ordinary, and didn't catch my attention. He was persistent and i agreed to meet. Turned out to be one of the most interesting guys ever.

[Edit start] We had a rough start in the relationship. We had many rules that we played by, and we decided in the first month just be honest with each other [Edit end] 

He's under Chaotic-good alignment. He was fun, I could sit and listen to him talk about nothing with a smile on my face. He fed into my excitement and never shut me down for being passionate about things. He didn't have a secondary education, just a really hard working guy. Family and friends loved him and all our interests aligned. Whenever I want to do something he's the first person I want to go do it with. He became my best friend. Everyone in my family and extended family loves him. All my friends think he's a riot and his family likes me! And after 6 years, happy to say he's the one. He's now a manager of a high end retailer store and doing very well for himself.  Also engaged to me. Was going to elope, family and friends threatened me with harm if we didn't have a wedding. 

Background: upper-mid class upbringing with an aerospace degree. So it's not like I had nothing to bring to the table."
Maybe you just don't like anal 
"Probably not a mistake and probably a sign that he's bicurious or questioning or something. Maybe wait a day and then fb message him to ask if he meant to do that (it's more of a rhetorical question, but a good way to start the convo). At the very least, he didn't, and no biggie because you don't really ever see him.

I'm jealous of your luck though because I have so many straight crushes and I would jump up and down if one of them expressed interest like that in me."
"In realistic terms it means about four more lines of chat about what they do before they ask for more pics and ""so what brings you to Grindr?"""
That being gay and the process of coming to terms with that creates a level of introspection that gives you the confidence to shatter other  bullshit social expectations.
"Isn't that considered a form of homophobia? To be afraid of being thought of as gay, because they think being gay holds some perceived negative/inferior connotation to others in society."
A cheater is a piece of worthless shit regardless of any circumstance.
"You know straight people are getting nasty when they start throwing the word ""lifestyle"" I s2g I hate this word with passion especially when it comes to sexuality and things along the line"
"Yep. And being bi is as bad or worse because it's constant, from both sides, and we're just as stupid and dick-for-brained as the rest of you. "
wonder what would happen if you do creampie💀💀💀
Brush your teeth and do your prep work boyo!
"I can't blame them. I have sisters and I've seen ( and heard) how  a lot of guys can be towards them just for being nice.

"
"The most frustrating thing about having to respond to those posts is the fact that OP actually knows this, but because it's his life and his interactions we're talking about they magically becomes better than the rest of the people in the exact same situation.

All of a sudden the same advice he would give to his predicament becomes prefaced with you don't understand we were texting back and forth soo much and it was soo meaningful... unlike the rest of the gay peasants around here.

So... I like this, but for the sake of the sub we all must ignore this and continue our sacred traditions!!!!!!!"
"Mannerisms IMO are a more important attractive attribute than looks.

You can ignore the physical blemishes of people, but if you are just rubbing up with how your SO acts naturally, it's just not going to work. So no, I don't think you should compromise here. It's just going to make you unhappy."
"In the early 90s I met a guy, Tim, online (not easy to do).  We were fwb for a few times but he told me he had a partner, so we both kind of converted that to friends.  Every week I'd drive from Hialeah to Boca Raton and we'd go to a nice place for lunch, for a year or more.  He would join me going dancing at the Stud.

A few times during the lunches we would stop by his place for whatever reason.  One of those times, on the way to the car we passed a gardenia bush about 7 feet around and high, and in full bloom.  I like the smell.  I picked one, sniffed it, then gave it to Tim.

I figured he'd sniff it and discard it, but instead Tim takes it and says ""what do I do with this?""

I told him ""put it in your hair"".

He did."
"&gt;That was too far

Ya think? That's definitely trespassing and ventures into sexual assault territory. Holy shit."
"That can be its own issue. Like, no, I do not exist solely to be your New Gay Best Friend (tm). "
"You can't feel the cum, but you can feel the difference between latex and a raw dick. "
i am way more interested in the illegal shit you seem to be doing upstairs.
I assure you that most dudes will not care that your super swole arms have a couple stretch marks on them. 
"We even have our own queer language in Turkey. It is not been used by many anymore. However, it is quite fun and bitchy. Also, it is very handy to talk and warn each other in dangerous situations without others realizing.  "
"Meh. You gave him rules, he said ""go fuck yourself"" and you acted accordingly. Idk why he would waste a good opportunity for some tail."
"it's not that looks don't matter -- I wouldn't date someone I'm not attracted to, and I wouldn't want someone to date *me* if they didn't find me attractive.

but it's a bar that I set, not the end-all, be-all... assuming a guy meets that bar, the rest is on the basis of personality and chemistry. I'd much rather date an average-looking guy who I had great chemistry with than a model.

as well, what I find attractive isn't strictly confined to conventionally good-looking, matinee idol kinda guys (ie: skinny nerds, chubby bears, etc)"
"I've known many guys like that, even dated some, and I've noticed that they tend to have a lot more issues on the inside than your more average-looking guys.  They have the same insecurities that the rest of us do, but tend to compensate for it with arrogance more than others might in order to keep up their image."
"Argument over whether to get iceberg or Boston lettuce. It ended with me calling him a cunt, turns out that's a no no."
