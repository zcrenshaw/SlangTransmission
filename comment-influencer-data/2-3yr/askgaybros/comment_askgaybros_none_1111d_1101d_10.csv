"""Throwaway account. I'm gay and in love with my straight best friend who is also my neighbor. He once laughed and said, ""suck my dick"" to me when I told him that I didn't like a certain movie. The thing is, is there more to it? I feel like he really wanted me to suck his dick. I'm thinking about jeopardizing a friendship and outing myself by sexually harassing him without his permission. So basically my question is: he looked at me the other day, then I got sick 2 weeks later.. do I have and STD? Thanks Bros"""

He loves you but maybe not in that way or it hasn't occurred to him.

"Well TBH, women deal with guys hitting on them ALL the damn time everywhere they go. So I can see how their first reaction to a man being ""friendly"" is to be guarded and reserved. Once they know you're gay, then they know you're not trying to fuck them and they can lower their guard.

But there's also that group of women that want you to be their stereotypical gay best friend once they find out you're gay."

"It kinda sounds like he's pissed at you because he figured it out and you haven't talked to him about it. It sounds like he's giving you opportunities to talk to him and tell him, but he's frustrated and upset when you aren't honest or evade the question or whatever. If he had a problem with it, he probably would have distanced himself and maybe even stopped talking to you all together. Just a guess. Are you not ready to talk to him about it? "
"Alright, I'm going to say something here and you might not like it: 

**You're in a position of power over this person and you need to take a step back as to not abuse that position.** 

While I understand your romantic interest, try to view it from his perspective. If he takes the wrong turn, he might think that he has to move out. 

*""What if I say no? Will he let me still live here?""* 

*""Do I want to live with a guy who's in love with me but I don't like back? Won't that be awkward?""* 

*""I just came out to him and he instantly tries to flirt with me? I'm super inexperienced. I don't know how to deal with this.""* 

**Or**

*""I really have feelings for him but if we make it official, what will happen? I will already live with him. That's a huge commitment. I'm not ready. This would be my first boyfriend. He's older too. I live with him.""* 

I can go on about this but I hope you understand. You need to take a huge step back and consider what kind of a person you would become if he rejects you, or if he would accept you. If you truly have a concern for this person, you need to first consider THEIR best interests in mind. 

If he rejects you, will you be able to live with him still? And if not, how will you help him find another place? 

If he accepts you, will you help him find a new place or try to create boundaries since you're living in the same apartment already. "

"I'm a girl, and from observation I'd have to say some girls are so used to being hit on/harassed/only ever liked by guys just so the dude can get in her pants, it's a massive relief and joy to have a male friend who will never fall for them and likes her for who she is as a friend. I had a very beautiful friend in high school (picture Jennifer Aniston but with emerald green eyes and longer hair) and she was happy about having guy friends (cause girls were bitchy and jealous bc of her looks) but legit every single one of them fell for her and cut her off once she rejected them. So she ended up spending most of her time with a gay guy friend cause she knew he didn't have any hidden motives for hanging out with her. "

It feels intimate 
You should just tell him you want him to fuck you when he gets back sweaty and that you love his sweat

"I wish I knew.  But, as a dominant top, I'll take it without explanation.

I can tell you this.  When a guy gives me control during sex, I take full responsibility for making him very glad he did.  My pleasure, while important, becomes secondary.  Nobody in my bedroom is a ""bitch"", and if they feel badly in any way after it's done, I did it wrong.

Edit:  Was looking this over and I glossed over something important.  My pleasure doesn't really become secondary.  That would be kind of stupid.  What really happens is that once it's on, I derive my pleasure more from a bottom's feedback showing what I am doing to him and less from the raw feeling of what he's doing physically to me."

DON'T

* expect passion and enthusiasm to carry the relationship.  These fade.
* rely on your or his good humor in lieu of conversation and heart-to-heart or brain-to-brain intimacy
* expect to do everything together -- you need your time, he needs his time

To be fair to his boyfriend they  both got tested before doing bareback and both were found to be negative. Then are you still asking him to get tested? You are pretty much accusing him of cheating. Don't do bareback if you don't trust him problem solved

"I'm 4"" exact and top. Yes, it works! Thanks for your post. :) Not the hookup type anymore, but I'm upfront about my size and preferences because so many guys have dismissed me or said ""it let me down when I first saw it"".

I really do like stuff like that (hiking bores me unless I'm in an amazing location but I like mountain biking, kayaking, snowboarding, etc).

As stated above, three different dates I went on the guys admitted straight up they don't do any of that stuff and just put it in their profile because it attracts masculine guys. The fact that I ran into three people like that suggests many more do it.  "

"As a parent of a gay 18 year old, I have to say, yes we do have to 'come out' many times as well. Though it is not as difficult as it is for you (as the gay person), we (as the parent) still have to deal with the shocked looks and whispers behind our backs.

Report him to the medical board and contact a local LGBT organization to let them know this happened and how they can help you.
"The reality is that its almost definitely a nature nuture combo. Especially with more recent studies into epigenetics. That said I believe current research points to there's genes that promote a higher likelihood ie identical twins are more likely to both be gay. But that they arent always both gay so there's indication of a non genetic factor. 

That said its still one of those things where once the switch is flipped it seems to stay that way. "

Yes, you're British, but this is too fusty even for a posh 24-year old Brit. It also has a predatory feel to it, and that's coming from someone who's (also) attracted to *much* younger guys.

I LIVE for these kinds of stories, but something's definitely off here."
"Let me just say, I'm versatile and I've been topped by plenty of 5""-6"" guys and I've always found that that is generally the best size for anal, not so  small that you can't feel it, but not so big that it makes your colon fall out of your asshole. "
You don't *have* a relationship with Jared. Enjoy Chuck and see where it goes. Stop getting ahead of yourself. 
"Me and my boyfriend have almost always been condomless. During the first few times being condomless it definitely felt less slippery.

I guess I'm used to it, but it generally feels normal. Some comments here mention a ""spreading warmth"" which I would imagine is the cum, but I don't think I've ever felt any sort of warmth like that. I always try hard to feel it as he cums, to no avail. The only verification I have that he indeed came inside me is when I am showering and cleaning everything out. Sometimes immediately after sex I can feel it dripping down my leg.

I think it's something that's more hot to think about than to practice. I get more pleasure from seeing his immense enjoyment."
"If your college has a gay straight alliance, you should contact them and inform them of the situation. Also write to whatever department you think administrates the campus wi-fi networks and seek an explanation. I suspect it may be out of homophobia but there might be a possibility that the sites are blocked for some other reason instead. If the sites were blocked by mistake (a possibility) you can get them to unblock them.

If the college refuses to unblock the sites, see if you can get a data sim and modem for your laptop. If your mobile phone network has unlimited data you can turn your phone into a wifi hotspot for your laptop or tablet. If your network blocks porn sites go to their nearest store and ask them if they can remove the parental controls."

"I'll add mine:

My buddy pretty much lives on Tinder. Chats up women all the time, gets maybe one or two dirty pics a month, scores from it about once or twice a month, and is proud of it. If I showed him Grindr and how easy it was to get laid with dudes his head would explode."
"If he's equating homosexuality with moral injury and equating watching poem to depression, you are not overreacting. Gay and bisexual people do tend to have higher suicide rates, but it comes more from persecution and fear of rejection than from something innately wrong with them, so this should not be lumped into a ""moral injury"" category. Actually, with morals being so personal and subjective, I'm not sure it's a valid category. This and the lien thing make this person sound unsuited to be instructing such a training. If you can do so without suffering any repercussions, by all means file a complaint"

"You need to turn to your family. They were there for you at one point and if they're all you have, TURN TO THEM. Don't ostracize yourself further. Do a speech to text, so you don't have to type the shit, and tell them you need their help. Don't put yourself through this alone. **Fucking nobody** deserves that."
"May I stick my hard throbbing dick in your tight hole, *please.*"

She just *chooses* to be dumb as a doornail.
"Not black, but Asian. If a guy rejects me because I'm Asian I just let it go. After all, what's the point in getting down about it when it's clear we weren't gonna work out anyway? Took me many years to get to that point though."
Ghost him if you want to save yourself from one giant cluster fuck of a situation. Do it if you're looking for a lot of change real fucking quick like. Though if I were gonna do it. I would say meet someplace nearby and see what his excuse is for leaving. Make it at the nearby gas station or something. Approach him from behind and say his email or user name. (Never been on Craig's list) the reaction would be priceless to say the least.
The peeing thing is semi-normal for me. The dick ass way he was forcing himself when you clearly asked him not to is not normal. Fuck that guy. Wait...dont fuck that guy. Stop fucking thay guy. He's no good. 
"You shouldn't do anything you don't want to. That being said, weed is less of a big deal then you think it is. 

What are your concerns with it?"
"I'll give a serious answer -- the annoyance you are experiencing usually comes in waves.  Yes, /r/askgaybros is annoying when you get the ""I'm in love with my straight friend and my situation is unique than everybody else"" or the &lt;insert problem where the obvious solution is communication&gt; questions for the 432nd time but I do try to give more serious answers and thoughtful responses to questions for the off chance that the question is legit.  I've never been good with coming off as witty (sarcastic or not) so I play to my strengths on critical thinking.  I think regardless of the annoyance of the questions being asked, I do think that there's at least one person who benefits on the more serious answers towards ""stupider"" questions than making jokes about ""daddy issues"", using sarcasm as a tool, or some other useless gay term that I don't care or desire to learn about.


Also, keep in mind that once in a while a good question or situation does come up where it makes people think, challenge their paradigm, and hopefully develop critical and concrete thoughts on the subject at hand and I do welcome those with open arms.

Eh, that's my two cents.

"53 here.  Not dating; not looking to date, marry, have kids, etc.  Those are all things I realized (at various times, not all at once) I wouldn't find happiness in.  Career is good, I like my house.  I'm definitely content.

Right now I'm at the place where I'm thinking in specific terms about what I want to do when I retire in another 13-15 years and planning how to make those plans happen.  It's a pleasant time of life that way: I don't feel tired of my career yet and retirement is still a way off, but it's also close enough that I like imagining it in concrete terms.       "

"Unfortunately it's a pretty prevalent thought process. This notion that ""the top takes what he wants"" and ""the bottom takes what he's given,"" or that the top's pleasure is inherently more important than the bottom's comfort, are also things that's been idealized to a degree in the gay scene and through porn and with bottom-shame. If it's done as kink it's fine but I don't think it's healthy at all for that to be the ""default"" notion."
"Yes exactly - most of my female friends were friends with me before I came out but I still think it applies (I was, as you can imagine a closted gay teenager would be, a 'nonthreatening' man).

When I hear about the stuff they go through constantly with men I do get why a gay man gives them some sort of comfort - the work colleagues who have got drunk at a work event and tried to follow them home, the groping on public transport, the friends from school who tried it on with them when they were drunk and sharing the same bed even after they had expressly said no. A straight guy friend of mine (well no longer a friend) I found out raped two of our close female friends. Women get a lot of shit from men.

Are all men like that? Of course not, most people are decent - but women have to be on the lookout for it so it is obviously a huge relief when a man reveals he is highly unlikely to behave that way because he is gay.

People need to get off their fucking high horses; YES fag hags are annoying. But feeling closer to or more comfortable with gay men because we have one massive thing in common (we are attracted to men and not women) is completely understandable, it doesn't make them a fag hag.

I can't help but feeling some of this vitriol comes from men who feel insecure about their masculinity because these women treat them differently to other men. Newsflash guys, you *are* different to other men in at least one way - you dont want to fuck women.

He got angry because you wanted him to take an HIV test. Something every sexually active person should be doing a couple (or more) times a year for their own protection and their partners' protection. Why did you wanting to get tested make him angry? 
"No, I love this. Thank you very much. It's hard to consider all angles when I'm overwhelmed by emotions.

Only thing I can say is, maybe you should try hanging with black people because all the people around me are black, successful, beautiful and educated. If anything I feel empowered... To constantly climb. To say you wish you were white, speaks volumes about your self esteem and those around you. 

And on the subject of porn....I'm somewhat the opposite. White on white, or white/minoritiy porn doesn't do much for my boner. I wouldn't call it disgusting as you put it. But I get it, you have a preference but hating who you are won't make white men want you more. That's just my take on it. 

I grew up as the ""different"" black kid. Smart, perfect grades, well spoken, all the kids asked me ""why do you talk like a white person""... I was raised this way. I get it, You aren't alone. There many many many of us educated young, black men out here. "

Every guy wants to be what they wanna fuck. 
Lick him. Lick his damp chest and sniff his pungent pits. 
Your insecurity is going to destroy your relationship. 
"a person with hiv fingered my butthole, do I have aids now? "
Tony will be fine. He is far better off without OP in his life and he'll soon come to realize that. I just hope he's smart enough not to take OP back when he comes crawling back.
"I (black dude) experience quite a bit of the objectification thing, I guess. The messages I get on apps are pretty damn disgusting, and I get a few people into raceplay and domination stuff pretty often. I just block them and move on. I don't really get any of it in real life though, beyond the ""I really like black guys"" comments in a bar. I just smile and move on.

As far as racism goes, I see people that are simply not interested in dating black guys for whatever reason. I just regard it as a preference and move on, no skin off my back. I've got my preferences too, so I feel like I'd be a hypocrite if I got mad at someone else for liking or not liking something."
Do they approach you without the bracelet?
"It is actually the other way around for me, I can only stand a FEW songs with male singers.

Female singers though, I pretty much love all of them. It makes me think, people say ""Female-Fronted"" is not a genre and saying it is is sexist, but.... that is sort of how my taste in music works!"
"We're sluts and like to fuck people we find attractive. We also find it hot watching each other have sex with other people! 

We're in a relationship because we love going to the beach together or doing romantic dinners or sitting and watching bad movies on a rainy day. 

It works for us and its been a great relationship! "
"You either don't talk about shit you know you're going to pointlessly argue over, or you just have a lot of angry sex."
"Dogs. Dog are so cute. I'm smiling just thinking about them now.

"I've definitely become jaded. I've sorta just come to terms with low expectations, which has actually kinda made me more awkward when interacting with guys that I find attractive. 
I consider myself way out of their league, so I dont get my hopes up. That said, I check guys out all the time, I just don't linger cause I know nothing's gonna come of it.

Such is life though, ya deal with the cards you're dealt ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "

I can't imagine why people downvote your posts."

Oh my God LOL "
"Ignore it and move on. Just imagine how awkward it all gets if you do reply to him, what with the girlfriend and you all living together..."
"Yeah it's happened. The night the guy became my first boyfriend. We were out at our spot where we went to hang out, share a few beers and watch the stars while laying on the hood of his car. He reached over and held my hand for awhile. I didn't stop him, in fact I welcomed it. He was smiling like a fool the whole time. Then I sat up to reach for another warm ass nasty natural ice. And he did too. He wouldn't make eye contact with me, but I could tell he wanted to say something.

After handing him another warm one and prodding him he said ""you wouldn't wanna be my boyfriend would you?"" 
I stared straight at him and he shrunk and turned away from me.
I said, ""would you like to be mine?""
He turned and looked at me, the moon lit up his face and I could see his eyes wide and nervous. Like a deer in the headlights.
""Yes""
""Ok""
He hugged me harder than I've ever been hugged in my life, and we kissed. It felt like seconds but it was definitely longer than that. Until sunrise we lay there on the hood of his car entwined in each others arms making out.

It's the single best memory I have to this day. The only memory that keeps me looking and trying most days in fact. If it weren't for him, I don't think I ever would have come to terms with my sexuality. Being bisexual I probably would have just found a girl to knock up and later told any gay people I met that they had a choice in their sexuality simply because I made one. It's ironic how we let our experiences define how others should feel, think, or behave. I thinks that's why so many people say gay men have a choice to be gay. Because they made a choice at some point themselves to deny their own sexuality and live a lie, or settle for what's considered normal or morally right. "
"In high school I asked a girl to go skiing with me. We got on the ski lift, which took about 5min to get to the top. Instead of waiting until we were close to the top, I asked her right after we got on if she wanted to go out with me... This of course, was me asking a girl out to use as a beard, I wasn't attracted to her, but she was really good looking. In any case, she said no. It was a very awkward and quiet ride to the top after that, fortunately since she was just going to be my beard, I wasn't exactly heartbroken, I just didn't know what to say after that.


A few days later she agreed to go out with me, and so we ""dated"" for a few months. This consisted of hanging out or going out to eat, I was really thankful that she didn't try to do anything sexual.


A few years later I found out she came out as a lesbian, so it turns out we were both closeted and using each other as a cover. So much for gays and lesbians not getting along..."
28 days after test is 99.9% accurate at that stage. If you don't trust the person don't have bb sex with them. Regular testing won't help that
"While your boyfriend does seem to have some mood / anger issues to work out, I don't think you're coming at it from a good angle either.

&gt;""You should hold my hand more""

&gt;pleading and begging for compliments

I don't know how else to put this, but you sound emotionally high maintenance and like you're trying to impose this style of 'love' on your boyfriend. You acknowledged this in your post, but then brush it aside because... he doesn't give you gifts? Do you favours? Little bit reductive, no?

And he's allowed to be low energy / irritable. His moods aren't there to suit your needs. I understand it can be hard to be around someone in that mood but... it's his right to feel tired after a day of work. Or have a low mood period. Or have multiple low recurring low periods. These things happen. They're not good, and he should look into seeing a counsellor if they persist, but it's still his right. If you can't take it, then maybe don't visit him on weekdays and talk to him about it (in a non-accusatory way, mind you).  

That's not to say he should take it out on you, or he should yell at you. He obviously doesn't know how to express his mood appropriately, and that's something you _don't_ have to tolerate. But still. Relationships aren't 100% happy rom-com bullshit, people have issues and being in a relationship requires you deal with them. 

All in all: you don't seem like a good match. Some things are his fault (the yelling), other things are nobody's fault. If you need validation and a 'full love tank', then you might have better luck elsewhere. "
"Yes, probably."
"Stranger Things. If you're an 80's/90's kid, you'll definitely love this show!"
"There's too much detail, frankly it reads like a story and not like someone retelling events."
This is why people have problems with accepting people's genders because it often gets so fucking ridiculous. Lots of Tumblr teenagers just make up pronouns they want to be called so they came be different from their other friends who have their own unique pronouns.
"You told him. He apologized and continues to do the behavior that you said bothers you. Tell him again, and start thinking about whether it's worth being with someone who apologizes but keeps doing the same shit. 

I think it'd be different if he cuddled all his friends. It's not unreasonable to read something in to him cuddling with just the one person but nobody else. "
"Nothing but this. 


IT'S RUDE OF THEM TO BE SO NASTY IN THE FIRST PLACE


Edit: This is actual, sound advice. If you wanna downvote because you think people should accept your greasy, nasty self, don't even think about stepping outside your room. Society has standards for a reason. "
"I find I enjoy the cuddling more than the sex.  Sure I wouldn't give up the sex but I can accomplish that alone a lot of the times, good cuddling always needs a partner"
"Well if it's a really small town, I'd just hollar for Gus. Bigger towns I may try a phonebook. Can't be too many people with the name of Gus these days. Augustine I think gets shortened sometimes too... So may be best to look for that name when searching the phone book. 

Edit: typos. "
"Give them time to let it sink in. Being that they're heterosexual and grew up in a predominantly heteronormative era (more than now), they probably weren't expecting their son to be gay. Should they be okay with it in an ideal world? Yeah, but on the bright side they told you that they support you upfront. That means that whatever concerns that they may have they didn't want to voice to you because they love you. Just give them the time they deserve to let the news sink in a bit.

Its definitely upsetting to hear it, but I think you ought to take comfort in the fact that they were supportive and comforting towards you from the beginning. That's a wonderful thing to have as a basis to go off of."
"For me, I have to see the guy before his cock really makes a difference. If the guy is good looking and has a nice penis then that's definitely a turn on. If some random guy sends me a dick pic, that's not a turn on for me. "
"Yeah, definitely more or less a guy thing in general, not orientation related. He might not feel comfortable getting all soft around you- not your fault, it's just sort of ingrained in a lot of guys that have had to put up a masculine front for most of their lives. He may not even realize he's doing it. I would suggest talking about it with him and letting him know how you actually feel, don't dance around it like you're going to hurt his feelings but also don't turn it into a blame game.... After you talk he may just become more aware of it. Some of it though you may just have to adjust to when it comes to dating guys- especially if you're into ""manly"" dudes, don't expect the same level of emotional openness as a girl will give you off the bat, it's gonna take more bonding like it would with any male friends you have before either of you necessarily feels that comfortable. "
"1. Ask if they're clean
2. Kiss around and see if it smells
3. Suggest you both take a shower before you do anything"
"This might be my always-been-single, insecure ass talking, but that's fucked up. This is the **exact** thing I dread happening to me and is partly why I've never put myself out there. You could do everything right in a relationship and it doesn't matter for fuck all."
So go to the gay bars and don't drink.
"Glad you had fun. &lt;3 Fuck your ex, that guy he went to will 100% cheat on him again!"
"At first, I thought it was platitudinous bullshit. But the most critical part was at the end and made it meaningful...

""it’s your job to look for something cool in everyone you meet; it’s not their job to show you.""

""If all of the people you pursue give you a mild response, or outright rejections, then it’s time to focus on improving yourself. Ask yourself, what is it about yourself that would inspire others to say “Fuck Yes” about you? If the answer is not obvious, then you get to work. Build yourself into a person others would say “Fuck Yes” to.""

**It's like grandma used to say**, ""If you meet an asshole once a day, that's just life. But if everyone you meet all day is an asshole, chances are that *it's you* who's the asshole."""
"I sort of always knew, but it took years for me to admit it to myself and work up the courage to *ahem* try to act on it. I'm still not completely out, only my few closest friends and one sibling know."
"Just going to point out, the fact that you tested negative doesn't mean he didn't do anything. Cheating doesn't automatically mean you get HIV."
"That HAS to be the explanation. OP, he knows, and he isn't happy you're hiding it from him. Friends don't keep secrets. Yeah, it's a bit different from our perspective -- fear of rejection, etc. -- but *he doesn't have that perspective;* he only sees that you've kept something from him. And that probably hurts him. (Yes, straight guys actually can get their feelings hurt.)

Be a better friend and come out to him. If this is all wrong (&lt;1% chance) and he recoils, you won't have lost an *actual* friend, just streamlined your list."
I see you've studied statisdicks.
"If we're sitting at a table together, I like to kind of pin one of his feet to the ground with mine. Nice combination of flirty and aggressive!"
"&gt;I had a lot of mental hurdles in regards to him and his past I have mostly gotten over

It sounds like there's an imbalance in the relationship, but on your side of thing. It sounds like you really haven't gotten over the ""hurdles"" of his past if they still affect you like this. ""Getting over"" means they no longer affect you, not that they don't affect you if they're not brought up.

If you can't actually get over your hangups you're going to be using his past as leverage to favor you, either on purpose of subconsciously."
"No. Tops are needed in the gay community.

&gt; But here's the problem: as soon as say that I'm a top guys expect me to have a bigxxxl cock, some have ever expressed their disappointment.

Fuck them and move on. Gay men find all sorts of reasons to not like someone. If it's not that it's something else. 
"
"It can be a problem, but mostly be aware that there are guys that are only going to be interested in you because you look like a kid and aren't going to want to stick around once you ""mature"". If he's constantly talking about how young you look in a ""That's so hot!"" rather than a teasing manner, then it's a red flag."
