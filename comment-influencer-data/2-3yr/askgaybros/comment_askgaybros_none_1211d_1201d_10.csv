"You know those intro videos where the guy just jerks off in awkward silence...

I've been in that porno at least once a day. "
"As a guy almost in his 40's:
Get out.  Do stuff.  Turn off the video games, get off reddit and do stuff with real live people.  Take a hike, learn a language, take a class.   Learn something that will amaze your future partners (body massage?) 
If you're fit, stay fit.  If you're not fit, work on it.  Learn to cook and eat healthy.

Probably the most important thing would be to learn to be comfortable alone.  Not to be negative, but if you're not comfortable single, then all sorts of guys that are no good for you start to look ok.   It's a bad path to walk.  If you're ok with being single, and ok in your own head, then the list of requirements to date starts to grow, and now it only fits someone you can be happy with."
"&gt; I can't ever determine whether he tried to take advantage of me while I was in a vulnerable state or he was genuinly empathic and thought that that would be an appropiate way to comfort me. 

The first one. Definitely the first one."
"I literally had someone say ""I can make a detour on my way home and crash in yours"". 

I was like ""But that's so out of your way, makes no sense""

"Stunning blonde American exchange student invited me to his host family's house after an event. Asked him: ""So, tell me about yourself.""

He said: ""I've got a very big dick. I'll show you, if you like.""

I blushed and said ""No, that's OK.""

Still kicking myself."
It's a shame that has to be said 
"Today, I was sleeping when somebody knocked on our door. I immediately jumped out of bed, not bothering to put on a shirt, and answered the door. It was our postman. The postie was initially shocked but eventually he did give me his package and placed it in my hands. The end. "
"18 and 24 are close enough in age but a world away in outlook and life experience. While legally an adult, he's still mentally a child (and won't fully grow until he can support himself and gain the experience that comes with that). 

Honestly, I would not pursue this relationship. Being in love with someone is not reason enough when they don't reciprocate. 

I'm not saying he doesn't have feelings for you. But he depends on you entirely, yet can't respect your most basic wishes (much less see that you're not interested in an open relationship and put your happiness first.) That's not the behavior of someone in love.

$.02 "

Obviously my latest straight crush.
"One other thing - the idea that 'gay' is somehow automatically more adult.

The idea that a same sex kiss is 'obscene' in public or that a character in a children's show can't be gay because it's an adult topic (when you have straight characters in them all the time - how is that any less 'adult')  The reason it's so annoying is that it has *ZERO* logic to it, to the point that it's not even possible to try to defend, but for some reason it's widespread - even among sensible people... even some gay people just accept it without thinking."
"Music that was edited into the video.  
  
No, I don't want to hear high-tempo trance; I would much rather hear the moaning/bed creaks/etc. An exception to this is if I hear the faint murmur of a radio or TV playing in the background."

"Not so much stereotypes as general inequalities: The way that comments about women are FAR more likely to be about their appearance - even from me, even after I realised.  When you are sitting watching TV and a guy pops up he'd have to have a pretty ugly face to invite comment - but an average woman pops up and it's open season - also famous actors... listen to people give their opinions on famous actors and the women will always get a comment on their looks.

Also confidence/hierarchy... I was in a room full of about 15/20 people, all quite progressive, all would call themselves feminists... and it just so happened that it was exactly half women and half men.  The boxing was on and the girls started (fairly loudly) drooling over one of the boxers at which point there was a cry of protest from all the men to keep quiet... and they just did.

I was trying to think, if we were the same group watching a traditionally female oriented show/game and the guys started talking over it, would a command to be quiet from the girls work just as well?  Then I realised... we wouldn't be watching a female oriented show - the guys would have already protested loud enough to have it turned off...

Personally though my least favourite is the idea that women are the gatekeepers of sex and men the keymasters.  That sex is something women have and defend, and men have to try to get it from them, by coercion, persuasion, deception or force.  The annoying thing is that this, like so many other sexist things, is harmful to men as well as women - and perpetuated by women as much as by men.  Sex should be a thing that 2 people share... not something that one takes from the other.

Sorry for the long rant"

He is the only one to blame for ruining his career. "
stop being passive aggressive and talk to him
"Yeah. He loves barebacking while he has a cuckold to support him, feed him, drive him around and then still have sex with him. He's got it made. He'll tell you it's love or anything else you want to hear as long as you keep those dollars flowing and putting up with his gaping, disease ridden hole. 

Mature for his age. What a riot. He lied about his age. He's getting bred all over town and pretends not to know any better, yet he knew to hide it from you, and slipped up. He's telling you everything you want to hear because you're gullible and have issues dating children. FYI 6 years is huge at that young age, not so much later. But have the balls to at least realize he's working you for all he can. "
"I accidentally shared a glass of champagne on the end of a pier, at sunset, mostly in silence enjoying the view, with a girl who didn't know I was gay.

Best thing to do is to end it. He clearly wants something else in a relationship than you do. 
"Similarly, I've noticed gay themed movies often get a more adult MPAA ratings.  One bad example I saw recently was this gay teen comedy called ""G.B.F."".  There was no nudity, no sex scenes, very little language, no drugs.  Just a couple short gay kisses and it was rated R.  Apparently the director got really angry about it, and publicly spoke out against it."
And this is coming from a guy who wants you to pm your dick to him. 
"Can't determine which hint was bigger:

On couch with a guy I was crushing on. We'd been on a date or two before, but had never sexed each other or made out or anything. He mentioned he was really cold and started to scoot towards me. I get off the couch to turn the thermostat up -- to north of 80.

A very good friend of mine, who is straight (or mostly is) and very attractive, drove with me to a friend's house to pick up some weed. I forget how the topic of anal sex came up, but it did. Just as we're pulling up he says something about how hot it is to just completely dominate another person. He then parks his truck, turns to me, and says,""you know, I can start out gentle if needed"". I'm like, ""that's cool"" and I get out of the truck.

This kind of thing has happened to me a lot. I think I missed out on a lot of sex when I was younger."
You took on the responsibility of fully supporting a sheltered teenager and are shocked that he's immature? The things guys will get themselves caught up in for a perky butt and a big dick...
"&gt;By the time I found out we had already really connected.

So what? A mature adult would have ended things and delivered a stern lecture on maturity the moment he found out that his Tinder date was ***sixteen years old*** and still living with his parents.

I fucking knew we would eat that story up. I'm pretty sure that was most obvious fake story I have ever read. It just reads like every gaybro's wet dream.

Congrats.. we'll keep your seat reserved cause in 2 years you'll post about your heart wrenching crush on him. 
There is a reason they call it irreconcilable differences.  If you are ready to live your life out go for it.  It sounds like you are ready for more than he is and if you continue you may remain unhappy.
"Rape is such an ignored topic in the gay community. Men have a stigma towards admitting they've been mistreated sexually. Too many guys pass off what is a crime as, ""Craig got a little too aggressive last night, but I didn't think I should stop him."" It's sad."
"Guys looking bored.

"This is called sexual harassment. Welcome to the world women live in.

You need to set boundaries with him. It's too late now, but if he does it again you need to speak up and say ""NO!"" ""I'm good. I appreciate your support, but am it's not appropriate for your to kiss me, or I don't feel compfortable touching someone else like that""

If he persists, you go immediately to human resources or a manager.

He is taking advantage of your emotional state, your apparently discomfort in being out/exposed and of the power dynamic. And judging by this, he probably knows you will be hesistant to set boundaries or act aggressively. He knows exactly what he is doing."
The word boipussy makes me loathe you.
"I would suggest you see your physician. a sudden change in sexual urges, acne, and sweating point to hormone problems. you should get your thyroid, growth hormone, and sex hormone levels checked out. he/she will know what else to do"
"I have a bit of a list:

1. The cooking thing. Something I find INSANELY odd is that people assume that cooking is a woman thing, yet the actual culinary field is overwhelmingly dominated by men. So the reality of the situation is that society has been conditioned to think that a male dominated career is supposed to be feminine, and thus men are somehow special when they are able to cook.

2. ""you do not look/act/seem gay"". This is one that I have heard from my mother, relentlessly, for the past decade. What is a gay guy SUPPOSED to look/act/seem like? I am me, you raised me to act the way that I do with the interests that I have, are all of those supposed to magically change because I happen to enjoy sex with dudes?

3. The above one except with OTHER people: ""Oh, I never would have guessed but now that you mentioned it yeah you seem pretty gay."" What? My mannerisms did not change, what I talk about did not change, my voice, hair, clothing, or taste in anything else do not change now that you know that I am gay. So what the Hell is it that suddenly clicks for you?

4. ""You are the most disappointing gay man ever."" Another one from my lovely mother. For some reason, because I do not dress, talk, or act like an overt gay stereotype I am a disappointment as a homosexual. I'm sorry, I had no idea that having sex with guys was not enough for you mother."

Do you want to come over and watch them with me?"" and I replied, ""No, I just watched them all.""

"I don't think it's not PC in gay circles. I think it's that many of us will fight against the assumption this must ALWAYS be the case. (That there is a ""woman"" in each relationship.) If you like it, you own it and love it. Nothing at all wrong with that."
"If kissing another person is too far out of an actor's comfort zone I would argue that makes them a bad one.

"Most straight men are emotionally retarded. And when I use the word ""retarded,"" I mean it in the literal dictionary sense: their emotional development has been intentionally suppressed in order to conform to societal expectations of masculinity.

"You know, OP, even the more friendly comments still have the same conclusions as the ones you're telling to fuck off:

1) He's too young; 2) that inexperience is not going to match your expectations; 3) end it.

So while you're not really asking ""What do I do?"" I don't know what kind of emotional support you're seeking. As adults, we should know by now that saying ""That sucks"" or ""I'm sorry"" doesn't really propel us toward a solution. And you might feel the pressure of the ""decision"" or course of action *because* you're an adult dating someone who hasn't yet learned how to be one. Hence, a kid.

So while I'm sure your boyfriend is grateful to have someone as supportive as you, he needs to be sat down and told that his behavior is irresponsible, inconsiderate, and disrespectful of your trust. And the longer you have to ""parent"" your boyfriend, the sooner I hope you'll reach the same conclusion that others are offering you."

After about 20 minutes I'm thinking to myself ""this is some lame house party it's just the three of us drinking beer...."" Then the light bulb goes off in my head. And then the party really got started. "
"Too long close-ups. I like seeing faces and entire bodies involved in the play instead of five minutes anatomical cock-in-ass friction moves. Don't also like ""the plot"" in porn; fucking is fucking, why add any distracting story or professional film set to it. Music is annoying too."

When I told him I didn't wanna keep seeing him he started calling me a slut, only wanted to fuck him, how dare he use me, etc. 

If someone describes themselves as a ""nice guy"" back away. Nice people don't have to actually declare they're nice people. "
"She is the definition of rich political game player. She has an awful personality problem, but I think she means well in some regards.

That being said I am a Bernie supporter and support him 100%. For me it goes Bernie &gt; Hillary &gt; Write in &gt; Trump "
"No. 

She's a politician, so naturally she's going to do some pandering, but that's part of the job. You show me a politician that doesn't pander and I'll show you a politician that doesn't get elected.

In terms of how she has dealt with the LGBTQ community she has a much better record than many Sanders supporters have tried to suggest. While yes, she didn't come out for gay marriage until 2013, she was serving in Obama's cabinet at the time and it would have been a political nightmare to contradict his policy stances given their history. She came out for full gay marriage less than three months after leaving the job. And that speech that sanders supporters like to trot out as ""proof"" that she was anti-gay is actually a very small, out of context snippet edited from a longer speech where she was speaking out against a constitutional amendment that would make gay marriage unconstitutional. In the correct context it is clear that she is not against gay marriage, and the people who edited the video were very clearly intentionally misrepresenting what she was saying. It's also a [pretty good speech](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4542458/hillary-clinton-2004-senate-floor-remarks-same-sex-occasision-life-defend-marriage-stand-marriage). 

If you look at her record in the Senate she was always a very reliable ally to the LGBTQ community, she was the first First Lady to ride in a pride parade in 2001. As First Lady she hired the first openly gay staff members to ever serve in the White House, soon followed by openly gay staffers working for Bill Clinton in the West Wing. She also helped Bill Clinton campaign on expanding AIDS/HIV research that was clearly being ignored and underfunded by Reagan. She even called his inattention to the issue criminal and hateful. None of that may sound like much in today's political climate, but 25 years ago these were historic things to do and say. 

As Secretary of State she gave LGBTQ State workers and diplomats more rights and protections than any other government agency, even ordering the department to recognize civil partnerships as equally as marriages in every way. She gave a truly historic speech at the UN where she declared that gay rights are human rights. Seriously, [it's an amazing speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MudnsExyV78).

I do have some problems with a few her policies, for one I think she tends to be a bit hawkish (although not as hawkish as she is often accused of being) and that iraq vote still sticks in my craw. I'm not crazy about the fracking stuff, but she does want some of the strictest fracking regulations ever put into place, so she's at least going in the right direction. And while she gets criticized for pushing fracking in developing nations, it needs to be pointed out that she pushed it in nations that were dependent on coal and even dirtier fuel sources than fracking, and often encouraged those nations to develop cleaner forms of power when possible, so I think that's an unfair attack. I also wish that she would just bite the bullet and go for the full $15 national minimum wage. But those are positions that she can either be lobbied on or moved into the right direction with enough political pressure.  

In regards to the Wall Street stuff, I just think it's silly. If you can't understand why a civil rights attorney, former First Lady, two term senator and former Secretary of State is worth 200k a speech then you're delusional. And if you think that the only reason a global banking corporation would pay her to speak is to buy her off then you're just buying into silly conspiracy theories. It shouldn't be hard to grasp the idea that naturally a global corporation would be curious what one of the most knowledgeable people in the planet in terms of geopolitics thinks about the state of the world's economy.

At the end of the day, she is clearly more qualified for the job than any other candidate in modern history has ever been. If you call yourself a liberal and you won't vote for her in the general election, then frankly you're just being willfully obtuse and buying into 25 years of lies and rightwing attacks that come from the very people who demonize our community.

"I have no gaydar and never have. For me, you have to be spitting out purses and rainbows for me to realize it in many cases. 

That said, it's best to assume every guy you meet is straight and act accordingly regardless of the signs. It is simply not helpful to play the ""what if"" game because it's almost always a losing position you'll be defending. 

Wait for guys to let you know specifically. Not hinting around and so  on. If you're in a safe country and self-supporting, don't hide your sexuality. That doesn't mean you have to go around advertising, just be natural. If you're at work and it comes up in conversation, great. That is a great way to get people to talk to you about things."

"I'm sorry it didn't go well. You need to realize this is his loss, and honestly, not yours. If you have good memories of time with your father, enjoy those.

Consider that you knew all along this bigotry of his was deeper than his love of people in his own family, his very own offspring. I think that says a lot about what kind of person he is deep down. Are you mourning the reality of things or that he isn't and never was the man you hoped he'd be?

I'm not trying to shit on him, just that we are conditioned that parents and children must love each other and many like to throw out things about family bonds. But if you're hiding for most of your life, and he's so casually dismissive of your happiness and reality, is it truly a loving thing? To me, it just sounds like this big giant illusion that everyone bought into.

If you really want to try to smooth things out, write a letter saying it all. Don't put a return address on it. Just let him hear what needs to be said. It may not make one iota of difference. That's okay. Just be yourself and find people like your BF that love you. Those are the people that you need in your life regardless of the blood connection or title given simply for being a sperm donor."

Damn you're woke af.

"Like I said in the other thread, something like that happened to me. 

It was an after-party, too late to take the bus back home, so I slept there. Since it was a really spacious bed, I was in it with someone else. One of my STRAIGHT friend back then, I knew him for a long time.

I remember, before falling asleep, our back was touching. As I usually don't mind having my body being touched, I didn't minded.

In the middle of the night, I felt him spooning me. I didn't really care, I love being spooned.

I don't know what happened in his head after that and all, but I woke up from him stroking my cock, and him pressing his dick against my ass.

I never felt so disgusted. I stopped having sexual encounters for more than a year after that, I felt used and dirtied. 

So please, pretty please, GET CONSENT.

"My college crush came over to my apartment to study a few times, he was stunning - on the shorter side, broad shoulders, the kind of tan guys get from playing outside without a shirt on as opposed to a gross tanning bed tan, athlete's body, chest and abs covered in a light amount of slightly sun-bleached fur. We ended up drinking a lot more beer than studying. He was always a little too nice to me. And he'd always lift up his shirt casually to scratch some random itch, like hot guys do, so I'd get a good look at his perfect torso. He'd always look to see if I looked when he did it, and I'd try to pretend I wasn't looking. He caught me once, locked eyes with me, and smiled. My eyes darted away with a nervous laugh. The signs were unmistakable in retrospect a decade and a half later, but my insecure college brain couldn't fathom what this hot ""straight"" guy was doing. "
The Way He Looks is one of the most adorable things I've ever watched.
"Videos by Cocky Boys tend to have a very ""nice"" vibe to them-- lots of chatting between the guys beforehand, and generally a playful or artsy vibe."
"I laughed so hard when I read your question that I almost spit the cum out of my mouth into my monitor. 

Really, the best tasting cum I've ever had -- so mild to be nearly flavorless -- was still nothing I'd choose to consume were it not for the sex act that produced it.  Yet the experience of swallowing it straight from the source is an incredible experience for both involved."
Two girls would be very concerned that they were suddenly in a room full of large hairy older men. 
or just use the language you already have to communicate your feelings xD
"Also, moisturize."
"My female friends like when I go to clubs with them because the guys stay away its hilarious.

One of my friends boyfriends even prefers I go with them. "
"I don't care. Big low hangers are hot to look at and a turn on, but they don't add any physical feeling to me. They're just for show. 

If I like the dude, I couldn't give a shit about his balls. l'll lick them regardless and suck his dick :D 

It's like insicurity on penis size, if you like someone you don't care how big their dick is. You care about what they can do with it and you're just happy to be able to touch it &gt;:D"
Imagine it was your bf LOL
"&gt;sleazebag as well as a douchebag home wrecker 

Okay that's probably pretty fair

&gt;potential sexual predator against children

Uh? Out of nowhere much?"
"Don't tell him.  I dated a famous dude for a while and didn't realise he was famous until he was recognised in a restaurant.  Most people  only wanted to talk about his fame, so it was refreshing for him to meet someone who didn't give a fuck."
"I was stood up by a friend with whom I had to make an assignment for college. I was suppose to be in another place after that, so I didnt have time to go back home, and as his place was just round the corner i asked if i could stay there for a while.

His answer was: 'I'd love to, but my parents are home.' And five minutes later: 'nevermind, they left. You can come over, but I need to take a shower first.'

So I got there. He was just wearing a shirt and some shorts and i sat on the couch. Then he would sit in front on me and place his legs on the couch almost touching my leg telling me: 'what do you wana do?'  With a smile and a cocky attitude.

It wasnt until  a friend told me what his intentions were that i realised how slow I was... 

BTW, this was some days after new years when he was on vacations and he told me 'Right after i get home we'll see each other, you won't get away from me...'"
"Not Chinese, but I am pretty sure there's a bit more nuance to your boyfriend's statements. China, as a whole, is still very homophobic. maybe in boarding school, the boys end up doing things with each other without sexual creed, but China is not a sexually open country. there's definitely a stigma for homosexuality "
"Dude the bisexual stereotypes are endless:

* Everyone is a little bisexual
* But somehow no one is *really* bisexual
* We're really just gay and using bisexuality as a stepping stone
* We're going to leave our boyfriends for women because we all want to settle down and have a nice stereotypical hetero family.
* Bi women are ""just doing it for male attention."" 
* Bisexuals are all equally interested in men and women.
* You can only be gay or straight, so come on, who are you into more?
* We can't be monogamous
* We're bisexual because we think we're enlightened or something.

All of those ridiculous, contradictory stereotypes and somehow *we're* the ones who get told to ""pick a side."""
"It really bugs me, and I think it will cause more problems than anything. If Disney says yes then people will say they are shoving it down everyone's throats, if Disney says no then people will say they are being exclusionary. I definitely am not saying they shouldn't put gay characters in their films, but the characters should be gay from the beginning, not shoehorned in to look progressive."

YAS Mama! 
"tumblr, the only reason i have one"
"I get irked by the assumption some straight guys have that they're default more manly than gay men. It happens almost more among nerdy guys and suburban hipster kids. It's like, dude, none of you can change your oil without going to a dealership, have never hung drywall, and get super scared to walk through any neighborhood that is even slightly below your socio-economic level and you think you're harder than me by default. "
"LOL you're both headcases. He's playing you like a fucking flute and you're sitting there with your balls so far up inside your body that you don't even realise it. Not to excuse his behaviour because an 18 year old should know about sexual health, but seriously?!!?! Fact is, the kid is using you and WILL latch onto you because you're providing shelter and food. 

Basically, you fucked up. "
"When they pull out, cum on his ass hole, and then shove it back in.

If you're gonna put your cum inside him, it's way hotter to just keep fucking him until his balls drain. "
"Ur 16 and he's 15... Both going to college in the fall?

Take out your calculators boys because something just ain't adding up "
Straight men and a straight women are just as shallow and superficial. Those  are  HUMAN conditions not gay conditions.
I feel like you're deliberately being obtuse here.  You've already identified why they treat you the way they do. You describe yourself as feminine and that you take the place of the woman in the relationship. I'm guessing you don't do anything to directly address this perception your husband's friends have of you. Then they treat you this way and it bothers you. Do something about it if it bothers you.

"It's kind of a common thing. ""Straight"" guy messes around with a friend and then severs contact. 

He's probably not ready to address his own issues with his sexuality. "
"It's a racist stereotype, assuming you're a thug for being black. No one wants that"
It makes me love you even more Daddy!

"I'm pretty sure that many of those people on PrEP are aware they could catch other diseases and are taking calculated risks. Furthermore, you can still spread HPV even with condoms, because it spreads by skin to skin contact, not necessarily by semen. 

And I strongly recommend that guys under the age of 26 get Gardasil vaccine, which now protects against 9 different strains of HPV, including those that cause the vast majority of anal and genital warts, and anal cancers."
is that a compliment?
Tell him in person that you don't appreciate the attention and for him to stop it. And that should he continue that you might not be as discreet.
"Dude, grow the fuck up.  What is this you WILL cheat on him crap? 

When you first started dating and he said he wasn't into it, why did you expect him to change his mind? If this is a deal breaker for you, tell him that and break up with him. And next time start a relationship with only guys who are into this, if it's that important to you. 

&gt;I've been extremely patient and done everything I can but he isn't willing to give even an inch.

That's because you didn't listen to him, and you don't respect his boundaries. And you didn't communicate your needs earlier on before getting into a relationship with this guy."
"I love this, you go dude! I know it's gunna go perfectly "
