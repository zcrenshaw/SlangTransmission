In a case like that a gay guy has to be somewhat aggressive in order to get his point across. Otherwise anyone he is attempting to meet will be on here the next day daftly asking if some guy at the gym liked him or not lol!

"This is an advice-based section of the Internet. Self-pity, whining, etc. will always appear in high frequency because the nature of this sub allows for the anonymous airing of problems. No wonder the two most popular topics seem to be sex and relationship woes. 

That doesn't mean that most who frequent this place walk around with a chronic chip on their shoulder, or that they aren't making any honest attempts at self-improvement. All it means is that Reddit can be a safe space for them to, for a moment, unload their emotional cargo. You're seeing people for a brief moment offer a flicker of their lives during which they're (most likely) struggling with something and need a place to ask for advice. 

I think the relatively dismissive and condescending tone your post contains has the unfortunate effect of masking genuinely good advice. It is important to get help and be proactive about changing one's own circumstance, but it's equally as important to recognize what important role a safe space like GayBros has in this process. That's my two cents.

Recently someone found out I'm gay and she was saying how happy she was to find out I was gay because she needs a gay best friend. I don't like hanging out with her...

"Multiple times I'm very blunt and concise about my expectations and hard no's. For example I don't fuck with guys who do hard drugs, I once walked in a dude's apartment who had a bent spoon and rubber tubing sitting out I made a comment about him partying with H and Tina, he laughed and offered me a jump and I stone cold noped right the fuck outta there.

I don't entertain catfish type dudes either. If you don't look like the pics you sent me I'm bouncing. If you mention they aren't recent that might be different but fuck that bait and switch bullshit."

Or, coming from a muslim background, I've heard an imam multiple times say ""Hey, being gay is similar to what regular straight men have to go through. We can't have sex before marriage and have to contain our desires towards women untill we get married, so why can't they contain their desires"" and the whole congregation goes like ""sa7!"" which means ""right!"" in arabic. Lmao I'm like whuuuuuuut? How does that even make sense to you all?

Now I flirt with her and she sneaks me extra McNuggets and calls me baby."

Not even straight people know what the fuck it means for people to be the man or the woman of the relationship. Trying to define roles this way seems like a recipe for conflicting expectations. Healthy couples need to talk through roles and plans for the relationship pretty thoroughly anyway. Better to start there instead of adopting lingo with unnecessary baggage.
"Completely agree. The circlejerk that it's okay to not want to fuck feminine guys (which itself is completely reasonable) too often turns into ""Lol lets insult their manhood and be assholes, but I'm totally not prejudiced against them"".

Just to clarify again, because some people cant seem to understand, if you dont want to have sex with a feminine guy that is completely, 100 percent fine. Just dont insult them or their manhood, it's not cool, it just makes you a douchebag."

"Several times.  I thanked them for their time, told them that it just wasn't going to work, and left.  No harm in that, and I've had guys do it to me...............and they were right; just wasn't going to work.  One of them was a young man (I'm almost 70, now) I'd chatted with online and we agreed to meet.  I drove over a hundred miles to meet him and while we got along, I wasn't comfortable; he was actually somewhat mentally challenged.  I told him I just couldn't go thru with it, he agreed and I drove home.

Another was a handsome Asian student, we chatted online, met at a restaurant and talked some more.  He seemed distressed and I asked if he was having second thoughts.........he was............I told him that I understood, we finished eating (I paid) and we parted.

There were several like this.  The last thing I want is a partner that just isn't into it and I always tell the truth, even if it means not going thru with the hookup."

"So much drama can be avoided in the dating scene by simply saying, ""Hey man, I appreciate your interest, but I'm not interested"" with a little smile and wishing them a good day/night. If the other person reacts badly, then that's on them, not on you. 

Just be kind but firm, and if things get out of hand, just walk away. This strategy has saved me from so much stress, both in dating and everyday life situations. "
"I think the one that made me laugh the most was overhearing a conversation like this at a conference I was attending a few years ago.

The one guy said something like: ""I think I'll turn gay for a while to see if it's easier to date."" (Something along those lines.)

"Young, stupid, went in blind and was meeting at a hotel. The guy was insecure, obese and to me was unattractive. 

I thought, fuck it I'm here. So maybe a minute into kissing he pulls out rope and asks me to tie him up and I said I can't do this and I left. The second I touched my lips to his, it felt wrong and when the rope was brought out it was too much."
"Luckily you live in a rather open and tolerant country, unless you are deep in the countryside...
    
First and foremost, you need you accept yourself! There is nothing wrong with being gay or sleeping with men. Get rid of any thoughts and believes telling you differently.
   
Once you've accepted yourself, stop caring about others having a problem with the life you live. Eg they aren't friends if they don't accept you as you are and hence they shouldn't matter to you anymore.
    
Then just be honest, you don't need to tell everyone that you're gay -you can if you like- but if you're asked, tell them unless it might be a critical situation."

I find this quite sad actually. 
"I don't know, lately I'm like way more attracted to looking at asses than dick pics, bulges, etc. I'm a total ""bottom"" so all of this has been giving me a totes major identity crisis. What's wrong with me?!? 😭"

"I don't get this, but my husband does. He's ex military and now an engineer. He does not at all fit into the stereotype of the sassy fashionista who is everyone's friend. People get a little baffled when he mentions he has a husband and that I'm really not his friendly gay roommate who stops by to give him lunch or pick him up after work. No actually we're really a couple. 

But he does act gay. He sucks dick good and eats ass like a pro. "
"Do not ask who is the woman/man/catcher/pitcher etc. Asking if he's a bottom or top *might* be acceptable when it is just the two of you and a few beers in, but at a bbq with partners and possibly other people around it's just weird. I doubt you would appreciate if he asked what positions you and your wife used last night.

That's the only thing I can really think of that is insensitive for a straight person to ask a gay couple. (other than the obviously offensive stuff)

Asking how his family took it should be fine, take social cues on whether or not to ask followup questions."
"Anyone who has to point out reasons and examples why they aren't gay is obviously insecure and defensive about their sexuality.

"This topic again.  Let me save everyone's time by going through all the motions.  Yes, it is a good idea to be on PrEP if you are sexuality active.  Yes, it is ideal to use it with condom use.  Yes, people will use PrEP as an excuse to bareack.  No, you don't have to entertain them.  No, it will not protect you from other STDs. Yes, people should use condoms but there are some who don't and it is unlikely you will convince them especially on this forum.  Yes, it can be affordable if you use the Truvada Assistance Program in conjunction with your health insurance at $3600/year.  Yes, it requires you to take an HIV test every three months.  Yes, it requires a doctor's note.  No, PEP is not the same as PrEP as it has a limited time window after the incident.  Yes, people in relationships can get HIV and/or STDs if one of them is cheating or sleeping around with others.  No, nothing is wrong with a monogamous or poly relationship.  

Anything else?  And no, you will not convinced everyone why this is or isn't a good idea.  "

"For the same reason that millions of americans consistently vote against their best interests. They are ignorant, ill-informed and have the luxury of not necessarily suffering much of hit to their specific lives because they fail to think of anyone but their immediate selves.  "
"By doing this, they have (and I think sometimes intentionally) forced you to start the chat without a face pic and to possibly change your mind upon seeing it.  Because of this, they have earned whatever you decide to do after you see the pic and fail to like it.

I'm usually kinder than this, but it's a pet peeve.  If somebody is going to try to force me to evaluate their facial beauty, the least I can do is go ahead and do so.

The ""discreet"" stuff is bullshit.  Almost NOBODY wants his face plastered in what is arguably a public place as a gay guy cruising.  Yet most of us bite the bullet and do it.  Those requiring discretion choose to be ""special"" at the risk of getting implicitly called ugly.

"Here's my take on this.

Fundamentalist Christian society is very much a subculture, with it's own norms, it's own unspoken rules for belonging, that have absolutely nothing to do with mainstream American (an assumption here - that you live in the US) society as a whole.  It also has very little to do with mainstream Christianity.  Think about it, when you say that 'my friends are Christian' how many of them are Catholic or Orthodox?  I'll bet 99% of them are part of a Fundamentalist denomination - one of those 'Church of New Hope' places.

Homophobia is one of those norms within the fundamentalist subculture, as you already know, and so, when you ask, ""Is he ready to be gay,""  what you are really asking is, ""Is he ready to leave the subculture in which he is raised, to embrace who he is?""

You should ask yourself that question first.

Because eventually, whether you like it or not, you are going to encounter a day when your sexuality will become an issue with that subculture, and the people that you know.  And, more than likely, you will be told that you are 'falling away from Christ' or some such like that, and need to 'repent' in order to be accepted back into the fold.  And even people who love you and have known you your whole life, will publicly fall in line and say the same thing to you, even though in private they may tell you that they understand.

And you will be told that you are rejecting 'society' and joining a 'lifestyle,' when in fact the opposite is true - you will be rejecting a subculture that forms a tiny minority within the Christian religion worldwide, and adopting norms that the vast majority of Americans have, which holds that one's religious beliefs, and one's bedroom behavior, are a private matter and should not have any bearing on your standing within the community.

So, if you are ready to leave that homophobic subculture, and let the people within it go, then by all means come out to your prospective paramour, and see if he is also ready to embrace life and love, or whether he is too attached to the subculture in which he was also raised, to respond kindly.

But if you expect to hang on to both your fundamentalism and your sexuality, you are likely to be disappointed.  The chances that he will be willing to stay in the closet with you, and yet have a clandestine relationship, are slim.

There are actually many, many, Christian denominations out there who will not reject you for being gay, if you choose to hold onto your religion after coming out.  But the subculture of fundamentalist sects (which, if you describe your past as a 'Christian community' with home-schooling, I believe you may be part of) will reject you, I guarantee it.  So brace yourself for a bit of a shock, pick up the pieces, and move on, if that happens.

So, if you are okay with losing membership in a subculture that is a distinct minority within both American society, and Christianity, go for it and come out to him.  I think you should, but, as someone who went through the same thing many years ago, I am biased."

"Talked to this guy for a bit, traded photos, planned to meet up. 
When he recognized me, he walked up to me butterflies I honestly couldn't recognize him. He was quite a bit older than the pics, and quite a bit heavier. This was when I was still figuring stuff out, so I stuck around. 
After realizing he was the most boring person ever, and not the athletic traveller that I was talking to, I just walked away. "

No patience for fascists. "
"If he isn't willing to come out and is miserable being closeted at the same time there isn't much of a solution to it. A decision needs to be made and he needs to make it. You can't make it for him. You can make an effort to show him that coming out won't be bad, because you came out and looks like things went well for you. But ultimately the decision needs to be his own.

Be a supportive friend if you can. Otherwise maintain a distance and leave him be."

"Your situation isn't very uncommon. People tend to develop feelings to those who are very close. At this point, gender is a barrier for most but there are also many cases where its not. My uncle divorced his wife to get into a relationship with his male best friend and he claims he's only gay for him. Going by what you said, it seems your friend is also interested in you. Wait till you're sure and talk to him about it. Don't ignore your feelings and don't be afraid of labels. Good luck."
"Met a guy on Grindr. Went to his place. First problem was he was about 15 years older than his pic. But it was pretty dark in his place so I couldn't really tell at first. Then at about the same time I realized how much older he was, I also realized that his walls and the floor were covered with plastic tarps. It was some serious 'American Psycho' looking setup. 

I walked back to that front door as fast as I could. I wanted to get out ASAP, but I probably shouldn't have let him walk behind me on the way out. He said something about construction as I was going, but fuck that. The age issue alone would have been enough to leave over. I'm not against older guys per se, it's the lying that does it. It's also the not wanting to get my head cut off with a chainsaw that does it."

*What does he get out of this?*

He gets a feeling of power by submitting. You're hetero, a straight guy who loves pussy and something that's not on our dollar menu at the hook up restaurant.

What you're doing is allowing him to live out a power exchange fetish that he otherwise doesn't have in his life. You can bet that as soon as you leave, he's jacking off over the thought of you allowing a gay man into your most intimate places.


*He's told me repeatedly that his destiny was to be my ""property.""  He's made reference to wanting me to fuck his ass -- I have zero interest, and have told him as much. So, is he basically looking to eventually be topped, do you think?*


It's interesting that you do and yet don't see what's happening to you. Your sexuality is evolving and he's using every black market trick in his little gay book to help you do that. 

He's not changing you, he's providing opportunity for you to change yourself and it's working. Sure he loves to eat your ass and suck your cock but a good chunk of the dudes here would do the same for you. I'm not talking about a quick dick licking either. Many guys here would love to go to town on a straight guy, and not because he's straight but because we love sex. 

He's providing a fantasy for you that your into. It's something that your brain in it's current state can accept. You don't have to do anything yet you still participate in gay acts. He let's you explore your sexuality in an environment that allows you to maintain the illusion of strict heterosexuality while engaging in polar opposite sex.

About him being topped by you, that's only a matter of time to be honest. There will come a point when he has you so worked up that you just want to fuck something. Oh look, there's a hole right here and I have a hard cock sooo.......

It's not a huge leap to see where he wants this to go. He's given you everything you want and at some point your heterosexual brain will have the opinion that it might be ok to fuck this guy.

Getting worshiped is always fun and you're enjoying it for what it is. There's nothing wrong with that in the least and if you never reach the point where you'd fuck his ass, that's completely alright. 

You're just missing out on the completion of completely dominating him and getting him to make the submissive sounds that all Doms crave to hear. It's rare when you find a Dom worshiper who's Dom isn't willing to push them to the limit.


*About him wanting me ""unclean,"" and promising to ""clean my dirty hole,"" and wanting me to never shower... he's mentioned more than once he wishes I would piss on him*


He's into raunch and he's hoping that as some small show of favor that you'll allow him to indulge. He wants to make a deep connection with you, sharing something that's taboo and intimate beyond what would normally be considered taboo between men.

This goes beyond gay and right into human connection. He's willing to put himself at risk to show you that he's yours. He probably really likes the degradation and if he wants to tongue ride the dirt road in dust season it's to show you that he's dedicated and nothing will stop him from worshiping you. He wants to prove to you beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's the right choice for your cock and holes.

He's not wrong and you do love it. Greedy or not you're no longer straight bud. Your brain has been cracked open and you're starting to love it. That's alright man, it doesn't have to be opened anymore. Enjoy the ride, try not to put limits on yourself and have fun.

"Yeah he is still there, the plan is we are going to live together when he gets out. I just wrote him and am waiting on hearing back "
I've been on a deployment for the last 6 months and I can report that I may actually die. 
"&gt;I feel like I am using them for the next 4 years to get an education, get acquainted with a new city and then just come out and leave them.

I endorse this plan.

Seriously: your parents, as their best selves, would want to love you and get you started in life as best they could. All you're doing is helping them avoid the pitfalls of their homophobia.

I'm saying, you're in a less-than-ideal situation. Don't feel bad about making the best of it.

Oh, and absolutely do not come out to hostile parents before you're 18. They could hurt you really badly while they think they're acting out of love.

Once you're an adult with a job and your own place, then you can come out and work on fixing your relationship with your parents. If you want to."
How's the sex?
"I was in a pretty rigorous program most of the time I was down. Wake up around 5:30, get my area together shower and all that and around 7am would go to chow for breakfast than go to groups and classes pretty much all day until 7 at night. Of course with some free time here and there. I started working out a lot, reading, walking the track, watching other guys work out lol. I spent pretty much all my free time with one guy after a while we were inseparable. Time went by pretty fast it's crazy"
"I've said stories to other people, there is a lot of sneaking around, late night shower stuff like that. Me and my dude would be hanging out a lot on the yard and there was quite a few times we jacked off on the yard and gave handjobs, it helped when it got colder cause of the coats lol "
Donald Trump him and grab him by the boipussy.
"&gt;  dispite telling me he didn't have any pics.

This should be an immediate red flag. Getting pictures of yourself is way too stupidly simple now. "
I think I saw that scene on some gay porn site.
"So, you're jumping to a big conclusion thinking he cheated on you because one Viagra is missing. Maybe he wanted to jerk off. Before you go divorcing him you really should get more solid evidence."
Lots of guys are into it. My ex was. Not for me. But I love to smell balls! Yum!
"Precum, definitely. Guys who precum a lot are my thing, idk. I'm a simple man."
"I'm bi, I've occasionally had fleeting moments of self-doubt where I realize that I'm not into what I'm doing with this guy or that guy and I wonder if maybe I am straight after all, maybe my parents were right, maybe I'm just dating guys to be rebellious or to be ""cool"" or to get easy sex.

Then I realize that I enjoy sucking dicks waaaaaay too much to be straight."
"No big deal, since it sounds like it was just you two present.  If the interest is enough, take it to the next level.  Under the circumstances the erection was a friendly demonstration of his appreciation."
"I lived in S. Korea for a bit. Place overall is very closeted especially in rural areas. I lived in the countryside and met up with this guy who lived near the University in town from Grindr. We met at a bridge to his place.  On the way to his apartment he was explaining that we were gonna hang out with a couple of friends and gave me this BS cover story to explain who I was. We are 3 years apart but  he was going to tell them that I was one of his teachers in HS.
 
I was like, ""Uh... I don't like to lie so can we just not meet your friends if you're not out?""

He just wanted to show off that he knew a foreigner. We wind up meeting the friends, (a guy and girl) in passing long enough to say hi and keep going since I told him I was not going to hang out with them. 

We go to his room. Had a cup of tea, then he goes, ""suck my deek."" First thing he's said in English the whole time. He moves my hand to his crotch, (thing was huge) and I was like, ""uhh....no"" and I tried to leave. He is like, ""Wait. No no.. It is okay. We can just sleep."" We get in the bed. Right as I am almost sleep, he goes, ""Touch my deek."" 
I wish I could tell you guys how annoying it sounded with his intonation and accent. I thought, ""Fuck it. I'm going home."" 

I get my shoes on and bounce. I shouldn't have stayed as long as I did. "
End it. Now. 
He who shall not be named 
"Yes rape, not that common but it happens. I didn't get fucked and yeah it crossed my mind. I was pretty thirsty in there sometimes and it clouded my judgement  i would've gotten gangbanged in there if I had a good spot. The amount of sexy guys in there was ridiculous"
"I wouldn't over-think it. I watch certain straight porn sometimes, even solo females. Doesn't make me straight. It's just porn."
I started talking to this guy and we quickly became friend's he is bi and I'm gay. Neither of us really want a commited relationship but we were with each other whenever we could be started messing around a lot and I really started getting feelings for him. I actually cried a little when I said bye to him I just wrote him and we are planning on living together when he gets out. I miss him a lot 
I pretty much fell in love with someone yea lol
The media doesn't exactly show a wide range of straight female bodies either. 
"He is not saying that you can't do it. He's saying that a reasonable and educated person wouldn't do it. People have the right to be homophobic idiots, doesn't mean that it's okay to be homophobic.  "
Probably just shy. Nothing wrong with it dude. 
What they did wrong was raising a spoiled brat with no coping skills. Ppl like you are why the LGBT movement hits so many roadblocks. You're a shit human being or trolling (I hope) who thinks the world owes you anything. I wouldn't be upset if you chugged a cup of knives.
"I'll never vote for Marine Le pen.
I know that it may sound selfish, i know that there are other issues, i know that it's not 100% rational, but i won't vote for any political party who wants to remove my right to get married.
I don't care about getting married frankly, i'm not sure if i ever want to, and if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, but i refuse to let Marine Le pen decides for me.
I don't want the ""upgraded civil union"" that she promises, i want the big marriage package with the cake, the recognition, and all the shitty things that comes with it.

Plus i don't know if getting out of the European Union and going back to the Francs instead of euros is a good thing.
And she looks like an Evil queen from a disney movie.
"
Biggest hypocrite of all - to call out someone for being 'immature' when he himself can't treat his wife with respect and not fuck young boys behind her back.
"Sorry, girl, I'm a human being. Not a sexuality that you can accessorize with."
"&gt;  It's ~~funny~~ sad, really.

FTFY."
"My all time favorite and the one I just walk away from now is ""You don't look gay.""

As soon as those words pass lips, i completely understand that I will learn nothing from any further interactions with that person and I need to remove myself from the situation as quickly as possible for fear of an educational reckoning of biblical proportions spilling over into their small little worlds."
I'd like shopping if I had money honestly. ;-; But instead of clothes I'd rather an electronic store or art supply or something. :P
Are you...are you saying...you. like. davey wavey...
"You sound classy as fuck. Social grace an self awareness on that level are rare birds, especially in the very hook up oriented gay scene. I think a lot of fellas (and as a bi guy, women, too) are so hungry for the validation of sex that they don't stop to consider the emotional well being of themselves or their partners long enough to realize that a ""no"", while painful, very often serves the greater good. Thanks for being you. "
I personally wouldn't. In my perspective that's not fair to either party. 
"I'll put it very bluntly.  I buried myself in school for 7 years.  That did not make me rich, but I do ok.

If you are with me, I want you to have a help-out attitude.  I don't care if you cannot currently pay for anything.  But to sit there and be pleased that this is a good status and to not try to improve your ability to pay for things in the future (I might die, you know) is unacceptable.

A side effect of having goals of some kind that you work toward is that you have something interesting to talk about when you are not involved in doing that.
"
Yes. Yes you are. 
I see where you're coming from but personally I prefer the part where the dick moves in and out of my mouth.
"That would be just...discriminated against. Not necessarily oppressed. 

Like, gays in Russia and the middle East are oppressed. You're misusing the word."
"-standing in the kitchen with mom when I was 19-

Mom: are you gay

Me: yeah

Mom: I knew it 
 "
"My last boyfriend would often tell me that he wanted to watch me get fucked by other guys, but no interest in seeing me fuck them, which made me think that it was about power.  I suspect he wanted to see me get dominated in retaliation for the fact that I would often bitch about his shitty driving and the fact that he was on his phone all the damn time.  Just a few of several reasons why he's an ex."
Sweaty armpits make me super horny too ;)
"If you are white and don't explicitly state that you aren't a Nazi BEFORE I see the tattoo (yes, I do know which kind is the Nazi kind and which aren't) I'm going to kick the shit out of you.

#BASH THE FASH"
"You give Nazis an inch and they take 20,000,000 innocent people and round them up in death camps."
"Some like it, some don't. Don't do it without asking beforehand I think. And if someone seems on the fence about it, refrain."
Masculine guys just had the luxury of hiding it in high school. 
"I'm pretty fucking vanilla, but I'll put my thoughts out here.

I want to fuck a perfect bubble butt on a nice twink while he's wearing a jockstrap.

I want to give roadhead on a long car ride.

Go back to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, rent a log cabin on a mountain with a hot tub, fuck a guy as he's leaning on the patio railing looking down into the valley bellow. I've been in several cabins put there where the hot tub was right against the railing, I've just never had the appropriate company. Although, after the fires, it may be a few years to have this one be possible again.

That about sums it up."
I don't really think I'd want to have much to do with either of you. Someone who would assault a vulnerable and defenseless person also strikes me as somewhat of a piece of shit but that's just me.
"The correct body alignment. The big spoon's lower arm should be positioned between the head and the lower shoulder of the small spoon, while head to toe body contact must be maintained throughout. For this purpose it is often necessary for both spoons to adjust their body positions, on both linear and rotational planes. Having the best visual perspective of the situation, it usually falls to the big spoon to direct the repositioning by employing a series of verbal commands. So if the little spoon needs to move 'up' and 'around' a bit, the command may be *'come up 20cm - rotate 25 degrees anti-clockwise'*. By patiently experimenting with such verbal commands the optimum cuddling position may be achieved. Or just put your dick in him. "
"Oh god yes i fucking hate it when they say that.


One time i was listening to Morbid Angel and a friend of mine once said to me ""Are you sure you are gay? you listen to Metal music why don't you listen to Lady Gaga or Beyonce""


What the fuck does my taste in music have anything to do with my sexuality


"
"Based on what you wrote literally no one is oppressing you personally, though.

I wouldn't even say gays are really oppressed in first world countries tbh. "
When it's actually a little chilly in the room and neither of you are sweating by cuddling. 
"I stopped reading this subreddit regularly, and my life is so much better as a result! I encourage everyone to stop reading this subreddit -it is terrible and full of miserable sad sacks, which is contagious. "
"Yeah - the main reason why I hate the phrase ""woman in the relationship"" is that it means fuck little. I think it's 100% acceptable for a relationship to have a dominant and a submissive dynamic, but that can happen with both gay and straight couples. Hell, in most straight couples (at least the ones that I know of nowadays), there's hardly a ""woman"" in the relationship outside of, well, the woman being a woman. 

I'm sure OP meant no harm at all, but it's a pretty inherently sexist phrase to me. Gay men don't get a pass for using it just because they're gay, and if someone asks me about that, I'll gladly tell them to fuck off. "
"WHOA, LOTSA GAYS ARE OK WITH THIS..."
"He looks 15....

But Marvel has been on point with their movies, so I'm sure it'll be excellent."
"Besides the obvious jumping to conclusion...I would be concerned you already thought this by counting his meds before you **left** on vacation and counting them again on **return**

This speaks volumes by itself."
Awesome
Maybe he isn't racist but racism certainly isn't a dealbreaker for him. 
How on earth do you have sex at a gym daily?
Five inches is a very nice and enjoyable length; nothing wrong with it....................Ideal size.
"lol ""young professional"" and ""down to earth"" are the two most ridiculous descriptors someone can give themselves. Whenever I see those, it's an immediate eye roll from me because it means they think so highly of themselves and their accomplishments or they think so highly of themselves and how grounded they are. In both situations, the person is probably delusional and not all that fun to be around because they lack honest self-awareness."
This whole thread feels like a fucking prison rape fantasy and all the fucking idiots jerking off to the idea of prison rape are just fucking stupid. As if sex is prison is as hot as it is in porn. 
"You know... You could always respect his choices and not hookup, just putting it out there."
I'd rather take my chances with a government that doesn't let me get married rather than import hundreds of thousands of individuals who fervently believe in a dogma which would see me killed / imprisoned. 
"That's bullshit, how else are you supposed to use it, professionally?"
I think this is the humblebraggiest humblebrag I'll see all day. 
"Yes, because violently murdering someone is an appropriate response to finding out they are a piece of shit. /S"
"Because some aspects of his political party's platform are not the same as yours shouldn't be relevant.  Proceed with caution, but proceed, indeed.  I trust he's a willing partner in this..............before you  ""throw him around like a rag doll""."
I like the surprise when they take their pants off. 
Cause you're gay
"You have zero struggles, you said so yourself multiple times."
"You're not a slut. 

Quit being cheap. That will ruin you. 

You got three problems. You got shame. You got guilt. And you hooked up with a guy you didn't find attractive. Go for a hotter guy next time and always play safe. "
"You said comedic irony, you meant schadenfreude"
That's perfectly fine.  You're allowed to sleep with who you want to sleep with.  I stopped buying weed from a guy bc he voted for Trump. (and also because he was kind of a sketchy lowlife and my other weed guy is hot and flirty).
Say that in public and not your internet safe space
"Oh, look everyone. He's preaching self improvement but at the same time brushes off other people's problems. 

All it takes is a good look at one's post history to debunk a thread. "
"If you're not sure, use your words and talk about it. 

As far as vocab, friends with benefits are friends who you start hooking up with, fuckbuddies are people you regularly hook up with but you're not particularly friends with.

If you're asking because you're regularly hooking up with someone and aren't sure what to call it, you're probably fuckbuddies or FwB, but you should talk about it if you're starting to develop feelings."
"&gt; I feel as if people are stereotyping .

""Stereotyping"" would be assuming he's a white supremacist because he's a blonde white man. It's not stereotyping to assume that someone with a literal swastika tattoo is a white supremacist, given that that symbol is directly linked to white supremacist ideology."
"...But you know I didn't die. I had crystallized..
.And now I'm a glamazon, bitch, ready for the runway!"
All the time... It's so normalized that people don't realized how they are treating things completely different.  
Shit! You mean I shouldn't go up to them and ask to lick their nipples?
"&gt; he cried saying he should be having fun and clubbing and living life is what he wanted.

LOL so typical, wants all the benefits without paying the consequences. "
Does it get you hot thinking about emaciated Jews dying in gas chambers? What exactly is so hot about someone being a Nazi?
"I just don't think it's right to attack defenseless people who pose no physical threat to me. And honestly, just seeing a tattoo doesn't really tell me much at all. Maybe he's just a weak minded person who got caught up in some bullshit. Maybe he was vulnerable and got roped into a gang like many young men do. Maybe it's from the past and he isn't like that anymore. Or maybe he is a nazi and wants minorities to be violently killed. The thing is, I really don't know what it is. So I'm not going to impulsively assault him. And even if it is the latter, I don't see what I would be accomplishing."
"There's just something about a hot normal guy (as in someone who may not be considered the epitome of conventional sexiness, but who is still sexy in their own way) with a gorgeous ass, a good mix of muscle and fat. And he sends you a picture, whether it's a nude, in a jockstrap or in a pair of tight fitting underwear. "
