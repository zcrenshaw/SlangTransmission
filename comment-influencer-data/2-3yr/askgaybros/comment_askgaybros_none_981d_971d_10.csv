Fucking do it! What a pair of knobs
"Dude, you are asking for trouble if you are doing Grindr hookups at your parents' place.  "
"Amen, and DONT USE GRINDR IF YOU'RE UNDER 18!!! dont be a cunt, stick to doing your homework and clean your room."
Get this ... he's 31 and I'm 25. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that I'm way too good for him 
"Playing hard to get. I'm dumb as hell when it comes to stuff like that, so please don't do it.

"
"Well, in my opinion that's the kind of thing that can happen only once.

I would make that very clear to him. If there's something he needs to talk through, you'll listen and participate. If he needs to stop drinking to control himself, you'll support him in that.

Being sorry is a good start, not remembering is no excuse.

Relationships always involve give and take and we have to accept our partners less than admirable qualities. But really, physical violence is not that cute quirk that you accept.

One time."
Are you gay?
"I'm not anti-beard (some are sexy as hell), but the wizard beards gotta go unless you're actually Gandalf."
I mostly lurk because I'm always late when I want to comment.
Because horny. Horny make brain not work good.
"Definitely ship his ass back to mommy and daddy's. I've been in my relationship for 11 years and we go entire weeks without fucking. If he went and pounded my best friend because I didn't put out for two days, I'd probably pound his fucking face."
"Wow.. In what world does ""Sorry I fucked your boyfriend... So here, fuck mine."" make any sense? "
"We - me and my boyfriend - were sitting on the couch after party and watching a movie. Our friends went to sleep or simply black out already and since I don't do alcohol, I'm always the last one standing.

My drunk childhood friend (very gloomy at the time, because he didn't get the promotion in his job), that I always thought was straight, wrapped his arm around me and started talking some silly shit that made me laugh. He was getting closer and closer, and suddenly he started kissing my neck. I started laughing, because I thought he got drunk enough to take me for a girl.

Making that bull to stop was the hard part of the job, but finally I managed to defeat his muscles with the power of my sobriety. Then he gave me that sad puppy look and whispered ""please, don't reject me..."" and I realized that he didn't take me for a girl at all...

I blushed and started heavy breathing out of fear, because I never kissed anyone, I didn't do anything romantic at all. I was ready to run for my life, but he tried again and things have happened...

Well, not really. We were kissing for a while and then he got sleepy enough to start spooning me. He fell asleep, but oh well, I felt his boner on my ass, so it was an exciting, sleepless night to me."
"For me, I was on a study abroad type trip and still pretty innocent. They put us up in these rooms with small balconies just above a courtyard. The balconies didn't have much railing either, just kind've a bar.

Anyway, there was this shy meaty dude (MD) I was crushing on staying in the room next to mine. One morning I was yelling up to my balcony to ask my roommate to throw something down when MD wanders out to see if I was yelling to him. He's just wearing his towel like he just showered and leans up against the railing. I don't think he considered my viewpoint, because it was basically a straight shot up his towel just about 10 feet above my head. 

He was hung. I got really flustered and kept mixing up what I was originally trying to ask my roommate. Roommate figures out why I just turned red and busts up laughing. MD figures it out after my roommate makes a joke about being commando under the towel and then he turns really red and then ducks inside.

It ended up being a running joke that my roommate would bring up with MD later to get him flustered and it was really funny to see him get red and embarrassed about it."

"&gt; I got into a relationship a few weeks ago because I was desperate

so, this is wrong all the way around ... "
"Awww, cute man.

My current bf and I met online, on a gay gaming forum. I thought he was super cute, but neither of us was interested in an online relationship (been there, done that, wasn't much fun) so he was just my hot online friend for a good long time. 

Then at one point he said he was going to come visit his brother in my country, and did I want to meet him? I looked at my situation - was dating a guy who was rapidly revealing himself to be a psycho. If anything did happen with this guy, I wanted it to be legit and not feel bad about it. So I agree, and break up with the psycho the day before my train.

I get there. He's super cute in person, but we're still just friends. Awkwardly talking, getting to know one another in person, getting on quite well. Get back to his brother's. 

""We should see the city, I've always wanted to see &lt;capital city where he was staying&gt;.""

Yeah, sure, me too. 

""Oh btw we're staying in the guest room and we'll have to share a double bed, is that ok?""

...

Reader, we did not see much of the city that week."
Already bought his plane ticket 
"Coworker of mine and I had to go on a business trip and they booked us a room together because my company was cheap like that. He was hot as fuck and I had a bit of a crush on him so i was cool with it and he slept shirtless so every night I finally got to peek at him a bit. On the third day before work he was taking a shower and realized he forgot his clean clothes in the room. He comes out of the bathroom with just a towel on to get his clothes. As he walks out he forgot the hallway had smooth tile, sure enough he slipped. Caught himself but didn't catch his towel. I heard the thump, turn my head, and sure enough get a nice look at him him full nude trying not to fall. We just laugh it off while I'm trying to act like I'm not turned on. But apparently it kinda broke the ice with him because after that he just stopped giving a fuck and asked if it was cool if he slept in the nude. Got to see him nude several times after that. "
I don't want a friend to use my laptop and accidentally get redirected to pornhub.com/one-hung-slut-ten-horny-jocks-bare-gangfucking-with-piss
"Not if he's hot. I can teach him a thing or two about how people of my race can def deliver the fuckin goods. Sorta like a goodwill race ambassador who uses sex instead of diplomacy.

And I have to admit it, it feels kinda good having a bigot swallow his prejudices for a taste of my colored cock."
"I've had plenty of sexual dreams, but never a wet one."
"Also, get tested. You don't know who else he may have been screwing around with/how many times. Better safe than sorry."
"We were in the same year at university and I'd seen him around a few times, but I was too socially awkward to make any actual friends. 

Anyway, I'd started doing this thing where I'd get drunk and add hot people on Facebook and see what happens. So one night I add him, and I wake up the next day dying of the hangover from hell and my phone's there laughing at me with '...has accepted your friend request'. Great. 

So it actually took me another month after that to start talking to him. I very awkwardly messaged him and said something like 'hey, sorry for randomly adding you, I think you're on my course?'. Ugh, so embarrassing.

Anyway he was fine and sweet about it, then after a brief conversation about ourselves we kinda started this game where any status or photo that would appear, the other one would like it. 

Now, at this point I didn't even know he was gay. His profile said women. But I was 99% sure I'd seen his picture on Grindr before, but only briefly. 

So after liking a bunch of statuses and stuff, I posted that I needed help with my laptop. He then messages me and offers to come meet me for lunch the next day to help me sort it. So we meet up, and he's clearly nervous because he's literally babbling the entire time and just talks about anything and everything, while I'm just sat there staring at his face. Anyway, after all of that we only had an hour together. 

So we're talking again that night and his messages start to get followed by a single 'x' each time. So I start doing it back. After a while it moves on to 2, then 3 etc. 

During our conversation he asked me whereabouts I was living, and at the time I was commuting about a 40 minute drive in each day to uni. At which point he offers me a spare room in his house (student house). He makes the joke that I could pretend to be his boyfriend if anyone asked, at which point I pretended to be totally stupid and clarify whether or not he is actually gay. 

So the next few weeks I stay over a couple of nights to see what it's like living there, and all of a sudden we're fucking like rabbits and now we've been together for just over a year.

So yeah, it all happened so fucking fast but I wouldn't change it for the world. And now we're living in our own place and planning the future together and everything is amazing."
Be an asshole to our server. Instant no sex or second date move.
Seems like when you came out as bi your parents probably just assumed you were confused and put it out of their minds. Hopefully they'll remember now. 
If you play hard to get I'll let you win.
"Dunno what to say about the lack of roughhousing, but this stood out to me:

&gt;I do a lot of online dating, and it seems to make him uncomfortable. He thinks I'm going to get kidnapped, or killed. When I tell him I'm going to meet up with a guy I get many texts/calls from him asking if I'm okay and whether he should come get me.

Irrespective of your gender, being the object of male sexual desire is somewhat dangerous. Dudes are creeps and he's trying to look out for his younger brother."
It feels right.
I don't know who this dude is but I'm buying what he's selling.
"&gt; they ruin an attractive face well kept or not!

Well a lot of guys who got decent beard makes them even more attractive to me. I absolutely hate it when some completely shaves it off, they look younger in a bad way. "
"&gt; He offered me his boyfriend 

Holy shit dude you need to find some new people to hang out with"
"I'm a lefty through-and-through, but I can't stand the SJW-types that don't know anything about what they're supposedly supporting and can't recognize any negative traits to the groups the purport to defend. To me, it's lazy and irritating and wholly juvenile. 

You can be liberal and still despise the people that can't think for themselves and demand ""safe spaces"" and complain about ""microaggressions."" Coddling these incompetent children is only making it worse. I'm embarrassed to be associated with this group by virtue of being lumped into the same overarching political ideologies. This is where multiple parties would come in handy. "
I dont mean to be a dick...but 31 and still living with his parents.....and you bought the plane ticket back. I would just kick him out and let him figure out his next step.
Nope. I have 0 attraction to women but 20$ is 20$.
You should consult a therapist. You have too many phobias to lead a fulfilling life. The attitudes you listed can be overcome. Good luck. 
"I went with some friends to our usual spot in Kansas City and had quite a pre-game. Ended up blacking out at the bar while watching the drag show. Next thing I know, I'm being led out the door by a cute boy I could feel in my gut was really special. I knew I couldn't let him go, so I invited him and all of his friends over to my apartment (along with a few stragglers, one being a 30-year-old women and her 18-year-old sidekick). Once we got back, we kept dancing until his friends and the stragglers all cleared out. The two of us talked all night and watched the sun come up that morning. I drove him home, gave him my number, kissed him, and drove away the most excited I've been about meeting anyone before. 

Since then I've gotten to hear his remembering of the evening. He went with some girlfriends of his and noticed me across the room, watching the show, enjoying myself, dancing around (sounds like me). His one girlfriend was getting annoyed at him just looking, so after the dancing started, she shoved him onto me. We (I'm told) danced and kissed the rest of the night. He said he thought I was just looking to get laid and, though he was wildly into me, kept thinking I would never contact him again.

We'll have been together 5 months as of tomorrow!"
"Gays, amirite?"
Tell him exactly what you told us. I can see both sides of the coin here and it's actually endearing that your brother suddenly feels very protective of you but explain to him that you don't want him treating you any different. 
"According to the PMs I'm a cuck who deserved it , but really I just want him gone "
You can't just spill tea like that without giving us something to snack on.
Weren't you the guy who posted a month ago whose boyfriend of two months was jealous of your friends... how come you would celebrate anniversary?
"Ya you're right, kids never fuck in their parents homes while they're gone...that's really unrealistic. "

Don't do anything. Stop using words like fag to insult him and just try to be kinder. He'll become defensive if you confront him about it. He's gotta come out on his own terms 
It's happened to me. You'll forget the weirdness soon enough.

"Yup, every time I want to reply there is someone who has said the same thing. Example: the above comment"
"The guy was completely drunk. Should he really had taken advantage of him? Sounds like a really shitty thing to do, even more so to a friend."
Hell yeah.  Love a good ass.
Letting me do all the talking. I had a date with a guy once who never intiated any conversation. As a test mid date i said nothing and we were in silence for 5 minutes. And not a comfortable silence
I attract the guys I'm not attracted to.
Grindr would be the worst possible cess pool for anybody with anxiety and self esteem issues. People who only care about your physical looks and nothing else about you aren't worth a second thought. Meet people in real life not in apps.

I swiped right 
Where I went to college it was tradition for guys to once a year do a naked run across campus. I'm in the basement of the library writing a history paper and there's only this one long slender window. I hear chanting and cheering and I look up and about 30 dicks and butts march by. The window was so narrow and I was perfectly positioned at an angle where I saw no faces and no feet. Just dicks and butts on parade. 
Gay men are much less hung up about height than straight women. 
You know you could do all those things and just not jump on the first dick that comes your way right?
"
What do you suggest then? Sounds like a very cynical statement - I agree but you don't back it up with any suggestions or support 
being 18 can be pretty traumatising, vulnerable and lonely for gay kids! 
I'm 34 and wouldn't be 18 again if you paid me - It was a very awkward time. Also no one want to 'date' guys under 22 because they are perceived as too immature and 'not knowing what they want' - I wouldn't date an 18 y/o because of that - we all perpetuate the cycle! 
Compassion my friend - Compassion! "
"Honestly, with the risk of sounding a little overclinical? You sound like a gay man who has issues with homophobia. You identify culturally as a straight man, but as you get more and more horny that becomes less and less of an issue. Then you cum, and you don't have that any more, at which point you have difficulty reconciling your straight identity with your gay actions. 

I dunno how true that is, but that's kinda how it seems? I suggest you take a little time to examine your identity. Your behaviour would suggest that you might be at least bi - how does that make you feel? Why? Etc etc.

"
That he's really sorry and that he couldn't control his dick. He offered me his boyfriend since they're in an open relationship but that's not the kinda guy I am 
I think you made a big mistake.  That's your Dad's home; he paid for it.  Inviting an online hookup into the home wasn't a cool thing to do.
It's okay. I guess in retrospect he was just a gym bunny man child that cared more about sexual gratification rather than emotional fidelity.
He does not exist 
Why on earth would you do this?
"Husband and I, 37 and 36 respectively, have a knack of attracting impressionable but driven faglets in their early 20's who desperately need a father figure, and it allows us a pressure release valve for our paternal tendencies. The relationships tend to burn pretty hot for a few months, but we're constantly encouraging them to take reasonable risks, get out of their comfort zone, and move out into the world with their balls swinging, so they often move away, but always stay in touch, and come visit occasionally. 

As a sidebar, it's amazing to me how selfish their families can be, using guilt and ultimatums to keep them from pursuing their dreams. How shitty a parent are you that you stunt your child's life by trying to keep them from moving to pursue their aspirations?"

"in college, when I roomed with a friend who was, I guess I'd call it, ""straight but comfortable.""

he saw nothing wrong with jerking off with me in the room and loved talking about sex in general.

one night after we'd both come home from the bar and were horny and a little tipsy, he turned on some porn and I asked if he'd mind me watching it with him (under the pretext that I was curious to see what straight porn was like). as we watched the porn together, he started touching himself and I followed suit, with him jerking off to the porn and me jerking off to him.

it became a regular thing, with me eventually getting bold enough to ask to lend a helping mouth.

never interfered with the friendship, but I'm sure it helps that I was never ""into"" him emotionally as anything other than a friend. it was purely a matter of horny + proximity... the following year when I ended up moving off campus, the benefits stopped.

I never really questioned his sexuality or cared to. made no difference to me whether or not he was secretly bi."
Preach.
I like a good snuggle struggle. 
Did you just assume my preference?
"Sadly, many people don't understand bisexuality.  Some people will be so happy that a guy comes out as bi as they think it means that he will still ""settle down"" with a woman and that guys are ""just a phase"". Others will see it as the guy being scared to come out as gay.  Neither is true.  Being bi means one is attracted to multiple genders. One does not stop being bi when they ""settle down"" with another person.

Best of luck in your new relationship!"

"Did he suspect anything? I mean, if you're passable, you kinda have carte blanche tbh. Before I was out, I was allowed to go to sleepovers, have guys over, and my parents thought nothing of it- but had my parents stumbled on me watching TV with a girl they would have assumed she was there for one reason... 

Not to say that it's right, but I get it- there aren't many safe places to go and mess around at your age... Perhaps just be a bit more discreet and keep it to a minimum, or don't host anymore. 

Oh how simple life was back then, wake up in your friends basement and go down on him while his mom's right upstairs making y'all breakfast, none-the-wiser. "

Step 1: be attractive
I'm not educated enough to answer that properly.
I think this phase just did to beards what hair coloring and piercing trends did for those in the 90s. It's gonna be completely free to have whatever facial hair you feel like from here on out with less constraint from what society at large is doing.
This is some good advice. 5 years is a long time to just throw away if the love is strong. One time though 
"Some would consider me old at 75, and it is a bit shocking at times.  But life is rich and sex with my husband is still regular, but I am rarely a twice-a-day boy.  I think a key is a positive attitude and living full speed ahead.  I am retiring this month after 50 years as a lawyer.  I recognize that keeping the brain active is important and I will start auditing classes at Portland State U next week."

It was in a bathroom stall in my highschool. My knees were trembling the whole time. Then after a few minutes someone entered the stall next to us and took the biggest dump ever. 
"While I was on a camping trip with some buddies of mine in college, one of them got this gal who was camping at a neighboring site into his tent. They ended up having some good fun in there, and somehow neither of them realized that leaving a lantern on next to them while they were going at it gave the rest of us a nice shadow projection show of exactly what was going on in there.

After the deed was done, the rest of us broke out in cheers, whistles and applause. He poked his head out to find out what the commotion was, she figured it out before he did, and literally kicked him out of his tent buck naked before getting her stuff together and running off back to her campsite in quite a state. She was the only one present who didn't think the situation was utterly hilarious.

There's still an inside joke that he'll ""leave a light on for you"" over that whole thing, taken from some old motel commercial."

"I think I do fit the interior design gay stereotype pretty well. I do pay attention to detail and the appareance of interiors matters to me, it just bothers me if they dont look neat and satisfying. I don't really like or care for lots of decoration or the latest fashions though. I live  in Sweden and prefer the Scandinavian style of simplicity and elegance with mostly white colours and wood. So basically I am miles away from you OP. 

One thing, do you know about futons? The Japanese ones. They are frameless beds that are very practical for those with more spartan and simplistic desires of bed furniture. After you have slept in them, you just fold the futon and place it in some drawer or whatever. I can imagine a regular mattress directly on the floor would probably attract a lot of dust(there are reasons why they are placed in frames). "

That sounds like the start of a good porn
There was this super buff guy on my dorm floor. He was a wrestler and too big for me tbh. He used to walk around the halls shirtless to intimidate people. One day he was going to go take a shower and his towel fell off. That confirmed my suspicions that he was on steroids.
This is a v cute story. 5*s
Sounds like it. He's a twat
"Yes and yes.

This may sound like shitty porn plot, but if I was to make up a story, it would be a hell of a lot more interesting than this. Believe me, it's true. Also, pretty long, because I can't summarise for shit.

In high school, maybe 15 or 16 at the time, my best friend and I were almost inseparable. Let's call him Tom. Always sitting together in class, doing things after school etc. He knew I was gay and didn't think much of it. I had a crush on him big time and did anything possible to get physical contact from him. Some of the things I did to achieve that make me cringe so hard now, but he was never one to shy away from it. But I digress.

It was November and me and him decided to try doing No-fap-vember. Now I could lie and say that I had no ulterior motive with this, but I knew my mum was going away for a weekend in November and I wanted to see if anything would happen if it was just the two of us, super horny.
About 3 weeks into it, both of us still keeping to the challenge (or so he says, anyway), my mum went away for the weekend. My mum and I lived in a tiny flat and if I so much as tried to throw a party, our neighbours would be on the phone to my mum within minutes, so it gave me the perfect excuse to invite just him over. So I said to him 'Hey, Tom, how about you and me get pissed in my house, watch movies and eat pizza?'. He was game. 

We got a bottle of vodka, ordered pizza and started drinking. We were pretty pissed by about 8pm and were just sitting around in just our shirts and underwear, comfy like that. We were watching Skins (the UK show) via my laptop hooked up to the TV. For some reason, Tom decides we should watch porn. He puts on some straight porn and we just watch in silence. It was awkward and I just stared blankly at the screen. He then says 'Okay, we've seen some for me, now some for you' and he puts on gay porn. I don't know why he did it, but I wasn't about to complain.  
Naturally I started getting a bit excited, which he noticed, as we were just in underwear, and says 'Ha, you're getting hard, aren't you?' and grabs my crotch with his hand for a second. I was a bit surprised, but too drunk to care. From there, he put on straight porn back on the screen and laid back on the sofa, as did I. Without saying anything, he takes his dick out and starts slowly stroking it. I followed through since it felt like the right thing to do. We laugh at what we're doing, but we're still wanking. Being drunk, I thought 'What the hell' and grabbed his dick. He grabbed mine back and we started jerking one another off.  
After a minute of it, he gestures towards his dick and says 'You know you want to. And I've always wanted to try it'. He wanted me to suck him off. Me, being a horny, curious, gay teen, who has been dreaming of this for months, it took all of half a second to comply. He didn't take long at all and I distinctly remember saying, as he came, 'Dude, wtf, are you trying to drown me?', in a completely serious manner. I then finished myself off and we went back to watching Skins until we both passed out.

Now I would have assumed this was just a case of extreme horniness and drunkenness, if it wasn't for the fact that the next morning, both fully sober... We watched porn and wanked again. Not each other, but just together on the couch again.  

After that, he went home and I felt very confused. Was he gay? Was he bi? Was he just curious? Did he like me like that?  
Ultimately none of that mattered, because we never spoke of that night after. We never addressed what happened and he started going distant. As far as I could tell, he repressed that memory fully. Over the course of the next couple months, we went from best friends to barely acknowledging each other's existence. Not that I wanted things to change, but it was him who withdrew from our friendship. He's always been very defensive when someone joked about being gay and I think experiencing something confusing like that must have made him feel even more lost in his sexuality. He's always dreamed of a wife and kids, just like his big brother, and being gay would mean that would never happen for him. He went on to make some shitty friends who would bully me a bit for being different and not liking football, which felt shitty coming from someone you once held so close. He became a bit of a manwhore, having a bunch of girlfriends for the rest of high school and constantly trying to assert his masculinity at every point imaginable, since he had a bit of a feminine side to him and he hated it. 

It's been 5-6 years since that night happened and the last time we 'spoke' was 2 years ago, during an impromptu class reunion, and it was just a 'Hi'. I have recently blocked him on Facebook because I can no longer stand his smug face and his fake persona that he puts up for everyone. My crush for him went away very shortly after that night, all that was left was resentment for him treating me like shit for the following 2 years. Was he gay in the end? Maybe, I don't know and I don't care. If he is, he has ridiculous internalised homophobia and self hatred and I feel for him, but that doesn't excuse his shitty behaviour. Whilst I wanted to do things with him, it was ultimately his decision and his actions that made it happen, I just went along with it, which makes what happened later that much worse.

TL;DR 16, horny, got drunk, ended up wanking and me giving him a blowjob. Never spoke of it again and he treated me like scum for the rest of high school. We don't talk anymore."
All my straight guy friends know what grindr is lol
"Pack up his shit and leave it near the front door. That's what I did. 

Sorry dude. "
"I'm pretty vanilla... I love long walks on the beach, big dicks and fried chicken! "
I'm really looking forward to what he can accomplish once he's free from the day-to-day of Washington. One aspect I don't see get mentioned enough is that he proved a lot of people actually do want someone who's smart and talks to us like adults if we get the chance.
"If you're not adult enough to deal with the inherent risks of sexual activity, you shouldn't be having sex. To my knowledge, you're much more likely to pick up worms from your 4-year old nephew than from an adult sexual partner, but whether it's worms, crabs, gonorrhea, syphilis, or any of the other highly contagious STD's you can easily transmit by oral, if you're not willing to put on your big boy pants and deal with it, you shouldn't be sexually active. Luckily, the genuinely serious std's are more rare and much harder to transmit and/or much easier to avoid with the most basic precautions - condoms for anal, zero exceptions. 

**Edit:** reading my comment again, I think the flavor came off as a little alarmist and negative. The easily transmitted stuff is also relatively easy to deal with in the great majority of cases - pretty much a round of antibiotics, and if you're using a condom every single time for anal, even that stuff is pretty rare. I'm a sloot and I've never had an STD in my many years of slootery, but I've also never had anal sex without a condom with any person except my husband. All the same, if you pick up a case of the syph, put on your big boy pants and handle it.  :)"
"If he is treated aggressively and now, there's a chance. "
"I prefer kissing and cuddling to sex. I don't mind sex at all, but I prefer the closeness and romance of kisses and cuddles. "
"This.

If you're still living with your parents (whether you're out or not), don't host for hookups.  In fact, right now, you should put ""can't host"" in your profile."
Smash that bussy.
"Few things.

1) The world isn't black and white it's in color, and sexuality isn't black and white it's a rainbow.

2) Cheating is wrong regardless.

3) You picked the absolute worst way humanly possible on the planet to tell her and you got an equal response. 

4) you were a giant idiot in everything."
"Moreover, did you guys fuck? "
"&gt; faglets

LMFAO 

word added to my vocabulary"
Men can be thirsty and you probably look decent.
"Ha, I actually have had the opposite reaction.  I came out as bi to my family but I know they mentally filed it away as 'gay but afraid to say it.'  A few weeks ago I was shopping with my mom and I pointed out that one of the store employees was flirting with me and that I thought she was cute.  My mom was practically sputtering.  ""Bu-bu-b-b-bbu-but you're gay!"""
"Used to have a token hot straight roommate. He would regularly walk around shirtless but aside from that I of course didn't see him naked.

One day, I got home from work and his car was in the driveway, so I came in and shouted something to him right away about how he better stop jerking it on the couch because I was home early, but didn't get a response. Walked past his room on the way to mine and saw that he wasn't there, went to the kitchen on the other side of the house to grab a drink and didn't see him anywhere, so I assumed he had gone out for a run or carpooled with someone to the gym.

So I'm sitting in my room relaxing when suddenly I hear coughing from the back yard, right outside my bedroom window. We hung out on the back porch a lot but not in the yard itself, so out of curiosity I went to the window to see what he was doing out there.

Turns out he was completely naked laying on a towel on the ground and working on his tan. Once my brain caught up to my eyes and I realized what I was seeing, I turned away pretty quickly...I mean, I'd wanted to see that, admittedly, but preferably not as a secret voyeur. That's just creepy.

Anyway, I found out a few months later after we all went our separate ways (college house, and we all graduated around the same time) that he knew I'd seen him naked and was totally fine with it."
"Let's be honest most of those guys are 24+ and using ""Peter Pan Syndrom"" as an excuse"
"No, not particularly. "
"I'm not repelled by it, I just have no interest in doing it."
"I've hooked up with plenty of farm boys, it usually sucks though becuase they're either deep in the closet or really religious, which wouldn't be a problem, but they have tried to justify gay sex in the short moments after we finished... It gets wierd. They're usually really hot though and have been raised with some good values, which is nice. "
"Well I would personally consider oral *SEX* and mutual masturbation with a partner to be sex still, but I agree that I'd rather do that and cuddle/kiss than anal sex. "
"Grindr is for hookups, Tinder is more for dates, at least that's the way I see it."
Idk.  I wouldn't even want them to catch me watching STRAIGHT porn.
"Coming from a strict southern baptist upbringing, liking guys in general. "
I'm glad the clean shaven trend is over. I'm the opposite of you and now you know how I felt for so many years. 
"he needs to get on meds NOW.  i waited for 7-8 years before i went on meds and it finally progressed to where i was diagnosed with AIDS.  started on ARV meds, and within a few months my viral load was undetectable and CD4 started rising.  so yes, there is still plenty hope for your friend"
When they think we're going to have sex but I'm not even thinking about that. Hawkward.
"You sound like about twenty billion gay men's dream come true. I don't know you so I can't comment on how your personality comes over in conversation, but your hobbies/interests are far from bland. Do you want to be more approachable to attract men? If you are 'rarely in gay settings' isn't this kind of a non starter in that area? Where do you want men to approach you - on the bus?"
"Yeah seriously, I remember when my dad would freak out when I went camping in Olympic National Park with my lesbian BFF but had no problem when my FB and I would go on a fishing trip alone for three days. "
"Safe spaces aren't an inherently bad thing. It started in LGBT circles for a place where you will be welcomed and wont face bigotry.

Obviously in some situations it's gotten out of hand but the outright dismissal of safe spaces is silly."
They probably messaged you when they were horny 
Use Scruff. No one under 30 is real on Scruff. 
"ummm this is embarassing so throw away.

I like the smell of a guys ass. Maybe even after not showering for a day and after a good sweat. I hate the smell of poop but this isnt that smell. I cant describe it but it smells erotic. Love the stench of balls too. they kind of get this smell after a full day. I am a top so smelling those two things together will make me explode inside the bottom. I really like morning sex because thats when it smells good"
"Dominant. I naturally fall into the caring, big spoon who watches over someone like a little brother. 

Love caring for my guy like he is a prince, and having him completely sub out for me in the bedroom. I swear there was a gaysome comic that described my life perfectly. 


Edit) [This one](http://gaysomecomic.tumblr.com/image/46062413774)"
Breathplay. My husband started crying because he was scared he was hurting me
"With my best friend. We basically were brothers and felt too incestuous, so I stopped midway through it. That was years ago, which afterwards I was basically ""straight"" and didn't try anything with anyone else.

Then, the first time I gave proper head to another man I was hella nervous. Like hands shaking... But then it was over and I felt things I hadn't felt in a long time. I felt powerful. And horny... Oh so horny... Horny enough that the next day I had someone completely different stop by my place and we went all the way. All. The. Way... And now we've been dating for the last 14 months. And I'm still just as horny as when I met him then, hehe. "

"I don't really understand all the comments on here that are pussyfooting around telling someone to cut their nails. Just be blunt and say it. ""Hey man, why don't you cut your nails?"""
"Well, actually, he found out that there was a dildo.

I assume it wasn't signed... so just blame it on someone. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Yeah.........     about that. It's not nearly as fun as you think.

Mines been gone for two years and it's horrible. No possibility of dating no mater how much I want a relationship. It REALLY eats at you. Then loosing your identity and other things is fun too.

Any ways best of luck and short term lapses can be enjoyable. Hope it comes back soon."
I'm imagining myself working out.
Uhhh I'd say smooth instead of boring 
"Is this seriously the quality of questions this sub has come to. ""So guys, is it true that gay guys like other dude's asses?"" 

Really groundbreaking stuff here guys."
"Such a pure and cute post. Congratulations!💫🌟🎈🎉

I actually found it disgusting. Likes he's treating his boyfriend like currency. I told his boyfriend and the boyfriend to the best friend is deeply disturbed
Yup. I knew I was too single for this thread to not depress me. Time to eat my feelings.
I'm a girl too :) 
"It was 2 years ago.
I was giving my friend a blowjob when my dad burst into the room.
It was a memorable coming out to say the least."
"Yeah, but your best friend though? That's rough. Has the best friend said anything?"
"Well, I do, but since I'm a total bottom, I do that for different reasons."
"Uh, we made out and it was great. "
"I'm 28 and have never had one. 

But I also jack off at least once a day so that might have something to do with it..."
"I'm sure the Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry is a valid, unbiased source of health information."

"A lot of older men, especially the married white ones, seem to want to use me as a sex toy because I'm considered an Asian twink with somewhat of a nice ass"
So maybe he's a bottom for you but a top for other people? He's allowed to have preferences. 
"Well it's a routine occurrence at this point. When are you going to suck up your fear and just talk to him about it? If it continues like this without some dialogue between you two, you're just going to drive yourself insane thinking about what it means."
"Yeah, we had been working together for a couple years. But he's 100% straight, He's got a wife if that's what you were getting at. "
~stunned silence amongst the judges panel~
"I was talking to him one day, and I just said to him. ""I could really have a boyfriend"" and he simply said: ""Can I be yours?""
Basically... He wanted to date with me from a year, yet he never asked so I thought of him as just a friend.
I kinda always liked him, but when I met him he had a BF, but he broke up with him... And I started to date him 6 months after that.

It just happens..."
"Picture it: Sicily, 1922..."
Yep. After I drop is ass off at the airport. So basically I keep everything? Lol

Tinder is for when you want to collect guys to add to your Pokedex. Grindr is for when you actually want to throw your balls at them and take them home.
Put it in his ass rather than his mouth...
"In college we had these old open bay showers that they'd retrofitted with shower curtains. The shower room had a open doorway into the bathroom, so that through the doorway you could see one of the showers a few feet away. One day I was walking into the bathroom, looked to my right, and through the doorway I see one of the cuter guys in the shower with the curtain pulled back. He was facing the doorway drying his back with his towel. I got like 3-4 seconds of glorious full frontal before he looked up and I had to act natural. Jacked off as soon as I got back to my dorm room. And then jacked off again. "
"My body convulses a bit too much to do that, unless you want a headbutt."
"Having lived my whole life cut, I can't really say it's been the worst thing ever. But if I had a choice, I would have rather not been circumcized. 

If you want to do it for health, practical reasons, go for it. But don't do it to your kid with the only reasoning being ""well I have a circumcized penis so I want my kid to have one too"""
Don't lie to him. This memory will haunt him forever.
"I have just got together with a new guy (who is really ace).

I moved across the country (England) to start a PhD, and basically new no-one in my new town. I was super lonely for ages but our supervisors introduced us and we hit it off as friends. I had no idea he was gay, and just really liked being around him (he's one of those guys that people are kind of just drawn to at parties). He always made effort to chat to me, make me feel welcome and asked how I was settling in, which made me a bit weak at the knees because I thought he was super hot too.

A few weeks later, there were departmental drinks. I saw him with a girl I thought must have been his girlfriend (he bought their drinks, they spent ages sitting close, similar styles, she made jokes about him and touched his arm). After a while though, we got talking about politics (no biggie as we were friends and had been hanging at conferences by this point). I mentioned being gay and he went 'Yeah, it's tough', which kind of threw me, but I thought he was just agreeing with what I said. Later on he asked to sit next to me (the pub was *loud*) and brought it up again, making it clear. My jaw almost smashed through the floor.

Next day I saw him at a conference, and my stomach had loads of butterflies (my super hot friend was now a prospective date, but there was no way I would ask him). We hung out a bit and went to work in the library later, where I couldn't really focus because my head was full of him. Later, we headed to the conference again and after it had finished he asked me and a bunch of other grads out for drinks. I went, got way too drunk and ended up with just him hours later in a pub. I drunkenly made a move, we kissed, he asked me to stay at his ('no sex...just a cuddle', which happened as planned). The next morning I was really nervous he was just playing, but he made me feel really welcome and I stayed for a bit.

Ended up asking him on a date, he accepted. I was a whole lotta nervous but we got a little drunk again and he said 'Could you not tell I was flirting with you for weeks? I tried sitting next to you at the pub and engineered that whole drinks just to get you out', I was fucking dumbstruck.

Anyway, it's been a month of dating now and it's going great. Sometimes cute stories do happen!"
"Years ago, a drag queen told me, ""Oh, honey, don't worry about that [why you are gay]. You'll only drive yourself crazy."" 

I realize that it will remain a theoretically interesting question, but I would hope that money is being spent on research that might actually help someone someday rather than focusing on something that isn't, in and of itself, a problem. "
"Naw, you ain't curious. You're feeling fat and you wanted validation.

You already know you're muscular bordering on very. You've obviously put time into your body and you like attention."
"I would honestly laugh it off and say... sorry you saw my dildo in the shower. If he gets weird about it, that's his own damn fault.

True Story: At my old job, years ago, I was not out to anyone and I'm pretty sure no one had a clue. One day my coworker and I were talking about a car and we couldn't really think of the specific specs for the car so I pull out my phone to look it up. He stands next to me to see what I pull up, and I open safari on my phone and it opens up the last thing I was looking at which of course happened to be some Sean Cody video of a guy getting rammed. I immediately started laughing and said ""oh shit sorry man."" and continued searching for the car specs. Later on he was like, hey man I didn't know you were gay but that's cool. Then months later he confessed to me that he let a guy blow him once in college. 

ANYWAY, play it cool. It's not that big of a deal."

"Idk it's complicated. It depends how homophobic/condescending they are? I had a really good friend since we were kids. He turned very religious and with it very judgemental. Told me its ok to be gay as long as I don't act on it. It was a sin etc. Jesus wasn't in my life etc etc. Among many other shitty comments. I told him it was ok to be straight as long as he didn't act it, for a brief second he realized what it was like but didn't change. Long and short of it I just told him to go fuck himself. Don't miss him, don't care, don't have time for miserable cunts in my life. People who think I'm sick in the head, going to hell. Who needs that."

"In a far distant world, that might be me one day. Looking back at myself now and today and being horrified at what I'm looking at. All is lost right now for me. "
"I lurk because I'm mostly interested in what other people have to say. Definitely not in the closet IRL though. I'm not view only, I'll speak up when the mood strikes me."
"I'm sorry. I suddenly got an image of a guy going ""mooooo"" in bed while taking it doggy style. 

I'm sure your thing is much sexier than that."
"DISCLAIMER: Your crush probably doesn't like you back so chill and go out and meet some actual gay guys, don't bother the innocent straighties. Toxic masculinity is hurting them enough.

Most of these posts come from people in high school or college. Gay guys that age, who have just discovered their sexuality, are much more likely to experiment/have sex with people they are already close with, even if they're not their usual type. Been there, done that.

In a way, the chances of them being interested in are higher, the younger they are.
