"Telling your son that you love him would be a very, very helpful thing for him to hear right now. He probably believes that his whole family hates him, and knowing that this is not the case will make him feel a lot better.

I would also advise you to tell your wife and older son that you love him still and are okay with it. It may take a while, but I think this will have a major impact on getting them to accept him.

You can feel free to ask him about his love life and sex life, but as with any conversation between a parent and child about sex, expect it to be incredibly awkward and uncomfortable, and he will probably refuse to answer you.

I would _not_ ask him if he was molested as a child. The odds that he was molested as a child are very low, and are no higher because he was gay. There is no evidence that there is any link between being molested as a child and being gay. This is a stereotype among people who don't understand or accept being gay and want something to blame it on.

I would also strongly advise against telling him not to tell anybody else. For one, given the reaction he got from his family, he probably already plans not to. But I hope he tells everyone, because as hard as this is to understand for people who are not gay or who are gay but closeted, your life gets _a lot_ better when you are no longer in the closet. Maybe not immediately, but it really does. Being able to be open and not having to pretend that you're somebody you are not lifts a huge burden off of you and makes it possible to finally be happy instead of constantly being terrified. He might lose some ""friends"" in the process, but in the long run it is so worth it. 

Thank you for not rejecting him. You are in for a long and bumpy ride, but knowing that his father still loves him will be very helpful. And having somebody in his family that can stick up for him to others in his family will also be very valuable. You are in a really strong position to change hearts and minds on this issue, and to help your family become closer and more loving. I hope you take this opportunity."

"He's three, bro. You explain that adults do silly things and you were just tickling daddy and you would never hurt him because that's bad and the reason he said a bad word was because sometimes people get surprised when they don't expect to see people behind them, then you give him something distracting to do and redirect the conversation to something that will be more interesting to him.  
  
He's growing up in the age of the internet. He's going to see lots of things before you think he's old enough to see them. Sex? Okay, inappropriate. Unintentional momentary exposure is unlikely to ruin him for life unless you act like what he saw was something horrible and terrifying that he should be alarmed about. He's going to take cues from you on how to feel about it, so don't panic."

"Hmm... I love when he wraps his arms around me, while he's sleeping. It's never ever comfortable, but it's so sweet that he acknowledges/wants (?) my presence even when he's not conscious.

He also has some weird need to keep me warm. All the time he gives me some blankets, his hoodies or sweaters, even if I'm perfectly fine. It's annoying, but also so cute that I usually can't oppose.

But my favorite is probably the talk we have after we do something kinky. He's so caring, his voice becomes so soft and he's asking me how I feel, or if am I ok etc.."

"CONTACT THE PATIENT ADVOCATE.

Going to the nursing supervisor/charge nurse/Unit manager can only get you so far; they only have power over the nurses themselves and not the Docs, and in this case it's the both you're having problems with. One thing you should also do is take names/document everything you see.

The patient Advocate can address all of these. I suggest you print out and share what you wrote, and hand it to the Advocate along with what you tell them (it's an emotional time and you might leave something out verbally).

If, in the *extremely unfortunate* case nothing improves or gets worse, you can contact the media. However if you do this, you need to provide them with everything you documented, with times, ect. (I.E. ""Nurse X came into the room at 23:46 to hang X IV drip. I asked him to change gloves as I noticed cross contamination"") ect.

Good luck, OP. I wish you and yours the best."
A guy once looked at me.
"Had to bust out the old throwaway for this one.

Back when I was closeted in college I had a good friend that I used to hang out with who had a really hot straight roommate. This was one of those really close friends that you hang out with all the time. The type you just come over unannounced and it's cool. 

So the roommate was about 26 with the real American man look, 6'3, light brown hair, ripped, blue eyes, you get the picture. We used to lift together but we never got too close. I always found him really attractive. 

One day I came over to his house particularly late unannounced. My buddy was half awake after having a long day at work. We hung out for about an hour, had a few beers, then he passed out on the couch watching netflix. I got up and got on my computer in the other room when I heard his roommate come home. He just came back in from a night out drinking with some friends. We made slightly drunken small talk and the entire time he was looking at me differently. I could tell something was odd but I wasn't sure what to make of it. He walks out of the room and I continue on the computer. Next thing I know I feel his hands on my shoulders. He starts to rub my neck and it feels amazing. At first I was a little taken back by it but I wasn't about to say no. Without realizing it I let out a slight moan after he pressed particularly hard on my back. He then moves to my ear and whispers, ""you like that?"" I just nod slowly and his hands start going slowly down my back. At this point I start to connect the dots in my head and I turn to look at him behind me just to have his face meet mine and we start to make out. 


Without any words being said, only eye contact, I follow him into his room and he throws me on his bed and rips my pants off. He then gives me the best head of my life. The kind where you know they've done it before. I then blow him too and we cuddle. 

The next few months were the same thing. I would come over and chill with my buddy and then my buddy would go to sleep and I would fuck his roommate. We started with just blowjobs but it soon moved to anal. Damn, I miss college. "

"The last bit is aftercare. Any kinky thing which involves one person letting go of control needs that to follow. If you're going hard spanking, biting, teasing, being rough to someone, you need to follow that with affectionate aftercare to make sure they go back to normal. Subspace and subdrop are real things so you need to take care of a sub after you finish. 
It's very cute but it serves a very specific purpose and your bf is smart to do it.

"Usually, I don't. Unfortunately, my boyfriend gets turned on by the sight of me wearing glasses with his cum all over them, so I wear them while giving him a blowjob and after that..."
"Saying all Muslims are dangerous: wrong.

Saying Islam does not cause these things to happen: also wrong.

The same can be said of Christians.

**Religion puts these ideas in their heads and is the major driving force behind violence against us.** It's the individual that carries out the actions though. While living in a religion-dominated country, the brainwashing is stronger.

My boyfriend was friends with a Muslim family and they made their trip to Mecca. Their 6 year old kid, not knowing any better, mentioned to someone that they had a gay friend in the US - Fatal mistake. They had to run for their lives while people tried to kill them. That family is now Atheist, living in the US, and spends their time debunking other Muslims.

I don't have the stats on hand anymore, but I remember seeing one survey that showed that of the Muslims that come to the US, they are slightly more supportive of gay rights than Christian Evangelicals in the US are. My best explanation for that is it's caused by the kind of person who wants to flee a country like that, vs the ones that would prefer to stay.

Our upstairs neighbor is Muslim and also fled the middle east over this. When we asked him what he thought of us, he just said ""my Quran says nothing against you. Those pages are ripped out."""
"&gt;So I'm thinking of going to my son's place over the holidays. ... How do I apologize to my son for not saying anything that night?

You already know what to do. You show up alone, apologize and give him the support that the rest of his family is failing to provide him. Go easy on the question. Do not ask if he was molested. Ask him if he had a safe and happy childhood, if there was anything you could have done differently. He'll figure out what you're asking without you sounding like an ignorant bigot that thinks all homosexuality is the result of molestation. 

&gt;I guess I'll be okay if he finds someone for himself but I don't want him to tell anyone. Is it okay if I tell him to not tell anyone? And who else has he told?

No. That is not acceptable. Tell him you trust him to make good decisions that will not place himself in danger. I guaranteed he has spent years considering the consequences of telling people. 

Also, you need to get your older son to back off. You were the bad cop when they were kids. Now it's time to be his protector. You don't have to understand the how or why, only that he's family, you love him, and it is your responsibility as his father to make sure he is healthy and happy. Let him tell you what he needs, then help him achieve those goals. "
"&gt;Personally I like ""My son likes boys."" I think it's funny and doesn't take the situation so seriously.

"I'll share my experience with this:

I had fallen for my straight best friend at the time. I was a freshman in college and wasn't out yet. At this point, he was going to military school across the country, so we could only converse via Facebook chat. I had recently realized my strong feelings for him and it was causing me physical pain. I really suck at lying and it felt even worse to lie to someone I trusted so much.

One night I couldn't take feeling shitty anymore, so I decided to not only come out to him, but also tell him how I felt. We were talking in the chat and I told him there were two things I had to tell him and that I was worried about the second one in particular.

The first part he was fine with. For the next part, I told him that I had developed feelings and that I couldn't really help it. I didn't want these feelings and I offered to give him some space since we tended to hang out a lot. He took about 5 minutes to respond which seriously freaked me out. I thought our friendship was over. But he came back saying he understood that I couldn't help it and he didn't want to spend less time together.

This was obviously incredible. I think once I told him, most of my feelings went away very quickly because it essentially confirmed that nothing is going to happen there. If anything, it made our friendship even stronger.

TL;DR: Came out to my best friend and told him I was falling for him. He took it well and he's still my best friend."
He was probably filming you.

"First of all, please don't commit suicide. It doesn't stop things from being bad, it just stops them from getting better. 

It seems like every young gay guy deals with this at some point or another, but it does get better. Yours also seems more like a case of depression than it does just dealing with being gay.

"Ex Rentboy here. No names but I have hooked up with a few celebrities in my time as a professional hoe.

Youtuber (I know, not what you'd consider a celebrity), (gay) total power bottom, loved riding me, but was on meth the whole time. Went for a few rounds and loved being slapped around.

Singer (straight) surprised at how great his ass was and how subby he got. Kept saying how he wanted me to ""rape [his] hole"". 

Singer (gay) Thought he was going to top me and I was super shocked as he was very fem in personality. Offered me twice as much to plow me but my hole is off limits so I called a friend and we had a threesome. Paid me double anyway :P

Athlete (straight) Vanilla guy, no real kinks, just wanted to have someone to fuck him every month or so and didn't want it to get out. One of my favorite repeat clients

CW Actors:
-1 (straight) hit me up on grindr of all things as he was staying in my hotel (yes, I have a day job too!) I came up with an excuse to take up something to his room, like towels or something, and we fucked for about an hour while I was on the clock. Giant mushroom head on his cock, leaked precum like you would not believe. Fucked him 3 more times before he checked out. 

-2 (Gay) Whew buddy. Not only did this one have a secret boyfriend near me before he came out, but I had the biggest crush on him. Super shy, super quiet. The unattractive secret boyfriend did all the talking, and we had a perfectly enjoyable threesome

-3 (straight) I can tell Berlanti had some fun with this one before I did!! MEGA ULTRA BOTTOM, could not stop getting dick in his ass. Would beg for it literally the second we left his hole. I was one of 5 guys on this one. Super hot group scene. He was on coke.

Youtuber (Gay) found me on scruff when he came to my town. Huge crush on this one. Wanted to be restrained and plowed, something I love to do. Gave this one my all and really gave it to him, edging him and not letting either of us cum til we literally could not stand it anymore. Spouted like a geyser and when he couldnt move I kept fucking him. Screamer, so I had to shove his jockstrap in his mouth to shut him up. Tried slapping me, getting me riled up to be dominant and take it out on him and BOY DID IT WORK.

Athlete (straight) Was really into the power play thing. This guy wanted me to be on my knees servicing him, eating his ass, calling him master the whole time- but only after Master asserted dominance. Wanted no argument from me whatsoever. Knew he couldnt fuck me and thats what made it hotter (even though he tried more than once!) Wanted someone that he could kind of humiliate and treat as a punching bag. Hot for him, a paycheck for me.

Porn stars: 

1-Dated this one. Cute italian twink who looked latino. super subby bottom, loved being choked. Had way hotter than me scene partners and I played around with them as well sometimes. Loved being choked, but also loved meth. 

2-Met this one in Key West while I was with my one ex (who also did some amateur porn but nothing you would have seen). Tattoos everywhere, big on the meth. Most likely steroids too, with how rough he was aging. Decent dick, meaty ass- wanted to fuck my ex while I fucked him, and there were no complaints there! Ended up giving my ex Hepatitis. 

3- HOT star, one of my favorites. Super fine and great hair. Its too bad he sounds like hes seriously concussed everytime he opens his mouth- Not that I didnt find a way to keep his mouth full! Met him at a porn star ""Meet and greet"" at a local bathhouse which always seems to turn into a ""Greet with your Meat"" event. Was blindfolded in a sling and took on a lot of comers, then went back to the porn star suite and fucked with some other dudes there. Orgies are fun :P 

4- Different porn star event, same bathhouse. Bitchy and rude, probably to make up for his receding hairline and tiny dick. Just super lazy and bored the whole time he was taking dick from us and didnt bother hiding it. Meth is a hell of a drug.

5&amp;6- More bathhouse fun, and these two were FUN! Just great energy the whole time, really into each other and all of us. Possibly on Molly. Making out a lot. 


There are more, and I can go into more detail on some but thats enough of a teaser for now! :P"

I ended up doing an English project with him, he invited me over to his place and he ordered us pizza and he actually DID the homework to prepare for it which surprised me. We talked and he turned out to be really nice. He ended up standing up for me when a teacher told me off for using rainbow colours in my book (I colour code my notes, still do) because I was one of the few out gay kids, he got detention for that and came out to me that day.

"probably being woken up by a blowjob

one night a couple years ago, an old fuck buddy who I hadn't seen in months randomly showed up on my doorstep, drunk off his ass. he said he was driving through my neighborhood and really needed to pee, so he thought of my house first.

I let him in, and after he did the needful, I took his keys and told him to hang out until he sobered up before driving home... at the time, my bedroom was the only room in the house with a decent air conditioner and it was a hot summer night, so we sat in my bed chatting and watching Netflix before falling asleep together.

a couple hours later, I woke up with my dick poking out from the hole in my boxers and him going down on me. that escalated pretty quickly into him fucking me, before we went back to sleep (this time naked and cuddling)... in the morning, I fucked him, we both showered, went out for breakfast together, and that was actually the last time i ever saw him."

Churches hang on to the old interpretation for a few reasons, I think, not the least of which is they don't like to be proven wrong or have someone else tell them what they're supposed to think. Also, once you get into Biblical interpretation you're dealing with a few thousand years of doctrine that's been passed down, and it's pretty hard to convince someone that what's been thought to be true for thousands of years is wrong.

"I think it's gross. Go to a bathhouse for that stuff. It's this type of behavior that gives gay men a bad name. 

Unless your gym is in a gay neighborhood and with mostly gay members then whatever. But seeing as in your average gym most guys are straight, I find it trashy that you would so gladly would hookup at your gym. One thing is to meet a guy at a gym, check him out and start talking to him, nothing wrong with that. But doing sexual stuff while at the gym, that's just trash. 

I'll never forget once a guy was cruising me big time at the gym. I am assuming he saw me on Scruff or something which is how he knew I was into dudes. Every time I go swimming I go the hot tub after which is located in the men's locker room. Most guys go in there naked, but I don't just because I am already wet in my trunks from the pool so no need to strip down further. I get in the hot tub completely alone and it's a big one, holds about 10 people. This guy takes off his towel, naked and literally sits right next to me (like 1/2 a foot) with the empty hot tub. I got so annoyed because even though he was cute, and I would totally top him, I was just relaxing and found his behavior just made me uncomfortable. So I scooted in the opposite direction of him, then he just kept staring at me for like 5 minutes and I forced myself not too look at him. He finally gave up, stood up, and bent over so his asshole was clearly visible in my face, then got out. 

I didn't find that hot, sexy or appealing. Like I said he was a cute guy too. If he had more tact and class, he could have just striked up a conversation with me and go from there. If he wanted to get with me, that route definitely would have worked. 

Come on guys, have some class. "
"Was at a work pizza party once and I was on a team that  got dismissed late and I was ravenous...Then a guy who had already eaten jumped ahead of me in line and got the last piece of pizza.   Not sure I've ever been that mad.  Even though more came about 15 minutes later, I was so hungry that I wanted to actually harm him.  Mind you, this was over 30 years ago.  I know people change a lot in that time, I certainly did, but I swear I would recognize him and his little smug smirk that I should've smacked off his face all those years ago"
"Yes, we talk about hot guys all the time. Sometimes we even bang them."
"It's his right to subject himself to it, but he's deceiving himself. If he decides to marry a woman, things will probably get very messy very quickly. I feel bad for him and his potential wife. "
But the dick you consume does. 
"I only ever do as a joke, or after I've had 6 or so margaritas. 

During sexy times? Nah. I probably have because I was wasted, but not really as a serious thing. Sir is a much better term IMO"
"""have you ever fucked a hairy man's asshole because that shit isn't for pussies."""
Everything works when you make it up.
Is it though? I feel like we may be using that word too much because it's the last one I would have used to describe that. 
Because its like looking at cute puppies  on aww. I rather see posts like this then omg i fucked bareback now i have hiv most likely arhgggg.....
"Can I just add, if he's trying to encourage you to go without protection, it doesn't matter what his testing status is. He's probably encouraging others to go without protection too. Even if he seems trustworthy, even if he's on prep, even if you're on prep, there's still a host of other annoying things you can pick up. Just because they're treatable doesn't mean they aren't annoying, potentially costly, or a pain in the ass (often literally). Worst part? Some are asymptomatic for a while, you could be passing them on to others unintentionally, and that's an awkward phonecall you never want to have.

Protect yourself first."
all of them lmao
Being part of a minority does not mean you inherently have sympathy or understanding for your own or other minorities. Gay people can be racist and bigotted too. Same goes for any minority.
"Honestly, no, lots of the anti-muslim stuff is from users I see here frequently "
"You shouldn't only focus on white guys. You're limiting your dating pool when there are plenty of black, latino, MENA and other asian  guys.

We can't say ""white guys are racist for only wanting to date white guys"" and then as POC say ""I only want to date white guys"". Makes no sense.

"Doing chores.  He cares less about our physical space than I do.  So when he does chores, I know it's 10% that he wants it done, 90% that he loves me.      "

Half of western Muslims think homosexuality should be outlawed. Let's not pretend it's not a dangerous ideology. 
"Because it fits their modern day agenda.

Obviously they've thrown out the parts that don't."
"There are two types of cheaters: One is simply incapable of monogamy, and there's really nothing interesting to talk about there. These people just have to up-front about wanting a sort of ""open"" situation, and they need to be with someone who's also okay with that. On the other hand, this other type of cheater is someone who's been in a committed relationship for a significant period of time and they're starving for affection, or sex (men often consider them to be the same thing). Their partner may be dealing with somethinglike depression, or they may have have become too caught up with something like their career, or raising the children...and they simply lose their drive for intimacy. If the cheater isn't getting it from the person they're with, then they'll inevitably start looking elsewhere.

From what I've noticed, the latter scenario is, by far, the most common reason that people cheat....and it's especially more likely to happen when people are older and have a lot more responsibilities to deal with, and ""baggage"" with someone: A legal marriage, children, a joint bank account, etc. So, I mean the high school and college kids on Reddit would likely tell everyone to ""just leave each other"" before they'd ever consider cheating, but it's really not that simple for a lot of people. Otherwise, infidelity wouldn't be as common as it unfortunately is. These cheaters would rather risk sneaking around ""for just that one thing"", than having a sure shot of losing 50% of everything, and trying to start all over again when they're in their 30s, 40s, 50s or older."
why engage these people at all? 
In hindsight I had absolutely zero obligation to sign. But I was 19 and terrified that I had done something wrong. Not emphasizing for ego purposes but this guy was super famous and I really thought he could do damage if he wanted to
I'm more of a staff guy myself tbh

"This only applies to some men, but smile. Some guys just have the most stunning, beautiful smile ever, making me weak in the knees. It's just so utterly charming, I want to pounce on them."
"In my early thirties, and while ""gay"" is the best response, ""likes guys"" is a lot less creepy for someone my age."
"I've posted on a dif account to /r/twinks a lot and cam modeled for one show before. The amateur posts on /r/twinks were fun, it was a confidence booster and got a few funny PMs out of it. I reverse googled searched the images after deleting them and found them on tumblr blogs which is kinda flattering. It's funny because one of them was a foot fetish blog and my feet weren't even the focus of the picture or anything, they just so happened to have been in the pic LOL

The cam show was eh, I wasn't fully prepared to be the peoples' ""perfect fantasy person"" that they fawn over or anything and I never even kissed someone before at the time so I kind of freaked out and never did it again.

As for the face thing, I had a masquerade mask on and I look like the most normal blonde hair blue eyed person ever anyways (literally have someone at least once a week tell me they know someone who looks *just* like me) so I'm not really worried about that."
"Strangely enough, I love when he asks me how my day has been. And when he scoots closer to me on the couch or touches my knee occasionally when he's driving. "
"started jerking off when I was like 9-10... at that age, it wasn't necessarily even sexual in nature, I just really liked the feeling.

somewhere around 11-12, I found my dad's straight porn VHS tapes and I'd use that to jerk off to when my parents weren't home, but mostly I used pictures from my wrestling magazines, underwear packaging, and other pictures of shirtless guys from magazine advertisements. I'd fish my sister's Cosmos and Vogues from the trash, cut out any hot pictures of guys, and then return them back to the recycling bin.

when I was around 15, we finally got internet and I completely binged on all the gay porn pictures I could find (this was in the dial-up days before downloading or streaming videos was a thing). I've always been attracted to guys around my own age, so when I was a teenager I was looking for barely-legal twink porn."
"What we eventually said came down to that but little children brains are weird, I don't want him with ""that"" image in his head for who knows how long. We did say that it's something adults do but I once heard that you should be careful with terminology like that. Like I said, their small brains are weird, what if he now thinks that any adult can do that to him because ""it's what adults do"" or I am overthinking..."
"What's with so many gay men looking down on other gays for enjoying twinks? Like, it's not a threat to you or your being. We all have different tastes, and the world would be boring if we all liked the same thing."
How hot are we talking? I only tolerate domestic violence from 9's or above.
"Yes, PrEP will prevent your eggs from descending from your ovaries to your uterus, this is why it is used. It is the primary means of preventing child birth for men who have sex with men. "
You should totally hang out with this guy again.

I used to think gay people were so oppressed and such a minority that they wouldn't think to cheat on each other in relationships.
"Some of the tops things I learned since coming out when I was 21. (Currently 26)

**For Relationships**


* Give yourself some time to learn what you want in a relationship. Date around to learn what really matters to you. (this includes sexually too) 

* Don't overthink things and just enjoy yourself. (Dating should be fun, not stressful) 

* Be open and communicate. (I cannot stress this one enough) 

**Other Gay Shit**


* Self acceptance will come in time. You just have to get used to who you are and being open about yourself. (It's not an overnight process)

* There is no way to fit into the gay community except by being gay. People see the gay community as this club that you have to earn a membership to. Just meet other gay people and hangout. (Don't get involved in all the clique bullshit.)

* Work on yourself. This includes going to the gym, eating healthy, learning different hobbies, etc. (this one doesn't really pertain to being gay it's just something you need to do to feel confident)

One last piece of advice, don't fall in love with your straight friends.

"Whenever my boyfriend and I haven't interacted for a while when we're both doing things on our PCs in our office room, he walks over, sits on my lap and kinda rolls into a ball, wanting some attention and affection. It's really adorable and is something I always look forward to.

Despite me being the significantly bigger guy in the relationship, I'm usually the little spoon (I like it plus I can't sleep as a big spoon anyway). He always uses my upper back as a pillow and growls really quietly when he first falls asleep. 

Also no, he's not into pup play, but I can see how you'd think that haha. "
"Wait... are we not obsessed with pecs? I mean... definitely love a nice ass, but damn, a nice chest is fun to play with and enjoy viewing."
Congrats on the sex?
"""So, this is awkward, but..."""
"When they're too shy to meet my eyes when they're talking to me. 

The domineering, sadistic, intimidating axe-murderer inside me loves that *shit*.

Also, guys who are just incredibly awkward body wise. Especially when they try to sexy and it just looks so... funny. It's hilarious and charming all at the same time."
"It kind of annoys me when people use Christianity as a whataboutism argument. The percentage of extremely homophobic christians world wide versus percentage of extremely homophobic muslims world wide don't even compare. Don't believe me? Look at the percentage of Muslims in a country and the punishment for being homosexual in a country. It's not pretty. There's a big difference in the level of homophobia between muslim countries and Southern Baptist-esque homophobes that /r/askgaybros doesn't seem to be able to differentiate.

Now to paint any group with a wide single brush is wrong, but you shouldn't give one group a free pass just because there's another group like it that's not as bad. If Christian dominant countries were going around beheading and jailing/killing homosexuals on the scale Muslim-dominant countries are, people would not be giving them a free pass on things. We shouldn't be treating Islam as a special religion that we ""just need to understand"" instead of having them modernize their religion, much like Christianity has bit by bit in the past 100-200ish years.

There's a fundamental problem with Islam (as most followers follow it) and homosexuality that needs the religion to modernize rather than be excused.        "
"It's not a gay night club, it's a gay sex club/bathhouse "
"He's probably sick of this mentality:

&gt; Our sex ... [is] more about me getting off than pleasing him.

Just because someone is submissive doesn't mean he doesn't want to get off too. I find it fascinating that you've been having all this sex that ""is more about you getting off than pleasing him,"" and you're totally fine with that, yet you recognize that it sucks to have sex and not have your needs met.

Talk it out and see if there's anything you both enjoy, but hopefully this is a lesson to you that sex should be enjoyable for everyone involved. "
