"&gt;What the fuck is wrong with the gays who are trivializing HIV? 

They weren't burying their friends 20 years ago. "
This is so wholesome. You have to learn to sign now. 
"Boobs are like lions. It's interesting to stare at them when they're behind some barrier, but I wouldn't like to have them released on my face. "
She is a witch and believes you are an incubus who will steal her familiar away. I would recommend blessing your windows and doors with sea salt to ward away any of her curses. 
"Well, Trump is a steaming piece of shit and anyone who hasn't recognized this by now is beyond help."
"Do what you were thinking and sneak into her room and take it back, then repeat after she takes it again.

If she wants to use the same dildo as her son, she has to politely ask, like an ADULT."
Find a new job and then sleep with his dad.
"Recently, our puppy jumped on the bed in the middle of fun time and wouldn't stop barking at me.

I pushed her off and she came back up. So I pull out and she lays on his chest panting and smiling like she protected him or something lol."
"My partner making a running jump into my bed with silk sheets, resulting in him sliding off at full speed and landing bare ass on a floor grate heater. He ended up with a nice waffle pattern burn on his ass, and I couldn't stop laughing. 

"
"I went through a brief phase of wondering if I was gay after I broke up with my ex. Thought about experimenting and matched with a couple good looking guys on tinder. Thought I'd subscribe to the sub while I was trying to figure things out. Turns out I'm not but thought I'd keep an open mind, anyway."
This sub is probably more pro-masc than most lgbt ones. But less pro-masc than the name would suggest. 
How is sending ass pics platonic? Honey. No.
"You should definitely learn ""Hi, how are you?"", *then* ""Wanna bang?"" It's just polite. "
the guy is literally jacking off in front of you
"This happens to me and I'm very, very gay."
Straight men can ask gay bros too
When I was pretty young I was in the car with my parents and we passed an amazingly hot guy standing at a bus stop. Without thinking I had a completely spontaneous reaction - '*Wooow* look at *him*'. I was not out to anybody at the time. I just froze and stared at the floor for the rest of the journey. Nobody said anything. 
"Let me out it this way. I had an actual list of traits I wanted. My 3.5 year relationship ended and I analyzed the factors that caused it, and came up with a list of traits that would address them:

1. College educated
2. STEM or business job
3. Didn't want kids
4. Their own place
5. Good family and good relationship with them
6. Chubby (because that's just what I like)

What I got instead was a mind-blowingly gorgeous struggling actor with a fucked-up family with more issues than a fucking newspaper. 

And he is the sweetest, and most loving guy I couldn't even conceive of. It highlighted a new dimension to a relationship I had never even considered.

And there are problems. I live far from where I work to be with him (for now). I have to pay for most things. I've been terrible with my diet and working out. DRAMA. 

But I love him. So yeah...couldn't be more different."
"Gay men are in a good place in American society compared to even a decade ago. We can live relatively fulfilling, normal, and accepted lives because of progress made for LGBT rights. This has caused many of us to lose perspective. A comment in this thread said trans people ""should fight their own fight."" FYI we would have no rights at all if it hadn't been for our straight lawmakers, advocates, journalists, artists, etc. who helped us attain the progress we currently have. When we make up only 3-10% of the population, it would be impossible to fight this fight on our own. If not even LGB people will stand up for trans rights when they make up less than .5% of the population...then that is a shame. A fucking shame. Although I have trouble understanding the trans identity or gender dysphoria as I am a cis man, a few things are clear through our knowledge of trans people:  
  
* Trans people have no control over their gender identity. Trans people also know from a very young age that their physical bodies do not match their gender identities.  
  
* Trans people are unable to ""cure"" being trans. Attempting to do so through conversion ""therapy"" causes damage to their mental and physical health, and endangers their lives.  
  
* Just as with homosexuality, neither nature or nurture or both are definitive, confirmed causes. It just *is.*  
  
* Being trans does not cause harm to others.  
  
These facts alone are enough for me to see that it is immoral to attempt to ""treat"" being trans, to discriminate against them, to harm them, etc. "
"I have heard some people say that positive guys shouldn't have to disclose their status because it makes it so hard to find people to date and have sex with. I'm sorry, but that's just too bad. Let people know what they're getting into.

Not to mention, there's a billion other stds out there! Herpes and gonorrhea are still fucking unpleasant."
"Agreed! Start with something simple, surprise him on your next date!

...preferably not ""Wanna bang"", you don't want to open with that 😉"
Pretty sure they're okay with this fact.
"&gt;Help, I have [common problem] and I haven't talked to my boyfriend about it? What should I do?

Uhh, talk to him

&gt;Help I sucked a dick and I think I now have HIV

Go get tested, and read up about HIV transmission routes and rates

&gt;I like straight best friend, what do I do?

Stop barking up that tree.

There, I just eliminated 95% of new questions"
The young and inexperienced gays tend to ask the same questions over and over.
"I had a drunken, emotional meltdown because I did not have matching dinnerware for 6. "
"It's not weird, and it's not weird to fuck on the first date. You do your thing. Others will do theirs."
He's probably bored and looking for head. Your choice. Don't get attached. 
Paragraphs are your friend.
I'd imagine it'd be like a suction cup that take some strength to get off.
"He's better than I imagined :) sexier, more adventurous, more into me, and funnier than I dreamed. "
My friend's boyfriend is jealous of me and tells her that I'm lying to her that I'm gay and thinks that we are lovers lol 
"Any level of physical contact, no matter how minimal. "
"37$ for an Uber Ride? Daaaaaamn. I wouldnt go that far for a hookup, max distance for a hookup is idk like 3 km by walking, and the guy must be hot as fuck to make me think of gettin a cab, lmao.

Anyway, yeah shit happens people are horrible sometimes, just deal with it and move on. Next time dont spend to much on a hookup."
it's become a generic lgbt sub rather than a 'bro' one.
Text my ex... Don'd do this. It's not helpful
"I'm surprised by most of these answers. Lockers rooms have always been a source of inward panic for me.  I never looked around, because I didn't want anybody to think that just because I'm gay I'd invade their privacy. I kept my eyes down, no eye contact, didn't look at anyone, and got out as soon as possible."
"One time my straight crush wanted to cook dinner for me and asked me if I ate meat. I said ""Yes. I eat... meat."" It came out all wrong and he stayed silent."
"First of all, your English language skills are superb. Wow. Congratulations. 

Can I offer a different perspective on this?  It's done now. It hasn't gone well, but at least you will never have to go through the anxiety and uncertainty of coming out to them. It's been done. it can never be undone. It's an achievement in a way. A milestone.

It is going to take them time to get used to it. It was a shock. They are processing their own feelings (including shame) right now. They need time and space to do that. Get out of their face. Withdraw as much as you can from them. 

What you tell your parents in order to survive and what you actually think and do are two different things. This is not the time to confront them or to teach them anything. Be emotionally strong, but go into self-defence mode. Lie to them, if necessary, to protect yourself. Try to be genuine about it, but the goal right now is self protection and conflict resolution. It sounds like you are already doing this (i.e. ""faking being straight""). It's OK. Fortunately for you, it will be over soon.

You say your family is going to reject you when you leave home. This may be for a while; it may be forever. You just don't know whether this is going to happen and for how long. Things will change completely when you move out and start your own life. You can build your own family, start your own life. You won't need them. Your family is toxic right now, and perhaps they are toxic in general. It's normal and reasonable for you to let them go in this situation, as difficult as that might be.

Try not to burn any bridges. Perhaps in a few years, they'll have come to terms with it all. 

Try to look for supportive resources in the city where you live. There are often government or non-governmental services for young gay people who are struggling with their families. Seek those out.

The death threats to your gay friend are totally unacceptable. I think you should tell this man to stay away from you until you leave home. Try secretly to gather evidence of the threats, e.g. recordings, screen shots. If something serious develops, go straight to the police.

You're not alone, young man. Many of us have gone through similar situations with our families. We have survived it and created wonderful lives despite it. You can too.

"Glad to see the ""TRUMP LOVES LGBT PEOPLE!"" meme is officially dead. Those 3 tweets are actually disgusting. Trump is only tweeting about this because the house republicans are trying to pass a bill that bans the military from paying for any transgender related medical costs. Pure discrimination. "
for some reason a lot of people here have the idea that trump was the best candidate for lgbt issues. it's dumb as hell
Think of someone you know with average intelligence. Probably good at some things and godawful at others. Now just think -- roughly 50% of humans are DUMBER than that person. Gays aren't immune to stupid.
I think you should have blocked the guy's face at least if you were gonna be posting online :)  Just do it the next time onward.
"&gt;Priebus reportedly took some solace, however, upon being reminded that the nation’s black community was always available as a suitable fallback scapegoat for any conceivable social or political ill whenever the Trump administration needed one.

I cackled, I wept"
As a child it was occasionally nerve wracking that I might be found out. Mostly I was scared of other people seeing my peepee. As an adult I don't care who knows I'm gay and anyone can look at my dick if they really want to.
"Once at a high school party, ""Lovegame"" by Lady GaGa came on and I actually knew the choreo and went for it because I pre-gamed too much. I'm still surprised people were shocked when I ""came out"" on Instagram."
"He's a top, so it's not what I imagined."
"&gt;I do prioritize ethics before taste 

If you said this to me I would stop talking to you too. You sound very smug. "
Hahaha what a shitshow this is about to become. 
"Well, yeah... I imagine that's the kind of stuff a lot of people are looking for, find stimulating or for validating their life choices.

As an example of how Reddit works, there was a post on AskReddit asking something along the lines of what people did after their education, and the most upvoted posts were the ones speaking negatively about the education system, that it doesn't get people anywhere, that how well you do in school doesn't determine anything, etc. And even if there is some truth in those arguments, what's important is that that content in particular rose to the top, and the stories about people finding great success after a continued education sank to the bottom, because it's not what people wanted to hear. This doesn't apply to everyone of course, but some people visiting that post likely want to hear affirmation that everything will be ok even if you don't succeed in the system. And with very lenient moderation it shows itself even more.

I think people would rather hear about someone's crazy fantasy-like life rather than someone venting about their typical breakup in a wall of paragraphs, even though it's more vital to tend to the person that actually needs aid. I also think there are more people on this subreddit that come seeking aid than there are people who come to help, which inevitably causes a discrepancy. "

Next step: angry Bdsm leather orgy
Just like most gay guys will wake up to the sensation of a wet vagina rubbing against their back right? 
"Act differently? As in, not try to sleep with your boyfriend? So again, that either that means he plans to cheat, or he is leading on another guy. Neither one is okay."
"&gt;Am I the only one

Probably not"
"I never struggled just getting in the shower, doing my thing, and getting out. What made it difficult was when the other guys were doing borderline sexual stuff just to get a laugh out of the others. It made me jealous that they could joke about their dick sizes together, start fights and get into wrestling, swing em around like a helicopter, like seriously. There were straight dudes doing gayer shit than I'd ever done and I couldn't join in for fear of getting hard and exposing my sexuality. Football players man..."
It's normal to feel attraction toward anyone in the late stages of puberty and beyond. 
"&gt; My boyfriend says I can just make new friends.

WTF? Good friends don't grow on trees."
"As soon as I realized I was in to guys, I knew instantly that i would be a bottom. It helps when your first sexual thoughts are about getting fucked."
"One buddy of mine who's exclusively homosexual catches himself doing this regularly, and friends of ours find it quite funny. This is particularly the case because he most definitely is *exclusively* homosexual. Women who any guy with even the *slightest* interest in women would kill to get with all but throw themselves at him now and then, and he just has no interest whatsoever in them. (He isn't even that *socially* interested in women, aside from relatives.)

Whenever we've poked fun at him over this, his only explanation is ""They're just *there.*"" He finds it just as amusing as the rest of us though."
I personally find it cringey when dudes pile on the gay-related hashtags on their Instagram posts.
"Meh I think it's only some people. I'm a feminine gay guy and I don't think a masculine guy should date a fem just because he feels he has to. He should date who he wants to date and if another masculine guy is what he likes, he should go for it. 

I won't lie, sometimes it can suck as a feminine guy who finds a guy that I like only to be turned down for not being masculine but I quickly get over it because I feel he has the right to be with what he is into and pity dating is not good on both ends."
"Not unless they're passing anti-gay laws as a representative of the people. Otherwise, it's their struggle and their choice."
Yes she would be.
My younger half brother is gay and struggles with it and feeling like he can't talk with any of us because we won't relate or won't understand. So I try to keep in tune with stuff that he might be experiencing that I've never thought of as a straight chick so I can be more supportive and empathetic.
"i would think ""thank heavens he's taking care of himself!"""

"My taste in music has been a running joke for years. People would say things like ""my god, you are the gayest straight guy I know""

"Never thought of that one. Like when someone, to say that a young boy is cute, would say ""He's going to be a huge hit with the girls when he grows up."" They'd probably take offense if you said he was going to be a hit with guys. Even if they were relatively okay with gays in general. They wouldn't say anything, but of course they'd bitch behind your back about how you're forcing the gay agenda on them.

Mostly though, I feel it's similar to how gay interaction is treated by tv ratings, even by people theoretically okay with it. There are escalating levels of intimacy that are accepted based on the environment, but I feel for gay people it's one level up from what it is for straight people. So, a gay couple holding hands is considered as racy as a straight couple making out, a gay couple making out is as racy as implied straight sex, and implied gay sex is as racy as explicit straight sex. And so on."
"If we want to stop the spread of HIV, we need to get everyone with HIV on treatment. "
Is he chubby though
"&gt;I have heard some people say that positive guys shouldn't have to disclose their status because it makes it so hard to find people to date and have sex with.  

There's actually a 'movement' in the community that aims to destigmatize HIV putting it in the same category as a cold.
There have been several news outlets and some bigger media companies and channels on YouTube and elsewhere that posted articles, interviews and videos that were basically sob stories about guys that caught HIV (mostly by being reckless) who were now whining about not being able to find a 'normal date' because the other bad and mean gays wouldn't want to hookup with them.   
While it's true that HIV is very manageable(thank god!) nowadays, it's still a life-altering and life-threatening disease.    
Not to mention the other restrictions in your daily life like taking a pill daily, weakened immune system, side effects of medications, the massive cost on the healthcare system. Even travelling with HIV is much harder and often impossible (seriously, google HIV and immigration/tourist laws for specific countries; you'd be surprised).   

Also, not disclosing or lying about your status to a sexual partner is a CRIME in many states/countries as it should be; and yes, lying by omission is included with that.

"So, how many PMs have you gotten so far about the open mind part?"
I love this. So happy for you!
"I was starving, but we didn't have anything to eat except hotdog wieners, so I grabbed one.. but there was a lot of juice dripping down from it and my mom had just mopped the floor so I shoved the whole thing I'm my mouth and quickly sucked it dry. It was for my mom's sake.. thinking back now I just wanted the whole thing inside my mouth. I didn't realize my brother was in the kitchen so he watched the whole thing go down. "
"I've experienced this as well, it happens you're being vulnerable with someone you love. To cry in front of another person is inherently compromising and a huge sign of trust. It's moments like these where our sense of empathy is at it's height, and the line between romantic and sexual love isn't always clear in the brain, especially so with couples. 

I would just interpret it as a quirk of the brain not being able to tell apart sexual and romantic vulnerability rather than some weird crying fetish. Remember that it's our culture that demands the two be separate, and culture isn't hardwired into us.  "
I'm only joking. Don't take me seriously.

"2 months in, it wasn't even bareback. We were on vacation. We took it slow that night. 

Normally, we fuck like animals but we took our time to explore around. He'd been closeted in all his other relationships and treated sex as if it were some secretive thing. Prior to this night, our previous encounters felt like quick little escapades.

He really let me in (literally) and it felt more like we were making love. No exaggeration, he cried when he came. It was satisfying (considering I edged him the entire day)."
"It's really great isn't it? Don't do it with hookups, kids"
good for you :). And here I am kicking myself because I didn't talk to this obvious gay paramedic that brought my grandma to a nursing home today. I caught him looking at me numerous times. bah :(
"Probably when he says ""we"" or ""our"" in a conversation about the future. He's a really independent guy and not the most overly affectionate person, but when he talks about ""our"" future together and ""our"" home together it's just a nice reminder that he really is planning on us being together for a while.

"Bit late to the party, the article was posted everywhere last night.

Currently going through a (long) experimental phase myself. Slept with a guy about two years ago after my 20th because I wanted to see what giving a blowjob was like and hadn't really planned on it but ended up bottoming as well. Found that I really enjoyed bottoming so I started to wonder if maybe I was gay. Hence why I do a little lurking on askgaybros.

"I distinctly remember going from 'wanting' to have sex with him to 'needing' to have sex with him.

Some bi people may resent those gay people who come out as bi, before coming out as gay, because it gives some fuel to the idiots who think bi people don't exist and it's just a phase.

But I feel, if you need it or just feel like that at the moment, there's no shame in coming out as bi first. There's no need to always be right, and life is a constant learning process, and it's not like you're actually hurting people with it.

Just remember that just because you or other gay people first came out as bi (but realised later they were gay/preferred to take slower steps, while knowing to be gay), doesn't mean that real bi people don't exist."

"A past hookup sends a picture of his ass and says he wants to hang out.  That isn't a platonic thing - it's a booty call.  If your boyfriend wants to become friends with him, then why don't you all hang out together?

"During high school I used to be really really light (like 95 lbs), and so this one time I was showering with a dude and he tried to wash my body all sexily, but he accidentally applied to much pressure and ended up pushing me into the wall.

I've since become enthralled by the discussions and the window into gay culture, so I've stayed subbed and read a lot out of curiosity and because you guys are entertaining. 

Still have no desire to be with another man, but my diet, cleanliness and receiving game is on point now. I do wonder what a real cock would feel like but I'm more appalled by the thought of the dude that would come attached to it, so I'll more than likely never act on that curiosity (I say more than likely because I love sex and trying new things with my wife and if that was something she expressed interest in then I could likely get on board)"

"Ask her casually if she has recently removed anything from your room recently. Make it clear that you are aware something is missing. Maybe don't specifically state what it is - she will know.

Then, ask casually that she return it within a day or so and that you would appreciate if she could afford you a certain level of privacy as you are an 18-year old and have a right to not have your personal life invaded in the future.

I think you need to confront this behaviour head on.

You are an adult. She really has no right to take your belongings - no matter where they may end up when you use them.

It may be a difficult conversation. I obviously can't comment on how it would go or how confident you may feel about doing the above, nor how she would react. But it's definitely something you should nip in the bud sooner rather than later.

Snooping parents when you are an adult living at home is not right. It's ultimately bad for your mental health if you end up constantly are going to be living in fear - as an adult - that your private and personal space is being investigated/invaded."

"These threads are the result of crippling fear of HIV, ignorance of how it's actually transmitted, and a desire to put the onus for safer sex on HIV+ people. 

""You're neg, right?"" is not a safe sex strategy. Counting on HIV+ people to know their status and disclose it is not a safer sex strategy that is likely to work. 

Nobody is going to protect your sexual health for you, so take responsibility for the decisions you're making around safe sex. Use a condom every single time you have anal sex and consider getting on PrEP. "

"Money was taken from my paycheck when I started my career and put into a retirement account.  That was in 1970.  I was furious; I wanted that money!  Getting ""old"" wouldn't happen to me because I was different...............I truly believed that everyone else would age, but not me.

I was wrong.  Others that I worked with also paid into other retirement plans, but I only did the one.  Anyway, since my 70th year is coming up, I can say that I'm old(er).  That one retirement account has paid me the better part of a million dollars, so far, plus there's a little bit from social security.  Everything; home, land, property, toys, tools, vehicles.............everyfuckingthing is paid for, and I buy a lot of it new, regularly.  I'm not going to get rich, that's for sure, but there's enough to keep me spending and happy.

So, for those of you that haven't started a retirement account (I started at 22), you'd better start................unless you are thrilled at the idea of selling pencils or holding a cardboard sign standing on the corner in front of WalMart."
"He holds my hand. 

Years ago, when we first started dating, he was a major closet case. Like ""I'll fight you if you call me gay....and then go home to my male lover"" in the closet. 

That lasted for a hot minute, and then he came out, and started holding my hand in public. To This day, whenever he does it, it reminds me of how much that scared little boy has turned into one fine man. "
"I really appreciate your response and know you're well intentioned but I know at heart two wrongs don't make it right 😔 and anyways, maybe he's a bit more aware of the technique anyway - wouldn't surprise me if what it really was was he just stole someone's pics and used them himself "

"Yes. 

When straight guys sees a hot girl, they just see a hot girl. It's just attraction.

But when gay guys see a hot guy, there's often times a mixture of attraction and envy. ""I want to date/fuck him"" *and* ""I want to look like him"". When an average looking guy sees a shredded hunk, he's not just looking at eye candy; he's looking at a reminder that he himself is not that attractive. This is a huge reason why so many gay guys hit the gym - so they can look like the guys they want to date."

"I hope people can read this, add it to their knowledge and act on it how they see fit. Rather than lash out and say it's trivializing HIV."

"You're turning into a women hater because you're an asshole. That's on you not them.

They are right to be wary of you because your attitude frankly  sucks. No decent person would write the kinds of things you did about another person.

I'm inclined to believe you aren't gay, but some homophobic troll from another board posing as gay, and perpetuating the stereotype that gay men hate women."
"- Straight guys calling each other fag is not ""homophobia"".  Pick your fucking battles.  Also ""no homo"" is not homophobic.  When gay guys are falling in love with straight guys because they exhibit one or more behaviors society deems (stereo)typical of gay men, straight guys NEED some way of reaffirming their straightness.

- There are two genders.  Male and female.  If you are transgender, you were born male and identify as female and vice versa.  I will call you by your desired pronouns, but if you're one of those special snowflake Baskin Robbins 31 Flavors genders, then fuck right off.

- Just because someone doesn't want to fuck feminine guys doesn't make them internally homophobic.  If anything, ""internalized homophobia"" would be a masculine guy exclusively fucking feminine guys (read. woman-like) in an attempt to cling to straightness and assert himself as ""the man"" of his relationships. 

- If someone wishes to identify as ""straight"" )even if they're in a fuck buddy/FWB relationship with another man), people shouldn't point fingers at them and force them to ""accept who they are"" and come out.  Shouting ""Nigga you gay"" at them isn't going to make them come out of the closet any faster.

- There's nothing wrong with being with a closeted guy if it's just a fuck buddy/FWB situation.

- You don't have need to have a face pic as your profile pic in apps.  Just supply a face pic in the first message or upon request.
  
- Don't pursue guys who aren't already confirmed to be into guys.  Don't try to date or fuck a guy who isn't out or at least known to be closeted.  If someone you like identifies as straight and has a girlfriend, get the fuck over it and move on.

- PrEP is useful in preventing HIV, but it is not a magic pill that protects you from all diseases.  It is not an excuse to take loads from every Tom, Dick and Harry.  The only way the ""PrEP is a bareback slut pill"" stigma will go away is if the majority of those using it stop using it for that purpose.

- HIV+ people should remove themselves from hookup culture, or at least limit themselves to having sex with other HIV+ people

- While ""No Blacks, No Asians"" is a bit racist, it's not something that should be dwelled on.  Gay PoC need to just weed these people out and move on to guys who actually want them.  Gay PoC should also try dating within their own race once in awhile.  The only reason ""No Blacks, No Asians, Just a preference"" bro is an issue is because gay minorities seem to almost exclusively chase white men.

- If you don't want to be fired or ostracized for being gay, then make yourself invaluable in society and in the work place so that your sexuality can be overlooked.  Work hard enough so that you're ""too good to fire"".  

- The whole idea of the Gaybros community was for guys who aren't stereotypically gay to 1.) have their own community away from mainstream gay culture  and 2.) be able to join a ""man"" space without having to worry about dealing with homophobia from straight guys.  I don't think it's right for feminine men to invade that space when they can post in literally any of the other LGBT spaces on Reddit.  I don't think one has to be an alpha jock frat dude to be considered a ""Gaybro"", but if the average person can tell that you're are gay just by the sound of your voice and mannerisms/body language, then you really shouldn't be here."

"I'm surprised at how long you went on without adding a period or even a comma there.

Now if they are really in a relationship there's not much you can do. To make things healthier you should come out to him, it'll be the best especially for you. It will ease your mind a bit. 
Then you should start to get over him, it hurts and it will take time but you will eventually, we all do trust me. Hey maybe your not even in love with him and it's just a crush. It looks like you have quite a few things to figure out so good luck and stay strong."
"The first guy I was with in freshman year of college came in his pants when we were just kissing. It was pretty hot, but I ended up getting blue balls the rest of the night because I didn't get to cum."
"I got hard more than a few times, thankful for tight briefs. The guy that changed next to me used to 'accidentally' brush his dick against the back of my hand most days and another kid used to pop out of the fly of his boxers on the reg."
Not the same but I regret not telling off this straight bitch for not taking my relationship seriously. It was at a social mixer thing and there was a guy that I keep bumping into for some reason. She said that I should ask him out even though I was with a guy for many years at the time. I explained that to her and she kept saying that I should ask the guy out. That annoyed me a bit cuz you'd never suggest having an affair to a straight person.
Im still smiling... :-)
"Although you can ask your friend in a very subtle way, if ""what the fuck is wrong with her"" is the normal way of conversation between you two, just text that.

"Uncut is easier to please, more sensitive, and the foreskin acts kinda like lube in that it eases penetrative sex - the skin can stay put and allow the penis to move all at the same time. Kinda like they were designed that way... "
"I really am amazed at people like you. How did being gay not give a single iota of empathy and solidarity with other oppressed minorities?

Gay people can't change who they are, and there's nothing wrong us, and it's bullshit that we don't have the same rights and get treated as second class citizens by (some) straight people and most governments in the world. The same is true for trans people except 10 times worse, and they're a much smaller community. Can you not see the parallels at all?"
"I shared an ice-cream with a gayyyyy and OMG I'm freaking out - my throat is a bit itchy do you think I have hiv?????? Should I get it tested?

I'm in the closet and I'm 54 and on my parent's insurance. NO I won't ever come out! I can't come out because my cat is gay and my parents don't like that. I want to go to the doctor but I'm scared, I don't want anyone finding out. Please help me please 😭😭😭😭. Omg my throat, I just coughed! I must have pneumonia!!

You need three elements for impressive, take-an-eye-out and frost-some-cakes loads: volume, power and motivation. 

For volume: you need water available, and it needs to get used. So stay hydrated. Ever notice the unsatisfying hot-glue-gun-jizz you shoot when you're hungover? It's because you're dehydrated as fuck. Aim to keep your pee clearish all day. To ensure your whole semen set up is using it appropriately there are two supplements you can use: Zinc and Pygeum. You can probably find the make up of semen somewhere on the internet, and you'll see a number of micronutrients in semen, none of these either anecdotally or clinically have been associated with increased ejaculatory volume except zinc.  Note: Zinc is best taken before bed, but can give you some pretty bad nightmares, Pygeum needs to be taken two weeks continuously before it has effect and can cause stomach upset. You can cost benefit if this is important enough to you.   Second bit, your semen is and can be stored in your body, if you're beating the downstairs roommate too much, he's obviously not always going to be able to cough up. What is too much? Experiment, I'm not your urologist. But myself I've seen peaks at 3 days  and two weeks in terms of volume and orgasmic satisfaction. 


Power: 

Distance, is a function of muscle strength. You have a group of muscles called your pelvic floor muscles. They squeeze your semen out. You want to go from squeezing a tube of toothpaste to stomping on a tube of toothpaste? Get them stronger. I know one method: dick nods.nods: with an erect penis make your dick nod as much as you can, come up with your own set and rep scheme. Switch it up, try and get your dick to look skywards as far as possible, try to hold it there as long as possible. A good test of how good you're getting at this, is you should be able to start and stop your flow of urine with increasing ease without touching your dick. This one takes a while. 


Motivation:

This one is simple. Your arousal, orgasm and ejaculation aren't under voluntary control, they are a response to stimulus, and your body fuckin knows when the stimulus is weak. Are you jerking off in the mirror next to a tape measure for the 8th time this week? Or are you cumming after a seven day trek in one tent with your parents, after an hour and a half of 7 positions with a smokeshow who makes you pre just from making eye contact? If you beat too much, your ejac will be weak. If you only give yourself four and a half minutes your ejac will be weak. If it's a snaggle-toothed, cross-eyed, lumpy bodied grindr hook up you picked up as easily and flippantly as you pick up bottled water, your ejac will be weak.


In sum, drink water, take supplements, nod your dick, save up your cum, and only fuck hot people. You will be ropin like spiderman in no time. "

"Allow me to share a rather adorable counter-point to your example.

I volunteer with middle school kids (age 12 - 14) teaching math every week.  We begin each session by playing a group (math-related) game.  This is the more social, laid-back part of the session with a lot of goofing around and all.  During this session, one of the kids (a boy) gets a text message, and one of the other kids taunts, ""Hey is that your _girlfriend_?""  The other kids start laughing, and then a little girl chimes in, wanting to sound smart, ""Or it could be his boyfriend!""  Not in a taunting voice--this was the kind of voice a little kid would use to show off that they know something that they think you wouldn't expect them to know.  And all of the other kids, not wanting to be one-upped, just kind of casually agree, sure, it could be a boyfriend, because some boys have girlfriends yet others have boyfriends, and that's just how the world works.

This simple moment made me really happy, and gave me so much hope for the future.  Because it sure as hell wasn't that way when I was in middle school (I'm 31)."

"I was sucking a dude off in my room and suddenly realized I really wanted an ice cream sandwich so I abandoned the blowjob, ran downstairs naked, hopped across some sleeping (I hope) people from the party we'd had that night to get to the kitchen, grabbed the ice cream from the freezer, and hopped and ran back upstairs. I ate it on my bed while he watched me then finished him off. I was really drunk so I told him not to bother getting me off and we just went to bed. In the morning he left and I didn't say goodbye, I just sort of waved. Yeah. In other words my first one-night stand was an absolute trashy disaster."

"The trans community was there for Stonewall, ENDA, DOMA, and every other push for gay rights.

How do you justify pushing them to the side just because it's slowing down our struggle a bit? 

If we didn't put the T in LGBT, their struggles would last decades longer than it already will. Is it worth endangering all those trans lives to split up our community so we can make marginally faster gains? "
