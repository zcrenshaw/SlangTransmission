I have no idea what to say but I wanted you to know that someone read this and cared. 
"Unpopular opinion maybe, but Kate deserves to know her husband whose child she is carrying had an extramarital affair with a 17y old boy. 

Just imagine your wife was cheating on you with some boy/girl down the street and the people who knew about it couldn't be arsed to tell you. 

Especially now that she's pregnant and making a true lifelong commitment to Michael (once a couple has children, not even a divorce will allow them to go their completely seperate ways). 

This whole situation is fucked up."
"Open relationships seem to be accepted in the gay community. I think its wrong and an excuse for those who cant keep it in their pants.

Edit: kisses to the sexy beast who guilded me. Mwahs!!!"
"I'd say no

 no way I'd get through that wedding without cringing to death "
You are such an amazing dad. 
"Could this be a fetish thing? Like a dom/sub thing he wants to try out, but that he's just communicating really poorly? The wedding stuff doesn't really fit, but otherwise it sounds similar."
"Yeah... wtf why do we do this?

"
"Go suck a dick? 

That's normally said negatively, but I mean it in a completely positive way."
"update: i found my boyfriend having a video call with his mom, basically telling her the detail of what happened. his mom was laughing loudly and when she saw me she said ""history repeats itself, i had it happened to me too."" i didn't know how to react, i was embarrassed and shocked of how racy she is. i'm glad everything's fine though."

It feels so regressive. I wouldn't even consider traditional roles if I was with a woman. 
I...I like the smell
It could had been worse and they could had been having a threesome relationship and your son was the real father.
Did you accidentally mistake /r/askgaybros for literotica.com?
"To be honest, I think you handled the situation the right way. Your son is young, so letting him learn this lesson and being there when he really needed it was the best move. Had you intervened sooner, he might have taken it as you not approving and rebelled against you, making you being there when the pieces fell seem more like you gloating than anything. By letting the events play out and then being there when he needed you the most, you let him make a mistake, and then helped show him how to learn from it.

As for your ""friend"" Michael, well, if it was me, I'd probably be having a nice long talk with him about what he had done, followed by a simple request that he not come around your son or family anymore unless he wanted his wife to learn of the illicit relationship he was having. If the man used your son, then he is not your friend. If he had been single, then it would have been fine, but he wasn't. He lead your son on, and showed little to no remorse for anything.

But that is just me.

TLDR: You did the right thing, but you need to distance your ""friend"" Michael from your family because of what he did."
"Nope.

I know people who all they talk about all the time is girls and sex and how waist-deep in pussy they are all the time. But so much as mention I got laid recently (not even in graphic detail) and he gets all weirded out and tells me to stop.

Like, bruh. It's only fair."
Gonna get my ass pounded! Laterz! 
"At the risk of coming off like a dick and being called ugly names by people who are actually less progressive than I am, I'm going to say that this all kind of your fault. There is a way to conduct yourself that allows you to avoid situations like this. Some people learn this very early on, and others have to fuck it up a few times before they get it. Some never do. If you don't want a drama tornado to follow you everywhere you go, you'd do well to start focusing on how to behave differently to prevent it.

So, considerations for the future:

1) Next time you get hit, call the cops right away instead of telling your violent vigilante brother.

2) See a psychologist yourself so you can figure out why you're surrounding yourself with physically abusive people. Believe it or not, there are people with entire social networks that consist of zero people who hit each other. You can be one too.

3) Try to avoid situations where paying someone off or blackmailing them to avoid police involvement is necessary. This usually involves a misstep earlier in the process, like not calling the police right away.

4) None of this is applicable if you enjoy being caught up in a whirlwind of drama and fighting.

5) If you begin to automatically defend yourself without taking time to really consider #4, then you like the drama. Someone who genuinely wants out of it will listen and take action to change how they interact with the world. Someone who doesn't just talks about it a lot and asks for advice after each individual fuck up.

It appears that at this point in your life, you're happy with the drama, since you're still trying to frame your ex-boyfriend for selling weed to keep your brother out of jail. That's the kind of shit that happens on TV shows when characters dig themselves into ever-deepening webs of lies. It is not okay for it to happen in real life, nor is it the marker of a person acting or thinking maturely. Keeping score of what other people do so you can use it against them is extremely unhealthy. It's what sociopaths do.

EDIT: Since people are bitching, please note that my cellphone made the bold letters without me asking it to. There is no hidden meaning.

EDIT: Someone explained the big letters, so I removed them since they were never intended to be the point of my comment."

"Tons of divorce, lots of anger, violence against people for no reason . . .

No change really. "
now you can come out again and again for the rest of your life
"No matter how annoyed or upset i ever get, all he has to do is just hold my hand and i just forget everything bad. Hes the only one who knows me so well. 

Haha, i feel like a sop for writing this but i'm just happy when he's with me. Coming up to 5 years now! Woop woop!"
"Depends heavily on the reasons behind it. If he was from a working class rustbelt community that had been bled dry by globalization and free trade agreements then I could sympathize to an extent. If he was a euphoric alt-righter his ass would get insta-dumped, though."
"I think mine falls into the ""thinks I'm magically clean"" camp, because everytime I try to casually sneak away to do it, when things start heading in that direction, he's like:   
- ""Where are you going""    
- ""I have to use the bathroom...""   
- ""Now?""   
- ""Yes, now....""    
And then when I come back he says, ""Jesus, that was the longest pee ever."" While I'm just like.....wow. Hahahaha"

You've created a straw man. Nobody cares who you're into. It's when that preference gets expressed as disgust that people start talking about internalized homophobia.
"Too much muscle is a thing. I need a healthy level of fat on a man, otherwise it's like cuddling a rock.

I completely agree. My sister would laugh at anyone talking to her about gender roles. 
Ya this happens to me. My BF always has a crazy high sex drive but mine kinda changes over time. When he realized that im almost always horny after a workout he started subtly encouraging me to go more often and ambushes me when i get home. Not that im complaining lol. 
"Heh. I go to the Y, so no. My experience is more like [this](http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/comics/minor_differences2/7.png)."
He's the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I'm the undersecretary. We get into an argument of political expediency versus our principles. I tell him we didn't come to Washington to make friends. He stands firm against parking requirements for new low-income housing developments in dense neighborhoods. Then we fuck.
"That he makes me laugh every single day.  That, and the fantastic physical/emotional rapport he gives me.  Even after 18 years together, we can't sit next to each other without touching, and eventually cuddling."
"I love being gay and out in particular. Have you ever been to straight bars? Everyone's so scared of looking dumb when they dance. I feel like at the gay bars around me you can dance more freely without people being mega judgey because while gay guys can also be mega judgey, the environment is generally more accepting than straight crowds which I'm grateful for.

Plus, being gay made me more okay with being me and doing things that make people stare at you. They already look at you for being gay or dressing a certain way so it's like ""what is there to lose?"""
"Hey, I volunteer in SF for a youth homeless shelter so I have some experience with this situation. There should always (I say should, I don't know Texas law) be emergency transitional housing available to someone who is in an ""at-risk"" environment, which you qualify as. Your home life is considered hostile and you can no longer reside there, so there's gotta be an option for you.

A quick search showed Promise House and Youth First, and I know from Promise Houses site they take kids from 10-21, you should be safe. There are options for you, a support network and people to talk to for both legal advice and counseling. Both of those housing options have LGBT support as well.

"&gt; Tonight is the night I disown her.

Apparently lack of empathy runs in your family. Your mother is clearly suffering from the difficulty of her past and her current beliefs and you've brought it all to the surface. Instead of trying to understand her, giving her time, or talking with her about this you choose to... disown her?

Maybe it's genetic. You, your brother and your mother all sound like terrible people who can't maintain interpersonal relationships. Thank your lucky stars your father seems to be different."

"Yep. My general indifference towards women is occasionally confused with misogyny. I mean, I get it, straight men are very interested in women, their needs and preferences. Straight women are interested in themselves and their own needs and preferences both as individuals as a group. Lesbians are also interested in them for the same reasons men are. 

Gay men are the only group who have be completely indifferent towards them, which is something they don't really experience. No one likes being ignored or relegated as unimportant. Gay men are also more likely to be open about a woman's faults, as they have no reason to puff up their egos."

"When I was younger, I never understood why gay people mostly hung around other gay people. Stuff like this is why.

"You are also probably rather privileged to say that. It's not that easy almost everywhere else in the world. 

While gay rights has improved drastically in the Western world, radical right wing Christians have moved from the US and over to Africa where they are able to easily spread their hate. 

You are privileged too because you were born after the HIV/AIDS crisis where you didn't have friends and loved ones dying each week. 

It is fine to be happy with who you are but to say you are lucky because you are gay isn't really the truth, you are lucky because of where you live and the time period in which you grew up which has been more accepting of gays but being gay in itself has not made you lucky.  "

"Involuntary moaning, shivering, feeling and/or checking out my body as I pound him. Pushing his ass into me. Fighting/Wrestling with me to possibly flip dominance, only to lose and then proceed to love it/melt. Gripping the sheets or side of the bed. Spreading his legs, or wrapping them around me tight. Grabbing my ass. Let's also not forget the oh so amazing ""toe dancing"" where they are either stretching their toes out, or crunching them in depending on how their being fucked is going.

"I originally posted this in /r/relationships and a lot of poeple said I should tell Kate about it because if Michael has given her an STD it might affect the baby. I don't want to tell her because I don't want  her to tell other people my son was involved and out him.

I've decided to confront Michael and give him the chance to tell her himself, but I would prefer if he didn't mention my son. If he doesn't tell her I'll probably send her an anonymous email or something like that without mentioning my son.

I havent told my wife because my son specifically asked me not to. I don't want to break his trust now that he really needs someone he feels like he can talk to. I'll probably tell her eventually but for now she doesn't need to know."

"I was 21 when I came out, it was 1972.  The common ""cure"" for homosexuality was electro-shock therapy.  It did cure most from being gay, well it cured them from being sexual at all.  So I guess it worked.

In 1972 homosexuality was a mental disease.  It was common to get beat up for the crime of leaving a queer bar and the police cared less.  It was a crime in most states to have sex with the person you loved if she/he was the same gender as you.  Butt fucking was illegal for all in some states.  

I came out because I had lived in Europe and saw that in some countries, nobody cared.  I came out because it was the 70's, it was a time when social mores were being challenged.  I came out because there were too many who couldn't, who were afraid, who would lose their jobs.  

Because we came out, society changed.  Some say you should come out when you are ready.  OK I get that but if we had waited, if we had let our fears overcome what we knew was right and just, society wouldn't be where it is today.  Yes it takes courage but it is also liberating.

It is liberating to stop lying.  It is liberating to break up with your imaginary girlfriend/boyfriend.  It is liberating when you don't have to remember which mask to put on in the morning.  It is liberating to live your life as one person, not the one who works and the one who loves.  

While much has changed, there is much work to be done.  Today, in 2016, Anderson Cooper is being Twitter attacked for the crime of being gay and a moderator at a nation debate.  Coming out requires people who know you to think.  It is much easier to hate a concept than a person you go drinking with, your neighbor, the guy who always provides great service at the butcher shop.  Those are real people, hating them takes effort.  

I hope to live long enough that there is not such thing as National Coming Out Day.  But until then, open those closet doors and let in the fresh air.  "

"We are entirely too quick to assume that in cases like these there's internalized homophobia at work and that really needs to change.

While I acknowledge that may play a part, I don't think that's the root cause of his discomfort. He flatly said in his second paragraph that he didn't feel part of the group. I read that more as him feeling like an outsider because these other people already knew each other than anything else. Ergo, they all already knew each other well and have already established interpersonal bonds. It is extremely easy to find yourself on the outside looking in in these situations no matter your orientation. Example: If you suddenly get thrust into a social situation with me and my friends; if you don't share the same interests, have thick skin and are strong willed, you will feel completely left out. Especially as it pertains to our interests...we can and have literally spent hours debating over which incarnation of Dungeons &amp; Dragons was best at a bar. Most of us have been friends for damn near 20 years.  If you have no idea what we're talking about and/or this doesn't interest you, it's not internalized homophobia making you feel this way (never mind that I'm the only gay guy in the inner circle) it's having no vested interest or clue about what we're talking about.

I think the OP is honestly overthinking this situation. He was put into a situation in which he only knew one out of however many people were here with the only common factor they had in common was their sexual orientation. Call me crazy, but it feels wrong to blindly accuse him of falling into the masc trap or suffering from internalized homophobia without anymore to consider. That feels like projection to me..."

2. Making gay friends is so overrated.

4. Gonna get down-voted for this but... Chasing straight men is disgusting. Gay men will shame ""Fag-hags"" but in the same breath try to convert their best friends. That's so exploitative, messy and overall pathetic to watch. I had a best-friend who told me straight up she was in love with me. It was sweet but I had to turn her down. Had she gotten me drunk or tried to cop a feel or been sneaky and scheming and conniving like the way some gay men are with their friends? Bitch, don't be mad if you get ghosted *so fast*!

"There's not a stigma, it's more like people don't understand why you would want to.

Most gay people associate rural areas with increased amounts of conservative and religious culture, specifically social conservatism (imo not incorrectly - evidence bears this out), and that usually means that gays feel less comfortable being out or are actively treated badly if out in those areas. 

So people probably wonder why you would willingly put yourself back in an area where there's a greater possibility of being treated poorly."

"Is 18 the legal age of consent where you live? 

Honestly, to me the maturity (physical and mental) difference between a 22 year old and 17 year old tends to be of such degree that I'd be a little concerned why a 22 year old wants to hang out with a 17 year old. At least when I was 22, and I mean no offense in writing this, but 17 year olds just physically looked like kids to me and just weren't quite as mentally mature as I'd prefer. But of course there are all kinds of things about both of you that might make that a non-issue. Just be careful he doesn't take advantage of you in some manner as can happen with someone who (probably) has more life experience than you. And anyway, if the age of consent is 18 where you are, I'd be careful about that for his sake a well. Depending on where you are, there are many who'd be gung-ho about prosecuting two guys in such a situation....  "

We were going to attend an on campus concert at my school, take a walk afterwards, get dinner, and go back to his place. Mind you, I'm only out in certain circles and this would have been my first ever hookup so I was naturally very nervous.

Immediately after the concert, the guy said he wasn't feeling up to walking and he wanted to go directly to dinner. We got in his car and he pulled into a dark area of the parking lot by the woods (it was probably around midnight) and hundreds of people were in view, exiting the venue. I asked nervously if we were going to dinner and he told me, ""This is dinner"". He tore off my pants and started trying to suck my privates, voraciously stroking me as I cried out for help. No one heard. I was able to slip my pants back on and get away.

He proceeded to block me on all social media before I could do the same.

It took a lot for me to post this. I haven't told anyone."
You need to smile and look more friendly. You look like a basement dweller who hasn't gone on a date for years. Or at all. Start by relaxing your body and show that glow in your eyes aka the bedroom eyes.
11/10 here.

This sub is filled with submissive nelly queens who want to lie in bed like a dead fish while someone tosses them around. I wouldn't take their advice to heart...
"You should do what makes you happy. If you want to be more masculine, then by all means change your habits.

But in the end you should worry less about what is perceived as masculine or feminine and just be you."
"When an attractive guy smokes, it just makes him that much more attractive."
"-Rock (hard rock, metal, alternative) is much better than pop. 
- Straight-acting does not make someone sexy, interesting, attractive or handsome. 
- A lot of the homophobia comes from inside the mainstream gay culture. 
- There is no thing (in Mexico at least) such as ""Gay community"".

"I'd see a wholesome preppy guy with a nice body and a sunny smile and if I'm particularly horny I'd be like ""I'm gonna tie you tight and gag those lips and whip you in so many places and then I'm gonna rage-f*ck that tight WASPy hole while I jerk you off and bite your neck as we both come. Let's see you smile then btch."" 

Then I'd remember how ugly it feels like to be objectified, and get even harder."
"Seriously, who the fuck is downvoting everybody who is saying no? OP asked a question about personal preference, just because you dont like it doesnt mean you get to downvote."
"Short fingernails (often bitten), a love of cats, super short hair. An insane amount of flannel (if sleeves are missing it's a guarantee). 

And that's all the stereotypes I have time for. 

To ID a fem lesbian - no idea cause I learned that a girl kissing another girl probably means nothing. "
Grow the beard a tad longer. It'll look better. Congrats on the shave. Much better.
Guy tried to convert me to Christianity. There was no second date.
Yes it was. If not just for the the way you look but also how you see yourself. I feel more comfortable in my body.
"My religious belief died in stages.

1. Observing the religious right.
2. High school science.
3. Realizing I was gay.
4. College philosophy."
"""Just checking out the competition"" is the biggest statement of denial I've heard in a while lol.


And damn, he was definitely thinking about that sweaty hairy body fucking him."
"It's nice to hear this from this sub. I sometimes feel like I don't belong here because I actually enjoy being gay. Sure, being closeted sucked (and being closeted for way too long), but I think my life is so much better now than if I was straight. "
Five inches is not small. 
"He's a second-rate Ann Coulter with a stale ""I can't be racist or misogynist because I suck black cock"" schtick."
Scary movies give him a massive dick? Interesting.
"Your self-respect, apparently"
Seems to me it's more about bdsm than gender roles. A talk about kinky fantasies might clear things up.
"Say ""Hey, would you like to go out to dinner sometime?"".  If he says, ""no"" then he only wants you for sex.  If he says ""yes"", he might be interested in more."

hairy asses are the best (:

"Here's another one, maybe a little less controversial;

Skinnyfat guys are beautiful. Thats muh opinion anyways and I'm sticking to it. "
"Very touching, I wish all bros were like you!  "
"Let him into my life, not only my butt. Got it"
"Nope. Honestly, just going by people's jobs on tinder, I've got a thing for flight attendants. "
"I had to make a huge effort not to laugh my shit out in class... ""history repeats itself, i had it happened to me too."" So fucking hilarious! 

I could also imagine my mum making an alike comment..."
"You're a minority. You're less likely to be guys first choice. This might get downvoted because a lot of guys like to pretend these things aren't issues in the gay community and chalk it up to preferences. 

Guys here like to talk about internalized homophobia but are apologists for internalized racism. If I had to guess, it's because it's harder to see something you're actively participating in as wrong."
Same. Having a beard helps. 
"With 17 gay apps on my phone, I have the latter but want the former. "
"&gt;Turned 40 for the first time

Do you plan on doing it a second time? ;)

&gt;guys my age are so boring.

Between this ^ and
&gt;What do you do when you are older and have too much energy for guys your own age?

I think you're unfortunately stereotyping men your own age...."
"Well, it gets me going if a top is confident and takes the lead. In a respectful but determined ""I'm going to give it to you, are you ready?"" sort of way."
Agreed. Wish I had anywhere near that amount of support when I was a teenager.
