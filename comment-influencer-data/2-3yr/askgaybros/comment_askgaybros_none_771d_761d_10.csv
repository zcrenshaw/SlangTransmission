"Two things:

1) Knock next time. You have a teenaged son. Guys masturbate a lot around that age.


2) Don't treat him differently and make sure to tell him that you love him no matter what. He'll get the message.


And who knows, he could just be really embarrassed you walked in on him jerking off."
Why is this titled like a buzzfeed article?

I think you should move on.  He's using the dick kissing as an excuse for dumping you.

The top 4 turn offs from OP's hookup. #2 will shock you
"Good on her for being a wonderful supportive mom. But for fuck sake, why are people still barging in on their teenaged sons' rooms unannounced?"
"I'd suggest not confronting him about it. Maybe it was a one time thing? He's 15, curious, figuring things out, probably. Let him come to you. Let it be his own decision, should it turn out he's gay. In the mean time be a loving, understanding and supportive mom like you seem to be. Build that trust in the subtle, loving way only moms can."
The L block from Tetris.
"After coming out my dad told me, ""Whelp... at least you don't gotta worry about gettin' anyone pregnant."" My response, ""... or getting pregnant!"" We haven't talked about it since. "
masc for masc  - bottom fem with facial hair and a cap looking for dick to get pounded.
Honestly the best thing that's come out from porn so far.
"Yall aren't even married yet and the sex is already bad plus the general strong disconnect. Gay or not, this is not a relationship you wanna be in. "
I met a Scottish twink once had no idea what he was saying. 
"Looking at the models on underwear packages. Secretly saving the packaging to look at later, lol"
"""Deleting this soon""= I'm really unsuccessful with this app

""Send a face pic if you want a response""= I have standards for the attractiveness of torsos that I talk to

""I don't message first""= I'm really socially awkward but compensate by being catty and bitchy.

""Discreet""= My parents voted for Trump

""Bisexual""= Bottom with delusions of grandeur"
My dad did that once to me. He always used the old knock once and barge in. But he then learned his lesson though when he opened the door only to find me naked on the ground full eagle spread
"Lmao that's gold, if he ever gets over himself, maybe continue seeing him, but wow... that's kinda pathetic, I would personally just move on. I'm sure you can find a better top"
"If someone wouldn't let me bring my boyfriend as a plus one, then I really don't want them in my life anyway. If your friend knows that you are gay and is still actively posting anti-gay stuff, then are they really your friend?"
Having a dick in their ass
"A lot are, yes. Certainly not all, but the stereotypes of bi men as being ""really"" gay and the fear of bi men as ""disease vectors,"" as well as plain old homophobia, make women who don't want to date bi men pretty common."
He watches too much porn.

"First, don't be upset your son hasn't disclosed his sexuality or his possible curiosity to you. He's only 15 and he's still exploring his sexuality. If you're openly supportive as you stated, **trust me** you're doing everything you need to do and its having a positive effect on his overall mental well-being. He'll come to you when he's ready, until then I wouldn't worry much. You're doing great as is.

As for the avoidance that's pretty typical haha, he's just embarrassed. I honestly wouldn't even bring it up, just go about things like you usually have. Bringing up the topic may make him feel even more embarrassed, so I would just reassure to him that you love him for who he is.

edit: words."
"Literally ðŸ˜³ but for real your ex cheats on you, probably broke your heart, possibly exposed you to hiv( I'm guessing he didn't let you know that he cheated on you before hooking up with you), goes around and slanders you to your friends.  I'm just trying to figure out who owes who the apology. "
It's only gay if the xbox is off
Wat ye fookin lookin at ye wee scabby cunt?
"""bottoms HATE him!"""
"I hate when I hear guys say they almost threw up when they saw something gay. I got a buddy at work that will give me so much detail about his hookups with girls but if I say something vague about gay sex he's like, ""Come on dude... "" like it was TMI."
"I am not, but I went to a summer camp my BF worked at for one of the ""family weekends"" that was the LGBT weekend, and I got to meet a lot of kids of LGBT parents. The teens did a panel discussion for everyone. It was pretty moving how pretty darn normal these kids are (except for the obvious curiosity questions and occasional struggles with shitty kids or even teachers). Best story by far was gay dads (both pretty masculine) trying to shop for and get pre-teen twin girls ready for a school dance, including youtube videos on ""how to shave legs""....

Anyway, I guess my only point is it seems like it's pretty much a normal childhood but for the occasional shitty person who tries to make it different somehow. I think a lot of people would benefit from hearing from these kids...."
Lol. was it because he was biting a pillow?
i would. id be a bit put off at how aloof i am but hell yeah. im interesting and cute damn it.

"Say ""No Homo"" afterwards and you're all good.

"Given that they're burning the bridge pretty hard with you, I'm willing to endorse burning it back. Kicking you out now without proper notice may well constitute an illegal eviction, depending on your local laws. You may be entitled to your room back briefly or compensation. r/legaladvice would have a far more informed opinion on it than me, assuming you're in the US or Canada.

Edit: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6slpir/friend_needs_help_kicking_her_18_yr_old_son_out/) is a current thread in the legal advice sub I mentioned about some wanting to remove a non-rent paying adult offspring from their home. The advice is consistently that there's no shortcut to the eviction process. IANAL, but it does seem to me like you should be able to keep the roof temporarily while you get your affairs in order."
"""Young professional"" - I have a *really* average job but I wear a suit"
"More like: Four times I was an entitled bitch and expected quality from banging a complete stranger I met on the Internet.

"The last hookup I went to, that guy was trying to fuck me bareback.... funny how he says condom on his profile"
Twinks with Scottish accents? *faints at the thought*
"Dude at school lifted up his shirt for some reason and I noticed the waistband of his underwear and his abdominal muscles. 

Like I had crushes on guys with cute faces before, but that was the first time I remember having a strong desire to touch and kiss someone's body. 

That was also the first time I consciously considered that maybe I was gay. Not that exact moment, but later that night after I had finished jerking off about it. ðŸ˜‚

Omg, how could I forget. I did have a friend in elementary school and somehow we ended up getting naked and rubbing our dicks together. Happened several more times but it was so innocent like I was too young to even consider it sexual. It just felt good and I wanted to do it every time he spent the night. Finally he told me we shouldn't anymore becuase it was ""gay"". I was terrified for like a year that anyone would find out and our friendship didn't survive puberty because of that. 

Saw him on Facebook not that long ago. He's married and bald but looks the same, (sigh)."
"I had on my profile a picture of me and my boyfriend because we wanted to make a trio (we didn't get to do it though) and we got many offers, one of them was something like:

**""Hey you guys seem cute, I am up for a trio so hit me up.**

**And if you don't want a trio can you please just come over, we can watch a movie, I am very lonely and I want friends.""** 

We felt like shit, but we left the city next day. "
"If you want your son to be more open with you, snooping through his messages probably isn't a good way to do it..."

"I remember when no one knew that HIV existed, but it was already being passed from person to person. Those who were getting infected had no idea.

I say this because one assumption underlying this behavior is that HIV is the last new STD and not just the most recent. Plus we increasingly have antibiotic-resistant strains of the old ones. "
...who hurt you?
"Yeah you didn't get blocked because of the dinner bill, that's a lame excuse. Welcome to gay dating. He's ""had"" you now. He's off to find another guy to sleep with. "
"You're literally average. Dicks your size are the best for anal and oral imo, though I'll admit that big cocks are more fun to look at and jerk. 

And trust me it's not all fun and games to have everyone after your 9 incher. When I was trying to date I found that many guys were just after me for my cock, and everyone here knows because nobody I've ever slept with or dated has had enough respect for my privacy to not go blabbing about it to everyone. 

IMO anyone who asks you that, you can steer clear of anyway because men are just objects in his eyes and that's never fun. Size queens should just go buy a fucking dildo instead of all ganging up on the few of us who are 8+"
"Let's see a picture then.

It's probably just that gay guys are thirsty - but there are some types that are popular with gay guys but straight girls don't seem to care for.  So maybe you have one of those types of looks."

I got out of bed today.
"Yes.

So in my homosexual career I have always been one who has that whole Masc4Masc attitude. I just didn't want to date a guy who wore make up and was super effeminate. One night outside the local gay club I saw this super cute guy who was totally my type. We had a mutual friend and I found out the guy's name and fast forward we started texting and hung out. 

We had a great time went on one or two dates and he had something to tell me. I am thinking great what could this be. He lets me know he is a drag queen and wears makeup and all that I wasn't looking for. So here I am in a totally brand new situation I normally wouldn't have dated a drag queen, just not what I am into. Here this guy already has me on the hook and drops this knowledge on me, so what am I to do?

I role with it. Tell him okay never dated a drag queen before and lets see where this goes. I will tell you watching him transform the first time from man to women was a sight to see. Then I went out on the town with him in drag. That was the most nerve wracking for me, holding hands with a drag queen in the gay community. You would be surprised how many people look or nudge their friends when we walk by.

This December will be two years of us being together and I love him more and more each day. Morale of the story is you never know who you will click with. 

:) "
"It's really, really worrying. I am 27 and was beaten with a metaphorical stick about safety as a teenager.  My husband and I occasionally invite a third and many, many men under 30 just aren't even discussing using a condom. Many flat out WON'T. Nevermind discussing status and testing. I do not know if it is message fatigue, if they see it as being rebellious since much of the gay taboo has fallen away, or if they simply aren't worried. They hope the numbers game works in their favor I guess? They think guys are always sure of their status? Whatever it is, I really do worry about HIV crisis round 2. 

We have so many great tools and such great information about prevention, I just cannot see how infection rates remain what they are. I know that men of color are being decimated. Currently, per the CDC, the risk of a white MSM over his life is 1 in 11. If you are a black MSM, 1 in 2. That BLOWS MY MIND. HIV is burning its way through the southern states.  

**Edit: Educate yourselves on the realities of [HIV in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html) and stay safe guys! Live your best life, enjoy the pleasures being a guy, and minimize your risk.

"I always have a hard time making friends. Sometimes I meet up to go get drinks and play games etc and then next day the guy is talking about how much he likes me etc. 

I said before we even met that I'm not looking for a relationship and I'm only looking for friends.

It's hard meeting guys off Grindr etc and keep that expectation.

But what I'm learning is to participate in a hobby of mine and find friends through that vs trying to force a friendship through a face and square online "

Missionary! Can kiss or cuddle at the same time. I love the intimacy of staring into his eyes (or him into mine).
"Pathetic? Haha no! You're being a real human being, you know with those things called emotions. You just don't want someone messing with them. What you want is to meet another human being, also with those emotions, so that you guys can have a connection deeper than hello if you choose to have sex."
I crave this on a daily basis tbh.
"He didn't come out to you because you're the gay guy he came out to you because you're his best friend. Cmon, think of his feelings first it's obvious he needs your comforting.

He will need some time now, 4 years is no joke. Do not make this about you, it's not."
"Back when I identified as bi and was dating girls, I'd always gotten a sense from them that they thought they'd be the one to set me on the straight and narrow and I was just confused. In a sense they were right, but not in a way where I'd land on their side of the fence. 

Straight girls love bi/gay guys when they're friends, but in a relationship they tend to be as old school homophobic as a grandparent in thinking that they want their man to be *a man*. 

This was a couple decades ago and I'm sure there are many more progressive girls out there now, but I'd guess that this is probably still generally mostly true. They'd never come out and admit to it but actions speak louder than words."

"1) Interact with other gay men - the easiest way is to use apps, but you can also try LGBT clubs or gay bars

2) Make yourself more desirable - the more you have going for you, and the more attractive you are, the more attention you will get

3) Try not to outwardly project your loneliness - guys can smell that a mile away, and it's a definite turn off "
"Two moments:

1) The time that after sex I dipped my thumb into the cum on his belly and then rubbed it across his forehead while saying ""Simba"". He was not amused, I was hysterical. 

2) The time that we got a kitten who was WAY too curious and in the middle of sexy times decided to investigate the husbands butt. He booped the husband right on the pucker. Kitten got a swift toss out the door. "

"The only thing I can say is kudos for discussing it like adults. I have been in that position where I was the older guy. When it comes to parents... and you're not their child... it's really rough. You're automatically the bad guy who's trying to steal their child. The fact you, as a parent, had an adult discussion about it... nice job.  "
"Mouth covered, hair pulled, maybe a little bit of choking or forcing. Yeah quite  a lot. "
Dicks. They eat dicks.
"I'm old enough to be the grandfather of most of you, and I find this the most curious change since I was a young man myself.  So many of you are constantly writing about being alienated and feeling such loneliness.

When I arrived at the gay parish so many decades ago most gay men were obsessed with finding the great love of their life.  Just like now days.  But what we really did best was buddies.  We were the undisputed champions of finding and keeping life long best friends, and having a whole circle of friends to share life with.  My best buddy and I go back almost fifty years, and we have talked darn near every day of our life.

I just don't get how we found it so easy to make and keep friends while you youngsters are having a hard time of it.  We were the ones being sent to prison for being gay.  Being lobotomized by our own family.  Arrested at coffee shops for ""associating with a known homosexual"".  Yet these fantastic barriers never stopped us from forming our own society.

Looking back this seems to have broken down during the worst of the AIDS train wreck.  I can't put my finger on exactly what broke down though.  I guess the older gays were totally absorbed in taking care of the sick and dying, and no longer reached out and mentored the younger gays showing up.

Then the economics turned against the gay section of America's big cities.  The younger lads could not afford to buy into the rising real estate prices, and as the older gays died from the epidemic the yuppies moved in and bought up the properties.  The gay ghettos died away.  There was no place to go to and connect between generations, etc.

I think the finishing blow has been the social media.  As the ghetto goes away it's dispersal eliminates the demographic concentration to sustain all the different social clubs, from square dancing night, to the biking club, to the guys who met for chess in the park every Saturday morning.  Where our friendships formed.  Where the older mentors connected with the youngsters showing up.  These warm face to face connections cannot be replaced by swiping left and right on an Iphone app.  Hence the loneliness.

You younger lads have got to put on your thinking caps, and invent new ways of linking up in community.  You've got the brains to do it.  You just have to stop being passive observers of life, and get your hands dirty making community happen. "
"Honestly they're perfect. Not going to lie big cocks are nice to look at, and I'm not going to complain if a guy whips one out, but most of the guys who have really been able to hit the spot have been average sized. I find big ones exhausting to suck too, jaw and throat start hurting. "

"My lover and I took in a stray cat who took an intense interest in our carnal relations.  She would come up to the side as my sweetheart was going down on me, and have her head going up and down in motion with my lover's head going up and down over my groin.  Eventually, my lover would open his eyes and see this animal an inch from his face...

The day finally came where I was rising up over my lover's spread legs to enter him.  Suddenly, from behind, our new cat dug a paw, one into each cheek of my backside.  Claws extended.  Needless to say, I shouted, and thrust downward and forward with great intensity and aggression.

For the next ten years, when ever my partner wanted a rough F*** he would skip down the hallway toward our bedroom trilling out, ""here kitty, kitty, kitty!""  When I heard that call, I knew what was required."

"We met on Grindr. He messaged me 3 times before I responded, but to be fair he didn't have a face pic in his profile and I had a personal rule about not talking to faceless men. 

Best rule I ever broke. We started chatting, leaned we both went to the same university, but completely different majors, so we had never met. Went on a date a couple weeks later to an apple orchard, went to dinner a couple nights after that. Soon enough we were seeing each other every day. 

That was almost 5 years ago. We're getting married in 10 months and I couldn't be happier. "

Comedy is how I cope with my shit. Sorry."
Make sure to tell your siblings everything too
"Sorry, you're gonna have to parent your way out of this. 

You can make rules as long as he's living under your roof, but there's a good chance that you end up pushing your son away and deeper into this guy's arms. 

You don't know the guy, and i haven't seen any evidence that he's a bad guy. For all we know, your son pursued him and/or lied about his age in the process. 

If i were you, id ask your son to bring him over and meet you and your wife.

Seems a fair compromise if you are to consider letting him sleep over. That will drive it home for the 24yo quickly thats he's dating a minor, even if he's over the age of consent. Most guys would run, but if he's man enough to face you I'd say he's likely the kind of person your son could have a healthy relationship with."

"No, people are naturally going to be curious. Especially those who have minimal experience with gays. If they're being inappropriate you can let them know but I don't see how being sassy towards them will help anyone "
No it's the Pidgeotto 
Having a six pack is like 95% diet and 5% cardio. It honestly takes very little effort.
"I keep somewhat of a diary of the pictures, videos, etc. I cum to...complete with date, time, and such.

Everyone is moving forward except me and that brings me worry without end. I'm so incredibly jealous of everyone. Definitely making an effort to move too though 
"In my defense, I wasn't paying attention to his looks moreso how he was around my son."

"I'm imagining two experienced gay guys pretending they both like pussy on the side and are having anal sex for the first time, lol. "
"I had a boyfriend that was quite vocal when I was topping him. It didn't do much for me, but he liked it so I would just go along with it. So we're going at it pretty good for about 10-15 minutes. I finish loudly, and so does he. Next thing we hear is people starting to applaud from across the street. We hop up and look out through the (open) window, and the entire house party across the street is standing in the front yard...listening, laughing and applauding. Someone noticed us peeking out and they say, the crowd went wild."
"&gt; I did have a friend in elementary school and somehow we ended up getting naked and rubbing our dicks together.

*Oh yeah, there was this other thing that happened earlier. I guess it was also kind of gay.*"
"You've been together less than a year. 

Your SO is (obviously) far more used to getting off alone than with a partner. And that's okay. You have time to learn them. 

My partner of about two years now used to be the same( death grip I mean), but we found what works for us and I can make him finish no problem. 

But also, you're thinking of sex as a point a to point b experience of arousal to orgasm. Treat it as fun. It's enjoying each other, learning about what makes you feel good and makes him feel good. Orgasm is great but it shouldn't be the end goal here. 

Take your time, you'll learn how to make each other feel good, waiting for a few weeks may make your anticipation higher but it's really not something you want to make a regular thing is it?"
"There certainly are plenty of guys who wouldn't want to do all the prep and recovery that goes with riding a big dick. I don't think it's your length that's the issue. It's probably the width.

We could say better if we had a visual representation of the phallus in question. "
A gentleman never tells. 
"It's ok, sounds like performance anxiety/nerves. What's the problem? Especially since he seemed ok with it?"
"If someone brings up an aspect of your sexuality that you aren't comfortable talking about, try politely telling them. It isn't really their business."
"It was love at first sight and it all happened within a week. I first saw pics of him online back in April last year. I was like ""Damn Zaddy, you're hot af!"" I met him at the Honda dealership and I knew I was gonna turn him on. When I touched his steel body and went inside him, I knew we were meant to be. I brought his fine metallic gray ass home and now he sits on my driveway always waiting for me to drive him. 
Edit: grammar"
"""Hey are you busy later? Because I douched."""
"This is the first thing I thought also. Making up a tiny excuse to blame the other person when you want to dump them, so that you don't seem like the bad guy. It's cowardly. Apparently straight guys do it too. Perhaps this 'kinda like like eachother' was one sided.

Telling that the 'don't come back' text occured after the sex was had.

Be sure not to fall for it if he starts messaging you the next time he wants to get his dick wet and starts acting like a fuck boy."
"It's the part that gives sexual pleasure. It's also something that's usually hidden; if you're looking at it that usually means the guy wants you. This might sound weird, but it makes sense to me - Men often consider their dick as a kind of sexual power totem. It's kind of a primal thing. So that makes them something I want to see also. "
"I remember one profile I saw that said:

*I have my own car, my own house, and my own money. You need to have at least 2/3 to talk to me.*

It's clear where they're coming from but it was so blunt and rude the way it was written like that. 

Or I love it when they're like, ""No fems"" and then on the off chance you meet them they're a big ol' queen themselves.

It's only gay if you lick your hand clean.  Otherwise it's a very friendly thing to do for a friend.
"I've had that problem before too. I ended up taking pics of my junk looking smaller than it actually is. That way it doesn't intimidate them as much so they don't back down. 

Then when things get heavy I'll initiate foreplay before I even take out my cock. Play with their hole, get their little bottom brain in heat.  That way when they finally pull it out, they know it's a lot to take-  but the fear turns into acceptance and a willingness to please. Holding them in my arms as I casually play with their hole and whisper how badly I want inside does wonders. Eventually they'll give up that sweet hole and let me deeper than any man before. "
"Snuggling up against a soft hairy chest. 

My personal favorite: when you're making out with a guy, holding his dick, and whenever you hit the right spot his dick pulses harder in your hand. Damn I love those moments. "
"ðŸ’€ you both sound crazy. But, it really speaks volume about how our community is obsessed with ""turning out"" straight men."
"If/when you run your report, please don't make this out to be some kinky gay sex thing. Address it as what it is: sexual assault (and if there's known HIV infection, gross bodily harm.) 

By the way, are you also reporting on straight men who stealthily remove condoms when fucking women? "
"I never see 'discreet', I just see 'discrete'.  Everyone is looking for 'individual and distinct' fun"
You have a dick. Bi guys want dick.

"occasional kudos on the body, but overall no difference. how i treat myself is a whole other story; im so much kinder to myself now."
"I was adopted at eleven by my lesbian aunt and her partner(s). Communication styles and opinions on porn were a little rough, but I think turned out okay. It is a little annoying to constantly explain why I wasn't raised by a mom and dad who were married, even as an almost thirty old man. People really can't get over the fact that it isn't 1952 for some reason. But I would probably be addicted to meth in Minneapolis without them. The horror..."
"When it's bedtime, it's e621 time."
Uhhh Because it's not 1976 
"This meme is spreading faster than syphilis. I went to porn hub and for like 80% of the ads it was this video. Still fucking hilarious tho. Better than that straight porn ""this isn't a beach it's a bathtub"" one"
"&gt; We will probably always be in an open relationship and probably will never live together, we have a very unconventional relationship that just seems to work for us. We had a heart to heart last weekend where he told me I was never really his type but loved the kind of person I was and even though I will always fancy him, I'm ok with not having much sex with him anymore as I know of other guys I can have sex with. 

Oh my god, that sounds super sad. I know you said you're ok with it but jeez. You should find someone that absolutely loves every bit of you, that makes you a priority, that sees you as a beautiful person that wants to be intimate with you and live their life with you. 

Different strokes for different folks, they say. If you can handle this arrangement emotionally long term then props to you. "

"I'll tell you what, my dad fucked Marlene Dietrich.

But on the real, I've fucked two people upvoted to 300+ from GaybrosGoneWild if that counts."
"&gt;this is what I hate about being gay. The way we have sex is so unnatural and disgusting 

No, thats how you have sex. Raw and not making sure your partner has cleaned. If you didn't want a shitty dick then you shouldve prevented it from happening. Anal sex isn't a gay exclusive thing (non gay guys can get shitty dicks from sodomizing a girl or even a bloody dick from fucking during a menstrual cycle) 

Also there is more to gay sex than anal sex.

This has all to do with your stupidity and nothing to do with homosexuality. "
In some places there are emergency funds or emergency housing for youth.  Try calling your city and your local LGBT centre.  
"Question for you, OP. Have you ever been to Europe? "
Sometimes I just want to bury my head into somebody's chest and cuddle with them for eternity.
"Milo, is that you?"
"Whenever a guy would touch me I felt this electricity going through my body.

Now it doesn't happen anymore, I guess it was the signal for me to notice that girls were not my thing."
"Maybe get some professional counseling instead of trying to treat your problems with superficial stuff or better yet do both, except get in shape for you and your health, not other guy's dicks."
Ehh I can't see anything good coming out of it.
"""Top"" means ""Verse"" 

""Verse"" means ""Bottom""

""Bottom"" means fisting. "
"I'm only kidding. It's a gay sub, and you're mentioning your dick. It's the code of the internet that a pic must be requested. So saith he the lord.

Anyway, it's definitely the girth. I wouldn't want to fuck that on a regular basis either. It'd be something to do once in a blue moon, or something to try once and go ""That was fun, but never again.""

When you find someone who is into big dicks though, my guess is they will be **really** into your dick. "
"The way you write is so cute and innocent :)

I think if you feel like you've established a strong connection with him and he no longer feels like a total stranger and its not 100% infatuation anymore, now would be a good time. 

I wish you luck :)"
Except for when they're freaking out about the ~~fantasy~~ possibility of predatory homosexuals raping them in the gym shower/army barracks/boy scout tent.
"Honestly, you guys sound like you have a great relationship - that both of you are being actively concerned and careful about each other's feelings. 

I've never been in one but I've talked to lots of people who have, and essentially it boils down to a few things:

1. Be very clear about rules. What is allowed and what isn't. Things like... can they stay and cuddle or is it strictly bam and go? Can you see the same person more than once? Can you kiss them? Are ""dates"" allowed - hanging out with guys you fuck outside of the bedroom? Strangers only or what about friends? Do you need his OK every time to fuck someone or is it just blanket approval to go for whoever you want? 

2. How do you handle jealousy? Does he need to know when you fuck a new guy? Some couples I know report everything back to their partner, whereas others are strictly don't ask don't tell. 

Another one that might be relevant to you to think about - how do you handle if he gets his sex drive back? Does that open relationship end or does he get to participate as well? 

The biggest thing is to mind each other's feelings and overcommunicate the shit out of things so there are no misunderstandings. Jealousy is the dangerous beast here but it can be managed."
