"Open the door get on the floor!  

No more admin rights in Bangalore!!"
"&gt; Needless to say, the Bangalore office mysteriously lost their admin privileges that afternoon.

Sounds like a tantrum I wouldn't want to deal with. "
"I once printed the entire Debian reference manual.

My mom's employer was not happy."
"2000% stupidity tax.

EDIT: I was off by 100% so technically 1900%. Credit to /u/MaxNanasy for the correction."
"I was already paid for the previous two days already. The 3rd day equated to about an hour of work, something Im willing to write off.

I work on cash or check (business only) immediately upon completion, daily. Unless its agreed upon after we establish a good working relationship, I never accept Net-15 or Net-30. Im a small business, I cant afford to be chasing down my money.


EDIT: I figured this will get the most notice as I keep seeing a lot of the same responses. Ill clarify some stuff.

- My customers find me. I dont get to choose who I work with. This isnt always a perfect or cushy job. I get some shit-show customers. But thats just part of the job.
- Im not big enough to vest and inspect and have a contract and have a work order and so on.
- Im quite sure my approach could have been different. When customers arent clear about the issues and needs, unexpected problems arise. In the end, everything worked as needed and problems resolved. I informed the customer on day 1 that the phone might be bad and also recommended hardware be swapped out. I was constantly met with resistance. Id prefer to be work, be paid and fix the problems rather than be confrontational. Other than a bad VOIP phone, nothing else was necessarily bad or not fixed/addressed, minus the less than optimal setup."
"Will never understand this. People expect help for free, but insist on charging everyone else when they need help? 

If it was a major job I would understand, but even then for that sort of thing you'd charge mate's rates. Just swapping out a toilet is what, an hour and a half's work? Maybe two? You're family, he shouldn't have charged shit for that. (No pun intended)

Edit: Came to gripe about inconsiderate bastards, learned how to replace a toilet. I love this subreddit so much. "
The bare minimum that CTO could've done is do a SWOT analysis of such a massive change with the IT leads. I doubt s/he did that.
"Back at university, when I didn't have Internet at home, I ran a rsync of the debian repos on my laptop (~ 2005 IIRC).

The helpdesk guys at the internet caf√© were wondering why internet was so slow that day... And magically was fast again after my rsync finished.

Good times..."
"I'll never understand why some people think they know better than the people they're **fucking paying to fix their problems**. Like fat people who go to the doctor and insist that they're healthy. Do you want someone to jerk you off and tell you you're great, or do you want them to do their job?"
"If it's next to impossible to find the driver through your website (and your website is supposed to have the drivers on it) that *is* an issue, Google or not."
"Yeah! YOU are personally responsible to ALL of your users' data! HOW DARE YOU NOT SAVE!

....I hate people like that."
I do wonder if they found out that $AC was the one who informed IT of the issue.
"Can't you ring Bill Gates and tell him how much money we spend on the Windows here, and ask him to fix it personally?"
"Just to point out, each hard drive would have multiple platters.  So he only violated 1 computer.

Still, those suckers are NOT easy to get into without the right tools."
I think proper BOFHing would require a company wide memo thanking $AC for bringing the security issue to light.
I sure hope you got paid before walking off.
"I apologise for all Indians. Here Admin is taken by default with very few companies following group policies ( or the IT guy saying f it, take admin) as such many do not know better.

I have a story about a team lead wanting admin on a company laptop and a few days later I noticed that all our internal data was public. If anyone wants to read let me know"
"My college doesn't make us pay for printing but limits us to 500 pages a semester. I use my own printer for everything because of the convenience. I ran out of ink for a week waiting for the ink to arrive so I have about 450 sheets left. I will be printing out 450 DnD character sheets at the end of the semester

Edit: wow my most up voted and commented thing is me overdoing something in the name of DnD"
"I love that solid response people give. ""Why do you need it exactly?"" ""Because I do! Give it to me now!!"" "
Obligatory Sir I am not a reading person and you are not being helpful so I am going to hang up now.

"It's possible that he *also* has a virus, but some techs make good money just agreeing with whatever the customer tells them."
I can do it in 30 mins.   I would imagine a plumber with a truck full of equipment it would be 10 or 15.  This is basically the password reset of plumbing.  
"I saw the title and thought, no, there's no way someone could do..."
"When dealing with that kind of person, and if you can say the number with a straight face, you're undercharging"
"Personally, I would have sacrificed OFFMAN himself, but that wouldn't free a port
"
"This is a very common trend among people about Cars, Computers, Medicine, etc.

The minute you do not know, you become the idiot and they become the expert.

I typically respond with something similar to:

""Mr/Mrs Customer, If I knew everything about computers I wouldnt be here talking to you."""
This works until someone manages to somehow get scroll lock switched ON with no way of turning it back off again. Cue office-wide panic.
Moral of the story: Percussive maintenance works on humans too
"'Can we set it to something and let them log in with it?'

'That's literally what you're currently doing with that ""new password"" field'

"
"Smart move.

I carry a Square dongle. 2.5% is worth it, to make sure I get 97.5%."
"&gt;Cus: No, I just bought VoIP Phones. I don't know which ones. Why can't you just tell me which headsets I need? 

You need a Plantronics headset. I don't know which one. Why can't you just tell me the make and model of the phone?

&gt;Cus: As you won't help me, I am going to go elsewhere and never use you again.

I had this happen on a tech support call. The ""tech"" got mad at *me* because *he* couldn't answer any of the questions I was asking him. 

Accused me of refusing to help him and hung up.

Turns out, the company he works for fired all their in house IT guys and this guy was managerial, not IT, and so he had no one to turn to, but he also didn't know jack shit and was obviously frustrated. We are just a vendor to that company and we only support the stuff we sell them."
"Aww. c'mon, SWOT is only bare basic business school stuff-why would a CTO know anything about that?!?! ^^^/s"
"&gt; $ex

Uh..."
BRB gonna do push a mass save on server for all programs...This includes Microsoft paint DO NOT WORRY.
&gt;Here you go lady!  It's a new kind of wireless mouse; it has a charging cable built right in so the batteries will never run out!
"
They can, but it'll get referred to the bank's fraud department once you provide the documentation from Square verifying that a card-present transaction took place and they gave their signature on it."
"Don't sacrifice anything needed?    
I would have unplugged OFFMAN's computer.  
"
"Ah yes. 

This strategy is also known as the *""Implement it now, worry about whether or not it works later, and blame bottom management and employees if it doesn't""* method of technical support.

As a professional corporate technical power bottom, I'm familiar with it."
"Working ISP Helpdesk I had a woman yell at me for about an hour about how it's unacceptable that we keep changing the order that her Google results come up in. She was VERY upset that she couldn't find the site she normally used because it was no longer coming up on the results...

She didn't understand the concept of URLs or bookmarks I guess."
$ex jam making sticky keyboards eeehhhh? ;)
"&gt;... I know what I'm talking about.

Translation: He doesn't have a clue.

"I for reals got a call after one Windows migration (forget which version) where someone complained about the way it showed mapped network drives in Explorer and wanted it displayed a different more aesthetically pleasing way.  I said, sorry but that's part of the operating system and can't be changed and the reaction was ""well can't you call Microsoft and have them fix it?"".  OK I'll get right on that.  "
"&gt; If anyone wants to read let me know

The internal data or the story?"
Save that one for April 1st.
I can't be the only one that has issues finding drivers on basically every website ever.
"You have to say it with a straight face, or they'll think you're joking. If you say $2,000 for a $300 job and smirk, they'll go elsewhere, you say that completely deadpan and no emotion, they might not know better."
I used to work at a print house. Managed to print off almost every source book for D&amp;D that I had on PDF. (This was pretablets era and I couldn't afford a laptop)
This happened to me 4 months ago... I make more money and have better work hours with the new company doing the same job.
The story... Unless the port is still open a year later (which when I checked last week it was)
"You're so rude. Plumbing requires actual work, you just fiddle about with a computer. Plus you know about computers, it's easy for you!"
"The issue isn't the technically inept it's the rudeness that seems to go with it.
"
"I say you break it down as 100% for dropping the IT desk, 200% for outsourcing the replacement, 300% for...

Yeah, 2000% stupidity tax."
You mean like someone plugging in another keyboard and hitting scroll lock? That's just crazy enough to freak *everyone* out.
"Gotta get the WARM sheets man, to keep you toasty on the walk back to the dorm."
"I got good mileage for a while with ""You aren't paying enough for somebody who *knows* all that information.  For that you would have to pay at least one more digit per hour.""  "
"Even in the UK I'd have thought this would be gross misconduct or criminal damage.

OK, my brain's melted now. Thanks, Norman. "
"""Push yourself. Feel the burn. This is only gonna be one rep if you do it right.. open up network and settings......"""
It's got to be at least 12.
"Having also once worked in higher ed where the students didn't have to pay for printing (they do now, I believe), we had students do stuff like this all the time. Some would print entire textbooks that they found online or the several hundred page primary source document that their professor provided digitally so they could read it on their tablets, but they would rather read on paper. "

"&gt;  I will be printing out 450 DnD character sheets

""How many of those do you have?"" 

""Fifty."" *slaps down new character sheet* ""I can do this all night."""
"We had a crazy exec who liked his desktop with the exact same icon layout. Problem is as we upgraded over the yeas programs went out of use... no more AOL 9.0 or corel draw. But he would shit the bed if it was different. 

So working off a screen shot we kept on file, each time we upgrade his machine dummy icons went in their place. His order was preserved and half the icons did nothing, but we didn't get complaints...."
"You just need a set of torx drivers, at least for the ones I've done. Not the most common, but not hard to obtain either."
"I hope you changed the wireless mouse for a wired one, because they can't be trusted around battery-operated tech..."
"Wow, you help your cousin and cousin in law free of charge spending a couple of hours, and then when you ask them for a favor they charge you for it? That's just dirty, you definitely did the right thing. If you're nice to them and they can't even bother to do 1/10 of what you do for them, there's no reason you should help them for free. "
"This reminds me of my time working in an auto insurance office...  

Me: ""What's the make and model of the car?""  
Cust: ""It's a silver truck.""  
Me: ""Is it a Ford, Chevy, Toyota...?""  
Cust: ""I don't know, it's just a truck, okay?!""  

This was especially astounding when it was a vehicle the person had newly purchased. How can you not know the name of what you just bought?? Especially when it's written on the side/back..."
I imagine so. More emmployees doesn't mean more value.
"seriously, find a copy of the user licence, prove them wrong.

you shouldn't let people have the last when they're wrong. Especially your professor, it's supposed to be his fucking job, he has no excuse.

"
Probably because the larger company had the infrastructure and policies in place already. 
"&gt;$Patches: Where is our HR representative?

You know shits gonna get juicy when this gets said. I love this man keep it up!"
"""I'm sorry sir I didn't realize, is your caretaker in today? Perhaps it would be best if you handed the phone to them""  
Did you feel that? It was a subtle burn."
oh god. he sacrificed 10 to the printer gods?!?!
And then it was EXACTLY what we feared.
I'M NOT A COMPUTER PERSON. Are you telling me to put gas in my computer?
"Fired all...   
I hope you got them flagged for 'money up front' from then on, because they probably won't be aroud all that much longer."
I sh!t thee not. We were all young and full of ourselves. The branch manager thought it was hilarious.
"The college I work for, people get admin rights exactly like this. ""I want it, give me!"" and my boss sends one of us over to give it to them. If we protest, he says it is better than arguing with them. We go over, give the rights, then watch as they proceed to load crapware into the computer. Two days later we need to go and in fuck the computer. And the week after. And the week after that. And so on. "
"In the good old days. These days the BOFH tends to specialise in assassination, which I think rather spoils it."

It toggles the scroll lock light on and off.
"That sounds like it could have been more like ""I'll be using this as a reason/excuse to my manager for why my work is late"", and they wanted your name so they have a ""witness"" to the problem in IT."
"You forgot the step where you awkwardly carry out the old toilet spilling the remaining toilet water on the floor.  


Also the step where you kind of gag scraping the old wax seal off of the floor.  "

In my experience people who think everyone is cheating them are people who are trying to cheat others. 
"This is a pro tip for ALL workers, IMHO. "
"You actually read and understood the employee handbook? What kind of idiot would do something like that? 

I really liked Sup1's reaction to you knowing the necessary info"
"&gt;what are you wearing? 

Uh, khakis?"
"Probably all she really needs is a statement of some sort showing her account was terminated and deleted. I'm guessing she's in a situation (or wants to avoid a situation) where she is being held responsible for information in her account, and wants something she can present as evidence that absolves her of responsibility in case someone tries to hold her accountable for the whatever-it-is still being out there.

Maybe she had a lawyer who told her she needs this, or maybe she watches too many crime dramas on TV."
"I am confused. Did the 50 person company buy the 300 person company? That is what ""acquired by"" means."
"Fuck, I wandered in here from /r/all and have fuck all to do with tech support or IT in general. I'm actually studying accounting. It's not an investment. An investment nets you a return. I would actually argue that it's a fixed cost. It's like paying the rent or utilities. Investments don't always pan out, but *good luck* running your business when you can't keep the lights on. You can lower expenses and liquidate investments. Fixed costs can be too costly and too much hassle to reduce. Finally, investments are optional. Fixed costs are **not**."
Heck I once printed a 250 page blank document just so I had paper for my hp lj5 in the dorm.
"That's why, at my last company, when I contacted IT for admin, I listed off the reasons.  They remote in, ""can you acknowledge the UAC prompt?"". ""If I could, we would not be on the phone right now..."""
