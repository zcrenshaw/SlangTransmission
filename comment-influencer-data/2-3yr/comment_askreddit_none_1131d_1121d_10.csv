"Of course they don't say that.  It further supports how, ""basic"" they are. "

"[As people age, their tissue loses elasticity](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=tissue+elasticity+aging%7Cageing).  Which means that when that tissue is stretched, it has less of an ability to return to how it used to be.

That applies to vaginas just as much as anything else.  I'm sorry for your loss."

So... when we gonna make this thing official, baby?

"If it's stalls I wouldn't care. But if I'm at the urinal I'd be pretty unhappy.

I think one of the problems in this debate is that many transgenders now a days are not even transitioning. They look like their biological gender and the only ""evidence"" that they are transgender is their word. That shit makes people uncomfortable and scared.

A blanket ban on transgenders wouldn't make sense but I do think there should be some transitioning clause so people can't just claim any gender they want for what ever reason they have."
They ended up as sluts. Nothing changed. 
"""I HAVE FREE SPEECH!"" as a retort to being told their (likely also ignorant) opinion makes them an asshole-- or to anything except being censored by the government, really."

You're right.  Except for the part that that actually was the joke
"&gt; leaves me, moves to 7 different states and takes baby

he has zero responsibility to the child at this point, as far as I'm concerned

it might not be the kid's fault, but that doesn't change anything"
Big fat fucking cuck.
Exactly. Why is it so hard to believe that a Hispanic judge with nationalist ties to Mexico would be biased against someone who was not pro-Mexico? The dipshits on this thread are ridiculous.

"It isn't anything like that at all. It's a test on existentialism.

Sigh. Nevermind."
Worth it.
"100-300k is ""well off"", but it's a long way from ""rich"".

"&gt; every fucking time I go out, someone catcall me/whistle to me/follow me/act like a creep

Interesting how you use exaggeration to explain the problem of exaggerated problems."
"That's funny about the anal thing.  I resorted to opening with ""Hey babe wanna anal?"" to weed out the girls without a sense of humor.  It's typically about 30/30/30 for girls who don't respond, act offended, or come back with their own funny response.  I'll gladly take those odds to get to the kind of personality I'm interested in."
"&gt;  It's creepy and weird, not some movie fantasy where hot guys are always coming up to us telling us how beautiful we are and asking us out.

But that does happen, no? I mean, maybe not the majority of the time, but certainly you have been approached by attractive guys who are actually interested in meeting you.

When is it ever about men though?
"A geology degree qualifies you how?  So you can name all the rocks in my yard...don't oversell yourself.

I was just talking about this at work. When me and the girls go clubbing we'll swipe everyone on Tinder and tell them to come to the club. It quickly fills up so there is a crowd and it is filled with people that think you explicitly asked them to be there so they buy you drinks all night and then you just take a taxi home
"I am talking about looks, idiot. You know what's part of looks? Confidence, good posture. Not all facial structure."
Clearly men have never made up words to easily describe things. Oh wait. That's almost all of them throughout history.
What if the crazy story you have made up for her is not real?
"&gt; That its emotionally supressing to men when its said to them.

Lol not if you're actually a man. "
"Those ones are dumb. It's really easy to see when a woman isn't wearing makeup. If every woman in the world didn't wear makeup for a day though, you guys would be really disappointed in how little attention you got compared to normal. It would be like being invisible compared to how it was before, unless you were naturally very attractive."
"It's just that she's the establishment politician, and historically speaking politicians have been corrupt quite frequently. It's basically how political parties function.

"If you are actually a teenager, I commend you for your excellent taste.  The commenters below have a very stunted grasp of quality music.  While they're probably right that Uptown Funk will be one of the most lasting pop hits of this decade, they are short sighted to hate on RAM.  From a quality album perspective, Daft Punk created a classic that will resonate with people for years to come.  "
"When was the last time a woman fought to be included in the draft?

"I'm not an economist so that's hard to answer with anything other than ""I don't know"".  Even from articles I've read, it seems experts are divided.

Logically I'd like to think that removing an illegal worker would open up a job for an American most of the time, but I'm sure that depends on a number of other factors specific to the exact job."
"I don't get called racist, but the fact is that there are people out there who will accuse you of being racist simply for disagreeing with any non-white person, as if disagreeing with someone's belief somehow means that you think they're not as much of a person."
"Vegetarians haha. Pretty obvious at this point that processed meat causes cancer and an over abundance of animal protein is not good for us

Edit: was it really necessary to downvote me? I answered the question and wasn't an asshole. Plus I'm not even a fuckin vegetarian myself"
"I disagree, the show started to decline in the final few months before he left."
Not gun violence. Violence in general.

Are you dead?
Pffft.  First time you try it that joint's getting robbed and homeless people are living in it.  You can't skeleton crew a fast food joint on the highway or in the hood.  And most fast food joints are on the highway or in the hood.

Pyrex was forced to change their formula for health and safety concerns. The size of the company had nothing to do with it. 
"Wait, 4 real world hours? What the fuck? What kind of shitty D&amp;D are you running where players literally have to go home for the day by failing a save. That makes absolutely no sense at all. 

Or did the entirety of your campaign encompass 4 in game hours somehow. 

Did the party just dump his sleeping ass out there and leave him?
