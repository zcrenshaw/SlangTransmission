Not at all where I thought this was going. Nice kid!
"I was definitely expecting this to be one of those stories with the crazy mom buying ice cream for her kid, and she is 36¢ short and tries to get away with leaving because ""It's just 36¢""."
I  took a quarter out of my own wallet to spot a customer once and they didn't come back and give me a $20. I feel cheated.
"I was expecting ""oh, well it didn't matter last time..."""
"&gt; I hear a voice ask for the manager to make a complaint. 

""Sorry but I'll need to see your friend's complaint as well.  How do I know you aren't just complaining for her?"""
These are the stories I love to read on this sub
"That would have been the perfect opportunity to say ""And if I was the owner, I would throw you out, goodbye""."
"There is absolutely no excuse for the customer's behavior, especially as she threw the sandwiches at you. Im not sure but that can be some sort of assault. Now if she was allergic to tomatoes then she should know by now that she should specify that fact and also say that she also wants no ketchup. How is the kitchen staff supposed to know the customer is allergic to everything tomato related when all they see is ""no tomatoes""?"
I'll have to use this line on my employees that pretend to work the aisles but are instead playing Pokemon Go.
"By how quickly the kid fell in line, you can be confident that the son didn't believe his father on another occasion."

A rare unicorn....someone apologizing for being a jerk to someone else. Savor the moment!
"I fucking hate people like this. I had one woman who called to ask why her insurance policy was *two dollars* higher than her friend's policy. Since different people usually have very different parameters, the answer usually boils down to ""you lead different lives and there's nothing we can do about it,"" but in this case I was actually able to find the reason; her policy was for a higher amount than her friend's policy. So I tell her we can lower the amount to what her friend has and then she can save her *two dollars.* 

She starts going off on how it was highly inappropriate for us to increase the amount, how she didn't need that much coverage and it was extremely presumptuous of us. I tell her that I'm happy to make the change for her, but that we didn't increase the amount, she applied at that amount and that's what her policy has been the entire time she's been with is. 

So, naturally, she begins to gasp dramatically and wail into the phone, ""Why are you telling me these *lies?* Why are you saying things which are *untrue?*""

She was acting like she was making a big scene for the benefit of an audience, except that she was on the phone and I was the only person hearing any of this. She continued to gasp and wail and express how shocked she was that I was such a liar for insisting that she'd been the one to pick the policy which cost *two dollars* more, and eventually she demanded my supervisor, called him a liar too, and hung up *without changing the policy.*"
Was expecting insane manager to fire competent staff over 36¢
"To get that angry over a pastry is ridiculous. I wonder how he handles other, less delicious problems in his life. "
Parenting is about setting consequences and then ENFORCING THEM - never set a punishment you don't want to enforce and always enforce it immediately 
Then you might be on the wrong sub
"&gt; *""Please laugh. Please realise your mistake. We can laugh about it together...""*

HA! Such optimism.

I'm glad she paid up &amp; didn't spend ages debating then leave your counter covered in melting sweet goo. All the same though... This just proves what we know: Customers don't read. "
People can never be inconvenienced to read.
"No, no. Not ""if I was"" but ""since I *am*"". The first implies you're not and you're just being cheeky."
"I don't mean to sound rude, but would you actually expect a tip for this? As far as she's concerned, she ordered a cake, it was written in the wrong colour, but fortunately you managed to correct it to her satisfaction despite your less than leet calligraphy skills. She doesn't think you went above &amp; beyond, she just thinks you did your job. Do bakers usually get tipped? I thought it wasn't a thing to tip retail staff? 

Now I know it wasn't your fuck up, and I realise other customers left in the meanwhile (could you have broken away to serve them then gone back to it? Or were you stuck in a back room with mucky hands?) and it was super frustrating for you... But it happens. 

I hope you have a relaxing weekend and next week goes better, with lovely kind customers! "
And... The lack of accountability is spread to the next generation.. Delightful (/s)...
"Once I was *shopping* and some lady chewed me out for putting a product in my basket too loudly, because she had just gotten her kid to lie down for a nap. Bitch, please..."
"Interesting.. I can eat cooked chicken yet whenever I've tried it raw it makes me pukey. Seems to fit with the pattern you guys are experiencing, must be the enzymes."
"I had a woman on drive thru say she was deathly allergic to tomatoes once. I asked her if that meant to also take the ketchup off (I like to be sure and I was newish at the time haha), and she said ketchup was fine. .-. Strange tomato allergy she had there..."
"&gt; He replies, ""Oh, I really don't know anything about WIC. I was just trusting what you said.""

That's a unicorn right there.  Buy him a beer."
I think his goal from now in will be to catch them all.
"Yes. Yes. Thank you. I always get so pissed when I read stories of employees being threatened and they don't do anything because they're afraid of getting in trouble. This is what you're supposed to do, and what all employees need to feel free to do - call the damn police if someone threatens violence. I hope his wife was embarrassed of her choice in life partner.  
  
Congrats on owning your own business :) "
"I would upvote you, but I couldn't find a  servant boy to read your comment "
Translation is that useless means anything that doesn't involve helping her directly.
"Where are you? Because this happens to be my AREA OF PASSION when it comes to UK law (read: I work in giving age restricted sales training).

I'm kind of assuming you're in the UK because of the '18' rather than '21' but I don't know, so sorry if this is completely irrelevant to you.

BUT whilst it is illegal to buy alcohol (or tobacco, or e-cigs) on behalf of a minor, it is not illegal to sell to an adult with a minor present. In fact, unless it can be proven that you knew that the alcohol was being proxy purchased, you're in the clear. It's completely on the adult buying the alcohol (proxy purchasing).

HOWEVER it's often policy anyway in many supermarkets not to allow sale of alcohol in this situation. So whilst not technically illegal, certainly best practice and most likely policy.

Uh... the more you know? Also good for you for sticking to your guns."
"Nope, we're too sneaky. You'll never catch us."
"That's possible, I'd say. I have a friend who comes out in a rash eating raw apples, but apple pie, sauce etc is fine - something in the preparation process affects whatever substance in the apple she is allergic to."
I hate when people get their way for no reason. Or when managers do things just to shut people up. That's why they are the way they are.
"In my store we don't put any money in the drawer until after the transaction is finished. It just sits in a slot on the register, above the drawer. ""I gave you a $20!"" ""Nope, you gave me a ten and a one, it's right here."""
"I never understand why the ""go to"" reaction is anger. If I thought the cashier forgot to take off the coupon, I'd just ask. Why seething anger?"
He kills them.
I don't see how his height is relevant to the story.
"The man COULD have been lying about having cancer, you don't know. And fuck your manager for basically threatening to fire you. Someone literally and very specifically threatened to cut your liver out. Fuck the stupid rules, the cops would've been called immediately if it were me. Good on you for leaving, regardless of the reason."
"I had a customer sort of like this. 

Bill was a landscaper. He'd show up a few times a week for this or that, and he often bought large amounts of bagged mulch or decorative pavers for customers that didn't like to wait. 

An average month for Bill was probably $2,000, and he paid in full every month..

Until he got remarried and she got involved in the business. 

The second wife was a harpy who would send a check for most of the amount owed, along with a circled and highlighted invoice demanding we remove certain charges; She'd count ten empty bags of mulch in the bed of his truck and five more full ones in the barn, so he obviously only bought fifteen instead of the twenty-five we'd billed for, that sort of stuff. If she couldn't find Bill's copy of the receipt wadded up under the seat the entire order was automatically fraudulent. 

Most months her she included a promise that Bill would never do any more business with us, but he kept coming in, so we ignored her while the account went farther and farther into the red. 

Eventually Bill's account got so far behind we turned him off, and he was not pleased. The boss showed him the invoices, and after a little tutting he called the wife to bring him his checkbook.

&gt;Wife: You are not giving these thieves anything! They've peen padding their invoices and stealing from us! 

&gt;Bill: Did you bring my checkbook? 

&gt;Wife: You don't have to pay them anything! You people listen to me, we're going to sue you! And we're going to own this place!!

&gt;Boss: We have signed receipts for every purchase and cameras all over the place, ma'am. 

&gt;Wife: Oh, so you're going to try and pass off a bunch of forgeries with both of us standing right here? You're going to jail! You're going to...

&gt;Bill: Honey? Did you bring my checkbook or not? 

&gt;Wife: No.. Why are you listening to these thieves?! I'm your wife!! 

&gt;Bill: Guess I run to the bank. Let's go, dear. 

She continued to spit nasty things all the way from my bosses' office at the back of the store to the exit. "
"&gt; I... I... I just want to go back to how it was when I was done at the register.

Should have saved your progress before you went up to the shopkeeper then."
"I'm sorry, I think I just hallucinated.

Did the district manager really just let a woman steal money from the store?"
.
"i spotted a customer a penny after he went out to his car to come back with exact change,and was short. he kept telling me no. he took 5 minutes, then came back with a penny.

thanks mr. "
"What a kind young man. I mean $0.36 is nothing. I've done things like said don't worry about it. I went to buy something the other day and I had small change, I was counting it first I didn't know if I had enough and the woman said to just get as close as I could. As it was I had enough but she was just so nice about it. But for him to come back and do that. It goes to show how much of a difference you made to his day. This is just the sweet kind of story I like to see at this time in the morning."
"... Why do people leave their IDs in the car? Don't they like, keep it in their wallet, and their wallet in their pocket or purse?"
Manager has no backbone and is an idiot.
"Definitely don't blame yourself. She sounded like she was out for the cheapest deal and didn't care about her granddaughter's needs at all. I have similar relatives in my family, and they like to make a show of buying big ticket items for people as cheaply as possible, and then hold it over you. Don't think about this woman, you did a great job!

My current college laptop was 450 with a $100 discount on laptops over 500. No company is going to put a discount on something that causes them to lose money, and common sense would tell you that. Common sense would also tell you to read the coupon. Even when I buy juice or bread, the coupons say $1 off on Brand, or something similar. Why should she expect a laptop coupon to be different?"
I can't imagine being told I can't buy beer because I have my 3 year old with me. Though it would be a good story. 
"&gt;When I turned around he was gone.

And you didn't even have to throw a coin into the pond."
Na. I'm not buying beer for my 3 year old. That would be wrong. He's driving. 
The things people do to try to make retail workers lives miserable
"*without changing the policy* 

I think that's karma if I've ever seen it. Self inflicted. But nonetheless karma."
Same has happened to me. A woman was 10¢ short so I said it was fine and that I'd just cover it with my tips since it was on a dime. She came back an hour later and gave me a $10 tip.
"Guest: ""Do you offer a military discount?""

Me: ""No, I'm sorry. We don't have any discounts.""

Guest: ""Oh, well, [other store] has one.""

Me: ""Oh, that's nice of them.""

Guest: ""Yeah, it's like 30%."" (Gotta be a lie or exaggeration but whatever)

Me: ""Yeah, that's really cool but we don't have anything like that. Sorry again. Have a nice day.""

Like, I don't know if people think there is some magical combination of words that will somehow unlock the secret menu of discounts, sales, and special hidden-in-the-backroom items. I've already told you no. Sorry you don't like the answer I gave you but I don't have another one. "
"It would never occur to me to tip the person in the bakery, even if they did go above and beyond. I don't think of bakery workers as tip-employees? I'd be super grateful, but I don't tip every person who does a job well... I tip servers and delivery men/women, and on the rare occasion that I have cash, baristas. "
"I think that tags would spoil an unexpected heartwarming ending though and not have the same effect. But that's just my opinion, it is a good idea :)"
"All. The. Time. ""Excuse me, will you tell my kid that he can't have this toy?""

 ""Hey kid, your mom says you can't have it but she doesn't love you enough to set boundaries herself."""
"I was expecting a slap between a customer and employee, one way or the other.."
I was expecting him to get yelled by his boss using some explanation saying that if he gave every customer 36 cents that's 100 dollars or something ridiculous 
Especially since it would be more dumb to throw out the ice cream and get nothing from it than to lose $0.36 off the profits
"""Please leave. Thank you"""
"Almost read like you were a police negotiator

&gt;  YouHadMeAtDucks: ""We can make this right, just put the gun down!""

&gt; perp: ""IT'S NOT MY FAULT!"""
"Some people just have a victim mentality. They think they are always being taken advantage of, always the victim, everyone is out to deceive them. In some cases it is because they are poor and/or uneducated and/or just dumb, but not always. People with a victim mentality are very sensitive to any slight and also tend to think any slight is intentional."
"I could if the OP had just walked into her home but she was out in public, she can't expect everyone to cater to her and her sleeping daughter. "
"Maybe use the first one but before you say goodbye, also say ""Oh wait, I am."" with a nice little smile on your face"
"I had a customer do this to me in drive thru. She pulls up and I open my window to tell her her total and she shushes me because she was on the phone. I told my manager and when he gives her the bag he screams ""HAVE A NICE DAY!"""
"Totally had that happen. My replacement manager I was training since I was going on maternity leave. My god, you think I'd stolen from the till and not just gone and fetched a dollar from my own wallet. Lady came back 20 minutes later with the dollar to repay and hot drinks for everyone. Needless to say I did not recommend that woman for hire. "
"Raging inside because, on top of being absolutely terrible behavior from a parent, blood on the floor of *any* establishment is a huge deal and shouldn't be taken lightly.

""I'm a horrible mother who forces her son to walk barefoot with the risk of him getting a serious infection, but I can find a way to make that your problem."""
"Got talked to by a manager yesterday because I pointed out a policy to a woman as I was fixing the problem she was having. I didn't tell her to go somewhere else, didn't tell her I wouldn't fix it, I just pointed out the policy so she wouldn't have that problem in the future. She decided I was rude and filed a complaint."
