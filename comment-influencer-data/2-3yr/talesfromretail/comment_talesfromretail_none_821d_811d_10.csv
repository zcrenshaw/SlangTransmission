Wait why didn't you guys call the cops on her? She obviously stole the stuff and you had proof of it. Probably not the first nor last time she had done it. And if she took 20 shirts that's like a 1500 $ loss for you guys. 
The woman searching for her keys at the register would kill me.
"What's sad is that he has a 3 year old at home and can't figure out the basics of raising a kid, yet he expects everyone else, who may not even have kids, to know what to do."
"Makes me remember the story of the guy who showed up with a little Ford Ranger type truck and bought a full pallet of bricks. Wouldn't listen to the employee, didn't listen to the manager. So they told him to give the camera a big thumbs up and they loaded the bricks for him. The truck did not make it home."
"See, people like this are why we can't have Kinder Eggs. \*shakes head\* "
"Last time that happened to me, a customer standing in front of the line digging through her purse, I had a *giant* line. The guy that was directly behind her was obviously irritated and I felt really bad for him. He looked at me then at her and rolled his eyes, and I mouthed ""I'm sorry"" at him, just because I felt his pain. He freaked out on me and said that he was fine, no need to apologize to him and that I seemed like an impatient rude person. And then he asked the woman that was just reorganizing her purse if she needed help with anything. I lost all faith in humanity that day. I was so angry."
How can humans behave this way? I vote for a plague.
Such arrogance to walk up to your counter on her next visits. Although she probably didn't remember what you looked like because that would require to see you as a person and not a service robot.
"If I was either you or the guy covered in green ooze, I'm certain I would have started crying."
"That would confuse me. I'll freely admit that. It's pretty vague, it should really say ""buy two get one free"" or ""get three for the PRICE OF 2"" "
"I would have used her own argument against her. 

""Oh, did *you* go to high school? Because this is a 15-item lane and you have 21 items. That's six more than fifteen. A sophomore would know this"""
Of course all people in retail know everything about everything we sell in our stores  /S
"I come to TFR for the angst, not the feels, damnit OP"
"**special ed paraprofessional**

Is this the same as a substitute teacher (airborne division)?"
"Exactly, that's more than just a slap-on-the-wrist amount. "
"I gotta say, it was really weird having to go to the store within days of losing my mom. A cashier would ask me, ""how are you today?"" and I'd just put on a smile and say, ""I'm doing alright, and you?""

I didn't want to make things awkward by saying, ""Oh, my mom just died."" But, it made me think of all the silent battles my customers must be facing where they simply smile and put on a brave face.

And, sometimes, people just need to reach out to another human being. Even if it's the cashier at ShopMart. Having been on the other side, I've realized it's less about what you want to hear back, and more about just making a connection with someone, or having another person hear you out."
"1. Don't cry over spilt barf. 

2. Why not laugh? Kudos to him for having the self-possedness to realize that getting angry won't change a thing about the situation. Wish more people could do this!"
You have the patience of a saint.
FOUR YEARS EXPIRED?! How does one even keep up with a coupon that long?! Jeez.
"some countries are filled with people _not smart enough to be trusted to_ not kill themselves or their loved ones with Kinder Surprise eggs.  

edit: I said that as a joke but it's true: http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/01/26/kinder-surprise-usa_n_9081286.html  

$1,200 fine for crossing into US with a Kinder Surprise egg!? The toy is in a plastic capsule, not embedded into the chocolate, it's a hollow egg goddamn it. But I can cross the border and buy fireworks and a rifle and vote in New Hampshire no problem. WTF. "
"Holy moly, I never would expect that from a customer. Haha. I thought I had seen nearly every variation of a nasty customer reaction too. Wow. 

Sorry you had to deal with that. 
"
"&gt;We can make or break this store.

Wow, I had no idea that your one purchase of two everyday household appliances, and one shelving unit would cover our *entire* next months overhead, and that we would have *no way at all* of recuperating from the loss of this truly titanic sale. Oh well, since the laws of physics won't budge, I guess we'll just have to close up shop."
We're about due for one.
"Update: He came back in about 5 minutes ago, and talked to my coworker. 

He said ""I apologize for making this a bigger deal than it should've been, but at this point I'm going to cancel the order. It's about pride and principle"""
"They looked super stylish, honestly. I'm glad he's thinking out of the box because they looked really good on him. "
"Yer a green bean, Harry!"
"That's a rare phenomenon, because usually the parents are usually fond of telling people without kids that they have no standing in telling them how to parent."
"""Yeah, you stole. You took something that was nachos."""
"It could have been concrete, I just remember it being something very heavy like bricks. I also wouldn't doubt that it's happened more then once in some version.

At my old grocery store we had a guy buy an entire pallet of softener salt. He did have the sense to take two trips though."
"""I can't handle when Timmy does the thing! What do I do?!""

""Have you tried X? I heard it works.""

""Um sweetie you don't have kids you don't know how hard it is just stay in your lane pls :):):)"""
"Yup. I used to work in skin care and a customer came in asking what we had to treat some skin problem - I don't remember the word for it, it was scientific and something I had never heard of before. I asked her to describe it to me and what symptoms she was looking to treat (maybe it caused dryness? Or breakouts?). Instead of answering me, she huffed, rolled her eyes and said ""forget it"" before walking out.

If you wanted an expert on skin, maybe go to a dermatologist. I'll help the best I can but if I had a medical degree, do you really think I'd be working in this store?"
"""Make it 22 items. You're gonna need some [aloe for that sick burn] (http://i.imgur.com/cojBQE8.jpg)"""
"Wait... you know that story too? I heard the same one at my hardware store, except it was a pallet of concrete. "
"I had to re-read your comment before catching the pun you were making. In my defense it's about 7:30 am and I haven't been to sleep yet. 

If you're asking seriously with a joke thrown in, it's not the same as a substitute teacher at all. Basically it's a salaried position that works under the classroom teacher (or head coach if in PE), so similar to a teacher's aide, but with stricter requirements. 

If you commented strictly for the joke, well played!"
"Years ago, he defected from a secret society that was working to overthrow the governments of 14 countries around the world, and has been hunted by his once allies ever since. He was trying to live in secret until he accidentally cut himself while cleaning his weapons and was forced to get a prescription for antibiotics. Hoping to avoid detection, he gave you his middle name. But now that his true name is out in the open, he will be forced to flee and go further into hiding lest those he betrayed kill him to conceal their secrets.

It may be a stupid cover story, but it's still not as stupid as the customer."
"It's easy to assume they didn't care, but it's also possible they simply weren't paying attention to the announcement and didn't realize what was going on.    "
"Cute story :-) but be careful with manually adding coupons, esp if the item was on sale and you gave 50% off the sale price. No one was watching but the manager looks at all the manual discounts in the morning when doing the deposit. 

The frames in ""craft store"" are waaaaaay too expensive. "
It's almost as if there's nothing else going on in the world. What normal person gets this worked up over beanie baby stuffing balls! haha 
She deliberately damaged the boxes of garbage bags.  You shouldn't have allowed her to return those.  
"Love this. I sold shoes years ago, and moments like this made all the rest of the hell manageable. 

I had one little customer who just loved me. He must have been about five years old. We lived in a small town, so I'd see him out and about. He'd scream, in absolute delight, ""shoe lady!"" He'd run full tilt at me, throw his little arms around me, and give me the hugest hugs. I loved that. "
"""How dare you want to help me get out of here quickly! You are an awful person!"""
"May depend on the state. If they didn't stop the thief with the jerseys still on her person, it might be up to how the law is interpreted; the cops might not do more than just show up to take a report.

Even if they did detain her, the cops might be forced to let her go if she didn't have the jerseys at that time, despite the video evidence.

EDIT for clarification: I'm not suggesting that they *shouldn't* call the cops; they absolutely should -- I'm just talking about what the cops might do (or not do) in response, based on the ways their hands are tied in their particular jurisdiction."
"I think I'd have actually picked it up, followed her, and squashed it into the back of her hair."
"Well, I only have one thing to ask.

Are there any discounts for members?"
I'm surprised she didn't come back in complaining the glass was wrong 
I heard you work in used car sales. I'm expecting that essay about the physics of combustion engines no later than Monday.
"""I have a truck!""
I mean, technically..."
"Why would you not call the cops and try to recoup your lost jerseys? We're talking $1500 in losses, not somebody took a candy bar. "
"I don't think it was the rewards program she didn't understand, but rather the concept of money and shopping all together. "
"It sounds like you and your husband had a great life together.

How's the bird doing?"
You should just have sold her an empty case ;)
"Seriously, you deserve an award for that. Or a reward. Well, you don't earn rewards from transactions, but you will get better coupons."
