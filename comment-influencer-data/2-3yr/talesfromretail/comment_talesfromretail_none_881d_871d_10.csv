*Customers are stupid.
"If he was bold enough to look you in the eye while stealing and think you couldn't do anything, I think he deserved to have the fear of God put in him. Hopefully this will teach him that stealing isn't acceptable. As for the poor little sister, I'm glad she got the satisfaction of seeing her tormentor get punished."
"&gt;W: When I was your age, minimum wage was so much lower!

It amazes me how many people don't realize inflation is a thing.

&gt;Man: Why is it so expensive? Usually this costs $x.yz but today it costs $a.bc.

And this is either inflation or simple supply and demand. 

I mean, I learned about these things in grade 7 or 8."
Are you telling me that you DON'T know her granddaughter's preferences as well as those of 500 other grandchildren?! Or their shoe sizes?! For shame...
"""Well of course the people of your culture would never wear such provocative clothing, you're apparently from the ice planet Hoth"""
I'm bummed your username isn't Windex_Kid.
"I had a buddy that worked in a food court have that happen.  Knew he was right, security camera showed it was right, but his manager wouldn't just tell the guy to go fuck, instead he made the customer wait until end of shift when they counted the till, THEN told him to go fuck."
"Haha love that logic. Oh you're a regular person, not an employee / slave. I shall treat you with respect. If you would kindly point me in the direction of an employee so I could belittle them please? "
"Oh, and on the lighter side....   

I once asked my boss for a raise.  

He asked me how much I wanted.  

""Just pay me what I'm worth,"" I said.

He replied, ""I can't. There's a minimum wage law."""
"&gt; ""We are organic gardeners! ""

Sounds like something a synth would say!"
"That's not your fault. She asked a question that was in the area of your ""expertise"". You gave her the answer. It's her fault for asking and then telling the daughter. If she finds washing that inconvenient, she can remedy that by buying more bras to extend the weekly washing cycle. Or she can suck it up an either do it anyway or teach the daughter to do it herself."
Looks like Nemo's plan worked. He escaped the clutches of the annoying customer.
One has to wonder if she is the underlying cause to the insufficient funds based on her husband's reaction...!
"I usually shut them down with...

Me: ""You used to get $4 an hour?""  

Them: ""Damn Right!""  

Me: ""Wow. And that would have been when, let's see, gas was, what, 62 cents a gallon?""  

Them: (slinks away)"
At least these were some of the rare people who realize their mistake and apologize for it.
I don't think giving water is the correct action when someone is choking.
"&gt;What a waste of time.

Says the guy who 1) didn't bring the product he wanted to refund, 2) drove all the way to the store without said product, 3) argued with a cashier following rules in order to keep their job... all for Â£3.  Now THAT'S a waste of time."
"Didn't you know about the law that says you're required to stay open ALL THE DAMN time? It says it right in the law ""Let it be known, that all pastry stores are to remained open from 6 AM to 10 PM daily, and take no days off in the event that one person has the craving for a sweetened bread treat or chewy bagel. It is hereby stated that all stores remain open ALL THE DAMN TIME. So as enacted, April 1st, in the year of our Lord 1672."""
"If daughter is old enough to wear a bra, she's old enough to hand wash it herself. That's much better for the bra anyway.
"
Correct!
"Right?! People act like whenever prices go up we pocket the difference... trust me, we hate it as much as you do.

But we've definitely had a large number of people whine about how they made $4 an hour as kids. I mean that's fine and all, but $4 then is not the same as $4 now. Heck, I can't even get a full meal where I work for $4."
Wait. Hold on there. You mean to tell me... Using the customers own logic DIDN'T get you bitched at?! :O 
Would love an update when he comes back!
Well great. Now this guy's dead.
"Medical problem? Or just regular crazy?

We may never know. "
"&gt;Hopefully this will teach him that stealing isn't acceptable

That or it will teach him to improve his technique."
"Has... has he never played a console? Did he think he could stick it in his PC and roll with it?

Seriously... what was this guys thought process? "
"It's fascinating how some people don't see retailers as people, you guys have lives too, hope you had a good laugh about him!

Ninjaedit: a word"
"&gt; for people that...are in your situation. 

For anybody who has never seen it, this is the very definition of tact.

"
How does any American not know the name of our capital? 
"As bad as it was for the mom to ignore the boy harassing the girl (and negatory on the spanking), I've gotta give her some kudos for getting upset with the boy for stealing rather than upset at you for daring to accuse her speshul sneauxflayke of taking the candy."
"I was visibly upset, and shaking.  I also hate to be touched let alone grabbed.    Hopefully she will think twice before she does something like that again."
"I had to be quick about it to get back to what i was doing.  Honestly i was interested to see where the story would go after she got the water.  also as it turned out, she was alone and didnt even have a kid with her.  its now a joke in the kitchen to ask someone if they are choking when they grab a water."
You honestly think that would've stopped that customer?
That instills a lot of confidence in the people handling my money....
HA! I was expecting a different ending. Petty level 1000. 
"Thanks. It was in front of the daughter that she asked me. I felt like if she wanted to me comfort the daughter about hygiene she could have given me a heads up, still, over my pay grade"
Hopefully I won't be there when he comes in! Somehow I'm always the one who has to deal with him and his various issues. He's one of those people who finds a problem with everything
"I went on vacation for a week, the boss had three guys fill my spot. (construction) Two to do my job in the air and one did my work on the ground. When I returned and found out I also found that each one made more than I did. I went to the boss and asked for a raise to what ever the lowest paid of the three made. He replied ""You're not worth what I pay you now!"" I replied ""I can not steal from you, if I am not worth what I am paid I am stealing so I will not be at work tomorrow or ever again"" and walked out."
&gt; finGet out
"&gt; ""Is there no dignity in working at a grocery store anymore?""

Not really. People really look down on retail workers. :("
"The sad thing is, the mother's checkout/overreaction is probably a big part of why the kid lashes out at his sister. 

Kids need stability and consistency."
"Out the window, across the street, under the Pizza Planet truck, and home free?"
"I'll have to use that one! Where I am, gas is somewhere around $4 a gallon actually. So... I probably wouldn't get very far in life working 15-20 hours just to afford enough gas to fill up my tank once. Really puts inflation into perspective."
"You're actually pretty spot on there! She often had the hood of her jacket up as well so really all you could see was her mouth. It was strange, I've never met anyone before or since who acted the way she did."
"&gt; you're going to look great in it. I think you're worth $60.



Smooooooooth."
"You guys should hire some help tho, working 7 days a week all day long is not healthy, y'all need to live, have fun, go to the movies or whatever at least once a week. "
The manager shouldn't be letting a potentially irate customer know when you are leaving work.
"If I had to guess she has still not figured it out

She obviously was so sure she knew how this all works"
"Not to mention that the cost of everything has gone up since those people had their first jobs. If you didn't pay people current minimum wage, you would have a hard time finding people willing to work at a job that wouldn't support them. And that not every kid has parents who are willing to support them and buy what they need. Some kids are working at age 14 or younger just to make sure they have clothes to wear and food to eat. Others are out on their own at 18 and paying for everything, and that $11 an hour is the difference between supporting themselves and having to go on some sort of public assistance, and if they're able to support themselves, I think that's great!

I bet the people that say these things never had to work hard when they were young and just like being nasty to people that have more commitment and drive to succeed than they did."
There are just SO MANY! Its hard. I don't have the brain capacity to remeber all of those numbers! I can't do it! 
"Old enough to know how his dad was behaving
"
"Could she not own like 3-4 pairs, and do a load of laundry once every 3-4 days? Im just a male here but i do have a little bit of common sense. What a stupid mom that person is.."
I don't service people who snap their fingers at me.  I'm not a dog; don't treat me like one.
"She's lucky she got someone who didn't haul off and punch her or fight back. Some people react very violently to being grabbed without warning, and it could have gone a whole lot worse for her. It's amazing how little some of these people think about the consequences of their actions when they do something like this. "
"Fine, I'll sea my way out "
"You know what else they'd say?


&gt; ""Another settlement needs your help"""
"Well, a lot of people are very clueless when it comes to gaming. 

Someone I know bought Mass Effect Andromeda on the day the patch that fixes the some of the facial animations (and other stuff) was released, he legit told me *""I just bought ME:A for the PS4 from Amazon and I'm bummed out that I didn't buy it when it first came out because I'm gonna miss out on that download (referring to the patch) that fixes a lot of stuff in the game. I should have paid for same day shipping.""*

**Me:** ""You'll be okay. When you put the game into the system it will automatically start downloading all the current patches.""

**Him:** ""What do you mean? I thought it's only free if you got the game when it first comes out. Won't I have to pay for the download if I buy the game after the download has already been released?""

**Me:** ""You're thinking of Season Passes or DLC, those usually cost, this is different. A patch intended to fix the core game is most of the time, it's rare that a developer charges for a fix patch.""

**Him:** ""Dude, I'm confused as fuck right now. I don't know what you're talking about but if you say I'll still be able to get it, I guess I'll take your word for it."""
Around 16
"I thought the same thing, haha. "
Wait until you hear stories of people trying to use $2 bills and getting accused of forgery.
"&gt; As a good-fitting bra is worth its weight in gold

Its plentiful treasures does it hold."
"Thankfully I don't work retail anymore but I get the feeling that I was incredibly unsatisfying to complain to.  I responded to every dumb complaint with a completely flat ""ok"" and a blank stare.  They'd just walk away every time."
OP should change to that username 
"Once had a man do this to me, but instead of a picture he had a crumpled up piece of paper with the card number, expiration date, and security code on it... of course, in true retail customer fashion, he threw a fit when I told him I wouldn't take it"
Done.
"It was the outrage in his face that got me, I almost straight up laughed at him"
"Well, I know I should laugh, but he made me really sad. Most of our customers are really nice about it though. "
If I ever have to be on my phone while someone at a store is helping me I let the person know why. If it's unrelated I put my phone away. I thought that was general etiquette 
"Its an expression, calm down."
"[Current federal minimum wage (adjusted for inflation) is actually *lower* than it was 30 years ago.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/)

*Local* minimum wages can be quite a bit higher, but adjusted to the rising cost of living in a major metropolitan area, its again, usually lower.

People whine about how much everything costs, then turn around and try to blame it on employee wages (often the lowest cost of running a business) instead of realizing those high costs affect everyone, including those ""overpaid"" employees. "
How old was the son? This kinda changes the story.
You gotta put it waaaay up there
"I've done this. The mom did that scary mom look, paid for the candy and asked the kid to hand it over. That nasty child had unzipped her pants and tucked it into her underwear to hide it. Her mom made her throw it away and proceeded to do that tight-lipped scolding like it's right between her teeth. 

So happy. I hate people who steal."
I can never understand how a person doesn't buy the right version of a game. It's such a simple concept
