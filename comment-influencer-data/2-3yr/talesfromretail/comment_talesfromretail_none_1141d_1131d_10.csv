"ha, the freaking customers and their insane demands of signs.

Had to keep repeating to a customer ""I have no control over the signs, would you like to speak to a manager?""

Because she didn't like the fact we had signs on registers saying something to the effect of ""This register is closed""
"
"Yes, I did. "
"""Okay let me go get him"" 
 
*turns around for a brief second*

""What seems to be the issue, ma'am?"""
Sounds more like a Mondae.
I read the price of your house as $1. Give me your house for $1 or I'll call the cops.
"""...Also we're closed tomorrow, ""
That just made it all the funnier. But really, that's a nice customer so consider yourself lucky/blessed/whatever."
"""Ma'am, when did you make that choice?"""
Did you charge her for the sundae?
"Good job defusing that situation! You asked exactly the right question, in the right way, and it fixed the whole problem. Good for him that he realized what happened, but good for you too."
*Combs hair other way and puts on an accent*
"&gt;do you honestly think I would come running back here for a dollar? I had no reason to return to your store until today and I want my money refunded. I didn't drive all the way here for you to tell me 'no'.""

Lets play spot the lunatic..I think OP got one!"
"Good God, I bet people would walk into a meat grinder if I told them there was a sale inside of it."
"I once had a guy rip off a sign and bring it to me, I'll post that story one day "
"When I worked at In N Out, we had what was called Animal Fries which is where you add cheese, spread and grilled onions. Because of the cheese, we have to charge an extra two dollars or something like that. About once a month or so, you'll get a customer that asks for animal fries, no cheese. I'll try and help and say ""You can just order regular fries and add spread and grilled onions. It's the same thing for two dollars cheaper."" And they'll cut you off and be like ""NO. I want Animal Fries. No cheese."" So I just charge them the two dollars.

HOLD UP. Just got back. New kiosks are different and charge you an animal fry if you add to the fries in any way. Instead, ask for sides of spread and grilled onions. Sides are free.

Edit: I feel I should warn you, the person at the kiosk may try and correct you and say ""Oh, do you mean animal fries?"" Say no and specifically say you want fries with spread and grilled onions. Most kids working at the kiosk are new and may think that you meant animal fries. If you have to, specifically say you don't want cheese because of the charge.

I also have no idea how they do things anymore. I quit over a year ago, so for all I know they changed their game plan. But I'm starving so I might go to INO right now and find out if that still works.

Edit 2: Just got back. They definitely charged me for an animal fry despite asking for no cheese. I asked a friend who still works here and this is what you do: ask for sides. Order a fry and ask for sides of grilled onions and spread packets"
"&gt;""That's fine, ma'am, but would you mind calling the police off to the side there? This is express.""

BURN! I love it."
GASP. MY SPINACH PUFFS.
It's the law.
"""I'm a drifter... Just rolled into town."""
Up vote for standing upto customer. 
"&gt; Also we're closed tomorrow

I almost feel sorry for him now! "
"&gt;Me: No

&gt;Her: No?!

&gt;Me: Yup, no.

You glorious bastard."
"""Well, fuck me, right?""

This guy would become my favorite customer."
"Also props to the guy for acknowledging his mistake (although he was rude at the beginning). Sometimes customers are so thick minded they will just keep babbling even though they know they're wrong, but they just won't admit it."
"You gave her what she ordered, why shouldn't you. If you hadn't she most likely complained again."
Actually you DID write the policy and it's your fault that everything is going wrong and I demand a discount!
We all love the folks who call the police because of some perceived slight only to end up arrested themselves.
"""It  isn't safe for you to go down there... Because snowflakes melt in fire."" "
"You can make her wait outside, but if she's with you and under 18, we have to refuse the sale. ): Mostly because there's really no way we can ""prove"" you aren't buying them for her. 


If the kid is like, really underage (like 13 and under) we don't have to because we can pretty much assume that the kid isn't smoking them, but otherwise, yeah. 


I don't really care for the policy honestly, but I didn't write it. "
"When I worked at a fabric store we'd have people come in and steal our ad signs. Then these same ad signs would miraculously turn up days after the sale had ended (but I'm assuming right after pay day for the cheats). Guest would come up, I'd ring up their fabric orders and then they'd demand the ""sale"" price.

""See! The sign says it's on sale!""

The sign would also often be dirty or have obvious folding creases.

Always a good time.

Edit: sale, not same. Thanks for looking out Swype."
"I laughed, but I'm not happy about it."
And buy the camera they wanted from Amazon.
"Easy! Ask what make and model his vehicle is, google the gas mileage. Get out your atlas and map out his route from the store to his home. Calculate the distance driven. Now you also need to consider **how** the customer drives. Is he light on acceleration, does he speed, etc. If he's conservative with his driving habits, you should be able to use the provided gas mileage to calculate the refund. If he is a more aggressive driver, you'll have to account for that. 

Ask the customer to fill his gas tank all the way up, mark his initial odometer reading, then drive his car until the gas is empty. Check his final odometer reading. If he went 500 miles on a tank of gas that was 14 gallons, his gas mileage is 35.7mpg. All you have to do is divide miles driven with the amount of gas the vehicle can hold. 

Once you've determined his gas mileage, you need to get the gas prices around town. It might be best to get the GasBuddy app or something similar to see a spread of pricing. To find the mean, or average, of all the prices in your area just add them all up and divide by the amount of places you've counted. So if you see there are 8 places in your area, add their prices up one by one. If I add my prices up to $15.12 and divide by the 8 places, my mean price is $1.89 per gallon. MAKE SURE if he is using Unleaded, Premium Unleaded, or Diesel! 

Now you can calculate the refund! Take miles driven between home and store, multiply by your average gas price per gallon, and divide by gas mileage of the vehicle. Let's say he drive 10 miles to the store. The formula would look like (10)(1.89)/35.7=$0.52

So from our example, you would refund him $0.52 for his troubles. The cool thing about this is that it's so easy to do. Next time you have a customer with this issue, you should have no problem helping them with it!"
"So if I'm buying cigarettes with my underage teenage daughter, can I still buy them or do I need to take her home and go without her? "
"Almost every night. People think the listed hours are negotiable. No, they're not. 10 PM means 10 PM. Not even 10:01. You're late, you're getting locked out. We have lives too, we're not just robots made to serve you. 

The only time I let it slide is when the person is apologetic and running in just as I'm about to lock up. But if it's someone aimlessly wandering around the store at 9:59 in no rush to come to the front, I'm going to log everything off and just let them stare off into space until I announce that they need to leave. I'm a night manager and I don't play around. "
"I don't know what it is about the garden center, but it's like the insane asylum unloads a bus in front of our store everyday. "
"""Hi yes, I'd like to buy that 2017 Nissan Maxima.""

""Oh good!  That'll just be $40,000.""

""Actually i saw $5, so you have to sell it to me for that.""


Yep, still seems just as outrageous. "
Nono. It's only *like* the law.
"Oh, but she is the all important customer! Without her cents that she spends in a year you will go out of business! "
"Why yes, I totally chose to have my pancreas completely shut down and make my life even more difficult than it already is. /s/

Some people are just so darn stupid. "
"Whenever I tell people this story they're like, ""You didn't actually say that, right??"" Of **course** I did.  She was drunk, it was funny, and I'm weirdly protective of express.  I was the express cashier almost every single day for the first almost year that I worked there; **nobody** messes with express.  Not on my watch. :D

Edit:  I grammar'd.  #justenglishmajorthings"
Now there's an idea... 
"*deadpan* ""Slam it shut on your fingers and then hold you there until the cops arrive to arrest you for Attempted Theft."""
"&gt;do you honestly think I would come running back here for a dollar?  
  
**YOU JUST FUCKING DID.**"
"HOW DARE YOU LET HER CAT STARVE YOU DISGUSTING BEING! 


Some peoples logic amuses me. Why would the business hide them from you. Also why would you lie about working in a store like that 1 year ago. Like there's gonna be a ton of employees that have been there at least a year. Gosh. At least pick something 5+"
"See this is where i want to like you because you did what every retail worker dreams of. At the same time, i can't help but find your level of arrogance off the chart. Though for what it's worth, while i may not agree with your methods, good on you for standing up for yourself."
"Some carnivals are 'independently' managed, and carny operators have more leeway in pricing, shall we say.  But yeah, amusement parks are a different animal altogether.  

""See the corporate logo?  This ain't the Midway in the carnival for your county fair.  It's two dollars, one ball, if you don't like it, write to our corporate office."""
"My niece and nephew (6 and 3) have lovingly decorated my kettlebell and workout weights with Frozen and Dinosaur stickers. Yes, it looks very silly, but I love what they've done, because they were trying to make it special for me.

They're your kid. They're trying to show they love you. A little embarrassment is worth it every time. "
[sniffs air] Is something burning?
"You: ""Okay, that'll be $8.""

DL: ""I'm drunk and my vision's all blurry, so you have to sell it to me for what it looks like. It's like... the law.""

You: ""Okay, that'll be $88."""
"There's nothing wrong with what anyone did here.  And if I was OP, I'd be as happy as he is. But, just to point out what should be obvious: this potential customer will come back tomorrow, he'll find the store closed, and he may well go to Amazon.  Which doesn't close.  And which doesn't treat their employees well at all. 
    
One of the great failings of modern retail is that the employees believe they have some job irrespective of the customers. They don't. Every store that fosters the belief that the store is run for the convenience of the employees (who, understandably, want to go home ASAP) rather than for the convenience of the customers (who may accidentally call at inopportune times, but who also do us the favor of actually paying our bills, including the wages of the employees) is not long for this world. That is a tragedy for the store's owners, but it also ends up having a not inconsequential effect on the store's employees. "
"I don't think they get that we want good customers coming back, or even what a good customer is.

I had a woman in using a gift card, that was like a dollar or something shy of covering what she was purchasing, and she asked if we could discount it to the amount of the gift card because she was spending sooooo much money (it was like 30 or 40 dollars). It's a gift card, you're not spending that money, someone else already did. I just awkwardly say sorry, that we can't do that, and she informs me ""that's a bad way to keep customers"". Well good, we don't really want to keep customers like you. Had never seen her before, haven't seen her since :D"
"I had a guy get overcharged $0.43 for some produce. He went all the way home, turned around and came back, I refunded the difference. Then he asked to be refunded his gas money for the mistake. How do I even figure that out. "
"""Yeah, I make minimum wage at ToyStore. Let me ring up the VP of logistics over at LEGO and get an emergency airdrop shipment to our store here in Possum Balls, Iowa. I have his personal cell number right here. After all, it's Your Right As An American™ to have whatever you want whenever you want it."""
I think that's why our store has (1/22-1/30) on the bottom in tiny print to tell you when the sale is supposed to end so people can't do that
"I kinda hope they come back, look at the posted hours again laugh about it and then go get ice cream"
"We had a discussion one day about when something goes from just being a dish of ice cream with toppings to becoming a sundae.  It came up because one person claimed she hated sundaes but loved ice cream with whipped cream, fudge, a cherry, and nuts on it.  It was a confusing conversation."
"&gt;""DID YOU PUT MY SON IN HANDCUFFS?"" quite loudly to which the officer said no ma'am, to which she responded ""WHY THE HELL NOT?""

This got me... Son probably caught a whoopin"
"""Well ma'am, it certainly sorts the wheat from the chaff. Have a nice day now!"" "
"Back when the Wii was new and still really popular, I had somebody say to me, on Christmas eve, ""It doesn't make sense that you wouldn't have any wii's in stock so close to Christmas.  Wouldn't you think people a lot of people would come in and buy them?"".

Yes, people want to buy them, that's why they already did."
"&gt;They're your kid. They're trying to show they love you. A little embarrassment is worth it every time.

Exactly! It's like that meme; (paraphrasing) ""no matter how big and tough you are, when a two-year-old hands you a toy phone you answer it!"" 

"
"No I don't want ice cream, I want expensive ice cream "
"I'd guess she has a white board or a to-do list on her fridge.

That cashier who walked off should be worshipped. My applause to both of you
"No idea, I guess I would if it was $5"
"At restaurants, we do the same thing. Five minutes to close? Well, yeah, come on in. 

The most annoying thing is when someone walks in and says ""when do you guys close?"" 

The host says, ""10"" or whatever

 And the people say, ""WOW WE MADE IT JUST IN TIME HUH"" 

Like, yes, technically...no need to rub our faces in it :("
"I was thinking ""because fertilizer explodes."""
"Honestly, that's the only reason I didn't make some effort to remove her from the store myself (e.g., page the store director or call the police myself).  The store was busy and if she was willing to make the call for me, no harm no foul.  Every sober person in the store knew she'd be the one in trouble :D"
"As a bank teller, we have had people take it even further than that. We have had people call the branch at 5:59 (we close at 6:00) and ask if we can wait for them because they are stuck in traffic etc. Keep in mind that almost without fail, these people can do the same transaction at the atm or even online 99% of the time. we had one particular woman who said she probably wouldn't get there until around 6:30 and had to deposit her check that day and it would be ""real quick"". It was well past cutoff, and there was absolutely nothing we could do to make it post that day, no matter how late we kept the branch open, but it would post that day if she did it in the ATM. She was still very pissed when we told her we could not and would not keep the branch open an additional 30 minutes for her on a Friday night. . I've also had people come up to me in the parking lot on the way to my car and ask if I can please open the door so they can do a quick transaction... Do people not know that everywhere counts down registers, locks away money (often in a times safe) and we can't just go in and open everything for you, no matter how ""quick"" or ""easy"" you feel your transaction is? It's not like we just close at random times or anything, we've had the same hours at this location since it opened... Like 10 years ago. Some people just don't get it."
"I went into sports authority because I needed golf shoes and they were having a sale that i got a flyer for. I bought some Adidas shoes which had a sale sign on it, and then they rang at full price. I told them the sign said different. It was slow, as always, so a manager checked the sign, and then disappeared.

Turns out someone moved the sign, not me, and I got them for the sale price.

I went home and checked the flyer, and Adidas wasn't on sale. I was nice the whole time, and would have paid full price because the shoes were kick ass."
"Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out."

"&gt; I was taken off guard and made very uncomfortable

Shopping with my wife a little before Christmas a few years back and I saw something I knew she would want.  We had separated in the store and I had no idea where she was so I hid the item under my jacket, holding it with one hand and keeping my jacket covering it with the other.

When I got to the register I took a few moments to look around to make sure my wife was no where in site.  Not seeing her I stepped up to the register and quickly pulled the item (a fire place bellows if your wondering) out from beneath my jacket, put it on the register and said, ""Hi!  My wife's in the store and I want this to be a surprise for Christmas, can you scan and bag it real quick?""

That's the first time I noticed the expression on the young girls face as she breathed a sigh of relief and said, ""THANK GOD!  I thought you were about to pull out a gun and rob me!""

I hadn't really thought what all that would have looked like from her perspective."
Thanks for upholding my constitutional right to check out quickly when I have 10 items or less.
