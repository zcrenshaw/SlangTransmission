This is the sweetest thing. I hope I have a marriage like this some day.
"I kept it for many years, and I passed my first test (and many others) with it! Unfortunately, over the next 20 years, it got lost in one of my many moves. "
Please tell me you still have that pen?
This is the cutest thing I've read all day. 
"As do I, based on Star Wars, bad puns, and true romance. "
"How...How dare you uh... Need to use the facilities?
"
"&gt; ""and are trying to educate our son on how to buy things in a shop!""

""so teach him to respect opening hours"""
I know!  Just terrible.  We should be forced to use a litterbox in the back room between the hours of 3pm to 4pm only.
"I think that one will always stay with me. A very simple little act, but it made such an impression on me."
I didn't realize this is an old story! It's cool you remember it. :)
And he never bought anything again.
"I got screamed at by an old man once, because I wouldn't let him into the bathroom, because both of the only working toilets were broken. 


He threw an absolute fit, screaming ""age discrimination"", and claiming that ""we were keeping the bathroom all for ourselves"".


Customer logic: They are the only people who exist, and further, the only ones who matter. "
Hope that kid's doing something cool with computers now!
"""Well sir, we are usually more helpful when the store is *actually open*. Sorry about that."""
She's probably over writing her own posts in /r/TalesFromTechSupport as we speak.
And today he's a mod on r/frugal_jerk
"""Chew"" Romance... 
"
"Ah the price match for the thing that is totally not that thing.

Had an idiot wanting to price match a high end filing cabinet with another store's generic brand cabinet. Trying to get a $120 fancy as all hell cabinet for $20.

And our own generic filing cabinets for the same size were $15 at the time but absolutely refused to look at them."
"A couple years ago, my wife and I unknowingly got each other the same ""I love you like a back alley hooker loves crack"" valentines cards.
[Here's a picture.](http://i.imgur.com/YKwvOzo.jpg)"
I am glad to have helped out. It was too cute not to share.
"One of my favorite experiences. A little girl walks up to my register and puts a doll on the counter. She waits half a second before picking it up and walking away saying ""ok bought it""

Things touch the counter then you get to take them home. That's how it works right?"
"This belongs in r/wholesomememes

This truly is realtionship goals."
"I'm really alarmed that your manager didn't knock and make sure it was empty before unlocking. You'd think he'd make absolutely sure of that, right?"
"""Since corporate dictates the prices go up 25% higher every fifteen minutes past closing, we certainly won't object to it either!! Haha""

*(cue customer shock)*"
Clearly she's worked retail at some point in her life. 
SCOOPING WILL NOT BE DONE ON COMPANY TIME. 
"I really wish this kind of thing weren't common but the other day I was using the more public restroom at work and in the only stall. I just get seated and see two sets of feet come in, one guy goes to the urinal and the other guy comes up to the stall and pushes on the door. Locked. Good. But instead of stepping back and waiting dude starts to pound on the door. When that doesn't work he grabbed the top with both hands and was shaking the thing as hard as he could. Meanwhile I'm sitting on a toilet staring at the stall wall shaking and just shocked. I know I said ""occupied"" a few times but it didn't stop until the first guy turned around and said ""DUDE!!! There's someone in there!"" And the guy just went ""oh"" and waited his turn. 

And if I ever own my own business that's why employee restrooms will be separate and barred  from the general public. "
"Standard game theory problem. Everybody is better off if you shut these guys down every time, because they'll stop causing so much trouble. But at each individual encounter, you're better off if you cave in."
I'm getting so happy imagining them giving the cards to each other and opening them at the same time. This is way too cute. 
"The memory is what's important. The pen is just a symbol. Don't mourn the loss, it served its purpose. "
"It wasn't a tip exactly, but one night we were open late because management thought it would be a good idea. We had very few customers so several of us had gathered near the front chatting a bit, mostly about how hungry we were.  Customer checks out and leaves.  He came back 20 minutes later with a big bag of burgers for us to share!  Awesome customer was awesome!"
"&gt; ""If you'd like, we can just assume the address and let your stuff get lost."" 

The correct response in retaliation to their attitude. "
"I love my good customers.  They always make my day better, and when the gods smile upon me, they are behind a bad customer and point out the idiocy of what ever my current customer is whining about. "
Reminds me of the time when I sold my son for trail mix 
Just remember to scoop when you're done. 
"&gt; we don't get paid after 8 so he's essentially working for free there

I hope she was exaggerating in order to make a point; if not, AND you're in the US: That's 100% illegal (a Federal labor law violation) unless you're on salary. It doesn't matter if you're scheduled past 8, or even if you're willing to work unpaid for that extra time; they have to pay you for time worked."
"You have to love people that feel like they need to make up for the deplorable humans in the world.

This world needs more Tiny Sheet Metal Bicycle Ladies."
"&gt;both of the only **working** toilets **were broken**

What? How? "
"Or maybe she was a decent human being.
Statistically speaking your observation might be the correct one."
Hate the ones who come in at almost closing time and think they can stay well past closing time because they are just that special 
"customer stormed out saying ""SO YOU DON'T PRICE MATCH THEN!""

"
"I've used something like this before when I was FeM at a grocery store.  I was right in the middle of my 2 weeks notice and I just said over the P.A. "" We have now been closed for 20 minutes, any items tendered after 9:30 (We closed at 9) will be subject to a 10% surcharge for employee inconvenience"" I've never seen people move their ass to the checkout that quick."
"awwwww! I love it! 
I always think of this elderly couple I served all summer when I worked at a 24 hour breakfast joint. My last shift serving them, they put a $10 bill in my hand and said, ""Good luck at school!"" I was going into my last year of college. 

I'm glad you passed your first test with it!!"
"I worked in a liquor store for 4 years.
I've had people yell at me for carding them.
I've had people yell at me for not carding them.
Some people are just angry and looking for something to be angry about."
"I believe there was a very cursory knock, then an immediate opening of the door. Manager probably just believed what the ladies told them!"
"Haha poor kid.

I dont like adulting either little guy."
"dvds buy 3 get 2 free *does not include dvd box sets

brings 5 dvd box sets up, gets angry. every. time."
"The security cameras have been used more times to prove a customer wrong, then to catch thief.

However last week we had someone steal a fairly large item. Once we figured out it was gone, we pulled the video, and posted it to the local Facebook page that everyone in town uses. Had his name in 10 minutes, and his mommy called in 30 minutes.  I had her come in and pay full price for the item, to bad the one he stole was a non-working demo.. LMAO"
TMW you try to be passive agressive but you end up just encouraging the person to be stupid
"Health and Beauty Aids. High dollar, small product size are highly desirable to shoplifters."
"Well, they did at least teach their kid one lesson.  Know when stores close."
Pfft. Why should anyone? Retail slaves are there to accommodate me. 
That's because printers are demon spawn.
