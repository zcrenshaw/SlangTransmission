I like that you are a problem solver. You made your problem someone else's problem.  You are management material!  
"&gt; Oh my goodness, you're an empath, aren't you!  I completely understand!  I'm one too...

So many different thoughts here:

1. If... if one were actually an empath... wouldn't they be able to sense another empath?  

2. Oh my goodness, you're an X-Men mutant, aren't you!  I completely understand!  I'm a mutant too...

3. BB, how did you get this way?

4. OP, what made you take this job?

&gt; The benefits of charging an apple with positive energy from a crystal plate?

Are we talking food apples or phone Apples?"
"&gt; ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶.. I think I pissed her off‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Well, there is always the *apology* route, but it *is* a *customer* we're talking about here."
"I don't get anything in return for my hard earned money, except for the items I buy. That's not good enough!"
That's pretty fucking despicable.
Really not that interesting but they arrested her when she got to her car. I had to go out and identify our product. Her trunk was full of stolen goods. More than enough for a felony. 
"&gt;EL: ""you didn't run after me when I left my groceries!?? That was a test and you failed! That's why you should be fired!!""

That one's the best."
You have an excellent manager.
"1.) INORITE.   
2.) Some days I hate being a mutant so much. Being the only normal person in a sea of crazies is terrible.   
3.) I want to ask that of 90% of the store's customers.   
4.) Through a series of uncomfortable circumstances, I am taking care of my senior parents and needed a mostly part-time job (this is about 33 hours a week) that paid Okay ($11/hour) and was close by (15-20 minutes depending on traffic.) I just severely misjudged the level of crazy I would be dealing with on a daily basis.   

We are talking about food apples. Gotta boost those positive ions that'll imbue you with the ancient energy of the universe. "
Your boss is an ass. You should submit a complaint about him.
A hundred times yes. While she was sitting in the back of a cop car. 
"&gt;we had her on video stealing more.
&gt;Let's just say the night didn't end well for her.

Okay, you *have* to fill us in."
I'm used to people hitting cancel by accident. She was just acting so weird. No one has ever tried to type in their own total before.
"Maybe its cause I ordered my PC parts via online services but I thought it was common knowledge online stores like Amazon, new egg etc etc try and pack everything together. That has to get old friend.

Edit: ""etc"" even though ""cuz"" was a more serious offense"
That kid knows how it works.
"If thieves were smart, they wouldn't get caught. This means that all the ones we have stories of are hilarious because of how dumb they are. "
Important to teach them the value of money!
I believe it's because I'm a young lad with a baby face. I get told that I look between 16-19. She thought she could try and intimidate me. She knew what she did was not right because she didn't ask for management.  
Is anyone else kind of concerned that someone with a temper like this is raising a pitbull...? 
"I've never even heard of breed-specific food. I'm not sure pet stores even carry it. They just carry different flavors and brands. Dogs aren't that different from another that you would need to care about anything more than how many pounds they are and if they need sensitive stomach food.

EDIT: A bunch of people have pointed out some brand called royal canin that does breed-specific food, but just as many people have informed me that they're kind of garbage anyways. Also someone pointed out puppy foods, which is actually a real thing that's important."
"Knocks on window ""why don't you smile more?"""
So I guess you could say he needs to find another shrubbery?
Bet you smiled then. 
"Notify the restaurant owner. If the restaurant becomes infested, the owner can sue the woman for damages."
"You'd think if he planned to steal from the get-go, he wouldn't have given his information, and from the way he was mumbling and making OP feel a bit uncomfortable, I wonder if maybe he'd taken some sort of drug or something that made him not totally aware of what was going on. Or he could just be a really dumb criminal."
I'm more concerned that he is so committed to breed specific food that he will force his dog to starve if he can't find it.
"Alright class lets all say it together.

&gt;A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part."
"I went into a Mom &amp; Pop store that had a sign by the register. It said ""If you claim you're never coming back, there will be a $10 liar charge the next time you return."""
Any minute now! 
"Ah, it's beautiful when they play themselves "
"&gt; It beeps funny when a transaction is bad.

Yup, mine goes ""beep"" if it is good, but like ""BWONK BWONK!!!"" if there is a problem. There is no mistaking it."
"Thyroid prescriptions are 30 to 90 day refills to, like why wouldn't you pick it up with a week left of the previous one. And she wouldn't die without taking the medicine anyway. "
"SO many stories on here about people trying to use all their change to pay, and then whipping out paper money to either cover the rest or to cover the whole thing if they realize they don't have enough change. I've dealt with these people myself.

This lady....I'm sure my blood pressure would have skyrocketed too. LOL I mean, she's giving you all change. Then she's paying an odd amount with a twenty....which means she's going to GET CHANGE BACK. Kinda defeats the purpose of giving you change.

But I'm glad you were able to find someone that speaks Spanish! LOL"
Not a smooth criminal.
"Lady, a lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on ours. "
"I supposed dumping a bucket of water on the kid as they left and yelling ""April Fools"" would have been wrong. "
"Hahahaha!!! Unfortunately, it's kind of a running joke around the store about the EXISTING infestation of the restaurant. I guess they *COULD* blame it on the range.."
"Me: ""Sorry, that's not my job. *This* is."" *puts OL in a full nelson and frogmarches her out of store*"
"Man, her husband must've done her real wrong lol. 


*""You're just like every other man I've met!""*"
So are you going out of business now?
I really do.
"You heard it here, folks. If you can run, you aren't disabled."
"haha, you made me spit out my coffee!"
"""Why didn't you fight for me?""

Because we're in our thirties, Lisa! "
"&gt; ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶.. I think I pissed her off‚Ä¶.‚Äù

*GASP* really?? *You don't say.* Telling someone they ""don't know what they're talking about"" when you went to *them* for help and advice insulted them?

God forbid they own up to being a jerk and apologize to you or anything, apparently their ego is too big and they'd rather leave without the info they needed. "
By taking them without paying. üòÇ
"Well, if you're getting paid $11 I guess I understand.  If I was getting minimum wage at that crazy house I'd find another job.

I work at a ""natural pet food store,"" which to most people just means that our foods have meat as the first ingredient and no artificial ingredients.  Of course, I sometimes get people asking me what food will best get rid of worms, because they don't believe in doctors (and by extention veterinarians).

I always tell those people the exact same thing.  ""If you had worms, you would go to the Emergency Room.""

I slice my apples and put them in rolls with cheddar and spinach.  You should try it.  (Would the sandwiches taste better with all those extra ions?)"
My mother would have said I get food and lodging for doing chores and she is undercharging me.
Time to get some copies of Playboy in and specifically mention that they're now in stock every time she visits! 
Corporate response makes me happy. Yay for responsible businesses!
"You met a monster. I know we joke about customers being horrible monsters, but some people really wouldn't care if suddenly your eyes popped out and your brains started to ooze out of your sockets.

I've seen too many crazy things done at accident scenes were emergency personnel are trying to help people in a car accident, and some jackhole is trying to squeeze their car by past the cones so they can get pas the accident scene 10 seconds faster. Or just general ambulance chasing so they can get through traffic faster.
"
"Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here
    beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect 
    with a little path running down the middle."
"People with problems like Crohn's or UC may use it because running to the bathroom from a handicapped spot will prevent a lot less crap-in-the-pants situations than parking farther away from the door. That's one situation where that's helpful. 

Also people invisible disabilities like that or other autoimmune illnesses also have problems with chronic pain, weakness, joint problems, etc. People like that may not be using a walker or wheelchair, but they're still struggling."
"I'm 50. If you asked me for my ID, I'd tell all my friends. "
"As someone in Arizona who has done work dealing with invasive non-native species, fuck this guy. 

Out of curiosity, do you remember what plant it was?"
What on earth did her age have to do with anything?  
This. Hope he gets written up and ask for your fucking gift card.
"Common knowledge is a lot like common sense, not everyone has it and far too many people who have it don't use it."
"&gt; ""My son doesn't work for $10 an hour.""

That's why he doesn't work at all. That father is the same person that puts an advert asking for a recent graduate with 10 years of experience in specific area you are qualified to 5 years after graduating."
I think I found one of your customers. I had a loony that I provided tech support for. She said her computer had bad energy. So the dumb lady opens the case and pours a magnetic powder all over the inside. Of course she didn't tell me she did that when she opened a ticket for her entire system being fried. 
Because about 90% of patients literally won't think to do that until there's 1 or 2 days worth left.
"It sounds like she's a pro at this if she knew multiple ways to avoid paying. But not a very smart one, or she'd have known when it wasn't going to work and paid to avoid being banned. "
At least he admits it.
What drives me nuts is the fact it goes bwonk bwonk when my chip purchases go through correctly. I thought I did something wrong when I first heard it. 
"No no, a rough, callous criminal for sure!"
"Marketing at it's finest. People don't like to think, so you take away the task by selling them a product that matches exactly the thing they need. Of course other products would work as well but since this product mentions your intended use specifically it must be good. Special USB cables for Samsung phones, cheese for pizza, etc.

Not that different breeds wouldn't require different food, but there is no need for breed-specific food."
Sounds like several women I've dated. 
"Sometimes insurance companies won't cover it until there's only 1 or 2 days left either. That's how my insurance is with one of my prescriptions. It sucks. Not that I would remember to refill it a week in advance anyway, but it would be nice to have the option.

ETA: I also wouldn't get mad or ask somebody to do something that could get them in trouble to get my prescription though."
I've never understood pitching a fit over getting ID'd. You drove here right? You should have ID. 
I think you mean chocolate
"&gt;Customer: ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶.. I think I pissed her off‚Ä¶.‚Äù

And the customer is always right"
"It's a higher wage than lots of the ""office manager"" positions in my town, so worth putting up with for the time being. At least I'm rarely bored there. 

Oh geeez. THOSE kinds of people. I've been lucky and haven't run into too many of them yet, but you can tell without initiating conversation -if they're buying books on all natural healing methods, healing crystals, healing statues, healing incense...yeesh. Anyway, I've been meaning to check out the new ""natural pet food store"" that opened nearby, because my cat is allergic to chicken of all things. oh! I bet my store and that store could totally partner up because my store just now started offering ANIMAL REIKI. Let all the non-vet-believing customers know that animal reiki is a thing and they'd be stoked. 

I love apples and Edam. I bet I will love apples with cheddar and spinach too, so I will totally try it. (The sandwiches made of ionically-charged apples would probably connect you with your spiritual fruit guide. Kinda like a cereal mascot but fruit instead.) "
