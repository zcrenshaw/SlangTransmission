"Thank god you defended yourself. One of the worst things in these stories is when a customer blatantly insults someone and they just give them the retail smile.

To an extent, you have to defend yourself. I was lucky at my last job to have a manager who did lots of floor work so she knew how hard (most of us) worked, and how polite (most of us) were. If we had to tell a customer we weren't going to help them anymore it was for good reason.

If a customer ever overstepped their bounds she stood up for us and that's an important quality for a boss to have."
"Daaaaamn, you called her out?

You are my hero."
Risk losing a customer? Has she even been in there in the past four years?
your manager was an ass.
"The following year: ""Due to customer dissatisfaction, [Donut Company] Australia will not longer hold 'free donut day'."""
"Worked in the gardening dept at local hardware chain. I'm clearly at my register ( there's two ), waiting for this lady who I saw approaching. Behind the counter and everything. 

She starts putting her plant pots on the counter of the other register. I politely tell her I can't ring her up there. She demands i do, because she's already taken her stuff out of her cart. 

I tell her I'm willing to help her move her ( all of ) 5 plant pots to my register. She demands I help her at that other one. 

I tell her I can't. Not assigned to it. She storms into the store and finds my fucking manager. I get written up for ""refusal of service"". "
"I don't see how saying you lost your name is an insult to a kid not being able to see. If anything, you were joking with the kid like you would with a kid with sight, and you were treating them as normal. Isn't that more important? That the kid is treated like every other child that comes to the counter?"
Right?! Nothing will make me pull out my sass like using that line. 
"&gt; gimmee

Seriously? What was he? 3?"
"So ... He spent extra gas money to save a few cents on produce? 

In what way does that possibly even out to a financial gain?"
"Good on you! Don't cave, everyone needs a manager with a backbone."
"&gt;She completely ignores me, picks up the closing sign and puts it to the side and starts unloading her stuff. 

Does she legitimately think that's how it works?"
"""It seems you've filled the phone to capacity.  This is easily fixed by resetting the phone to factory settings."""
"I love replying with "" what makes you think I hate my job.""

If anything I love my job. That's why I don't break the rules "
"&gt; cafes are for smoking

Haven't heard this in years"
"These people that work at corporate offices ths t bend over to customers must not know, or have forgotten, what it is like in a sales floor. I wish, for a single month out of a year, they be forced to work on a sales floor, in a department they are over, and work under the same perplexing policies they have created. Bastards. Yeah ... I'm not bitter any at all."
I work at a cafe/bank hybrid. Customers sat down on the couches and instantly took their shoes of while drinking. The banker had to tell them they cannot do that.
"Obviously he should be treated special every moment of every day, or otherwise, what's the point of his mother blinding him in the first place? 

Edit: thanks for the gold! Love you ðŸ˜˜"
"I'm having serious trouble imagining a cafe/bank hybrid. Like... cafes are for smoking, relaxing, enjoying a brew... maybe having a scone or slice of pie or whatnot. 

Banks are the place where hope goes to die."
"Just put a windmill in front of his mouth, he'll have all the energy he needs to commute"
"And that's the kind of message you wish all mothers taught their children.  As opposed to the typical ""yell at the cashier, steal things, complain until you get what you want, retail workers are less than human, etc"" that you typically get in TFR.  Good for mom, and glad you got a water!"
"Kind of glad this wasn't the ""customer tried to take my personal water bottle"" story I was expecting."
It is so rewarding with the boss has your back.
"Oh he still is an ass. I got the hell out last year, but apparently he's gotten worse according to people I still talk to there. I recall one night where he kept us an hour and a half after closing to face every aisle in the store. Wouldn't let us go until he checked all of them. 

Before I started at the store he went away for chemo for like 5 months, and I would have figured that would have humbled him a bit. But literally his whole life is that damn store for some reason. 

Edit: chemi-&gt; chemo   Fucking phone"
"Yes but only after I poured it into a smaller cup, she said she didn't want to waste the whole large."
That is textbook sweet old lady.
"&gt; M: You were pregnant for four years?

This is pretty much exactly what I would have said. With a held tilt, and slightly squinting my right eye."
Tune in next week to another episode of dragon mall Z
"this reminds me of when I worked at a self service copy shop.

we had plenty of copy machines available, but one of them had an out of order sign on it one day.

I watched from my counter as a lady walked directly to that machine, moved the sign, put her card in to start copying, and (obviously) have it not work.

she huffed and came to me saying ""this machine doesn't work omg blah blah"". 

I walked with her back to the machine, put the sign back on it, and said, ""yup, that's what out of order means"". 

I love it when people can't/don't read signs.

"
I feel like at most places you're just sort of expected to take all the abuse.
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, Instant Karma! Now with sprinkles!"
I will never understand why people go shopping for stuff on their lunch break. They act like they should get special treatment. I'm sorry but life doesn't revolve around you...
SIR I AM NOT A SHOE PERSON!
That will make it worse when she starts screaming they hacked her phone to get rid of her pictures. 
"&gt; NO YOU JUST LOST A CUSTOMER FOREVER WHAT KIND OF PERSON SERVES THAT? 

You may have just dodged a bullet there.  Can you imagine if you actually made her sandwich and she LIKED IT?

She'd become a regular.  She'd always be asking for you because you're the ONLY one who ever makes her sandwich right.  Soon she'd have managed to get your cell number and you'd start getting calls, ""I'M HERE AND YOUR NOT WORKING!  I NEED YOU TO COME IN REAL QUICK!  YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE MY SANDWICH!"".

Finally you're on the phone with the police at 3AM while she stands outside your bedroom window with a bagel in one hand and a bagel knife in the other screaming, ""MAKE MY SANDWICH! MAKE MY SANDWICH!  MAKE MY SANDWICH!  MAKE MY SANDWICH!..."""
*stole* her pictures.
"""Attention customers: there is a car in the parking lot with an open trunk. If you hurry, you can grab whatever you want out of it before the owner can get out there to close it."""
"Yep, I was just thinking that this is usually how one person ruins it for everyone else. :-\"
"Yes.  Yes, it is.  I pity the kid who's going to grow up expecting to be completely coddled just because he's blind.

Not saying no one should help him, but..."
"The guy had a legitimate complaint, but he sent it to the wrong person. As OP said, s/he had no control over the schedule. 

I wish more people who had this complaint would call corporate. Maybe then they'd realize that understaffing is costing them sales."
"It baffles me why customers will come in to a store and try to ""explain"" how a promotion works, store policy, sales, etc. to a *person who works at that store*. Yet it happens all the time.
"
"On another thread some idiot called the poster out for losing a customer when they would not price match a product based only on the customers word that the product was cheaper somewhere else.

My response was along the lines of, ""I think we found the guy who works for corporate!"""
Losing a customer like that is a GOOD thing. Bending over backward to prevent losing a customer like that only gives them more excuses to take advantage of you. You did the right thing.
"A unique variation on the whole ""I bought this the other day from the other store and want to return it now, paid cash and I don't have a receipt"". "
"The only thing I can think of is that she wanted the car owner to come up to the front and thank here personally for taking a pic of the ajar trunk. But if I got paged to the front of a store for something like that, I would turn to the person that took the pic and ask ""So why didn't you just close it?"""
"I've found it best to respond with a higher level of insanity. 

""No ma'am that can't be right. October didn't exist yet in 1916."""
"I'm Danish I work in one of Denmark's busiest (and most successful) department stores. If you get angry and start making a fuss, we will not serve you until you calm down. Continue and you'll be escorted out and told not to come back."
"I hope she was banned too and the police called. I mean *just to be safe* since it's possible she was a danger to herself. 

""Hello Police Officer. This customer was saying she is considering suicide. Can you check it out please? I couldn't handle it if something happened to her."""
"&gt;""My. kid. can. read.""  



But obviously this kid **doesn't want to**. Maybe customers should actually listen to people (who only want to help) for a change. 

Edit: word"
"""Sorry ma'am you don't shop here enough to power this register for a day let alone 4 years"""
"""Sir, if you don't understand sales tax, then I think you're going to struggle with the concept of interest rates, too """
"Literacy is HARD, man. She didn't understand the squiggly symbols on the sign."
"Thank you. Favorite line I heard from someone as I was working at that same thrift chain: ""How do you expect me to get back to [destination] when you *only* have four cashiers? You'll be the reason I lose my job and if that happens I'll have yours!""

Maybe give yourself adequate time to shop and get checked out then? "
"""Fucking wasted my time""

Oh no, your resume fell off the board into this conveniently close garbage can. Aw, shucks!"
"Ah, a lifer. That's why he takes it so seriously. I got written up for not being in my department when someone needed a hunting license. I went to the bathroom. I was gone for at most 5 minutes. 

Some managers have to lord over their kingdom as it is the only place they can lord over. "
We must work at the same place. I had a regular come in two days ago asking if his points combined from both months. Then got angry at me when I told him they don't (they never have). He's here at least twice a week too.
The kind of person who is still looking for a job 
"I hear that guy Bell was working on some phone or something.

What a fucking dweeb, it'll never take off."
"&gt; So the next guy pulls up and pays. As I'm handing him the food, he notices the drink sitting there and asks me what it is.

""It's a drink for another order."""
"&gt; T: No. Listen here. I drove all the way out here on my day off to return these damn things. You're going to return them or risk losing a customer.

Every now we get the ""I drove all the way here and *you* are inconveniencing me"" person and I can never feel sorry for them. We have a store telephone, call us and check in advance to see if we're open/have the product you're looking for/can reasonably assist you in any way before making the trip."
"""Remember me?! I've never been to this store before!"""
"I get the advertisement complaint a lot. Also we give our bag money to charities and that's always a really good way to shut people up who complain about the charge, makes me feel much better."
And I want a refund on this car because it is out of gas!
"I refuse to believe, perhaps in vain, that a manager would break the law for a customer.

There's no way, right?"
"AND I LOVE YOU, RANDOM CITIZEN! "
"Me: So are you gonna pay me for my time explaining this to you? I'm wasting my time explaining this *again*, who's gonna pay me?

Sir: ???"
"Yeah! I didn't want to be rude, but she couldn't find time in 4 years to bring those back? "
"LMAO I LOVE THIS HONESTLY 
"
"I almost got written up once for not being at the service desk because i was showing a chstomer to an item, a required part of my duties. So it's like what do i do, do my job and get written up, or still do my job and get written up?"
You have worked in retail for 2.5 years and nobody has cussed at you? I was working for 2.5 hours and got cussed out
"Sane people who have never worked retail would never believe something like that would happen. ""People aren't that terrible."" Yes. Yes, they are."
"Would have been nice to be able to grab a blank piece of paper, and write the number to corporate on it with a *non-functioning* pen."
"While all along the creamer was secretly hidden ""in the back""."
