Don't they always write in cursive on cakes?
I can only imagine it look better because it'd be less stop and starts
"&gt;CAN YOUR SON EVEN READ?

Thank you for saying out loud what we readers were thinking."
"Less labor-intensive, too. "
"Worked at a charity store. Fire alarm goes off, I direct the staff out, go through the store to make sure all are out (acting manager that day). Lady wants to pay first... nope, doors thattaway, get out.

Then customers still wanted to enter, and the owner of the neighboring store wanted to turn the alarm off as it was ""disturbing his customers"".

Literally surrounded by idiots."
"My guess is she didn't want to get out of her car in the cold, and expected you to freeze and do it. Sorry lady, but if you aren't willing to do it, why should a poor retail employee, who probably isn't allowed to wear her jacket on the floor?"
"Kids that little don't give a crap. It is the crazy parents. For instance my SIL made a snide remark that we had forgotten to put our daughter's  name and age on that freebie smash cake that some bakeries give out for a 1st birthday. No. We didn't forget.

She doesn't care. She isn't old enough to care. She just just wants to destroy it. I promise she isn't going to wake up in a cold sweat in her thirties thinking mom didn't even love me enough to even get my name on my fucking smash cake. "
"I want to have a smart comment for this. I really do. But...I just...who...what?

People are weird. "
"I'm a woman. The only shoes I've found that fit comfortably are men's size 8, 4E. Women's shoes, even the ones that claim to be ""wide width"", aren't wide enough. 

In case your wondering, it's really difficult to find pumps in a men's 8 4E. "
Community college bookstores are often known for using Adobe After Effects at the end of every shift to make sure any questionable sales responsibilities are placed souly on the customer through advanced frame by frame editing. It's common knowledge. 
"I have a female friend that needs to do this, but she gets all her cute shoes from a drag site.  They're women's  shoes in men's sizes made to be super cute and stylish. You could try that! 


Edit: 

Haven't been able to contact her but try searching ""men's high heels"" or drag shoes.  I wish I could be more helpful! "
"A warehouse near where I lived had a fire, and the staff on the other side of the firewall were forced to keep working since the firewall was rated for 8 hours.  The fire marshal had that manager's ass served to him on a gilded platter as part of a four course meal."
"Ah, the sweet karma of people who really should not draw the attention of cops, doing just that. I really wonder how people can be that stupid. "
Fewer labor intensive....?
Sounds like you should make some notes on that guy's account.
"""Families?"" ""Dinner?"" Please. You're all mindless retail drones who exist only to ~~pass the butter~~ sell me things. Now get me your manager and/or free gift card before  I tell you a paradox, R2-D2."
I was standing on the razor aisle putting up some shaving cream and this dude takes some razors and slides them in his pants and I'm like. I can literally see you.  
"I hate when they try to rationalize their behavior. 

'It's a sample!'. No, no it is not. A sample is taking a little bit to see what everything is like so you know if you want more. If you're taking more, then it's obvious you like them, so the 'sample' has done it's job and no longer applies. What you're doing is greedily gorging on candy like an unsupervised three year old. And frankly, I know three year olds with better manners and more sense than you."
"""Well obviously he can't read it! *It's in cursive!!*"""
People really do just find ANYTHING to latch onto for some kind of freebie don't they.
"&gt;I work in the electronics department at a major retail store.

and there wasn't any kind of camera coverage of the area that this took place in or of the aisle that she claimed you threw her phone down? They couldn't talk to the person in the photo department about this customer?

Maybe you are better off somewhere else."
"""Oh, that's hard."" That's what she said.  There someone had to say it."
Makes me wonder where the kid heard it in the first place. Children do not come up with those phrases on their own. 
"Ha! He sure showed *you!*

"
"The logic of some people is amazing. ""Theres a solid 5 hours left on that bomb timer so go ahead and finish out your shift and we'll call it a night"""
I didnt even have a jacket that day either! I have other customers that do this as well. Sit in their cars for over 30 minutes before coming in.
"I used to work at a grocery store with an in-store bakery. We had a ~70 year old Asian lady that did all the cake decorating. Couldn't speak a word of English, but could decorate the fuck out of a cake.

She couldn't speak English, but she could read the letters (enough to put them on a cake anyways). So any time someone ordered a cake, the manager would write down what they wanted on a little order sheet.

Anyways, I was a cashier and was working the returns counter when a nice young couple came up to me and said they had to return their cake. 

I asked them why and they said, ""We ordered a chocolate cake with blue frosting around the edges, and we wanted one of those plastic 'Happy Birthday!' signs you guys sell on the top. No writing or anything.""

Well I open up the cake, and in *perfect* cursive frosting, it read:

###*Plastic Happy Birthday Sign*

I gave them their money back.
"
"&gt; C: Um... why are you guys leaving? I have a water sample.

We're leaving because we close at 5 and the universe doesn't revolve around you."
"I wonder if maybe the mom is from a working class background. Not that wealthy people can't be polite, but it seems like that kind of empathy comes a lot of times from having worked retail or similar jobs. "
"People take it from the trolley because they think its from the back so its ""fresher"" lol, exact opposite. "
"When I was a kid I used to hear things like that on TV a lot.

There are lots of possible sources. "
Same with apple juices or chips. Ive seen moms open gerber products to for their children to eat only for them not to pay it and leave it behind. Since then we've locked the baby foods behind glass it sad that we had to and now moms are angry because of it.
"I'm in my 30s, and I want a smash cake."
"Good words may include 'willful destruction of company property' and 'under no circumstances allow this man to have an account here, any employee found to have sold or rented to this man will be terminated with extreme prejudice'.."
"In order to do an exchange, there has to be something to exchange for.

I don't know why this is such a hard concept to grasp."
"People are rude in Canada?! I thought it was a magical wonderland where the money is waterproof and smells like maple syrup. Where they watch hockey, eat donuts and always say please and thank you."
I tried to not do cursive... Looked worse than nothing at all
"Ah yes, I vividly remember my second birthday and the fiasco that was the cake. I knew the bakers wouldn't be so gauche as to use block letters, but the cursive script was appalling! It was almost as if the decorator had never taken calligraphy while studying abroad, so I had it sent back and we sorbet instead.

Or maybe none of that happened and I don't remember anything because I was *two years old*. "
"Sounds like he might have been in a form of shock, if he had just that minute received the news. 

But yeah -- still weird. "
"We used to have this guy that would come in and try to price match our stuff with completely different models on his phone. Obviously that doesn't fly. I dealt with him so many times as a front end manager. 

Anyways any time a cashier called and he saw me coming... he would just go ""Argh no. Not her. Nevermind."" It gave me some satisfaction each time. "
And I believe they should be very. carefully. worded.
"if they were smart, they wouldn't have that many warrants in the first place, would they? "
"Something on the opposite side of this I found out that last week there was a pretty major gas leak in my shopping center.  They cleared all the stores in the center, plus the one not connected but still in the same parking lot... except for mine.  We never once heard anything about it.  No one called, came in to clear us, nothing.  We're in the center of the center so the stores to either side of us never crossed in front of our store while evacuating so no one ever stopped in to tell us.

Glad nothing major ever came of it but damn, now we know where we rank around here."
"If management is unwilling to look at the footage to determine the customer's story by verifying that OP didn't throw her phone across an aisle, then they aren't a manager one should want to work for.  I'd advise that OP complain to your district manager about your manager's incompetence before leaving."
"Sales Report

Nice weather. Good mall foot traffic. One scary-ass dinosaur bird. $0"
Stupid sexy Flanders... 
"Bah, they don't even check the cameras when things get stolen."
We don't give you what you want. We give you what you ask for. 
"&gt;**Somehow** I don't doubt the truth in that.

If its still somehow, you dont know too many customers. On many occasions i was working produce. I honestly now think the bannana stand ij the CENTER of the produce is actually invisible "
"People are dumb. The amount of times Ive had people come up to me having found something out of date and asked if they can have it discounted.

NoooooOOOOOOOOOooooooooo"
I don't think she realized that her son doesn't care about what's written on the cake at his age as long as he can smear it on as much surface area possible.
"This is the same customer that wants to buy a window and when asked what size insists ""STANDARD size, of course!"""
"I recently got myself a 10 gallon tank and everything added up, it's cost me at least $300 to create a safe, clean, stress-free home for my little guys (a cobra guppy, some tetras and an otto) and I'm still running into problems. I have a build up of gunk on the bottom of my tank along the gravel, and it's starting to become slightly overrun with those damn mystery snails.  

People seem to think you dump a fish in a bowl and it'll be self-sufficient. No way. Fish require SO MUCH care that if you aren't willing to learn and purchase whatever necessary to give them a happy and healthy life, maybe a pet rock is better suited for you.

Guys like that grind my gears. "
"Whenever someone says that I just say ""Neat, you making a purchase with us today?"""
"You can have as many as you can afford.  There's nothing stopping you.  Sounds like fun, to me."
"I honestly need to do this. Anytime I put on a pair of pretty lady shoes, I just look down and see a man's foot."
He responded to the wrong comment and got massively downvoted lol
"Oh, I so wish you had security cam footage of the expression on his face.  I would love to see that."
Could you imagine her reaction if it was her kid needing CPR and no one helped because there wasnt a screen?
Stay out of my house 
"It was in the 20's today where I live, not counting windchill. I don't want to be out in that more than necessary, but I'd never demand someone come out to my car and stand out in the cold to talk to me while I stayed nice and toasty inside. Just, people, it's a five minute walk into the store, if that's too cold for you, you shouldn't have left your house. And it's awful to force someone else to suffer temperatures you aren't able to stand."
