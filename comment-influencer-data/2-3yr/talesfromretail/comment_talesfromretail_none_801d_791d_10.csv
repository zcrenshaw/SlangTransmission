"I thought this was a ""she called to complain about something minuscule and made a huge deal about it"" but this was a fairly nice post. I'm glad this post turned out so nicely!"
"I'm glad that she wasn't a jerk about it.

However... Do you guys not honor old sales signs that were left up? We do that automatically, then take the sales sign down."
"Get up, pick up her card, walk all the way round to the customer side of the counter as slowly as possible, swipe her card, walk all the way back as slowly as possible, place the card on the counter, all while making eye contact."
"this reminded me of a Garbage story I have.

I don't work retail but I do run warehouse that has 3 full sized dumpsters out back.  We have had MAJOR issues with illegal dumping as of late so I have been forced to buy locks and lock the dumpsters over night. Apparently people didn't take too kindly to that 

One person decided it would be a good idea to drop off about 10 bags of household garbage. Now me being the petty person that i am, having some free time I throw on a pair of gloves and open a couple bags,  BINGO mail with the persons address.  I load all the bags into into the back of my pickup and drive to the persons house (2 min drive down the road).  Toss all the bags onto their front lawn and go back to work.

Couple hours later this clown has the balls to come to my warehouse and yell at me for giving him back his garbage.  He is getting quite heated but i can't help but smile the whole time.  My warehouse has camera (with audio) EVERYWHERE.  I tell him if he really has a problem with it I would be more than happy to call the city and show them the recordings of our conversation (in which he admits guilt) and he can enjoy the $5000 fine for illegal dumping.  Turned tail and got out of here double time."
"""WHY IS THIS JUNK SO EXPENSIVE""

Ha.... Showed them"

OK. *puts cloths away underneath counter* Is there anything else I can do for you?"
"Had a customer do this last night. For us. He would have been fine if he had come in a minute before closing, but he was apologizing constantly for coming in so late. Not his fault really wife called him on his way home and said they needed dog food so he stopped at the first place that had it. He knew what brand and formula he needed and got special treatment as my coworker overheard him and grab it off the shelf for him before he even got halfway through the store and brought it up to the register. Even if he had stayed past closing he would have been fine- since we are scheduled till 30 minutes after closing and it only takes us 10 to do the closing process."
Should have held the ham back until she apologized. There's no need for a customer to scream at an employee
I.. what? Who assumes you can do a refund at a restaurant? 
"&gt;B: muttering Oh, because your fingers are broken?  

No, but thanks for the vote of trust. Hand it over and I will skim - uh, scan it for you if you like. *Scan*. Sorry, did I say skim? That's totally last week. I ain't like that no more. Just hand it over, and I'll, uh, scan it for you."
Were they also informed that their estimate went up by $200 to cover the purposefully damaged product?
"""Lady, one more obnoxious outburst and I'm licking this ham!"""
"&gt;we are scheduled till 30 minutes after closing and it only takes us 10 to do the closing process.

I wish more stores understood that. When I worked retail many times we closed at 9 and were only scheduled til 915. Depending on what was left to do, it was really hard to get outta there in 15 minutes. "
"Is it bad that my immediate response to her children query would be ""What about them?"""
"How the heck do you not realize that you just paid over a hundred dollars for something that should have been three or four dollars? Didn't he even check the amount when he paid, or notice that he had a huge receipt, or anything? I mean, I know people tend to zone out at the checkout, but you'd think something would have made him realize something was up!"
"Yeah, hold the ham hostage until the rude-ham-lady pays ransom with a nice apology"
"""With any luck, a 24 hour adult store.""

"Probably not honestly. My aunt was the one that took care of him that day, she was such a sweet person I highly doubt she would charge him for any damages. I know one of the boards, a glass mosaic piece survived the fall undamaged, I think the other was just slightly chipped. Which speaks well for the quality of their work. "
"I might be wrong but I think it is actually the law to uphold a sale if the signs are left up. Businesses used to leave up sale signs on purpose to trick people into getting items at full price since not everyone would pay attention. This is what I remember my old manager telling me when I used to work in retail. 
Edit: I live in the US and in California, apparently here it is legally required for the store to honor any sale signs that are left up and any mislabeled shelf prices, has to be a whole shelf worth of items with the wrong labels not just one item. I actually didn't know it was different in other states, I thought it was national law but as others have pointed out it does vary depending on state and country."
I love love love this story. Your attitude is perfect. Smile and laugh your anger away. Some people only think they can read others. 
"If we do, I haven't been told about it. The dates of the sale were clearly written though, not in little fine print. "
"&gt; WG: Excuse me? Were you even going to tell me that or just let me have the orange that fell on the dirty floor?  
&gt; Me: What? I just told you it fell on the floor.  
&gt; WG: But you weren't going to tell me.

Please tell me you're exaggerating or embellishing or something. The very thought of this exchange is causing me physical pain."
"&gt;""You're getting ready to lose a customer over two dollars.""

Ma'am, you just said we're a multi-million dollar company, I'm sure we won't miss you."
Found OP's manager.
"I bet another customer was originally going to buy a £1.29 pack, then saw the £1 packs and left the £1.29 pack on the shelf where the £1 packs were.  Obviously rich bitch thought she could bully the cashier into selling it for £1 on account of someone else's laziness.

EDIT: u/burlapfootstool, you're absolutely right.  I was barely awake when I was browsing reddit this morning and skimmed over the first paragraph."
"Customers, that's who."
The fuck?
I read this thing all the way to the bottom waiting for the lady to have called corporate to complain for some minor detail. And I'm pleasantly disappointed.
Thanks! I try to post positive stories!
"I love it. Reminds me of a time my friend left a bunch of trash in another friend's car so he gathered it all up and left it on his lawn. Anyways I have to admit that occasionally I'll take trash from home and put it in the dumpster behind the store I work at, but it's ok because I'm allowed to use that dumpster. "
"""No, my fingers aren't broken, but obviously your brain is.""

Happy 4th!!!"
"I'll never understand how people don't understand that handmade stuff is more expensive. It takes a lot of time to do it, why wouldn't it be more expensive?"

"As a former store manager I always scheduled twice as much time as the till take to count out.  Not just for the sake of late guests, but because I wanted the shop to open looking like it was new each day.  Everyone understood, but still the last minute folks drove us a bit crazy."
Why are people so shocked that a majority of stores have cameras? It's so people can't pull dumbass acts like this.
"I used to do that, then they would feel stupid and say 'I could've done that!'"
"Except when you return to a debit card the cash doesn't show up right away. It can take a day or so to process. 

Usually find this level of frustration in drug addicts trying to return crap for drug money

Edit: a day or so - is anywhere from 1-15 business days. Usually 3-5"
"He was probably on autopilot and his wife was out of town so only when she came back she looked at the reciept, looked in the fridge and asked him wtf."
"I love it!...  but you do have to get awfully close to the goblin, though... bleh.  :)"
"I had a similar situation a few weeks ago. We close at 9:30 on weeknights. I had a customer in the store around 9 that gave me a bunch of items to hold for her, and said she'd be right back. I warned her that we close at 9:30, and she said she'd be back before we close.

At 9:25, this customer calls my store. We'll call her CL for crazy lady.

Me: Thanks for calling Clothing Store. This is SufficientlyAwkward, how can I help you?

CL: Hi, I had you put some items on hold for me and told you I'd be back to buy them tonight, but I'm not sure I'm going to make it there by 9:30, as I'm just leaving Store at the Opposite End of the Mall. 

Me: Okay, well I'd be glad to extend that hold until close of business tomorrow for you if....

CL: EXCUSE ME, I don't want you to extend my hold! I want you to stay open late so I can try on and buy my items!

Me: Ma'am, we're not able to stay open late due to scheduling restrictions. I can't force my employees to stay after they're scheduled, nor can I stay late this evening. But I'll gladly extend that hold for you if you'd like!

CL: Well this is just ridiculous! What happened to the customer alway being right?!

Me: ...Would you like me to extend your hold ma'am?

CL: YES FINE. However I'll be sure to let corporate know how you refused to accommodate a customer! *Hangs up*

By the time I'm done on the phone, it's time to close. We close the doors and are finishing up some straightening, and about ten minutes after we close, Crazy Lady shows up outside the door. 

CL: *yelling through the glass* EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, I'M HERE!

Me: Ma'am we're closed.

CL: UM NO. The lady I just spoke with on the phone said that you'd let me come buy my items!

Me: Ma'am you spoke with me, and I told you we close at 9:30. Your hold has been extended. We're open from 10 am to 9:30 pm tomorrow. 

CL: BUT YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT THERE, JUST LET ME IN.

Me: ........No. Goodnight. 

I walked away from the door and just let her yell. Later I found out that she complained to security about me, and then threw a fit when security told her that I was completely justified in not letting her back in. She came in first thing the next morning and bought her items from my assistant with no issues or complaints. 

TLDR: Crazy Lady thought she could extend my store's hours because ""the customer is always right"", and I shut her down."
"I mean technically you can, but it's only if there's something wrong with the food not because you don't want it anymore."
I love the spellings of your spoken words!
"I expected this to be about a customer throwing a tantrum over a penny, but this was a really sweet story! It's nice hearing about such a lovely family and such cute kids, and you're a great person too :) Thank you for sharing!"
"""I know."" "
"""You couldn't read the 'employees only' sign, so you'd probably get lost going out to.  Here I'll have security escort you out.."""
"I'm assuming you mentioned this to your manager? Because Id've been like..""Remember that guy you let return..."""
Exactly what I would have done.
I also laugh when I'm nervous. But what else can you do when working retail? I can't karate chop these dummies. 
"Personally I'd honor the sale, but that's the policy of my company."
"Well ma'am, the children may eat food from the food pantry too."

"I've hung up on a few customers. Unfortunately it doesn't quite feel good because if they've pushed you to that point you're probably upset yourself
"
"No. Way. I can't believe someone is dumb enough to thi... actually, yes. I can. "
"Pro tip, when someone starts screaming just start making really loud childish noises over them. If they start back up, keep doing it until they get embarrassed. And laugh. Laugh maniacally at them.

It's what I do with toddlers until they smile."
I love your manager.
"She just wanted to play the victim card and complain the entire time while doing so. 

There is no helping people like that. "
"I absolutely love it when people try to complain to a fictional ""corporate"" on mom-&amp;-pop family shops."
I don't understand. You don't eat the orange peel so why would it matter if it fell on the ground?
Don't even. Just take a looooooong look at the numbers and mouth a few numbers to yourself. Then turn the card over and take a look at the back. Then proceed as normal. Don't say a word.
"I paint as a hobby and have never intended to sell my work, it's just for me. One of my coworkers asked me to paint something for her, she said a poster board was fine since she wanted to hang it at her desk. I did and she insisted on paying me $10 for it. The GM saw it and told me he wanted to commission me to do the same but on big canvas and he would pay me well for it. I spent about $40 on supplies (canvas, new paintbrushes because this was one of those projects that would cause me to go through quite a few, an extra bottle or two of paint, etc.) I spent the entire weekend on it 12 hours a day including about y on friday, so around 30 hours on it. I bring it to him and he hands me $40. I told him I spent that much on materials because he specifically asked for canvas so he gave me another  $20 the next day. I made  $20 on 30 hours of work. People do this all the time. I've never painted anything for anyone else except my fiance since. "
Humans.
"Actually, yes. She was happy with me. Especially since he didn't complain. "
"What was she hoping for? You to just be like ""hey that's cool I got you""? "
"Ah, okay I thought both were wrecked. Sounds like both could still be sold with a little work."
Some stores consider that to be a form of shoplifting and/or retail fraud.  
"""I know what it is, but I'm not at liberty to say."""
"Are you sure that's 10 inches, it looks too long to me?

Clearly it was at least twice as long as what her husband described as 10 inches."
"Seriously. That's why I was like, your total is blah blah blah. I usually announce the total so they pay and gtfo. But not this particular time. "
"So... sweet story, but I'm afraid I also don't know what ""no fireworks. No license"" means, and I'm not Hispanic.  

Now that I've typed it in, I'm thinking it means ""we don't sell fireworks because we don't have a license to do so"". Is that it?"
