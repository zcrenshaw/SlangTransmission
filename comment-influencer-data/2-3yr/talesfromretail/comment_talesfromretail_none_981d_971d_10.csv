Bless the customers who say what you can't.
"No, see, he wanted to exchange it. He gives you his crapped out, broken mouse and you give him a brand new, more expensive one. "
If it were me I probably would have ringed her up then daydreamed about the badass way I should have responded. You just responded like a badass. Well done.
"This is awesome. Fuck people who are like **""Not my problem""**"
"&gt; I DESERVE 50% OFF OR SOME LOYALTY BONUS!!!

So do I, sir..."
Oh how I wish they mean it when they say they won't come back.
You are my hero.  That's the kind of thing I usually come up with long after a rude customer has left.  Bravo!
"I cut this story down short - it was probably 5 to 10 minutes of them insisting, arguing, and complaining about the styles we had. (These were free shoes provided through my store's partnership with a local charity, so they didn't get full selection.)

When I showed them the son's shoe, I put it as gently as I possibly could, since I had no idea how they'd react. A cutesy little shrug and ""oopsie daisy"" smile. They really lightened up after the fact, which was nice, and thanked me afterwards. 

Then as soon as I left I laughed my ass off and told my bosses about it so they could have a laugh, too. I still think about how slowly I rotated that shoe. It was perfect. 10/10

Edit: a word"
"I have some here, in my overcoat. There; next to the $50 Rolex.."
"Oh yeah I checked that out.  May have been why he was annoyed?  But the box and mouse had the same serial.  The serial wasn't registered on the receipt though so it could be possible if he kept the old box.

But yeah I am very suspicious of the angry customer routine.  Have had that tried on me by customers many times."
"Asked a guy this one time for ID when he was buying smokes. ID was expired; doesn't count as legal ID here. 

""But it's still me!""

""Sorry man, those are the rules""

""Not my problem...""

Umm... It was the very definition of his problem. Especially as he didn't get his smokes. "
"Good on you for standing up for yourself. Nothing to feel bad about here. This guy was obviously looking for something to be pissed off about. 

I mean... a soda. That is was what your job was worth to him. Some people can be so ridiculous."
"&gt;not following laws is what landed you in jail in the first place


And you should go to jail for absolutely killing my sides with that level of burn.


Seriously though, what the heck is wrong with these people?(Customers that think laws don't apply to them, not inmates/ex-inmates)"
You'd think that the one thing you should have is gas at a gas station rather than a drinks machine
"That customer is clearly a novice, the first move should be asking to speak to a manager. Besides, all lawsuit threats should be preceded by accusations of fraud and/or theft. Step up your game, Foreign Guy."
"Oh I need to know, what was your reaction/how did you feel when they came to the realisation that they were wrong. "
Who knows. Maybe he's a gamer or something ?
"Underagers get so pissy when you won't sell to them, it's fantastic. 

It's them and the 21-26 year old crowd too (US seller). Like, nothing magical happens to your face when you turn 21, you have to show me your ID if I ask. Sorry that you somehow made it this far in life operating under the impression that your age is printed on your forehead. 

I had one girl say to her friend when I asked for their ID, ""Ugh, I'm going to be carded FOREVER."" Checked her ID--turned 21, THREE WHOLE WEEKS AGO. Oh the humanity! I should have known how MATURE and OLD this girl was. I'm such a bad liquor store employee--still having to ask a recently of-age person for their ID three weeks after their birthday.  "
"Yeah that was on her. She's the one that waited for 10 min before even asking if you were in line! Not to mention ignoring all cues that you were not, in fact, in line. "
10 minutes = ~ 45 seconds 
That's hilarious. I don't know if I could have kept a straight face if he just kept repeating it.
He is a *hardcore* gamer. He plays Counter Strike. You are probably some noob. /s
'What the hell do you mean you are giving me what I want.  This is ridiculous.  I am never shopping here again.'
"'I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER'.

What do they think this is going to achieve? Do they think Managers are these big scary ogres who sit out back waiting for the complaints phone to ring, then loom over the lowly employee and make them lick their boots?

PSA: We know our managers. Yeah, some of them are shit, but a lot of them work with us every day and know that you're probably lying through your teeth if you complain about us being rude/unhelpful/lying to you. If you complain that we haven't given you a discount, they're going to want to know why you think you deserve one. Seriously, this is a lose/lose. Stop threatening us with our managers."
"Many many years ago I worked as a bartender. The first night at my first job, at closing time, the manager had to practically throw a few patrons out who refused to leave.

To a person, they all groused and threatened to never come back again.

Being naive, I asked my boss, ""How can you stay in business if those customers never come back?""

He looked at another employee closing out a register and they both broke out laughing, saying something along the lines of, ""Justwanderful, stay this young. Stay this innocent. Never grow up.""

To my surprise, when I clocked in for my next shift, many, if not all of the customers who were pitched out at closing time were back drinking and having a good time like nothing ever happened."
"He wouldn't get far with my manager xD


My manager is pretty much perfect in these scenarios. When someone disagrees about something (typically our returns policy), I cite them our company policy and how long you have to return or exchange a phone. As soon as they say ""I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER"", I say ""He'll tell you the same thing, but I'll bring him over."" Cue the part where my manager hears out the customer and asks me if I made her aware of company policy. 


""YES HE TOLD ME BU-""


""I don't know why you're speaking to me then. I'm going to tell you the same thing.""


- * Cue the ""I TOLD YOU SO"" Face *"
"What a miserable pile of flesh! I seriously cannot believe the nerve of some people. I would have been just as shocked as you were. If/when that happens again, I would definitely refuse service and let a manager take over. I know that's really hard during holiday time, but that is no way to be treated. People are the worst, sorry OP."
I bet next he's gonna call Microsoft and complain that nothing works on his PC running Windows 98 and demand that they release software updates. 
"""Not my problem either. Anything else I can help you with?"""
"""I don't feel like it anymore, so YOU should do something that goes against your returns policy because *I* said so."" 


""And I just realised, that bracelet displayed on the shop window is showing a price cheaper than what I paid for it a year ago! I demand you refund me the difference because ME ME ME ME ME!!!"""
You never know the background of those people. She did handle it in a nice manner though in the end!
I think it was a junkie mind trick he was trying to pull on you.
"I saw a customer threaten this once, ""I'll tear up my card and never come here again!""  The cashier,  an older lady with no fucks to give silently bent down,  got the waste basket and put it out in front of the customer,  who blushed and stuttered and stammered but did NOT throw their card away. It was a thing of beauty"
"&gt;You could literally never come back and nobody here would ever care

Oh god...say it again. It's so beautiful."
"I bought CS:GO, played for three minutes, and refunded it.  I saved the first round I played by ignoring everyone telling me I was going the wrong way and surprising the last enemy player.  I was told in no uncertain terms that despite showing skill and tactical awareness I was a complete noob and that noobs aren't allowed to play CS:GO against players until their third week of play or something like that.

I'm 29 years old and first played Counter-Strike in middle school.  Y'know...**fifteen years ago**.  I'm definitely a **total** noob at CS, I have **no clue** what I'm doing, and I'm lucky I didn't shoot myself in the head.  Bloody fucking stupid is what shouldn't be allowed."

"I'm in my thirties and love being carded. 

Last night I was getting a six pack with my pizza. A young girl who couldn't have been older than 22 gave the cashier such a hard time being carded. It was my turn next. I whipped out my ID and offered it to the cashier while loudly thanking her for checking IDs. 

The cashier cracked up and rung me up. The young woman just glared at us both before walking out with her oversized bottle of arbor mist."
"Oh, how I will love the day that I'm able to help someone by telling off someone being a rude know-it-all."
"More likely than not, they're either new money types, or people that shop for designer clothes at discount stores after season. 

Anybody that is truly wealthy usually doesn't have a need to flaunt their wealth wtih gaudy logos and brands, and would know better than to (nor would have a need to) ask a question like that one. "
All day? And he couldn't have stopped at a gas station to take care of business? All day long?

"I did a price adjustment for a customer who had quite a few items. I tried to explain to her that she wouldn't be getting much back (if anything), and that the promotions she purchased the items on were better than the ones she'd be adjusting to, but... nope. The whole thing takes a good 15 minutes to do. The whole time, she's huffing and puffing and impatient. I finally finish, look at the screen, see that I owe her 1 cent, and hold back my laughter. You see, she paid with cash and Canada no longer uses the penny. There was nothing I could do. I couldn't even put it on a gift card for her. It took all my willpower not to tell her, ""I told you so!"""
"It would be fun to watch this lady at an auction house, trying to bid less and less."
"I recently learned how to work on the registers and I can't believe how some of these customers overact. This one lady was returning something that I could only return to the original card and she gets all psycho and tells me that she will tell everyone she knows not to shop there. I replied ""...ok,"" like yeah I can change the way the registers work too lady. 

I don't like confrontation, but I also don't go above and beyond for rude customers. Although still not as bad as this one woman who was returning items pass our 45 day return policy and I told her that I could only offer her what it was currently selling for. She tells me she spent over $100 for the dress and if she did not get the original amount she would take her store credit card and rip it up right there and then never shop in the store again. Like ok blame me because you can't read the policy printed on every receipt. "
"As an Earth Science teacher, you wouldn't believe how many students will see a large crystal of quartz (like, somewhere between the size of a larger pebble to the size of my fist) and ask if it's diamond.

I tell them that if I owned a diamond that big, I'd retire from teaching and go buy an island somewhere."
You spelled it wrong. It's Rollex.
People in Hell want ice water.
Plus on top of that there's a super market next door that has a very public bathroom. A lot of times people who are very angry about feeling like a thief is because they are in fact trying to steal. 
"I'm forty-mumble and wish I'd still get carded. 

Out with my family the other night, 26 year old niece and her 25 year old boyfriend get carded.  21 year old niece and her 22 year old boyfriend get carded.  33 year old sister, carded.  My wife, who's a few months younger than I am.  Carded.  They look at me, 'yea don't worry about it'.  fuuuu."
"""It's ok honey, I'm sure they won't close. I'll just pop in to get a few things.""

""What do you mean you're closing?! I drove in the snow to get here!"""
"Oy, thankfully you got a new job! If management doesn't back you up when you're getting physically threatened by a customer, then they need to be removed from their position."
The proper response is to ask them what they do for a living and then ask them to perform that act immediately for you. 
"I once had a tenant (same as a customer except he was ""buying"" shelter) who didn't like the fact that I wouldn't give him his security back after breaking his lease.  He threatened to call my boss. I couldn't take this guy anymore, so I decided to be honest with him. ""Mister, who do you think told me to hold your security? You think I care, like I'm going on vacation with your money?  Hell, call the guy.  I'll probably get a raise."""
"You should say ""potahto"", if they look at you like you're mad, ask if they want the tomatos or tomahtos, if they say neether, you say nyther, then call the whole thing off. "
And she doesn't see the irony of insisting she is a good customer through this whole exchange.
"real talk. If i didn't know about him and he didn't come into the store at all, it would have worked out and the girl could have bought the swishers. that level of thinking is probably what caused him to get caught for whatever got him in jail before. "
Young people still haven't learned not to talk to their friends when the friend is in a store where ID is required for purchase...  I learned this when I was 15 and my friend's brother would buy us Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill on the weekends.  Only took me one time to figure it out.
Baklava is amazing. Why anyone wouldn't get that first is beyond me.
It blows my mind when customers insinuate or outright demand money off because they... just don't like the price?
"Two things struck me as odd. 

One, the fact she had the bag and felt like it was a coupon that could be used anywhere, without confiscation

Two, the bag says 15% off whatever you can fit inside it. She didn't have any items inside of the bag, she was holding it in front of her chest like a trophy. All of the items she wanted were on the counter."
"I got to do this once. 

I went to the place I used to work at in normal clothes. I walk in and there's this woman arguing with the cashier about a mailer coupon. The place had put up plenty of signs saying it was a print mistake. She kept being rude to the cashier while he waited for a manager to tell her exactly what he and the signs said. 

I stepped in and called her out, told her that the cashier had no power over the mistake and she was causing a scene and inconveniencing the cashier and the rest of us in line. The cashier, a former coworker, gave me the biggest ""thank you!"" look. 

After that she got super defensive and changer her tone completely while still running her mouth. Finally the manager shows up and tells her they won't honor the thing because it was a mistake and that there's enough signage to indicate it. 

I loved that feeling of ""now I can call you out"" since I was also a cashier at this place and that was my old shift. Had I been working there still, it would have been me dealing with her. "
I'll infer from this comment that the 9th is the circle of mini marshmallows.  Yay!
"Not really related but this reminds me of a manager that did the exact opposite for a co-worker. It was a gas station that should have had two cashiers working from about 12-8 but could never keep enough staff so it was almost always just the one plus the manager.

Anyhow, my co-worker had some sort of bug and was violently vomiting every 20-30 minutes. Instead of sending her home and running the register until relief came in, she just put a trash next to the till. I was amazed when I heard about it later. I wound up getting her fired for unrelated reasons but never told anyone I was who turned her in. It happened about a year and a half ago and I'm still proud of costing her her job.

It's always nice when you're reminded that there are people out there that genuinely care "

"I called my local Ford dealership and tore the salesman a new one because my Ford Pinto was in an accident and now I want to replace it with a brand new Pinto and he told me they don't stock the Pinto anymore.  How friggin hard is it to keep them in stock?  Jeez people... I am taking my business elsewhere!

"My store had four tills. The fourth till did not work as a checkout machine, it could only be used for stock. I genuinely have no idea how this worked, but we couldn't ring people out, and only produce workers could use it. I was just a lowly cashier, so I never asked, I just accepted.

In order to make this the absolute most obvious, we completely stuffed what would have been the checkout aisle with boxes. It looked awful, but there was no way you could access the till. The boxes were knee high and filled the entire aisle.

Every. Day. I had to explain to people that it wasn't a working till, even when there was no one else in line at any of the other registers people would stand and try to use this till. I would point out that there was no cashier, I would gesture to the aisle full of boxes and people would be furious that we had 'tricked' them. 

I will never understand. "
