Pretty sure it was a lie and she just didn't like your service. Or shoes. Or something equally as crazy.
That title had me expecting an asshat and I was very pleasantly surprised.
"&gt;When the guy came over, he said he'd wanted to come to my till to say thanks because if I hadn't asked him for the Id, he wouldn't have realised he didn't have it and it would have messed up his whole night

"Smart move by the tow truck driver. Too bad the truck can't be towed, but now it's not likely she'll be using it either."
"Barista: ""Large mocha on bar!""

That old grandma stole ingredients and then made the staff eat them. That's some super villain style badassery right there.

The chain says she knew what was going on
"Hilarious,  and they totally deserved that, but be careful; stores have been charged with false imprisonment for less. "
"The cops were happy we stopped them, apparently one had a warrant out for his arrest."
"Something that I've found odd is that when I swipe my debit card some stores you have to press the ""red button"" to run it as credit and other stores you have to press the ""green button"" for credit."
Great story OP!
I will also bring up the fact that some of the managers here value sales over compliance with the laws regarding age restricted items.
I love it when a customer breaks retail mode (in a good way). :)
"OT but an odd coincidence story.  When I was 16 I popped corn for a Showcase Cinema.  I'd come in way before the movies started for the day, there was a huge open parking lot and I owned a beat up old Chevy Camaro so naturally every day I worked I would get up to about 100 MPH in the parking lot before locking up my parking brake and spinning like a top across the lot.  When the car came to a stop I would pull into the nearest parking spot to where I landed and go to work.

Almost ten years later, in a different state, I am at a party chatting with some people I have never met before.  Turns out one of them used to work at the restaurant/hotel next to the Showcase. 

When he finds out I worked at the cinema at the same time he worked at the restaurant he turns to me and says, ""I used to take my smoke break out back the same time every morning...do you have any idea who that crazy fucker with the red Camaro was?  I used to see him spin out all the time, I always figured one day he was going to flip the car!"""
Ridiculous and unnecessary comment by your manager.  Good for you for doing your job
"Hey man, whatever works."
"I've commented this before on other stories concerning people not using the cart corrals, but every time I walk through a store's parking lot, I mutter ""Fucking savages"" constantly."
This woman was 100% trying to get money for her next fix.
"*...But the stolen truck is mine, I stole it myself, you can't take it back* - Lady"
"""What...the fuck...just happened?""

Alternatively,

""Well.  That...that happened.  Wow.""

(Note: Not calling the story BS, just offering two different things I probably would have said were it me in OP's shoes)"
"Somebody just took my drink with my name on it too! And then came back while I was still waiting for them to remake my drink and complained.  I was like ""that was mine""  She hands it to me like I'd actually drink something the dumbass just sampled.   Your lady gets around.  "
"This happened to me yesterday! Asked the man what he ordered and he stood there asking me if it was his drink while telling me he didn't know what he ordered. 

Ended up figuring out he hadn't ordered anything."
"""Granny Bolt"" sounds like the name of the next Incredibles cast member. Perhaps a mentor for Dash."
"Perhaps she was severely color blind, and not all pinpads have the same layout. Still she should have asked for help."
"If she's really allergic -- Dunno. Short of her daughter being really sick and homebound for the day, an an allergic person would likely not go anywhere *near* the tea aisle intentionally if it could be avoided, as doing so could potentially put *them* in the hospital with a severe enough reaction.

If not -- It brought her attention, which, it seems, she craves. Any kind, any way, good or bad -- she's gotta have her fix."
"By doing that, they validated him and he'll do that again. Annoying but hey, let's hope karma catches up with him..."
"I love that 'You WILL serve me' or 'you will xxxxxx' like lmao, will I though? 

I'm really good at managing to do nothing/the bare minimum while on the clock so literally just not serving you is my lazy self's area of expertise. Try and call my bluff "
"I used to love customers like this crying and tantruming like a toddler because they are made to wait like a normal person. My favorite instance was this one guy with a full cart who barreled his way through a line of 7 people. he was about to unload when I told him ""sir there are people before you"" his reply? ""yes well its not my fault they don't have the balls to take what they want"". I was WTFing hard luckily the other customers let him keep going just to get him out of there."
"To be fair, she didn't think she was stealing it. She thought that her father had called with the other card and that everything was okay. At least until the tow truck showed up. And she did actually keep trying to fix it, except that she was swearing and screaming instead of being calm and rational."
I just hope she was stupid enough to park the rental in front of her personal truck so can't use that either
"He did tack on the difference to my paycheck, but I also got chewed out about how dangerous it was to let 6 grown men into the store when I was alone"
"Sadly it happens a lot. What was striking was this was not one but *two* drinks in this order--to her single drink; and they were *iced*--to her hot drink, and they were *tea*--to her coffee drink. She was truly dumb. "
That story went a completely different direction than I was expecting from the title.
"The hell with engraving eggs, just stick with making reddit titles. 

Seriously, who can resist clicking on **""Only flaming skulls and Mexican strippers"".**
"
You really are a polite customer. Thanks!
"It warmed my cold, dead, retail heart."
"Yeah, this is definitely a thing. I always read the screen though because, *surprise*, 9 times out of 10 the screen will tell you what to do. Still not sure? Ask the cashier. You're trying to get through the line quickly, and that's really the quickest way "
"Colorblindness doesn't work like that. Even so, why would she think the X is the ""go forward"" button? "
"She walked down the aisle to get the tea, pretty sure that if the box produced enough to make a reaction then she would have had one just walking near them. "
"I *LOVE* when people mention they are going to sue. I promptly shut down any rebuttals I may have had and simply reply, ""I'm sorry, I will no longer be able to help you with this matter. Let me get the number for our legal department and they will be able to help you further."" Shuts them up 100% of the time (granted I've only gotten to do this a half dozen times or so). 

It is my absolutely favorite response to anything and I can't get in trouble by management for saying it. "

"I once worked a 10 hour shift behind a register all day and a lady came up and made one of those classic stupid jokes. 
""I bet you love being here all day""
""Oh not really.""
""It's a joke""

""It's okay to laugh it was a joke""
""I would have laughed if I thought it was funny""

She was taking her sweet time so you'd get frustrated and take the keys to do just as she asked. Good on you for making her do it.
I mean of course it was but... why? What is the point of this lie?
Because we've built up a civilization that is so advanced even the most dimwitted can survive with ease.
Oh you're having a reaction? Here I'll call an ambulance! Oh that's not necessary? Yeah I knew you were lying.

Do people honestly not realize how incredibly stupid they sound?"
"Awww. I just had a cute encounter as well. I'm on lunch now but was putting out stock about an hour ago. Our stock room is filled from wall to freaking wall, it's never been this bad nor have we ever had this much stuff plus this is a 3 truck week! Anyways so needless to say I need to be getting as much out as humanly possible as quick as possible. I was up to my knees in windshield wiper blade hell when an older gentleman comes up asking about lights to go on a trailer for a parade. So I go through all our options and what not, he chooses some and then says, ""well let me go see what the wife thinks"". 
About 2 minutes later he comes back so I climb back down the ladder and he tells me she likes the round ones better (he had oval shaped). He puts them back, grabs the round ones and then proceeds to stand there talking about his wife for at least 30 minutes. He just kept going on about how lucky he is and they have been married 59 years, and how he knows what she says goes. It was the cutest thing to watch this man gush over his wife of half a century like they had just started dating in high school. 
Those types of customers can take up as much of my time as they want!!!

Edit: words are hard when your typing this really quick outside on break and have frozen fingers."
"&gt;I've worked retail

&gt;I think I'll be a nasty customer

No, ma'am, you have **never** worked retail.  Guaranteed."
"&gt;If not -- It brought her attention, which, it seems, she craves. Any kind, any way, good or bad -- she's gotta have her fix.

Attention and control.  "
"I ALSO have a coincidence story, although mine is just slightly odd and only mildly amusing.

In my teenage youth, back when I was making just as many bad decisions but was slightly shorter, I walked into an empty local burger joint for one of their tasty creations. After ordering, the girl says ""and your name so we can announce it when it's ready?"" I look around the tiny, empty place, chuckle, and say ""oh it's ok, I won't wander far. I'm just going to wait here."" She says back ""listen, they want us to announce all the orders this summer. I just need a name, any name is fine"". Something about the way she said ""any name"" convinced me to think of something ridiculous, so after a beat I said ""ok, my name is Captain Awesome"". 5 minutes later, with a look on her face halfway between gleeful amusement and loathing, she walked back to the counter, looked me in the eye while I sat maybe 10 feet away in a chair turned towards her, leaned into the microphone, and in an speaker-enhanced voice, announced ""captain awesome, your food is ready"" throughout the store.

A few years later, a friend said that he needed a friend for a double date, so me and him go to meet up with these two girls. The night carries on and we're all telling stories about food service and crazy customers and that story comes up. 
She says ""I had one guy come into our store who made me call him 'captain awesome.'"" I paused and looked at her though squinted eyes.

""Wait, where do you work?"" I asked.

""[Burger joint]""

""That was me!""

""I KNEW IT!""

She was a good sport about it. She said that she thought it was funny, she was just really embarrassed at the time."
Yup.  I was very shocked.
"My wife had a genetic condition to where she bruised at the lightest touch.  Every time she had to go to the hospital, the nurse would pull her aside and ask, ""Do you feel safe at home?"", looking at me. I'd joke sometimes , ""If she'd just did what I tell her I wouldn't have to beat her"" and then ask them to look again at her chart."
"Where I work we take names as well. I get the opposite problem.

""Order for Pete is ready!""

Then a man walks up, ""is this mine""

""Is your name Pete?""

""Yeah, but I'm not sure its mine""

""Did you order a medium italian?""

""Yeah, but I don't want to take anyone elses food""

""I can guarantee that's yours, have a good day""

At least once a day."
"Long time lurker, first time poster. Everyone puts those at the start for that fresh new karma. "
"Wow, your owner sounds really nice. Not only is he giving you the extra money, but he's really concerned for your safety! Even though you got chewed out it sounds like he's a pretty good owner. "
"That reminds me that I need to pick up some pecans today. LOL

But yeah, gotta love the people that blame cashiers/floor workers/etc *personally* for not having what they want or for pricing things too high. Because, you know, we have *so* much control in Corporate Land. :-\"
I hate people like this. Why do they think their time is so much more valuable than everyone else's? 
"One day I went to this one store I heard about at the Bridge Club last week. They were supposed to have just the sweetest little angel figurines, and I really wanted one for a centerpiece on the Thanksgiving table.  

&amp;nbsp; I went to the store and sure enough, there were these nice little angel statues.  They were only $8 and I was so excited to find them at a good price - BUT I remembered what Bob had done to me in '68.  That rat bastard ran around on me with my formerly-best friend, Jenny, and they got married.  I lost touch with both of them after letting the air out of his tires and slapping the grin right off Jenny's face.

&amp;nbsp; I saw Bob in this store and struck up a conversation with him.  Turns out, he was the owner of the store.  He had started this store a few years ago with Jenny as his business partner.  Well fuck both of them.  I had a couple of expired cards I keep forgetting to remove from my purse, so I hatched a plan and headed to the check stand, which was conveniently near the door.  The clerks were so nice, I almost felt bad that I was about to rob them.  I put on a sweet old-lady smile and the young man at the counter even complimented me on my sweater, which I had made in our knitting circle this past September.

&amp;nbsp; The clerk swiped my cards and of course they were declined.  I pretended to rummage around in my purse looking for some cash or something, and then I grabbed the statue and bolted for the door.  LOL the nice young man and the other young lady clerk didn't know what to do!  They stood there watching me go, and it was such a rush!  Take that $8 loss and suck on it, Bob! Hahaha!

&amp;nbsp; Anyway, Thanksgiving was a complete success and I enjoyed looking at that little figurine for the duration of the meal."

"red/green colourblindness would make the buttons the same colour, however red/green colourblindness is pretty bloody rare in females. It's generally considered a male-only thing."
"So the manager allows his behavior until he experienced it himself, and then something had to be done about it?"
