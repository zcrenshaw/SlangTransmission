"Worked for 4 years in a toystore The number of times Ive seen children understand what Im saying because they took 2 seconds to think about what Ive said, and an adult will just get angry as fuck for no reason is staggering. My favorite times are when an adult yells at their kid because they point out said adults stupidity. "
Had a child once tell his dad to stop having a temper tantrum in public because big boys don't scream in public. I've never seen a man look so embarrassed
I find this adorable. I'm glad the father found a way to make his son feel like he was gaining something by giving up the binkie rather than that something was taken from him. And this is a really great way to do it as well. Thank you for playing along and helping!
"In Texas we have to take a state mandated test for a license to sell alcohol.  OP followed the states directions, ""must be clear, firm, and consistent"" haha!! 
Not to mention it is their jobs on the line and possible huge fines!"
She seriously didn't try wiping it off before driving all the way there to complain? WTH lady...
"I cracked up at ""swim to Texas on a cantaloupe."""
"*Lady: “No, I don’t want it that way. Make it even please”.*

*dumps box over her head*

There. Now we're even."
"I actually lost my job as a hostess by doing this.  A couple was letting their kid be a hell spawn.  About 20 minutes into their meal, the kid starts sweeping silverware off the nearby tables onto the floor.  Parents didn't do a thing about it.  I gave them serious evil eye while I picked everything up.  I showed up for work the next morning and the manager asked me why I was there.  Turns out I didn't have a job anymore."
"&gt; W: No such books exist because all fantasy is fictional.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  

At the beginning of Star Wars it tells us 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...' That means it happened, 'cause it's illegal to make that disclaimer and then follow it up with a story made out of whole cloth.

Shame on your wife for spreading her 'Fantasy is Fictional' heresy.  Shame I say!  "
"That actually could have been me haha. My brother said this to me after I got out of the military ( there is a solid 15 years between us) and I was having anger issues. It led me to get help. He said ""Hey man, just take it easy. There isn't any reason to be mad."" I'll never forget him saying that."
"Aww. This story makes me happy that you both apologized. Maybe in the future he won't be so quick to condescend.
And here's to hoping all future grumblings by retail workers like us go either unspoken or unnoticed! Haha."
So sorry.  That really sucks.  Sometimes a loud sigh and evil eye will convey what you can't say
Rocks are smarter than some customers.
Some people can only be charitable with other people's money....smh
That would mean she couldn't do her favorite thing: complaining and ordering people around. She probably thought it would be a highlight of her day to stick it to those retail workers. 
The unsung hero who stepped up as the attorney. Mad props to that guy
"Fully expected some ratty parent to come in trying to exchange slimy, chewed up pacifiers. Never been so happy to be wrong!"
That's actually sweet!
"&gt;in a very loud and angry voice well maybe if you got a girlfriend it would 

When you desperately try to think of something witty to belittle the cashier but you're not smart enough to come up with anything really good so it just makes you seem stupider"
"""And *this* one has a PRICE STICKER on it! It looks just *awful*, what do you intend to do about it???"""
"...And here I am with my original NES just thinking ""huh you're popular again"" while blowing vigorously into the cartridges. 

Edit:  your-&gt;you're"
Ha. She was embarrassed because she knew you were right. 
"Angry at kid because they knew it too. I hate those types of parents.

*edit* Seems people think I was angry at the kid. The mother couldn't handle her child correcting her."
"Many retailers have ""do not confront"" policies that cater to shoplifters. When you also consider the average pay for a retail associate, you can see why many associates don't want to get involved and are more than happy to look away. "
"&gt;""You ~~suck~~ foiled my evil plan!""

Good on you, OP. I wouldn't have done it for less than $24.99, myself."
"I love how she pulled a discount ""do you know who I am?"" by talking about her husband"
Do people really think retail people are that dumb or oblivious?
"Every so often, you get a chance to make someone REALLY happy in retail, and it usually has little to do with what they are buying.  It's kind of a special moment.

Glad you got one of those moments. "
I like how he resorts to pressuring you by implying that he will commit fraud. Mastercard does not take kindly to being abused like that. 
"I read ""bikini exchange"" :P"
"I had a story similar to this. I used to work in a ticket booth that people drive up to, at an amusement park. There would be two people in a booth, windows on either side. So, after I finished my transaction with some lady I started talking with my coworker.

 All of a sudden the lady goes, ""can I talk to your manager?!"" and I say ""why? Is something wrong?"" and the lady says, ""You two were MOCKING me!"" My coworker and I both look at eachother like 'wtf??' and the lady drives off. Very odd."
"I've found the reason for this, I believe:

As kids, we listen first, then speak. 

As adults, while the other person is still speaking, we're already thinking of the next thing to say, or why they're ""wrong"", etc. 

"
"I'm so sorry... it's infuriating to hear these stories. My kids are not angels at all but I keep up with them every step while we're out. Toddlers are messy eaters, I pick up the big pieces that hit the floor and wipe the table before we go, along with a big tip and extra apologies. 

I mean, they have to learn to behave and act civilized in a restaurant, but that doesn't happen if they're allowed to treat everything like a playground."
"""Is only life. Why you heff to be mad?"""
"Very sweet story. I always loved when customers went the extra mile to say thanks like that. Looks like not only did she leave a lasting impression on you, but I bet she'll remember you and how you helped for a long time. :)"
So $25.99 it is then?
Um ... She is an idiot.
"Of course it's discounted, she probably had to dig through the trash to find it"
Sadly we don't know if it was an African or European cantaloupe.
"There used to be an old TV program (Supernanny) where they would sometimes take the dummies (binkies if you're American) and put them in bags and then tie them to trees for the dummy fairy to come and take them away so they could be given to young children who need them. It was a bit odd, but a nice concept to get then kids to stop using them without having them taken away as a punishment or what have you."
I expected something a lot saucier than this. Good story op!
"Once outside, I bet he switched to ""man, can I get a couple dollars for gas? I just ran out on my way to the vet. C'mom, dude. It's for my *dogs!*"""
"&gt; In Texas we have to take a state mandated test for a license to sell alcohol.

Which I find ironic and somehow comforting considering Texas has no legal requirement for what constitutes a valid ID and leaves how a person must prove age completely up to the sellers discretion."

"I just had a Patrick and Spongebob type feeling from this

""Patrick put your hand on the lid""

*patrick moves his hand to the bottom of jar*

""The lid""

*patrick moves his hand to the side""

""THE. LID""

"
"I just do not understand why managers do this

They tell us not since we are enforcing their rules but I guess they do not apply to them"
"I get this kind of problem all the time where I work (a chocolate shop). The creams are the heaviest item we have and I try to explain this to customers but they usually don't get it. 

They're always asking ""can I get $5 in whatever cream?"" And when I pass them 3 they get angry. Like...I'm sorry you didn't listen to me when I told you they're expensive by weight. "
"She probably went home and ranted about the two ticket booth employees who made fun of her to her face.

I worry about these people."
"&gt; I mean, who cares how you are right?

...what the actual fuck, who says this? I CARE HOW YOU ARE, OP."
She's such a towel.
"Reminds me of this scene from yesterday:

Guy walks up to my register.  
&gt;G: I'd like to return these two items and take these instead.  
&gt;Me: Sure thing. *Ring up the items*. You owe us $18.  
&gt;G: No, that can't be right. I'm returning these ones.  
&gt;M: Yes, you're returning the two of these, they cost $22. Then you're buying these two, they're more expensive, they total $40. So, you owe us $18.  
&gt;G: No, I'm *returning* these...

I eventually managed to have him pay and leave, but not before having to turn the register's monitor towards him..."
"I guess this is why I should be glad we don't have envelopes where I work. Our gift cards are just attached to a small piece of card.

Giving customers an extra choice of having an extra item is quite often too much for them to process"
Was she a bit older? This could be a woman in the early stages of dementia or something like that. Or she could have taken drugs or been drunk like trekie88 suggested. 
"If they are stealing, they are not customers!"
"America is really weird to us EU folk.

Over here, tax is included in the price. Nothing extra is added."
"&gt;My name is (John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt).

What a coincidence. His name is my name too."
"God I hope he was on drugs, because at least that provides a rational explanation for his behaviour"
"I'm not trying to pick on you, but if no one points it out, you won't ever learn (you said English is your second language). Grams is shortened to ""g"", not ""gr""."
"&gt; Same concept as the tooth fairy, which was obviously designed to make kids excited about losing their teeth instead of freaking out about it.

I've only just realised that I probably should have been freaking out when I lost my teeth as a child.

It looks like the whole Tooth Fairy thing worked pretty well on me..."
"&gt;I want a 10% off coupon for my troubles and you better clean the ones I purchase before I take them home!!! 

I'm literally shaking. "
"&gt;I'm not hiding an NES system behind some super secret wall behind the counter.

Seriously?  Your store doesn't have a super secret wall behind the counter?  I though they were mandatory!"
"My grandpa was a terrible, terrible customer. He would always get rain checks, have expired coupons, scramble for every last cent, etc. He also couldn't see or hear very well, so the retail person wouldn't be able to explain that the coupon was expired or whatever else. It got to a point where the managers would be called as soon as he went into the store, and they would always put on their retail smiles and help us as best as they could. He couldn't drive, so my dad would take him grocery shopping, and my dad would try to help too.

When he passed away, my aunt (his daughter) mentioned something about the retail people who would never know why he stopped showing up. I wondered if they ever remembered or thought about him.

He was no one's favorite customer like the one in your friend's story was, OP, but he was probably someone's least favorite. So someone probably remembers him.

Thank you for posting this story, OP. In a weird way, I feel a little better. I hope your friend and the wife can find some peace."
"""Actually, I know your job better than you.""

This is a trigger for all of us. I hate it so much. "
exactly he had a tattoo on his face which i thought nothing of but once he said that i just thought wow you are a buffoon
She was like.. early 30's!! 
"IIRC the kids would come down in the morning to find little toys and treats hanging from the tree, left by the ""dummy fairy"". Same concept as the tooth fairy, which was obviously designed to make kids excited about losing their teeth instead of freaking out about it. I think it's a good idea."
"I also believe they have these policies as to ensure the associate doesn't get into danger, as I've heard many stories of LPs getting into violent confrontations with weapons involved.

"
I've even used the story when interviewing for times when I've worked with customers and had a good experience.
"Nothing you can do in that scenario. 

One day though, inquire why the previous shift can't empty the trash. I've worked at places where the day shift's biggest responsibility was showing up to open the doors....nothing else. Night shift did all the cleaning. Got the night shfit to start complaing about this and finally the day shift would do some cleaning before leaving OR there would be days where the night would get to leave early, and the day had to clean the restrooms or whatnot. 

No harm in asking that. 100% harm in any actions against folks who can't throw away trash."
"At first i read the end as ""I'll never forgive him for saying that."""
"""Since you have threatened legal action, you must now leave the store, and any further communication is to only occur through the store's legal department."""
"&gt; CS: Are you trying to bribe me Ma'am?

I was picturing you saying this nice and loud, so that the entire lobby could hear you quite clearly."
My sister uses public employees as babysitters. She likes to go to restaurants and then ignore her kids until it's time to leave because it's not her job to clean. I don't know that my sister has time for her children
"So this reminds of a sort of similar experience I had. Full disclosure I don't work in retail though.

I work in a busy big city ER, and due to our sometimes incredibly high volumes our wait times can get a little long. All the staff try to be very apologetic about this when this happens and explain the situation to patients.

However, one night on my overnight shift where it was again busy as hell in our acute area, I finally make it over to our ambulatory area. It's busy but wait times aren't too horrible. I start seeing people with the usual sorry for the wait etc... 

Then as I'm writing up a chart for a patient I just finished seeing, I see this young woman probably mid 20s, going off on the hospital and staff, how horrible we are, how long they have been waiting, how no one cares, how sick her brother is how they should just leave and go somewhere else. So I casually say to the nurse beside me but I guess loud enough for the lady to hear , that if they feel that way they are free to leave. 

This apparently set off a second explosion from this lady, how it's her right to be in the hospital, that the government pays for this place and she's a Canadian and lot of other stuff. Fine whatever I just ignore her as the nurses try to deal with her, but as they try to go to speak to her, she lets go of this one aimed at me, ""you just work here, you're just an employee, you can't speak to me like that"" 

I don't know what happened, maybe it was the multiple shifts in a row of extreme volume but I snapped. I started to walk up to her and said ""Mam I'm The Doctor here. I have no problem seeing and treating your brother but if you continue to behave in this manner I will call security and I well get you forcibly removed if necessary . "" (this is very harsh for my standard, I'm more of a kill'em with kindness type of person) 

She booked it to her brothers room and a few minutes later her brother, the patient came to apologize. 

It just so happened that my colleague ended up seeing the patient, but I wonder what she would have been like of I went into that room.

So I guess we should all try to keep our inner monolog inner.. 

  "
"Anything is possible at this point. I am in Alabama, after all. "
Only $24.99? Pfft. I won't accept a bribe less than two months pay. 
"Yeah she was looking for the mythology books, she just didn't know what it was called. ""But they are based upon reality. Where are the books about that?""

Lord of the Rings was based on nordic mythology. I bet I'd be sexy in librarian glasses. with pulled up hair."
"No. The data that was there allowed them to keep track of when she was ovulating. If they had lost the data, they would have had to start all over again and, believe me, while the ""work"" is fun, it's keeping track of the data and everything that's a pain in the ass to the point where my wife and I were ready to give up trying for both of our kids initially.

You have to understand that women ovulate for about a week and trying to hit ""the sweet spot"" is kind of like trying to bullseye womprats in a T-16 if you're not Luke Skywalker."
"*Lucy: You'd get more business if you had more lights.*

You'd be less obsessed with that if you were brighter."
"I'm from Merry Ol' England. The punishment for selling to a minor, even by proxy, is £5000 and two years in jail!"
"$30 for a coat is still cheap. I've seen varsity jackets that are over $100. It's trendy right now. So she was getting a good deal but if it's not dirt cheap, they don't care. "
