"The fact that you *lost the way you make money so you can live* because you stood up for yourself when someone was extremely rude to you over *10 cents* makes me so unbelievably angry. And yet, there's the older men and women who would say you should've lost your job because those people completely lack empathy.

Employees should be allowed to defend themselves. We should not be harassed. We are worth more than that.

Anyone who thinks otherwise should just remove themselves from the planet."
You really don't realize how stupid people are until you work at retail... 
I'd hate to get fired over something so petty. I want to earn it dammit!
2 grand for that window replacement? Wowzers. Commercial glass must be stupid expensive. I would rather just have a spider painted on in the middle and keep it that way.
A neutron star is considered the densest object in the universe. Clearly scientists have not studied this woman.
"My guess is that the cost is based on the fact that

1. The window is large.

2. It will require more than one repairman (because, you know, large).

3. It's obviously safety glass, or it would have shattered.

4. This will most likely need to be expedited- faster = $$."
Your co-worker is an ass. Once you said you weren't trained he should have done it.
"This reminds me of a guy I encountered when I worked at a bookstore many years ago. The space was being remodeled to make more room and we gave out these 20% off coupons for the ""grand re-opening"" the following week. It said something like ""Pardon our dust!"" 

I was to hand one of these coupons, which would not be entered into the system for use for several days, to each customer. I usually tucked it into one of their books and said something like, ""You can use this starting Thursday for twenty percent off any purchase. Have a good day!"" Or similar.

One time, this 50-year-old man in a suit, who was buying a $1 clearance John Grisham paperback, handed it right back to me, telling me to apply it to his purchase. We went back and forth for a while, me saying I couldn't scan the coupon as it wasn't active yet, him saying he didn't want to come back so just give him twenty cents, me saying ""but don't you want to save 20% off a future purchase instead of a dollar book?"" and him arguing that I must know how to press a button to give him the savings, and so on. 

Eventually, he crumpled up the coupon, threw it in my face, and called me a bitch. "
Sounds like watching other people lick  stamps is the thing that makes him hard 
Good freaking grief.  I would have refused to proceed with checking them out until she moved.  That's something that Loss Prevention would lay an egg over.
"Ha! Had that happen plenty. I don't mind, I ask which vehicle is theirs and I tell them to have a great day. Especially if it's animal related! A cat's health matters more to me than a parking spot "
"That happened to my sister at a movie theatre. She left her phone there and we went back immediately and it was gone. We hadn't  even left the building and only the cleaning crew had been in the theatre. We asked the manager if anyone had found it and he asked the employees in front of us and they all said no. I called it from my phone and one of the kids pockets started ringing. She got her phone back, and I'm guessing that kid got fired. "

Would be terrible if the police found out someone was driving without a license. 
"If you got time to count, nice one"
"So even if she had something with a 30 gallon tank, and it was empty, it would have been...? What? A buck less?"
"To be fair, you are probably responsible for the quality of the products your employer sells./s"
"I want to hug your manager! That guy got exactly what he deserved, and honestly your new layout sounds more efficient and better for helping customers. If he threw such a tantrum over this, I'm scared to think what he was like on a regular basis, and GOOD RIDDANCE!"
How hard is it really to lick your own stamps?
Over $0.20... What is wrong with people?
"Nah, she never pumped it. She came in to prepay so when she left the store I had voided the transaction, taking the money off the pump before she could pump it into her car. 

This is in the U.S, all gas around my area is strictly pay before you pump or pay at the pump."
"""these people outside the shop clearly work here and have nothing better to do than to stand outside work after it closes in the desperate hope that they can just serve one last customer"""
"Can't help but wonder what you would have done if she popped in and said ""Hi, my cat is in some serious trouble, and is over at the vets right now. Could I please park in your spot for longer than 15 minutes?"""
"The manager will also feel betrayed.
He thought your sister silenced the phone before the movie."
"Yep. The gift card brings the absolute worst customers, I've dealt with worse over these dumb things. People lose their  minds if they think you're trying to rip them off, even over 3 cents. "
Like... serious question... why are customers this fucking dense? 
"As a supervisor, the second the customer drops the curse word, my employee can do whatever the fuck he wants basically."
"I couldn't agree more with you. It really is sad that people will so callously say that they don't care if someone loses their job because they complained about them, they hope they get fired. In what universe is that ever okay? That's a disgusting mindset to have. 

A few months ago, probably around March or so, I was the supervisor for the night, and it was extremely busy. My cashier was checking a couple out, and there was a long line behind them. Something went wrong with the couples transaction and my cashier had to wait for someone to come and sort out the pricing from that department. I rerouted the line to the other register on her other side. 

The next woman in line immediately started telling me that she would fire my cashier if she were a manager, and how awful and rude she had been to her. I had been standing there the entire time... yet somehow the woman hadn't realized that. I told her this, and also told her that my cashier had done nothing wrong, and that if she felt she should be fired for taking care of the current customers in front of her, then she would have to leave because that's not how we do things at our store. She left. 

I don't understand how malicious some people can be. I'm disgusted with these types of people. Truly appalling behavior."
"So, did she even pay? Since she got the refund, does that mean she got a free tank of gas?"
Fuck your gf's security for letting him go.  Hold him until the cops come for theft.
"I work in a medical facility. We had a woman who was kicked out of the pain management program for having 3 dirty UA's  (tested positive for meth and heroine). It is made VERY clear to the patients at intake that there is a 3 strikes and you're out rule for the program.  
She proceeded to go out to her F150, floored it and drove through the front of the building INTO the waiting room.  She lined it up perfectly so she drove right through the two sets of sliding glass doors.  Her truck went through the doors and all the way through the lobby until she hit a wall.  It was late in the day so it was not very busy.  We were VERY lucky no one was hurt. The cop on duty was cut by flying glass and that was the only injury. 

She did 20,000 worth of damage.  The doors alone were 6,000 plus all the structural damage.  She took out a desk  (that someone had been sitting at less than hour before).  
I'm sure the facilities insurance covered the damages.  I doubt she was billed for it. I'd love to think she got a bill from us for $20,000.
She's in prison now for that little stunt. "
"&gt; before giving in and knocking $50 off.

*long sigh* goddam it"
"Why didn't they pop in or, heck, stick a note ON the car if they really just absolutely HAD to park there? Gah.


My Uncle has a vet clinic that shares a carpark with a hairdresser, cattery, and a small grocers. So many people for the grocers park in the emergency animal care parking spaces - which makes no sense, since those parks are essentially the farthest away from the store as you can get, in a very large and rarely full park. Like, whut?"
"Yep. Despite all her complaints she spent a thousand flipping dollars. 

Made no sense but hey, to each their own I suppose "
"I'm gonna be honest, it would make sense for OP to be written up over the incident, but no single incident with a single customer should be enough for termination."
"Honestly, they sound like thieves to me (serious). "
"This reminds of the idiot who tried to return a sandwich because he was full. 
"
"""I'm also allergic to purple! Keep that away from me!"""
Awwww come on let the poor guy in. He only needs cat food (and cat litter and light bulbs and a 12 pack of Bud Light and some cigarettes and a new speaker system and a flat screen TV and a new spatula set and a racquet because racquetball is tomorrow morning and some denture glue)
"I work at a movie theater and I have to deal with this type of behavior way more than I feel I should. Guests (G) will come up and ask:

G: “Could I get two tickets for (movie) for 7:30?”

Me: “Uh, it only looks like we have a show for 6:00 and 10:30 tonight.”

G: “But it says right here (points to phone) that you have a 7:30 showing.”

Me: “I’m sorry, but the only showings coming up on my schedule are 6:00 and 10:30 for tonight.”

They will eventually ask for a manager or I will try to explain to them that they’re probably looking at the wrong date for the movie or the wrong theater. Either way they refuse to believe my schedule is correct when I explain myself."
"When your job requires counting money you get damn quick at doing it.

Plus when you think about it dimes are really easy to count."
"Agreed. Flipping off a customer and getting into fist fights are a way more satisfying way to make an exit.

/S of course, but seriously. I'm gonna defend myself, I might get fired, but the fact my manager was spineless enough to not stand up for me or even hear my side was proof enough the job wasn't worth my time. Trust me, I've had enough of that in my previous job experiences."
The issue was he was not on site.  It was a one person operation I forgot to mention that detail which is now fixed
"...and another manager who enables the customer to constantly get their way when they are wrong.

Thy cycle continues."
And that's why people act that way. Because idiot managers let them get their way.
"True. Thieves fall in two categories. The sneaky ones who try to stay under the radar, and the brazen ones who make a scene and rely upon a flustered employee backing down to avoid a scene."
"I work at a movie theater and caught a coworker stealing a phone.

A couple teenage girls had come up to me, one of them had lost their brand new Iphone. I call in over the walkie to ask if anyone had found anything (generally if you find a phone it goes to the managers office till the owner shows up). No one has the phone.

I go scouring the arcade area for it, the girls are audibly discussing the phone, and half an hour later a lady overhears them and says, ""I found your phone half an hour ago, I gave it to an employee!"" I ask what sector the employee was in and it was fast food, I ask for a description and I know who it is. I call in and the managers still dont have a phone - its been half an hour and the guy is evidently trying to keep it.

They found it in his locker in airplane mode, gave it to the girl and he had already tried changing her passwords and stuff. He got fired, he was scummy in other ways too."
"if... 

If you're spending *that* much and you have a coupon for online... 

Wouldn't you

Ah who am I kidding who can use logical reasoning in 2017 anymore "
"&gt; I explained it three times

And that's when you say, ""I'm sorry Ma'am but I just can't dumb this down any further.  Perhaps you have an intelligent husband, child or family member that could explain it to you?"""
Oh I've had someone go off on me for $0.05!
"&gt; I find out my manager had given the lady the money off, **and left the voucher with her to use again**

Wait, WHAT?!? I can understand doing one or the other, but *both*??? You definitely made the right decision in leaving that nuthouse."
"It doesn't matter if she was trying to steal or not. If she ""behaved"" like a criminal, she'd be treated like a criminal. 

You did good. "
"I've worked in restaurants and shops for a while, and there's a thing I like to say: ""People are all right. Actually, most people are just fine. But when people walk through that door, they're not people anymore. They're customers, and customers are desolate bastards."""
So... did you get the number?
"This is a hard and fast rule for my team. Cuss words from a customer = conversation stops, transaction is over, leave immediately. "
"Newspaper headline the next day:
&gt;""Senile WWII Vet Attacks Computer In Parking Lot While Horified Bystanders Are Left Confused"""
The security guard asked her if she wanted to call the cops but she said no. I also think she should have let him call the cops 
"Sadly, no. I guess I was just too forward"
Why was your manager even entertaining this? What does you shaking your head at a random person on the road have to do with your job?
"&gt; she told them the company won't accept complaints from customers with such disgraceful behaviour

Take note, retail managers and corporate overlords.  This is the Right Way."
So did she end up taking everything?
"You're such a horrible employee, you're gonna get fired from a job you don't even work at lol"
That would be a daaaaarrrnnnn shame
"Fuck that guy, the fact he came back makes me think he did this on purpose and enjoyed knowing that he was costing other people large amounts of money."
As well as the price.
"At least she didn't become irate, yell at you, and call corporate to try and get you fired for being a presumptuous harlot."
"Hug?  I want to canonize him!  Where do these wonderful creatures come from? And where can I find one?

BTW, ""canonize"" is to make a Saint, not shoot with a large artillery piece."
"I am starting to conclude that everyone needs to continue to be treated like children.  We all need someone to clean up after us, to scold us for our behaviour and to hold our hands while crossing the streets.  Actually, I don't know why I still associate these self centred behaviours with children, to be honest, because I darn well know that many adults have never learned how to stop acting that way in the first place."
Now that's a stellar joke.
Paging /r/frugal
"""I am a grown adult!! Now, allow me to throw a tantrum like a child!!"""
"Had a gentleman complain that I wouldn't (couldn't) sell him cigarettes without a valid ID. We have to ask every person every single time they come in to purchase any but, for whatever reason, he went on a tangent on how it's the White man's fault all these laws are in place (I wish I was joking; also, we're both Black). Had to shut him down pretty quickly after that. He then proceeds to hop in his car after explicitly stating he didn't have his license on him."
"Once, I went to the Apple Store to get something in the morning. It didn't open until ten, I think it was like nine, and I saw employees milling around inside, getting stuff ready. So I left and came back later when they were open. It didn't ruin my day. The world did not explode because I didn't have whatever I needed at that particular moment. I don't get why that is so hard for people to understand."
Cheers Babe.
My mom saw a customer try ramming there shopping cart into the locked doors at closing at our store. It's hilarious 
"&gt;Us: ""the shops closed, and it has been for an hour""

I just picture the whole conglomerate saying that in a monotone voice at once"
I don't understand people like that.  You get mad so you break something?  That shows a great deal of emotional immaturity. 
"heh I had someone really pissed off at me (well, on my voicemail anyway) because she came after 3pm on Saturday and I was closed. Yeah, I close at 3pm on Saturday. Apparently (as I've commented a few times) some rando website I had never heard of said I was open until 5pm on Saturday. I still don't know what site that was. All of the ones I do know of and have access to maintain have the correct info."
"There was a girl in my baking class in high school that was ""allergic to red."" I assumed she meant the red dyes in food. Nope- if it was the color red she was allergic to it. She mentioned it _every single day_, and always ended up in an argument with the teacher. She constantly ate red foods outside of class. One she time got caught eating a piece of red candy in that class. She was fine until someone pointed it out, and then she had to rush to the nurse because she was extremely allergic!!"
I'm Arizona a good spot is based on shade. Not walking distance.
