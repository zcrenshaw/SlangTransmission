"Well I'm sure that will be a sane and sensible discussion about pertinent issues, with no name calling, mud slinging or deleting of comments, and I'm sure all the difficult and testing questions will be treated with the utmost respect and answered fully. 

Oh wait, no. Not that. "
"My guide dog reads it off the screen, and barks it out to me in Morse code.

In actuality, I use a screen reader program and voice dictation program to read it aloud to me."
I can almost hear the mods over there polishing up their ban hammers. 
Oh god this is gonna be a shit show.
"I can't tell you how many times I've said stuff like that.  I adore morbid, self deprecating humor"
"Good lord, let the poor girl leave you already before you make things worse for her. If you want to be a female then go ahead and get it done with already, don't force another person to go on with you like this before leaving her years from now. "
"Have you ever used: ""Wow, I didn't see that coming!"" as a morbid joke?

"
Can we build a firewall and make /r/mexico pay for it?
"As someone who has been abused by an elder(not my father though), I can certainly empathise with her. At that age I really did not know any better and had really thought that man had loved me. Its wrong and it was the main reason I never said anything to anyone around me about it. Because eventhough I knew it was wrong as I grew older I was afraid of expressing that to anyone in fear of them knowing it was sort of consensual. I did not know any better. My thoughts are with your daughter. "
"Good relationship with your mom?


Sorry, wrong person."
"Can blankets are the only intellect allowed for space divots, and accordion; doesn't package having gnarly botanicals?"
"Fine I guess?  Never had much desire to listen to porn.  Some of my friends play pranks on me by getting me to listen to stuff like that, only to tell me it's something like a hardcore gay orgy.  They're assholes sometimes, but it's all in good fun : )"
Hell yeah
Life finds a way...
"I don't know if it's fair to weed someone out for not being on LinkedIn. Some people hear about the unsolicited email on LinkedIn or undesired friend requests on Facebook, and decide it's not worth the hassle. They might be intimated from appearing to look like they are looking for a job. A job seeker might be afraid to accidentally disclose proprietary or otherwise sensitive information."
Anything that doesn't fit their narrative will be removed and banned.
"This is not a question. I just want to say that I think you and your daughter are both incredibly brave. Also, it is important to tell yourself ""this was not my fault"". It is one thing to know it logically, and I am sure you do. However, I think is still important to keep telling yourself. ""This was not my fault."" "
AMA. Ask me ANYTHING.
"Conceptually, I can sorta get it.  Practically, I don't understand how the human body can do that.  I don't understand how colors are possible, how depth perception is possible, how any of the fancy things you guys can do with your eyes is possible.  "
"I'm the usually the guy making the jokes. I've got a handful of them up my sleeves.

This used to be my Facebook profile picture: [from Family Guy](http://i.cdn.turner.com/asfix/repository//8a25c3920eaf5fa6010eaffb99c438bf/thumbnail_6002.jpg)"
"Fellow Turk here. No questions, just wanted to say fuck Erdogan and his bullshit and I hope you stay safe brother. I have a lot of friends still living in Turkey and I'm very concerned for the future of our country. "
"The ocean, my family's faces, pictures of relatives who've passed away, someone smiling 
"
"I had been divorced from him for 12 years. He started abusing her when she was 8 and stopped when she was 14, and she is now 16. Looking back, there honestly were no signs I could have picked up on. She really went out of her way to hide it from me and everyone else, because at the time she believed they were in love with each other. There are a few things that make a bit more sense in retrospect, but nothing that would have been any sort of real clue. 

As much as I wish no one would have to know, her dad will be facing a long time in prison, and it's going to be in the local news, so..."
I wipe very thoroughly.  VERY thoroughly
"Weirdly, not as much as I would have expected to. Part of me hates him. Part of me feels sorry for him. "
The point is he hasn't explained how...
are you gonna go eat bacon?
Sure. I can feel my hands and everything. I can make a fist and do hand gestures but to anyone watching it just looks like my shoulders are flexing. 
I'm guessing they're a little too busy to be on Reddit right now. 
Or it'll be full of douchebags who are trolling trying to keep other people from asking honest questions. 
THANKS OBAMA.
"She is mostly ok. She sees a therapist regularly, takes psychiatric medication, and has PTSD from the abuse. But all things considered she is handling things well. She is mostly worried about people treating her differently once it all comes out. Right now nobody knows except a few people in my family. "
"""I've got a handful of them up my sleeves"" this fucking guy."
"I was just banned for breaking their sixth rule: No dissenters. I literally asked if I would be downvoted to hell for asking a serious question during the AMA. And the response I got was first, a comment saying I would be banned, followed by a banning from the sub. My question was why Trump thinks an expensive wall will be effective, considering it's evident that a physical wall wouldn't do much at all. That was the comment that got me banned.

So my question HERE is, can they really call this an AMA if they blanket ban everyone who isn't a long time subscriber and wants to ask serious questions that he seems to be avoiding answering? Why does the potential next President of the United States get to reach out to the masses on one of the most popular websites in the country, only to get his dick sucked by his legion of followers in what is the very definition of a circle jerk? I'm not too Reddit savvy but I don't know, can we maybe ban this AMA for breaking AMA rules or something? Maybe my anti-Trump bias is doing the talking here but I feel like this is bullshit and like the exact opposite sentiment that this country was founded on."
"Eh, this well be predictable. Besides trying to woo sanders supporters, He'll (by he, I mean a campaign worker who knows reddit) just answer questions by saying ""Hillary should go to jail"" ""I'm going to fix the tsa"" ""I'm going to put Comcast in place"" ""I'm going to stop all the crime that Obama has caused"" and say absolutely nothing about actual policies. "
"The Obama AMA was pretty much the same. Maybe less on deleting comments, but ignoring/evading hard questions and giving PR responses is pretty much the norm."
"Currently I am. She doesn't know anything yet. It remains to be seen if she knew anything about the abuse while it was happening. I have been ""friends"" with her for this entire time. We are friends on Facebook, and she and my ex and I have all done things together as a family prior to my knowing about the abuse. We didn't always have the smoothest coparenting relationship, but it was better than most. 

The indictment hearing was ex parte, meaning it was done without his knowledge. There is now a federal warrant for his arrest, and he will be arrested tomorrow morning. It was kept quiet on purpose because they will be searching all of his computers and electronic devices for evidence, and obviously they don't want him to take off or destroy evidence before they can get to it. 

His wife will be taken in for questioning at that time as well. If she admits to knowing anything about the abuse she will also be charged.  "
"Maybe this is a dumb question, but if one day there was a surgery or technology to give you sight, would you want to do it? "
oh my you just made me lol hard 
Damn thought I was done trippin guess not lol
"It's not the healthiest, but I'm not gonna pass up a nice crispy piece of bacon here and there"
"Its this smug ""im better than them"" attitude that gave Trump all these supporters in the first place. Pull your head out of your arse and realise that you have the exact same political power as every single person on /r/the_donald . None more, and none less."
What an evil fuck you are.
You think that's bad you haven't seen the depths of Reddit only sulfuric acid can remove from your retinas.
Do you hate him? 
"She's already prepared for it, you don't have to cushion the blow any more. You're just stalling because it's going to be hard.

If you two are going to have to break up, then do you know what makes that easier? Time. Time AFTER the breakup. Give her that gift so that she can start getting over you."
"Yep, that's pretty much what happened with her. Her father is a very manipulative person, and he used that to his advantage with her. "
"he won't see it, that's for sure ;) "
"Well, of course I haven't ""seen"" it.  But I have listened to parts of it.  Pretty cool show"
"He has articulated results, but not methods. Religion isn't listed on passports. Mexico isn't going to pay for the wall. Our treaties do not provide for protection money. Unauthorized immigration is down, crime is down. Congress has not and will not appropriate money for him to launch a second Operation Wetback.

He would bring back harsh interrogation methods in clear contradiction of federal and international law. He would alienate Muslims more generally. He would not make us safer. Coalition forces are already bombing ISIS. The problem is they often bomb more than just the terrorists, their arms and their money. 

He is a hateful man who not only demonstrates no understanding of the issues. He doesn't care that he doesn't know, or doesn't care that what he claims isn't true. He trusts his erratic impulses and seeks to exploit voters' basest instincts. "
"Something somerhing broken arms...
"
"What went through mind when the doctor said "" son your losing your nut""?"
"Thanks, I do my best!"
My daughter disclosed the abuse to me about a month and a half ago. We have been working with the police since then. 
"Ok this is so rude, but how can you see what we are typing, sorry for being ignorant, just my natural reaction."
