You killed your mother and sister on purpose didn't you ?
"73, but with my lifestyle, I'll be lucky to hit 50."
How many babies are you aiming to rape within the next year?
"Yeah, it was for their own good."
Strike them in the head until they let go or lose consciousness.
"Do you plan to molest any more children? If so,  will you give us any hints about your next victim?"
Where does your favorite ex-governor come from?
"I'm undecided right now. If I did, I would want one boy and one girl."
If someone hugs you at the end of a date what would you do?
"When you take girls across the state line for sex, how young do you like them to be? "
Alaska.
"Of all your relatives, if you had to choose one to die suddenly and violently, which one would you choose?"
Hard to say. I try not to play favorites.
4 years old.
"I watch every single Boston Red Sox game, I color in coloring books, I do word search books, and I enjoy to watch the show How I met Your Mother. Basically I'm just relaxing 24/7."

I'm not sure. I was very young when she died.
"Oh no. I am out of the love game, I have my children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren to give me all the love that I need. My current celebrity crush is Alex Trebek."
"(My grandmother doesn't really like to answer questions about mortality, she doesn't like to think about it because she doesn't want to leave her family.)"
"Here, I proofread your whole fucking website for you.

Because your username is niggerslave. Not sure what the mystery here is.
I meant height.

= yes"
What lube should I use if I have dry itchy balls?
This is chilling
"I thought about that, and asked someone who is, they said because I'm just attracted to women and transwomen so I am not pansexual, tbh I don't really care, all I know is I love her and that's what matters"
What do you wear while jacking off?

"This requires a bit of a story. We were introduced by a friend who knew I like transwomen, and that she was trans, however she didn't tell me she was trans, there is large amounts of transphobia where we live so she is very cautious, so she told me that she doesn't want sex for the first 3 months of a relationship, but because she was an amazing person I was ok with that, I have hands afterall, and tbh her being trans was a bit of a relief as I assumed it would be something along the lines of sexual assault. But anyway, she sat down with me in her flat one day and told me, as she said she felt safe with me, were now in a 4+ year relationship so it worked out 

I don't really identfy as anything, more because their is no name for my sexuality, but the closest label there is would be bi I guess"

Head and shoulders shampoo.
Planning on proposing (she doesn't use reddit so I know I'm safe saying it)
you guys need new usernames...
"You can also drink your own piss. There's just no reason to do that or to name yourself niggerslave, and if you do either one everybody will think you're an ignorant dumbass."
"Good way to receive a free ""extended stay"""
"Proof

Starts AMA, answers two questions and goes to take some rest... you for sure are the son of principal."
I wouldn't know how to respond in that situation.
"Would you rather pay to have sex with 100 duck sized prostitutes, or one horse sized prostitute?  "
"I have lived a wonderful life with a loving family throughout it all. In all honesty, I wouldn't choose to change a thing. My husband died in the early 1970s and in the 1990s I moved in with a former high school boyfriend who also has passed, I regret not marrying him but I did not want to have a different name than my children."
"I feel that when you are younger, love is much more intimate and close. When you're older, a relationship is based on the actual relationship. It's about being able to talk with one another, having similar friends to spend time with or converse with about. The ability to talk with one another about past experiences and past trips. It is much more about the communicative relationship than being intimate."
What would you do if you were caught doing buttstuff in the plumbing aisle at Walmart?
What will be your reaction when you get your first hard-on?
"It's more salty actually.

Sorry saw the opportunity. Thank you, it means alot knowing more people would be willing to accept her/us than reject us, on reddit atleast"
Hopefully soon.
Neither. Just take back the toilet plunger and run.
That's all that should matter.  Congrats.  
"Yes I have issues, as we all do, but that has nothing to do with my choice to write to people in prison, nothing at all. My profession enables me to work with people from lots of different backgrounds, and whom have been through many different experiences, good and bad. So whilst I appreciate your suggestion, I don't agree with your comments, nor do I believe the life is as black and white as your seem to think."
Is the principal hot at your school?
"At least you're calling it as it is and not making it a racist issue. Ignorant yes, but I'm black anyways so I could care less. It's like a white guys username being crackerwhip1. It's just a word until someone makes a big deal about it. "
What is the coolest thing someone has given you for starring in a tranny porn video
Fucking brilliant.
When will you finally come out of the closet?
"I know it sounds a bit pathetic but porn more or less, its sort of the only way people are going to be able to find out they like trans women. I saw a picture of the pornstar Bailey Jay (just her face) and I was curious who she was so I went onto her website (I didn't know she was a pornstar at that point) and I saw her naked, and I was really attracted to her, even though she had a penis, and I just thought 'Well, that's new'. And yes I was very confused, but I accepted I like transwomen. Hoped this answered your question, and doesn't make you think I'm a weird (I am but you know what I mean)"
