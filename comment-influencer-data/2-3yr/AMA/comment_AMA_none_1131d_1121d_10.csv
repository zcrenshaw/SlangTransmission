"Female, and I was gonna keep it to myself, but where's the fun in that, so yeah. 
So the weirdest I agreed to, was probably being chained to a cross and spanked. I underestimated what my toes barely touching the ground would do to my blood pressure and almost fainted, but was too self-conscious to speak up. Dumb, I know.

Weirdest I said no to - I rejected anyone who didn't seem like a halfway decent lay or seemed in any way too submissive or meek, so when an older man asked if he could wear my pantyhose while I'd be abusing his nipples and curse him out, I said I had a 2 hour appointment due in a minute.

Although, borderline fucked up was when a boy, around 10, walked past my window and I smiled at him - didn't expect him to notice -  just because he was a cute kid. He did notice, and he actually did the goddamn ""How much?"" hand sign! I signal 10, and he gives a huge smile and shuffles to the door. I open and say, ""I meant: 10 more years, kid. Come back in 10 more years."" Oh, the disappointment on his little face!"
"I could give a short list that's still longer than the average person's lifespan, but here's some:

1. Sex workers are always either too dumb for other jobs, forced, or addicts. Not quite, but those are simply the dramatic fates that get publicized about a heavily stigmatized world, so they get more weight. It's like always showcasing the man eaters among pit bulls to make the whole breed look bad while most are good dogs. Sex work is convenient for those who have no problem commercializing that part of their body like a secretary commercializes their hands for typing. If done right, sex work earns you a lot of money in a short time, and if done right, you can pick your customers, set and enforce your own rules, and stay safe and healthy. Some sex workers are actually crazy about getting laid as much as possible, so that job is ideal. Some students do it, as being able to spend one day a week to earn what others make in a month, is damned convenient!
Lots of the women I met there, just wanted to get rich fast (and they did!), get out of debt/mortgage, put their kid through college, patch up a financial gap left by a deadbeat ex/""baby daddy"", or fulfill the dream of a better life, as in, buy a house instead of rent a flat. Most women I met, were there of their own free will; one had an abusive pimp and refused help, but hers was a rare case. Most ladies were genuinely cheerful and sorted out. As for wits, I'd say totally average, I met degree holders and I met airheads and everything in between.

2. Johns are always losers who can't get a ""volunteering"" partner. No. And define loser - anxiety and shyness are real and valid reasons to seek a woman who will be discrete, act like she has no opinion, and promise no strings. Also, many seek out sex workers for special fetishes, or just because they want to get laid without having to call back, make false promises, etc. Which is also fine. I met many sophisticated, nice, smart, fun, and ridiculously handsome men there. Many don't ""need"" sex workers, it's just a hobby or a guaranteed zero-commitment screw. There was a Frenchman who went through Belgium's brothel like a trophy hunter, taking selfies with those ladies who agreed, like others take selfies with statues :D

3. Brothels are filthy. Well - depends on staff. Everyone, the sex workers, the receptionists, etc. are expected to pull their weight and clean up after themselves. This usually falls largely on the receptionist where I used to work, as the ladies are too busy serving customers as there tends to be massive traffic.

4. Drugs. It's not always a thing for brothels to be drug lairs. The places I worked, were under prolice scrutiny and we prided ourselves in being helpful providing proof that the house was clean and so were our ladies.

5. Brothels are illegal - not always. Antwerp's Villa Tinto was actually a city project to get illegal/forced prostitution off the streets by offering a safe and affordable way for women who chose that job. Some do however pose as bars to stay out of trouble for sure - I mean, there are beverages, there is a counter, there are bar stools, and those women in lingerie are obviously waitresses, what did you think, you filthyhead????

6. STDs run rampant. Uh, no. If the brothels are actually supervised, especially when a lady has to work around dozens of colleagues/rivals, she can NOT afford to earn a reputation of allowing bareback. The reason is money. Johns tend to be foolish and think it's true when she says she's making an exception for him. If she does for him, she probably does for others, so she instantly becomes a best-seller, which also means, she may get the shit beat out of her by colleagues who attract fewer customers because they insist on the ever so mood-killing use of a condom. So most did insist and those who didn't, didn't last long. Either got kicked out by owners, or bullied out by colleagues.
For the sake of fair competition, where I worked, you were neither allowed to ditch the rubber, nor were you allowed to go beneath the common price range of 30 Euros for not a second over 10 minutes, 40 for 15, 150 for 30, and 250 for 60, as well as extra fees for certain acts like anal or being eaten out. Going cheap or bareback is unfair competition and not allowed.

7. Fat or older women don't sell. Also false. They may not be quite as popular as the classic, skinny beauties, but it has to be a very bad day for them, too, if they don't do at least 10."
"No, but it was likely as I went to high school just around the corner :D So I was always kinda very alert for teachers walking by. To jump out and say ""Look where your teachings got me!"", mind you. Art school, y'all."
"There were a few :) One john had a crush on a lady, but he knew he couldn't have her. She was a married mother and just trying to gather some cash for her education. He respected that and simply brought her chocolates at every visit to show his love without imposing or whining (we had some actual bawlers). But being a gentlemen, he always brought 4 boxes - one for all 3 working girls and 1 for the receptionist, so no one felt left out.


We also had one receptionist, an unkempt older man, who would always order/buy/(where the FUCK do you get that??) a big serving of a pile of small fried whole fish and enthusiastically offer them to the girls. He didn't quite understand that fish breath from any orifice was not a good idea for a prostitute. But it was adorable. He was gross, but adorable. He never perved on the ladies, never made inappropriate comments, just joked with us, gossipped with us, and offered us his fried sardines or whatever they were."
"I have the same basic set of friends no matter who I am. I'm more or less aware of the ""switches"" that happen, but I am less aware of what is said and done while I'm stuck inside my mind prison. It's like I am personally sleeping and wake up sometimes days later in a daze. As far as I am concerned, I only have two distinct personalities. We both want and live completely different lives for the most part. Maintain the same job, as it's hard to switch that on a whim. For instance, she is interested in one man, while I am interested in another. "
Even you won't know you work for them!
I used to work for a call enter that had a psychic branch and a porn branch. The same people worked in both. 
"Ah, now you're putting me in a spot where I might antagonize people. WHOOHOO! 

So, big fat DISCLAIMER: the following are my experiences ONLY and whatever I say about any ethnic or religious group, is to be read as ""not all, but many in my personal experience"". And my descriptions intend no disrespect, my observations speak for nothing and nobody other than myself.

Ahem. Well, let's get the worst out of the way: yes, in my experience, the darker the man, the bigger his tool, and the bigger the tool, the less he cares about technique. These clichés have actually confirmed themselves, although I've seen some humongous white guys with great technique.

Now, black men, other from being tremendously hung, rarely had anything particular in mind, often didn't even want a BJ, just got on, in, and off, but very energeticaly like it was a sports competition. Little talking, though much complimenting and also other than wild sex, very gentle, friendly, and almost always super cheerful. Whenever I saw a black man, I made eye contact, because they were my favourite for all the above reasons.

They were closely followed by Middle Eastern men, who tended to be more passionate and borderline romantic, sometimes even a bit morose, and by far the hardest to get to leave. They were also the biggest kissers. The Middle Eastern guys were mostly Muslims, and the place was in a Muslim neighbourhood, and it was hilarious to see them walking down the street with bumps in the middle of their foreheads - seeing hookers is of course a sinful act, so they prayed extra-hard and often hit their heads on the floor doing so. Seriously, Muslim men with forehead bumps were a thing there. Unfortunately, another stereotype often proved true, which is a notable degree of perceived entitlement to a woman's body and attention, beyond what you paid for. White guys showed nearly none of that, and black guys usually only very carefully, as in, try, but take no for an answer. Basically, with ME guys, everything was subject to discussion and this was a major downside.


White guys were older on average than brown and black guys, and talked more. Often way. Too. Much. They also came with the fetishes and requests, while men of colour were usually just into the basic sex and kissing. But white guys also paid best most of the time and haggled less. Haggling is a Middle Eastern custom, so much of the time an ME guy paid for, went into discussing how much that should be and what for. It's a lot more rude when it's about my body than if it'd be about a bag of oatmeal. I admit they look similar, but come on, the lighting ain't that dim.


Stamina-wise, it was mostly an age thing, the younger the faster. One guy came on the floor while undressing me. That was 15 minutes paid, out in 2, no refunds, next.

Men of colour were also more assertive and forward most of the time while white guys tended to ask more if such and such was okay or whatever. The forwardness sometimes crossed the line, but overall I preferred a guy who did more and talked less. White guys also tended to be the shyest and most self-conscious about the whole act or about their bodies. Black men, without exception, came with impeccable hygiene. Middle Eastern men again closely following. White guys, by far - on average, some were impeccable - were the least groomed and would come in unshowered, goopy, whatever, and I had to subtly nudge them towards the joys of wet wipes. I never got that from black guys and rarely from Middle Easterners. The latter 2 were all circumcized, by the way.


In short:

Best sex - black guys

Best lovers - ME guys

Best payers - white guys"
Every day of my life.
"Just write to him, but make sure you include your cell, pager, and your home phone at the bottom."
"Young man, you have your whole life ahead of you.  
To say you're suffering from autism is to belittle who you really are.  
There are traits that are not as appealing to you as you think, but having a daughter and a step-son who are both classified as being Autistic, as well as an aspie wife and father in law with Autism, the only hindrance is you and your attitude. Don't use it as a crutch or a cop-out, just be yourself. You may learn things differently than others, but that's what makes humans so incredible. If we were all the same, we'd never advance in society.

Find out what you love to do, even if it's just something as watching movies, and do it well. Do it for you, and not for anyone else.  Find something you can tolerate, and do that for work. My step-son is 18 and has found that he loves being in a kitchen helping to make meals for other students at his school. He's also found he loves making pizzas for the local pizza company.

Don't ever let someone tell you that you are less than anyone else because you're Autistic."
"God this brings up memories of film students wanting artsy-fartsy pseudo-deep shots of me pensively sitting at the edge of my hooker bed, and while taking longer to capture that than the average 19-year-old customer takes to get off, get a student-friendly price."
"335, kept a tab. It was like Pokémon GO, you don't really need or want another goddamn Zubat, but damn it feels so rewarding to just pile'em up for XP and for that obscene number in the Pokédex where it says ""Seen"" vs ""Caught"".
"
Are you ever scared that one day you'll switch and never go back? 
I imagine it is something like rubbing your index and middle finger against the thumb in small circular motions whilst simultaneously raising the eyebrows and making an inquisitive frown.
"Not me, but my Sister's boyfriend was on there and this is what he said.

1.Yes, He actually got pulled over and was surprised to see the camera's and told his friend ""Oh shit I think we're on the news!"" No Camera magic except some things were cut out of respect and for the sake of timing.

2.Yes, He had to sign one to be on the show and whether or not to have his face blurred. His friend had to as well. 

3.As he said in 1, It was weird seeing the camera's but he's dealt with the cops in the area before and he's pretty well versed in the law so he had no worries. He said since it's on TV he thinks the cops were less aggressive and let him off scotch free, but took his weed.

Any other questions?"
Did you ever unexpectedly have anyone you knew walk in?
I stopped going a few years ago just because of the guilt. Now I have really looked into what Mormonism is about and it is built on lies and polygamy and racism. I want as far away from it as I can get. I was brainwashed.
"Male or female? Did you prostitute yourself or have another job at the brothel? If you were a prostitute,whats the weirdest request you were willing to grant? Whats the weirdest request you werent willing to grant?"
"Can you leave each other notes?? Like, ""hey party girl, gotta big day tomorrow so if you're gonna come out and play can you go easy on me? thanks""."
"You may laugh, but the ones who could actually make me cry (once they were out) were not rapists, wrong-hole-men, abusive guys, or whatever. I'm an introvert. I want the porn transaction. Less blah blah, more boom boom. If they stayed too long, with or without paying, or if they talked too much and expected me to respond, fuck no. One fucker went full toddler on me hiding in my closet when his time was way up, so I actually yanked him down the stairs and kicked him out the door, like, I literally kicked him and he was still laughing. It's not just johns. When a person I got no bond with, keeps yapping at me and I can't just get away, I fall apart. Seen Game of Thrones, that old maester, standing in his shirt and his dick peeking out, next to a hooker and talking politics? That same thing once happened to me, and my voice was cracking, because nooooooooooo make it stop. Naked, in his shirt, dick peeking out, TALKING PHILOSOPHY with his fists on his hip and looking profoundly towards the ceiling OMG STFU

Although let's be honest, the one who didn't immediately hurt me the most by wrecking my nerves, almost put me in the grave with the long term effects of his shit. He was handsome, good in bed, and paid well, and we were mutually attracted, but he was from a group of high HIV risk. So when he decided to ditch the condom  when I begged him not to, and I then got an inconclusive HIV result, I got so severely depressed that a couple months later, I was on suicide alert. The HIV thing cleared up within one month of weekly re-testing and all was well, but tell that to the depression that was refusing to pack up and leave."
"As for the best memory, it's probably a boring answer but I met so many peeps from other countries not only America and experienced tons of different cultural thing.
Also understanding the way Americans see the history was pretty interesting bc Japan used to be a huge asshole to them.

The worst is hands down my landlord.
He ripped me off just because I'm an international one. He has never paid my deposit back to me. I eavesdropped him once saying how shitty asians are.
I don't even know why he let me stay in one of his units.

The food I wanted to eat when I came back is definitely sushi.( sorry I'm like a representative of Japanese stereotype lol)
I mean like the typical sushi, not like ""California roll"""
"&gt; they want to get laid without having to call back

When asked by reporters why a rich, young, handsome movie star needed to hire prostitutes, especially when most of them would sleep with him for free, Charlie Sheen replied, ""I'm not paying them for sex, I'm paying them to leave.""

"Who closes the bus' door when the bus' driver leave the bus?

Sorry for bad English. "
"I have a main identity, which is myself. I go by my birth name and I would consider myself the ""original"". Most DID is caused by traumatic events. The personality splits accordingly. I am sure some people have a more equal split than others. From support groups and others in my therapy centers, I have started to piece together that the more personalities, the more equal the splits become. There is less control over which personality you become, not that there is much control in the first place."
"0) I still party every few weekends but the best memory I have is putting a party on and seeing everyone's smiles and a huge number of people enjoying what you've spent so much time and effort into organizing.

1) Police are hit and miss, 98% of the time they will come and we will talk with them and organise a time to finish without any trouble and that's the best case scenario, the other 2% can be no talk just action and the police try and take the speakers with officers in riot gear.

2) I wouldn't say it attracts any lower tier of talent, some of the best talent the world has seen attended these parties or actually started at these parties (David Bowie, The Prodigy)

3) The genre of music has sort of been passed down and always has a variation of underground music, such as Hard Trance and Jungle, just sounds you wouldn't hear anywhere else.

4) There are rarely any trouble at these parties, I've seen 2 fights and people get rid of the trouble makers, we turn the music off and everyone as a community reacts and gets rid of the trouble. 
"
I'm thinking that it is a bunch of bullshit. I've been doing some research and the facts are there that proves it's false
"I have to ask... what exactly is the hand gesture for ""How much?"""
"Arabs and other people of Middle Eastern, mostly Moroccan and Tunisian descent. Second in line, black men, mostly Congolese and Nigerian. I'd say late 20s to mid-40s. Needs saying that the Brussels brothels were located in a Muslim neighbourhood with also a very high % of black residents, hence the ethnic stats. The Antwerp brothel was in no specific ""ethnic"" area, so there were way more white men, mostly mid-30s to mid-50s. Strangely, the darker the customers, the younger they were on average.

And needs saying, most were nice. Didn't have to call police much."
"I'm gonna bring a bit of American's openness and honesty to people to Japan and bring a bit of Japanese politeness to people to America.
Perfect answer I guess lol

Trend that I wanna bring to Japan is definitely Uber!!! Uber expands its business in Japan but doesn't seem becoming popular.
On the other hand, I just wanna implement Japanese-like mandatory health insurance.
I had a friend, who has an epilepsia, begging to me not to call an ambulance even if he faints. It's pretty sad and  I don't think these kinda stuff should not be said by people from the greatest country. 
"
what are the biggest misconceptions people have about brothels?
I guess I'm an asshole for not being on Reddit 24/7 since it came into existence and not knowing everything that's been posted. Go fuck yourself. 
"There will always be black sheep. The problem with prostitution is, how are you even gonna prove a person is a sex worker unless you catch them in the act of soliciting or sitting in a brothel window? So you can neither fully supervise/control it, nor tax it under all circumstances. How do you know the guy I just let in, is a john and not a plumber? If you heard me moan, how do you know I got paid for it? This is also why trafficking will always remain feasible, sadly. Once a pimp stole your passport and you got no language skills, you're at his mercy as you got nowhere to go and no one to talk to.

But the thing is, those brothels I worked at, are very out in the open, they have the workers sitting half-naked in shop windows and police regularly check their ID and ask them questions to pry into their general well-being and understanding of their situation to make sure there are no forced or illegal girls. A 16-year-old got busted, but turned out she had chosen to do the job. She was deported back to Russia though. This is why I think these brothels are great (not the deportation part). The one in Antwerp even has its own tiny police station AND doctor as well as panic buttons all over the rooms. If you want or need to do sex work, this is a great, safe environment, as people know who and where you are, as opposed to an escort doing home calls or a street walker getting into cars in deserted neighbourhoods at night. Yes, the rent can be high, but you are never alone and helpless. And they will never accept a girl who can't ID herself or seems out of it. They sometimes even send men to pose as drug dealers or prospective pimps to check how susceptible you are to becoming a drug-hooker or fall prey to a pimp.

In the Netherlands, they're doing a lot to regulate it and make it both safe and taxable. This doesn't eliminate human trafficking completely, but creates competition that may hopefully one day smother the forced sex market or at least draw traffic away from it. Most johns are good men, so they will naturally prefer a woman who doesn't seem to hate her job. Hell, there are entire hooker review sites where men will post star ratings and reviews, and one major turn-off most johns have in common is a woman who can't even pretend to enjoy it. Few are sick fucks who don't care or even enjoy a miserable prostitute."
"I once fought a kid that must have been 16 or so at the time. I think they had him hooked on something, cocaine was pretty standard in that place. Anyway, at this point i was something of a house favorite, win some lose some but allways give a nice show. The place was an old truck garage and the ""arena"" was the two service pits that where next to each other minus the middle wall that was taken down, so a big square in the ground. Guy comes rushing at me, eyes bloodshot, arms flailing like worms and i have no idea what he's trying to do. So i step aside and he hits his head against one of the walls. He inmediately turns arround and charges again, so i stepped aside again and off he goes against the opposite wall. At this point i was unsure if he was faking it trying to pull some weird shit to lower my guard or actually being stupid, or shitfaced stoned. So he does it again, and bangs against another wall. Half the people there were laughing the shit off and screaming OLE! while the other half was getting kind of angry. Happened one more time, charge, hit the wall, only this time, the kid is laying flat on the floor, so i close in and push him with my foot. No response. I look arround and everyone is in silence. So i kick him in the ribs. No response. Guy who handles things gets down on the pit, slaps him a few times, nothing. So they took him away. Weirdest and easyest Fight i've ever been in."
"It's not scary ever. No matter who I am, I know one of us has a handle on things. It's just a different type of handling things. It was nerve wracking at first though, when she first developed when I was about 12. 
It's a decent accommodation. I know how to keep what I need to keep separate and so does she. "
"Yeah, the MENS department  
"
"LOL are you asking if I ever wondered if I was privileged for being in a body that is most of the time judged, disparaged, and appropriated without my consent, and found an opportunity to benefit from it in a way that exposes me to MORE judgement and abuse? No, I did not check my privilege to do with my flesh as I please. Plus, getting up at 4 am to give myself razor rash to be smooth by the time my 12 hour shift starts at 6 am 40 miles away from home, and having to stay energized and cheerful without drugs for 12 hours straight to create an illusion of every guy being my first and favourite, is kinda very taxing. It was basically 12 hours of non-stop light gymnastics and brutal next-morning muscle pain. Not every customer is happy with you lying on your back.

Plus, it's a free world, anyone gets to do what I did if they so wish. "
"Pretty much. It's basically holding your hand up with all the fingers sorta meeting, and shaking the hand around a bit. Usually, they also mouth the question. The answer is a number of fingers, each finger being 10 Euros. There were men who thought 1 finger = 1 Euro. Nope."
"Heartbreaking no. Non-sexual was rare, but there was this one guy, I shuddered when he was sent in by an overzealous manager and she just told me to go entertain him when I had no time to say HELL NO. She normally never did that, but that day had been very slow and the owner wanted his rent from all the girls and we were nowhere close. He was like 80 years old and I thought oh fuck no no no. Turned out, all he had wanted - and royally paid for - was spend an hour talking about how, as a young lad, he had fallen in love with women of my body type and been trying to find the perfect model of it ever since so he could spend his life drawing the big female form. He said I had brought back memories of his first love who had sparked that passion shortly before World War II where he had then lost sight of her as he'd had to go to war, and that was really all. Which was refreshing. I usually hated talking, but this guy talking about how he lived for drawing and admiring the rubenesque female form, did a lot for my self-worth and body image."
Perfect personality to join the CIA ;)
"The Antwerp one had fully equipped hotel-like rooms and showers, so yeah. Brussels... nope. Only wet wipes. As for sheets, nope... carrying more than 1 is kinda inconvenient, but every woman brings her own. No sheets on site, because hell no."
Depended on my mood and whether or not I was shaved :P 
Just claim it's performance art.
"My family is behind me. They are finally seeing the light. I know a lot of people will distance themselves from me. They will say ""I'll pray for you"" when in fact I'm so happy right now. Way happier than being in the lds church. I always hated going, probably because I didn't get a good feeling about it. I'm kind of in shock since I just decided to do this. It's so liberating though!"
"People that want to ban prostitution say all of these cliches. Their main objection though seems to be that trafficked girls get drawn into prostitution, but they never explain how exactly illegal immigrants can work in a regulated trade. It always leads me to conclude that they are just our new morality police trying to drive prostitution into the dangerous criminal underworld. They don't care about the safety of prostitutes at all.

I think it is a great way for people to avoid a lifetime of toil, if you save hard you must be able to make some serious money in ten years, enough to retire and do other things."
"i'm 26 now. After a while i patched things up with my family, so they let me back into my house. Currently i'm studying to become a Literature teacher and work part time at the Public Relations office for the governor's secretary."
"There are bargains and compromises in their own ways I suppose. It's more of a mutual respect. I do have quite a quite of animosity as far as her boyfriend choice goes. Her life goals are entirely different and reckless and I would like to stay alive. Her habits reflect badly on me, as the original, even though I am not actually partaking in any of the activities. But then again, I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm boring as hell and mainstream haha."
"It's kind of abrupt. She was originally a coping mechanism for abuse I suffered when I was younger, so she gets triggered most of the time."
"Just knowing that happens makes me incredibly happy. Thank you for sharing that gem, friend. "
"Not a fan of the guy, but this is the most genius way anyone has ever put it. Hell, I've often had flings where I thought, okay asshole why are you still here, why are you hogging my blanket, why are you using my toilet paper?"
What is the sweetest thing that has happened while you were on the job?
"I gotta get a glimpse of these warlocks

"Miss Cleo was an Actress by the name of Youree Dell Harris, who is now dead. She was hired by The Psychic Readers Network and Access Resource Services to star in a series of infomercials. She was not the owner of the company nor did she ever take any calls on behalf of the company - she was an actress.  When both Access Resource Services and The Psychic Readers Network got fined by the FTC and sued into oblivion she was never touched, why? Because she was an actress hired to do some commercials and nothing more. "
