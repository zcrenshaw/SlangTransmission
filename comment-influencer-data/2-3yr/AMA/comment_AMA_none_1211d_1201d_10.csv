"Honestly, everyone who works at six flags bangs each other. Seriously. If you want a summer job where you're guaranteed to bang your co workers, six flags is the place."
"Yeah unfortunately masks aren't allowed for anyone other than children, but I agree on your bewilderment. A lot of six flags security officers are just wannabe cops who think they're tough shit and take their job too seriously. I always laughed my ass off at them because in my head I'm like ""dude we are rent a cops at a theme park. We aren't that cool. Slow your role rent a cop.""

Where do you see yourself in ten years? 
"i guess you are still bound to their confidentiality contract because YOU AREN'T ANSWERING ANY FUCKING QUESTIONS!!  
  
/s"
"I had a boss who everyone hates. She has worked at the park for 42 years or something, since the park opened. She still runs the park like she did 40 years ago. She is impossible to make happy and most full time and seasonal employees have NOTHING nice to say about her. I quit because of her, which I later found out a lot of people do. She was just a psycho bitch. Never had anything nice to say, and if you were having fun at your job, she would get mad. Many people described her as ""hating morale"" She is the worst boss I have ever had. And i always just wanted to say ""You work at a theme park and have for 40 years.You aren't that great"""
"All kinds of things. I think the craziest thing I dealt with was a man high on bath salts who tried cutting his wrists with a piece of glass he broke off his window. He kept yelling: ""kill me now! Just kill me!"" Police and rescue arrived pretty quickly and took him away."
People often ask this. I don't know what darkness is so I can't say if I see it or not. I was told by a friend of mine who hasn't been blind all his life that everything is just black... But again I don't know what black is. Lol
Oh I get it now. Well I don't mind. I think it's funny. 
I remember going on the Halloween night Fright Fest and walked in with my zombie costume and mask on and was rushed by like seven security people like I had explosives strapped to me or something.  It was stupid.  All because of the mask.

"Worked at Great America over summer 2010, cannot confirm.

I was one hell of an ugly teenager though...."
"Excellent question. Your best bet is in your car once you're parked, and the parking lot is full. Otherwise inside the park, there's not really a good place. Word to the wise though, if you want to bring weed in to the park, don't leave it in your bag because they search bags, PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET."
I believe you mean severed. Decapitation is when the head is separated from the body. The more you know ðŸ˜‰. 
"A kid got his foot decapitated for riding the Viper roller coaster and hanging his foot out in October of 2014. It never made the news. I've googled it tirelessly but it's no where to be found. I guess theme parks can pay off the media, but one time there was a small fire on the Goliath operator booth and three news helicopters were there in minutes. It makes no sense to me."
"No, I found a corporate job that pays me a full time salary, gives me weekends and holidays off, and benefits. Something Six Flags did not give me."
THEY WILL NEVER KEEP ME DOWN
"I apologize good sir, I went out to lunch because I didn't get any questions initially, but I'm here now!"
"The rides are safe. Occasionally they get stuck for a few minutes, but I have to say the maintenance department does a really good job. Plus the state of Illinois has to test all of the rides and give them a license to operate each year. "
Workout man...everyday hard as fuck. Don't quit. You got this!

"This is the first time I'm excited about an AMA. I hope he won't get ""sick of it"" and leave after like 10 questions."
How much weird sex stuff happens behind the scenes?
"Technically his head was decapitated, it just included all the rest of the body but the foot."
Do we work together??
How are you adjusting to the glowing blue eyes?
"Probably. I mean think about what happens when she dies. what's her legacy: ""She worked security at a theme park her whole life, and no one liked her."" That's the image she leaves behind. I can't believe I spent two years taking shit from a 60 year old woman who never went to college, and settled on a job like that"
"I'm 22 now, thanks."
Anything crazy happen when you worked there?
"""Can't be bothered."""
"&gt; Getting fired is pretty hard

&gt; Pull your phone out in front of guests

That doesn't sound very hard"

Yup. And I feel in dreams too. 
"Only a matter of time before ""who the hell is Karl Pilkington"" appears on /r/OutOfTheLoop"
"1. I am not a troll, just for the record. 

2. You are defensive of any criticism, and seem to not see any point other than the one you have attained by having herpes (online STD blogs? Not exactly objective). Gathering this from your comments in this thread, so it might be a bit narrow. 

3. Gifting? Is that what I read about somewhere here? That's like, the whole HIV / AIDS thing I read about where people chase and purposely have sex with carriers. This is pretty much crazy, and you seem to be using the term to ""open people's eyes"" towards your own situation. To make your own life better.  Simply put, no thanks. Why did contracting herpes open your eyes to this, rather than simply knowing it existed? Because it's your own position, of course. I get it. Just pointing it out. 

It's a disease. Done. 

Honestly, this whole thread seems to have quite a bit of this ""internet activism"" in it, and I honestly never post or comment on it, but it's starting to get to me a bit I guess. 

I mean no offense by the above, just sharing my personal, uninformed , and probably stupid opinion. Best of luck on your ventures.

"Starting pay is $10 an hour. If you get promoted to lead, you get $10.50, and supervisor is $11.50. All work is seasonal. Benefits include free admission for you and a friend every day (with your employee ID) free tickets, a discount on the overpriced merchandise, and employee ride nights. Getting fired is pretty hard but not impossible. One easy way to get booted is to pull your phone out in front of guests. That gets you canned right away."
 That was cruel.
Wonder if he'll bring Suzanne.

Good question. I Usually judge people by their voices or their smell. 
"No good way to sneak into the park unfortunately, but to avoid paying 25 dollars in parking just drive through the exit when going in. Almost no one ever gets caught. "
Well my current girlfriend is blind too and i'm very happy with her. My ex broke up with me cause I was blind so that sucked. 
Welcome to the world
It was mainly an issue with 16 year old couples who weren't with their parents. They would just make out with each other mostly. A couple of times we caught people banging in the car in the parking lot though. Their look when they realized we caught them was priceless.
This is the hardest thing for me to wrap my mind around. A color is something that can't be described.
"Anything you've always wanted to get off your chest about your job that you couldn't? Like, it doesn't have to be crazy or anything."
He was in the parking lot. So not sure if he ever actually went in to the park or not.
"I respect your opinion but I loved my coworkers. I did not like one person in particular because they poisoned the work environment, but that's fine. Perhaps you're right, and I'm better off too because I make a better pay."
Head like a fucking orange
"I have trouble believing these AMA's. Anyone with a brain could answer questions how people think sociopath's answer questions. And I feel like a sociopath wouldn't waste time doing an AMA, because AMA's are for people who care about others, as in seeking attention and conversation with others. I doubt sociopaths would have any care for that sort of thing.

I am not a psychologist or doctor of any kind, so this is only an opinion."
Do you just dream of sounds? 
My guess is she's horrible *because* she's worked at a theme park for 40 years. 
See those little things on the letters F and J on your keyboard? I just type by pudding my index fingers on the F and the J and my thums on the space bar. The rest I learned throughout the years. And I read by using a screenreader called NVDA. I might make a youtube channel or something to explain these kinds of things because it's a lot easier if you can just talk. Lol
