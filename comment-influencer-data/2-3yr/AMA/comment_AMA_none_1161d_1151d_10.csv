Dad?
"&gt;So I'm butt ass naked in my workplace bathroom

Might as well fap while you wait for the pants to dry."
You. I want you on my team. 
"I signed up for a free sample months ago and they never arrived. You guys are jerks, go eat a bag of dicks. "
Put your pants and underwear in rice that should get rid of the stains.
Proof
"**FINAL UPDATE**
Thank you for all of your kind sympathies and offers of help. I have finally made it home and will soon be scrubbing my ass clean. This has been one of the worst experiences of my life but thank you for making it a laughable one at best haha. Much love. 
"
Consider it done
That was a copy cat site. Our dicks are way too good to give away.
"There is no crazy bug in the water. Tourists buy bottled water anyway. Here are the rules for surviving Rio: 

1-Always carry 10-15 bucks in your pocket. That's the ""thief money"". Aka if you get mugged, just give it to them and most likely you won't get harmed.


2-Use an international credit card like VISA so you don't need to carry 50+ bucks around. Tourists glow in the dark. You're like Sauron's ring in a land of Gollums.

3-Only carry copies of your documents in case they want the whole wallet.

4-No flashy clothes, sneakers or cellphones. Yes people rob nikes in Rio. If you can get a prepaid phone or use an old one, even better.

5-If you need to ask for information, do it at decent looking stores or counters.

6-South zone neighborhood is relatively safer but you can still easily be mugged.

7-South zone has some pretty safe restaurants and bars. You're not gonna catch any bug.

8-If you can, try to walk around as a group and don't split up.

9-Flash kidnappings are a real thing, but i'm not certain how they would go about having a foreign person transfer cash or much less conduct international blackmail.

10-McDonalds here is slow.

11-Barra has somewhat safe haven in shopping malls and the food there is also safe. Same goes for the small malls in the south zone.

12-Local crime lords might stage some big event and i would also expect the poor people who got kicked out of their houses to build the olympic park to do some kind of protest but no one can say for sure what will happen.

13-security here is pretty loose and although we haven't had any huge terrorist attacks, if the place is gonna be packed with americans, well... 

14- If you smell some nice BBQ coming from a shady stand it's cat meat."
Did you try turning it off and on?
"Shitty pants and underwear - 0/10

Shitty pants and underwear with rice - still 0/10"

"Best question yet.

The site has been active for about 15 months. I personally only came on board about 5 months ago. I was somewhat miserable at my corporate gig for about 5 years. I had recently got a little obsessed with Gary Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferris, and being an entrepreneur. (Please tell them they're responsible for my decision). This was an opportunity that came up and I decided that I had to take it, and hope any skills or experience I learn will turn into other opportunities or businesses. If I ever have to get a real job again though, my resume will most certainly be screwed!

To answer your question.....it was definitely an interesting conversation to have with family members. Most of my family finds it hilarious, but there were a few family and friends that I've not been comfortable enough to tell. I.e. grandparents and my girlfriend's extremely conservative parents. I'll go with a general statement that I run an online website/business, marketing, etc. 

TL;DR - Quit corporate gig to run Dick business, was uncomfortable but funny telling family about Bag of Dick business."
"Okay, I guessed!"
"Do they paint you, or do you blue yourself? [(obligatory)](https://media.giphy.com/media/fj3CWRJJshhe/giphy.gif)"
Toss the boxers. They're done. Focus on saving the pants. 
"That's a really good question. There's this trick I learned to figuring out stuff like this:

Grab a coin, and pick something for heads, and pick something for tails. Flip the coin! As soon as you do, your heart will tell you what you hope it lands on. Once you feel the answer, don't even bother looking at the coin. You already know.

So I guess pick 2 possible reasons and do that trick thing."
Where am I supposed to get rice haha
"Ah, I see. [Here is where I found said freebie](https://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/4dm83r/anonymously_send_a_free_mini_bag_of_dicks_or/). Maybe you should send them a bag of dicks for ruining your good name."
How do your family members feel about you working in the bag of dicks industry?
"Absolutely. We encourage our recipients to in fact eat the bag of dicks. They're actually really good... I've eaten way too many bags of dicks at this point in my life.

That being said, our site is mainly used between friends just joking around with each other. If you're REALLY in the market to send something malicious, then you might want to check out poopsenders.com!"
"Can you borrow a sweater from someone and tie it around your waist? It's poor fashion, but at least you won't be the guy who shit his pants at work. 

Alternatively, you could take this approach: http://img02.deviantart.net/2b1c/i/2004/212/b/a/another_jthm_clip.jpg"
"Depends on your definition on hot.

I'm a 27 year old male, bald and maybe a bit overweight. I wouldn't win a beauty contest.

Unless you're talking temperature, then yes I'm feeling slightly warmer than normal."
May I answer your question with another question?
"P.S. - About a month in, I received a text from my mom that read something like:

""Mom: ""How's the Dick Business been going?""

It really made me realize what I had just done with my life, but sometimes you commit to a decision and you just have to push forward."
"15- being black helps. I went there on a solo trip there. Black lady, dressed plain, didn't have my camera phone out everywhere. People didn't give a shit about me. I was able to slip by and enjoy everything without really worrying. Highly recommended. "
There was an episode of Scooby Doo that I never finished. I forget what happens in it.

"Step 1: be black

Step 2: don't be not black"
"My feelings are a long story. When I enlisted it was coincidence the attacks on 9/11 happened. Yet I bought in hard. All in. Now, I have children, much more life experience and wiser so that I can think for myself. I've had a lot of time to work out all the stuff that happened. I feel that I got caught up in the war machine. Now I'm dumbfounded how we ended up in Iraq. I'm pretty much disenfranchised with the US yet still am very proud of my service and the experiences I had. Quite the juxtaposition. "
Just did a search in our order system...about 5-10 orders to Donald Trump. Pretty weak if you ask me! We really should run a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton promo.

You could go to China?
"I genuinely can't decide. On one hand I know a crocodile would hurt me no matter what. On the other hand, I do not know the psychology of ducks and how much of a confidence boost they'll get from getting bigger."
Haha. We've actually talked about doing a Glitter/Penis bomb type of deal. It has not been ruled out :-)
Can you guys design a contraption like the glitter bombs but with dicks instead?  Imagine flying dicks ....it would be fantastic

What you do: Don't answer any questions. 
"Yes it is. You cannot be legally married to two people at the same time in my country, but there is no legal binding contract or tax benefits for one of them."
What colour is country music?  I'd guess white.

"Two at once and alternating... it really depends on the day. I assume you are asking about the sex. They have sex with each other too. But neither one really likes girls just each other.

When one of us is at work or out we may spend time with the other. It really is just all cool. We can do whatever we want with each other but we are exclusive in our triad. "
Proof?
