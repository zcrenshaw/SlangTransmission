"Have you ever had a taboo, sexual relationship? If so, with who.. and is it ongoing? "
"Her to her friends: *""So I literally chained myself to him for a WEEK and he still didn't get the message.""* "
Nice. I like them like I like my liquor. Twelve years old and kept in a basement.
My grandmother. She's like 89 or something. Haven't seen her in a while.
How do you like your women? I like mine diced and cubed in a vacuum-sealed plastic bag
"Thanks for the kind words. 
He was my neighbor and was out of prison for a prior sex crime. I just bought a house at the bottom of a hill. He lived at the top of the hill and had been watching me. 
I work late at night and he knew that. He waited until I came home one night and just walked in the door right after me and had a gun. 
It happened in 2003 and it was @3am. 
He was caught 4 days later after assaulting another woman. 
He received a life sentence but ultimately died in prison of a stroke in 2006. "
You don't say?
"I was in the hospital for 6weeks and tried to live in the house but just didn't feel safe there. I sold the house a month after I got out of the hospital. 
I haven't really altered my life willingly. I did alter my name after testifying at the recommendation of the prosecutor. 
My life has been altered because I've changed my name under the victim protection act and have a medical license. Every time I have to renew my license I have to go through a bunch of crap in trying to prove who I am. I'm always feeling pissed about that. 
I was married when it happened and got divorced shortly after. I am not sorry about that because I met the love of my life 8 months after the assault. 
I'm now remarried and have a 10 year old daughter. So I guess if there is any good that came from it that would be it. 
Funny you ask about owning a firearm. I am pro-gun. I grew up in northern Idaho and hunted my whole life. 
When I moved away I just never thought of having a gun. 
My husband and I just got our concealed carry permits. We both have guns now. 
A gun wouldn't have helped me the night of my assault because it all happened so fast. "
I bet you love Comcast 
"I guess I was just calm enough to keep him calm. 
The detectives said that I did everything ""right"" 
I just tried to read what he needed and went with it. 
Bottom line: the desire to live outweighed the desire to fall apart. "
"If the toilet malfunctions after doing your business, what do you do?"
Save that shit. You gotta be smart.
I dunno. Somewhere obvious. An orphanage maybe?
"Without thinking, where is the best place to publicly masturbate?"
What would be the biggest turn on for you?
"It was gradual. Went from talking, to talking less, to whispering, and then no speaking at all.

I never really panicked, but I was very confused and upset. "
"Snickers. The nuts really compliment the caramel, and on top of it all, the marshmallow type stuff is the shit, man. Reeces are good too, though."
"Both of us go to college. She takes classes in the morning and I take them in the evening. Only one of her classes is actually on campus though, and I have 3 on campus. The profs were pretty cool about it. They laughed about it. My chem prof even took a photo.

For the shower, one us of would be standing right outside the shower holding our arm in while the other person is in there, and vice versa.

We actually slept in her bed the whole week because I'm a childish fuck who sleeps on a futon, and 2 people couldn't fit on it. Sleeping together was easily the most physically uncomfortable thing about the whole week.

Our other roommate has to pay our rent next month."
"So as someone who isn't into scat, what's it like to have someone shit on your chest?  What would you compare it to?"
"First of all, my my condolences for what you had to endure. You are obviously a strong person for getting through that and not giving up. 

How did he get in and what tine did it happen?

How quickly was he caught?

What kind of sentence did he receive?

"
"I like to think I'm strong. It was such a nightmare for a good 2 years. I was fortunate enough to have amazing health insurance and so was able to get the best medical care. 
I've spent quite a bit of time in therapy and now volunteering as a rape advocate is therapeutic for me. 
I survived the throat injury because he didn't cut deep enough to do critical damage. I lost quite a bit of blood though and it was pretty touch and go for the first week. He did injure my thyroid (a small butterfly shaped gland in your throat) so I take medicine for that. 
I got a MRSA infection while in the hospital and that almost killed me. 
The surgeon told me that he's never seen anyone survive with the amount of blood loss that I had. 
I have a nasty scar. It looks great now after scar revision therapy. Not sure how to post a photo here or I would share what it looks like now.  
The medics got there within 5minutes of my call and I was lucky enough to live close to a major medical center. 
I suppose a lot of things went ""right"" or I wouldn't be here today. 
I ended up having 6 more surgeries after that and I still have some chronic neck pain that I am able to manage by doing Yoga. I get migraines 1-2 times a week that I manage with a small dose of codeine (I'm a redhead and don't process other pain medicine well so that's about as strong as I can take).  
He stabbed and cut me on other places as well but all mostly superficial. He was not trying to kill me with the knife (at first), he was just trying to torture me. 

"
Correct 
Getting chased by a serial killer. Ed Gein maybe?
lol Honestly that's probably what happened
"Oh I get it now! Thought you were just being an asshole, my bad!

I can sort of force out squeaks, and I can whistle with no problem, but verbal noises like a grunt or a laugh just won't happen. Can't hum either. Basically anything that involves the use of my throat/vocal chords isn't happening!"
Wait... there was sex?! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME!
Why don't you just tell them why you became mute?
Hell yeah I do! 
"I want to be myself, and the line leader."
"So when my dad was walking in I was finger painting with my friend ruby. She saw my dad coming and told me to hide under a table (to this day I have no clue why she told me to do that but I would love to get in contact with her to ask). I hid for about a minute and eventually he was able to convince me to come out from where ever I was hiding. After a while of packing my bag (I still remember that conversation I had with him as we did it in very extensive detail). We were about to walk out and my grandmother ran into the room and started yelling at my father now holding me in his arms. All the other children got taken to another room where all the baby's were kept. My grandmother grabbed right arm and leg and started to pull (while doing this she ripped a muscle and permanently damaged herself but didn't let go). I was kicking screaming and crying. Eventually the police got there and took him away.

My mother is fine she actually is an excellent teacher. She won the teacher of the year for Australia a couple of years ago and went to a NASA space camp thingy. She is a great and very strong lady.

I don't know if it effects me really. I have a lot of problems but my life in general has been a bit of a shit show. Although when I go to Father's Day BBQs I get double the meat for free.

And I live in nsw Australia "
"I'm glad that they give selective mutism some awareness, but it's not portrayed accurately *at all*, which is kind of annoying. I'm fine with mutism being used for comedy though, as long as it's in good taste.

I'd really like to say ""hi"" to my mum. 
"
"I mean, all shit smells. It wasn't the worst thing in the world, but I definitely wouldn't wear it as a cologne."
Nope. The most I can manage is a forced squeak kind of thing. 
"Gladly, you can recreate it :)"
"No questions.

I just wanted to say how I truly admire your strength and courage.  Thank you for coming here, and I wish you a long and fulfilling life - you bloody deserve it xx"
Because I don't know why I became mute. 
What is your greatest accomplishment?
"Sausage, by far."
"What's your favorite place to slit someone's throat, bag said human, and dump them?"
Dunno. I'm pretty mundane. I went camping once.
What food have you inserted into your rectum the most?
"That's a good question, cherokehall, and I really appreciate your sensitivity asking it :-) to be honest, I don't think I would have been able to give my kid away once it was in my arms. To me, it felt like it was all or nothing. 

I have actually talked about this with my current partner, and we've decided we'll adopt a kid at some point, from a mum who maybe was in a similar situation to mine but for whatever reason didn't have access to the same services that I did. "
Yes
"here is what I recall from the last time I read from someone who went to high-school with him:  

He was  quiet guy, kept to himself mostly. He liked basketball. His bodyguards were with him pretty much always. 

I know that says almost nothing, but it's all i have on Lil' Kim"
Outside. Nature is the most peaceful place sometimes.
1 week no fap :'(
"26 inches long, and 12 inches thick."
What is man's greatest contribution to society?
"It's either should **HAVE** or should**'VE**, but never should **OF**. 

 See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information."
"Okay, *whoosh* went that joke.

Next question, Do you still make sounds? Like what if you put your mind to it and want to verbally communicate, is it just gibberish?

I'm honestly asking this one because I have no clue how that works. 

"
Please provide an illustration of how you changed shirts.
"This will sound so strange but no. I'm not ""happy""
I wish he would have spent many years in prison being tortured. 
He had only spent a total of 5 years out of jail/prison since he was 16 for sex crimes. He was 55 when he died. 
I thought I would feel safer or better in some way when he died but I didn't feel anything. 
"
Op still doesn't get it
"&gt; ultimately died in prison of a stroke in 2006.

Sooo sad to hear about his death. Sounds like he deserved a long time in prison. Hopefully there is some cosmic justice that he'll experience.

Do you still live in the house?

Have you altered your life in anyway because of this?

Do you own  firearm?"
1 week no fap? O.O
"Well nothing bad yet that I know of :). We paid taxes ahead as soon as we got the check, because we knew that would come soon. 

We did kinda have to be careful because we went from broke to comfortable, so after a period of allowing ourself to spend money and enjoy it, we had to rein ourselves in and go back to being practical. "
Meth. I've seen what it can do. Heroin too.
What size knife do you recommend for silencing small children?
So you physically can't talk even if you tried? 
Do you put schnitzel on the barbie?
Three HOURS? How did you survive?
I used to wear a necklace with a little shell on it. Still have it somewhere!
"The first day, Monday morning, we just cut our shirts off.
After that what we did was we would put our shirts on and off by just just pulling them over each others head and shoulders and through the rest of the body. I wore tank tops for the rest of the week so i was easy for me, and she wore strapless dresses so she wouldn't have to worry about that. She also had those like blouse type shirts with the really big arm holes. Both of us are pretty skinny, so it was pretty easy to fit our whole body through them. I weigh 115 and she weighs like 95 or something like that."
That fake-ass butter shit they put on the popcorn.
When did it start? Did you panic? Was it sudden or slow? 
"So, you are saying that each of you fit your entire body through the arm hole of the other's shirt? Now's your chance for a serious amount of upvotes, if you can make a video of that process."
What is the best web browser?
I'm so sorry to hear this happened. You sound strong as hell. How did you survive the throat injury? Get medics there quickly or something? 
"No offense at all. I was married at the time and it did cause me to pull away sexually from my husband. It was hard for him as well. He wasn't there to protect me and in some way I think he was pissed. 
We are obviously divorced and my new husband was so kind and gentle, I don't have any issues with it. I think trust is the key. I trust my current husband and so it has never been a problem for us. 
I think that women really need to realize that having sex in any form is our decision. I talk to many women who say they feel obligated to be intimate with their partner even when they don't feel emotionally ready for it. 
I should include men here as well. I only say ""women"" because I am a woman and the people in my therapy groups are women. 
"
"As an older, more experienced guy to a younger, less experienced guy, think really carefully about whether you're being overly picky or dismissive.  It sounds like you could make a great couple, and you don't want to be kicking yourself in 10 years when you're looking at her as a woman instead of your childhood buddy and regretting not having acted when you had the chance.  It's fine if she's genuinely unattractive, but put some serious thought into it before you dismiss the possibility."
"We paid off bills, paid off our car (we had to buy a car after we taped the show, but before we got the check), and set up an investment account. We also each got a new toy (my hubby got an indoor trainer for his bike, I got a quilting machine, and our son got Legos :)"
"If you run out of shaving cream, what do you use as a substitute?"
Did he kill you eventually?
"I usually just try to keep my distance from people. I smile a lot though, so that they don't think I'm rude. If they do try to talk I attempt to just nod or mouth words so it looks like I just have a really quiet voice that they can't hear.

When ordering food or drinks I just point to what I want on the menu. Asking questions is something that usually needs writing down. Otherwise I just mime everything like a mad woman!!

I don't hide it, because it would be exhausting. Most people don't bother trying to chat anyway. If they do I make it clear that I know I look ridiculous, so they can laugh and feel awkward with me. Headphones help a lot in keeping people away!"
"So my mum divorced him after we ran away because he was abusive. Because of this he wanted to get back at her. So, every 2 weeks when I made the 2 hour court ordered trip to visit him. He would whisper shit about how he would kill me in my mother or grandmothers ear."
"I don't know, he'd get mad at me 'cause he's a bad man."
"First, I missed my period. Very unusual for me as my cycle is usually like clockwork. So I went to buy a test, which confirmed the pregnancy. 

My first instinct was to google ways to make it go away. I looked up Chinese herbal solutions, even bought a bottle of something called 'dong quai'. It didn't work, but I was so scared to confront the situation and willing to go with any method that felt the quickest and most discreet. Luckily, my boyfriend, who I had only been with a short time, supported me through the freak out stage and we booked an appointment at the nearest women's health clinic. 

I was 5 weeks along when I had the procedure, which was  very early and luckily meant I had a low risk of complications.  I arrived there at about 7am after fasting 12 hours the night before for the anaesthetic. I sat with my boyfriend and about 5 other women and their support people in the waiting area watching 30 Rock for about half an hour, then was called on for a counseling session. The provider's demeanor was deadpan if not slightly slightly cold, but I appreciated that she didn't question my reasoning too much - she really left the decision up to me and made it clear she wasn't going to judge me either way.  I went in for an ultrasound, and then the last I remember after that was the anaesthetic going into my arm while I sat in stirrups. Then I woke up in recovery about 15 mins later. It cost about $350 Australian dollars."
"lol I think it's because we knew that if we were careful, it would be life changing. We didn't want to screw this opportunity up. Don't get me wrong, we've had some fun with it, but put our priorities in order. The day the check cleared, we sat in an Einstein Bagels and paid off all the cards and the car loan before we allowed ourself to spend it anywhere else. I give my hubby the credit for most of that, he's very disciplined with the budget. "
Nothing that anyone can find!
"* How do you allocate budget for these trips? 
* Do you just backpack and travel when you feel like it's a good time or plan everything in advance?
* Tour packages or own customized plans?"
"I only get frustrated if they can't understand or say something like ""just speak!"". Otherwise we kind of work together in the knowledge that it's a challenge for both of us.

I often feel quite isolated if with a group of people, since they'll all be talking with one another.

When someone knows sign language it's like Christmas. "
you could just tell people a Sea Witch stole your voice

"It happened. We kinda just stood their awkwardly facing the other direction. One time I dumbly said ""So, how's the weather?"" She didn't find it as funny as I did lol"
"Thanks. It is good for me to talk about it. I hope someone else that's been assaulted see's this and feels less alone. I know that through my hardest times it was helpful to know I wasn't alone. 
It's always been interesting and sometimes sad at how each person handles trauma differently. 
I was sexually abused as a child and when I was able to give a statement to the detectives, they asked me if I had previously been sexually abused. 
I told them I had been and they told me that might have helped me know what to do and to stay calm. 
In therapy groups others would say ""I didn't have it as bad as you but......""
It can be isolating. I think what helped me is just realizing that I had a choice. I could give up and be a mess for the rest of my life or I could work hard on recovery. 
When stuff like this happens, there is so much more that goes with it. 
Even after all this time, I can still feel sorry for myself. Fortunately, I have a strong support system. 
Thanks for engaging!"
Rekt.
"Video games. Overwatch, specifically."
"Yep. They would get pretty angry and try to bribe me to speak more etc.

I asked them to learn sign language whilst I could still speak again, and they wouldn't because ""it would encourage me to stop speaking at all"".

... that worked out well, clearly. "
Isn't this the plot of kindergarten cop?

What's your favorite thing to wank it to?
My god. You're an amazing and astonishing person. Thank you for the in depth answer. I hope it's useful/cathartic for you to be able to talk openly about this to everyone too. I'm sorry that guy died before he'd had time to suffer like very worst filth he was. 
"He was very young when it happened. I wouldn't say either of us think it was 'justifiable'. What I will say is it wasn't on purpose. It was gang related. No weapons used, and my husband wasn't the only one involved. He was for sure a different person then and I do not associate him with the label 'murderer' but I know society does."
"I don't really see her as attractive, we're just really good friends. And yes morning wood did happen, but it's okay because I wake up earlier then her"
Nah lol she just kinda goes along with all my dumb ideas. She really started regretting it on the second day though
"For the record, I am definitely not 16 😂"
