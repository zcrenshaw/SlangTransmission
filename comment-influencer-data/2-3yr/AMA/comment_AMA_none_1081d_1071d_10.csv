"Whip my junk out and pee, yell yellow rain and watch everyone scatter."
Answer: OSHA
What you do if suddenly want to piss at the top of the tower?
You right
Why don't they have the on/off switch at the bottom?
Why not just go with a parachute and jump off in the end?
"&gt; We have a guy that's pushing 400, always smoking weed.

Dude loves to get high huh."
Were you shocked to see how many times he has slept with an Ops mother?
He's paid towerly.
"Tornados give me a frighten, can't do shit about them though.

10 year old me would probably not believe it.

I have once but the guy on the ground met me half way, luckily he wasn't a dick and had me come all the way down.

I normally don't eat lunch too often, too busy to stop for food.

2200 ft which would be close to a plane circling the airport getting ready to land.

I'll do some rock climbing here and there but the two are surprisingly different.

We have a guy that's pushing 400lbs, always smoking weed. But he gets up there very slowly. So not really.
"
He sharted at our wedding. I was wondering why he was commando.
"I'll fix or repair anything that goes bad, lines, radios antennas, bulbs wiring. Always troubleshooting something, and the turn it off and back on works for everything just about."
I ain't no snitch 
"I was pretty firmly in the ""I don't want to vote for either of them camp"" but she was dignified, specific, and said mostly things I agree with. 

He, on the other hand, fidgeted himself around questions, stuttering through what looked like pre-planned responses to questions that weren't asked or straight up made shit up. 

I'm now firmly in the ""I could never vote for trump and can consider voting for Hillary"" camp."
Someone's going places.
"- What are you scared of? 
- Do you think Ten year old you would think you're the man?
- Have you ever climbed all the way up just to realise you forgot something really important and have to climb back down?
- Do you take your lunch at the top? Can you just kick back in your harness and pop open your lunchbox?
- Whats the highest you've been? Can you put that into perspective for a manchild like me?
- Do you climb in your spare time?
- Do you work in bad weather?
- Do you have to be fit to climb that high, often? 
"
Start at the bottom and work your way up.
"You'll find small birds stuffed inside mast pipes but that's because ospreys are brutal motherfuckers and have a sick pleasure in decorating the tower with bird corpses. I've yet to see something just cooked in mid air, or sitting on the tower."
Deadass
It just made me dislike them both even more.
You rang?
"Sexual descriptions of me. Not too bad, just surprised me. "
"If you mean ""there it is"" as in my addiction was the sole reason for escorting you're dead wrong. Think whatever you like, but that was just another detail of my life at the time. That's also a pretty disrespectful comment to make to someone who has been willing to open up and answer any question anyone may have. If you don't have something intelligent to add to the discussion then kindly see yourself off the thread. "
"Before last night I supported Trump a lot.  Now I support him less, and feel embarrassed about it for the first time.  "
"Well, I went from

*I don't care for Trump, but I think his egomania and generalities are way overplayed. And I loathe Hilldog and think she'd be worse for America - hope Trump wins*

To

*Wow Trump is much worse than I thought, but I still hate Clinton most. But either way, #DeezNutz2016*

If that counts. "
Also apparently he has a milf fetish. But who doesn't 
I'd imagine that someone who smoked that much back then might not be healthy enough to respond these days... 
What exactly do you do up there? 
"You probably just missed it. Drill another hole, You'll find it! "
"
I'm definitely convinced to vote now.
Also more convinced that we are fucked.
As a youngster, this is my first presidential election I'm actually paying attention to and I have to say, I'm really scared and disappointed.

I did not really believe trump was an idiot racist like everyone says he is, but now I'm convinced. He completely disregarded that stop and frisk is completely a racial profiling issue. The way he points out immigrants to be the bad guys is infuriating when I see my immigrant family working hard to give me and my siblings a good life. He and Hillary argued like children.. And as a child (19), even I'm embarrassed with what we have to choose from. 

I would honestly rather side with the liar who is prepared, not the racist demagogue who doesn't realize that as soon as he is in presidency, he will just be another government puppet. 

Idk man, should I even vote at all? help.

"We had a girl that went through a traumatic experience.  After her court case was over and the guy was behind bars, she asked us to be there as she burned all of her court notes and victim impact statement.  She didn't need us any more.  She was empowered and not afraid."
"As someone who doesn't climbs towers for a living...you just shit off the tower

"
"Not that I know of.  We are there to empower the kids, they are our only priority.

If we are the only obstacle that stands between the kids and further harm, we stand ready to be that obstacle, however."
"This guy thought I'd stolen his drugs. I hadn't. He held me at gunpoint and stripped me naked trying to find where I'd hidden them. He was straight blitzed out of his mind and out of touch with reality. When I got the chance I bolted. This incident led to me changing my number and moving. 
"
"No waivers just know you're fired before you hit the ground.

My life insurance is pretty decent and I don't take hits from this line of work

I'll have to get a measurement on them.

We did a cable install out in Charlotte by the Nascar Speedway. Well the steel cables that are used to secure the mini tower broke free and split the guys face open who was at the base of the line. I didn't know whether to push his face back together or what. So I taped his head and tried to stop bleeding until ems arrived. He made it but is a vegetable now."
Someone in the gif thread mentioned RF can cook you if you spend too much time in front of the dish. Have you ever found cooked wildlife around a tower?
I actually found a comment and was pretty damn sure it was his account and he confirmed. We had a good laugh. 
"There dozens of us out there dozen. But seriously I just thought that they were hiding it so wanted to see, phone still works, just removed a bit of the metal, felt a bit stupid afterwards"
"Would it be bad/impossible to wear a parachute just in case something goes wrong?  I recall once two people got stuck on top of a windmill that caught fire, so both died."
"I went from ""Fuck both these clowns, I'm voting for Jill."" to ""I pretty much have to vote for Hillary.""

Pick any other candidate from the Right and while I may not agree with anything they say, if they had won the election, well congrats, Mr. President.  

Trump will never be the President, even if he wins."
"Sorry, but what? She had plenty of substance, especially on trade, on NATO, and a few other crucial topics. Any time they were asked about policy, she had an answer. I may not like all of her answers either (being a Republican), but she definitely had some."
"$30 an hour if I got 30k for the year,I'd beat someone with jumper cables."
"How did you get into this line of work?
How do you get paid? By the tower?"
"Yellow rain, for pee. Brown thunder for shit. White snow for well, you know."
"Has a doctor confirmed this? Those don't sound like any time of ""allergy"""
"!remindme 3 hours ""When OP finally answers"""
"Believe what you want, I guess.  I don't have time or energy to deal with the assholes out there who want to judge everyone."
"For context.

Why does Louise always wear her bunny ears? And do you think we'll ever see her without them? 
"Ran into some guys that were coming off a tower, shot the shit, asked where to apply, took two months before I heard back. I get paid via direct deposit. And it's usually management that pays us."
"Yell yellow rain if you're peeing or just shit into a trash bags if you really need to go. One guy tried climbing down to shit, stopped about half way down the climb and tapped his pants at his knees. Smelled awesome "
How many South Park jokes do you get daily?
Lol yep &amp; now he's stalking mine pretty sure. 
This is amazing and terrible at the same time 
I actually really enjoy games like that.
I've been recovered for 2 1/2 years. Thanks for asking. 
"China, and that was terrifying. The towers there are completely rusted out and most steel and or equipment get carried by natives through the mountains."
Useless. The new iphones have Jack shit in them
There are. I'll have to go through and upload them. 
With an application.
"Not really, I've been on a tower while it's been struck it hurts like hell for a week then goes away, best thing to do is get on the inside of the tower since most of the tower is grounded.

Also I'll repair anything that goes bad or test poorly. Whether it's replacing it or fixing it on spot depends."
"It either falls in between being on the tower when it took a lighting strike, or having the gate that a carrier was on drop 15 ft while we are dangling from the top."
"To be honest, that sounds about like the only two ways to get a job anywhere. "
