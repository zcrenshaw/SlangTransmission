0,Props to that secretary though.
1,"At least she didn't argue that she needed that specific router to be fixed. 

""Can't you just patch it?"""
2,I would not want to be that boss when he has to have an argument with his mother over nearly shutting the business down.
3,Never be in business with friends or family.
4,What can I say? I had the right tool for the job.
5,"""I'm gonna fax him all this crap until his dumb ass figures out he has the wrong default printer set"""
6,"Nice story, happy ending, you got the money and the yelling was really short. Everybody wins!"
7,Trust me there are in-house IT departments that won't do shit all day and still think they are all god-like. Good on you to start out in a company where they teach you good service skills. You'll probably gonna need that more than tech skills in your career. 
8,This is the most american tech problem i've read so far.
9,At least she didn't try to take a picture of her monitor with a digital camera
10,Usually getting customers pregnant is frowned upon... 
11,"&gt;How dare you make our $80,000 AV system useless, in which I may or may not have the voice at installing them in first place, and may result in an investigation on me !"
12,"Don't forget rule #0: ""Is the device even there?""

Anyways, good job!"
13,Could ya just remote in and power my Google Bing?
14,"&gt; $Boss: Mom, you're fired.  
&gt; $Mom: What!? You can't fire me, I helped set up this business!  
&gt; $Boss: You misunderstand, I'm getting a new mother.  
&gt; $Mom: What?  
&gt; $Boss: $Dad won't put up with your shit anymore and is getting a divorce."
15,"&gt; I can google

You are IT. I Am IT. All I do is google. "
16,"And then print it out, scan it to pdf, and copy/paste it into an email so she can send it to her friends."
17,My apologies in being so specific. I had no idea you know Wesley
18,I am impressed that she took the time to do this.  Kudos to her.
19,"&gt; ""this new generation has no respect for their elders."" 

""this old generation has no respect for the people they demand help from"" "
20,TL;DR The day printserver latency became the least of our problems.
21,"Get it in writing. Print it out, make her sign it, and her boss as well. And make backups. "
22,No fax machine involved? Amateur. 
23,"This is because there is likely a card reader on the printer that just works like a normal USB card reader. So it would show up on your boot list,  especially if there was an SD card in it. I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often lol. I've seen this happen a few times. 

Edit: quick look online shows that printer does have a card reader."
24,"So your colleague was given a disciplinary for monitoring the network like he was supposed to be? Poor guy, is he still employed there?

Also that Director must be doing some shady things. It really speaks volumes when you are that determined to make an example of someone who was just doing their job correctly."
25,"Everyone knows Wesley. Maybe with a different name, voice, face, gender, ethnicity, etc, but every person here has met Wesley. 

Fuckin Wesley. "
26,Talk about passive aggression.
27,"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-are-illegal

I'm patiently waiting til the first major lawsuit happens and OEM collectively crap their pants."
28,"Whats the secretary going to do, call up the boss in another country and tell him hes all fucked up? Asian cultures don't tend to value aggressive confrontation as much as ours. 

Easier and faster just to fax his documents back to him. Less conflict. "
29,"The simple answer - and its a good question... Is $25 an hour. A year ago I was making $85 an hour, and in that sort of gig, your opinion matters.

As far as this job was concerned, they were paying for a 2nd year graduate, and they didn't even consider that my opinion might be valuable. Far easier to 'rail against IT' without having to think of succession plan

Edit - if the $$ were good enough to hang around, it might have gone the 'rehabilitation' route - or sucked it up enough to float. But at a junior rate, I'd rather walk and have a month off"
30,"Good for you for leaving that hostile work place. But can I ask, why just quit? If you knew that you no longer wanted to work for this man due to his poor management style and ineffectiveness as a leader, why not bring this to the attention of his boss? Why not show how you are the 4th technician to be driven away this year and it is solely because this manager is ineffective at his job? Worse case you end up leaving. Best case he gets the boot."
31,"Reminds me of when I had to yell at the cashier at a repair shop I worked at because she kept unplugging an extension cord we kept behind the counter for testing electronics so she could plug in a mini Christmas tree she brought from home to decorate the store. 
Edit: I'm thinking of just making a post about this so look for it tomorrow."
32,Quite. You don't want to mix those relationships with business.
33,"My question is, who puts confidential information in the file folder and name?"
34,"Former L1 tech support, can confirm. 50% google, 30% password reset, 20% turn it off and on. "
35,"I used to work for a company that had the opposite problem. We were paying bills for some things we hadn't used in 10 years just because the comptroller was afraid it was something we might be using after all - even when the people who used to use those services would try to convince him we had long ago switched to something else. Fortunately, none of it was anything that made a huge impact on the bottom line."
36,"Enable it again, but QoS him to 56k speeds - it'll work just enough that things start loading, but won't be anywhere fast enough for video. This'll be much more frustrating."
37,"It's nearly 200 now, which is good because 69 is a terrible position if you're trying to conceive. "
38,"We've had a couple clients drop us as their outsourced IT. All of them were irritating and a nightmare to deal with. Many within a couple months requested to become a client again after dealing with other companies, we usually refuse."
39,"Which is why you get it in writing, print it out, make her sign it, and her boss as well.

It doesn't matter if ""corporate IT"" is the one making the final decision...  after it blows up in her face, she's going to blame you for it.  So, cover your ass."
40,What... what were they using to click the link?
41,"Hey, if you're going to go out, you might as well do it with your balls still attached. Good on you.  
  
In my experience, bullies will continue to bully you until you stand up to them."
42,"Government worker here, fax machines will still be used until the sun expands enough to make earth uninhabitable."
43,"""Since we have you on audio shooting the server, I must regrettably inform you that neither the warranty or SLA cover deliberate damages. Please hold..."""
44,let's all hope $Boss fired his mom
45,Good service skills can help you move up the corporate ladder. What may seem like brown nosing in high school can transform into good interpersonal skills in the workforce. 
46,"My reply would be, can you still walk after I put a quartet of bullet holes through your heart and head."
47,I'll Google your Bing any day
48,"Similar story, although not mine:

&gt;$Tech: \&lt;standard greeting\&gt;, what seems to be the problem?

&gt;$Guy: Yeah, do you fix hard drives?

&gt;$Tech: Depends, what seems to be the problem?

&gt;$Guy: \*pulls hard drive out of pocket\* [Well...I got drunk last night and shot it...](http://i.imgur.com/XOcAjcY.jpg)

&gt;$Tech: [WTF.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/34/3c/38/343c38df0a50c771bd48128b2fee243e.jpg)"

50,"""This isn't the battery dying. This is us having a 1920s Ford Model T. It's max speed is 20MPH and that was when it was new. We're now entering it into an F1 race"" "
51,This is a rare gem for TFTS.  Made my morning.  Thanks OP 
52,"As much as I wanted to call him out, if I said anything to him he'd create a scene and ruin the rest of my brothers birthday. I'm away most of the year and rarely get to see my immediate family so I bit my tongue and disabled his Internet. "
53,Typical Fuckin' Wesley
54,"Not in this case.

Tracking apps like this track things like cervical mucous viscosity, when you had sex, when you started menstruating and when you finished.

The six months of data is statistical data in this case. The more you have, the more likely you can figure out when the woman is ovulating and you have a better chance of becoming pregnant.

Losing that data would mean they would have to start everything over. And it's heartbreaking if you're trying to start a family."
55,"That's what i gathered at least... and to be fair, she said she had never really worked with computers. But i'm just wondering how far she thought technology had come?"
56,Well there are companies that offer fax-to-email and email-to-fax solutions.
57,"I always love when ppl make that ""wut!?"" face to me, when they figure out that the fix was THAT easy "
58,"This is an exchange right out of the first season of arrow. 

""My friend spilled coffee on his laptop, can you recover anything from the hard drive?""  

""This laptop is full of bullet holes""  

""His coffee shop is in a bad part of town"""
59,Flash has to die. If adobe aren't interested in keeping it secure then it must be put down.
60,"Super CEO: I've just terminated CEO, can you do what needs to be done?

You: Sure, BTW, he has set the building on fire, but don't worry, I've restored the building to it's original state, and sent the burned/charred pieces to a separate location for evidence of the activity."
61,HR. They really aren't tech people. :)
62,I think I got [a similiar](https://redd.it/2b147l) tale for you
63,"Well, obviously, now you need to put a bootable operating system on an SD card and stick it in the slot, then try booting from the printer."
64,"No, but perhaps i should add that to my standard questions... Is it plugged in? Did you Reboot? Do you know how paper works?"
65,"it is or tis, not both. tis is an abbreviation of it is."
66,"My boss's final word to any and all (including C-level) employees......

NOTHING gets changed after Wednesday or within 2 days prior to or over a holiday.  If you insist, you WILL be onsite with me until all things are counted as normal.  

Reasoning: Since they insist, they also own it."
67,"*triggered*

Honestly why do people do this? just call the computer **The Computer** and the screen **The Screen** not the Hard drive, not the CPU, heck call the computer **The big box thats under my desk**  When you say your HDD is broken, I think you have data loss, not that Word has frozen.

edit: RIP inbox..."
68,"I wonder how much money was wasted on her little adventure.  Printing personal photos in color, spending the time to do it, opening a support call for training to do it, etc "
69,Probably moved the mouse on top of the paper and started clicking away.
70,"That may work in the industrial tech world, not so much with consumer tech though."
71,Rule #0: Is it plugged in
72,"""Somebody stole my car!""

""But it's right there.""

""No it's not, it's gone!""

""I'm looking right at it!""

""I don't have the keys to drive it so it can't be there!"""
73,"Sysadmin here 50% Google, 30% remembering what Google told me last time, 20% clicking random buttons until it works."
74,Well it's corporate IT that would make the final decision on something like that. Backups are already in place. Main issue is her not knowing what she'd be deleting. Her idea is to simply just delete everything. Regardless of what it is. 
75,"How ya doing there Barry?  
Just great, thanks other Barry!
"
76,"You could just add the office cover letter. No personalized message, just a professional courteousy , and he will get it the first or second time."
77,Did you try reversing the polarity?
78,"""When this town was built, we didn't have any civil engineers to plan the roads, so sometimes there are really big traffic jams for no apparent reason. If we make Main Street go through and widen Central Avenue--""

""No, just nuke it.""

""...What?""

""Just nuke the whole town and we'll start over somewhere else. It'll be easier that way.""

""But...homes! Families! Businesses!""

""The people don't need those things. They can buy RVs and live out of them. Give me the launch codes."""
79,"You'd be amazed at how many households do this too. Magazines they don't use, streaming services they don't use, cable bills at old addresses, the list goes on. You'd think people would have a better grasp on their own cash outflows, but no...."
80,Makes sense. I won't change it though or you'll look crazy.
81,Ok but did you ask her if she had ever worked with *paper*?
82,"&gt; Becky: No, I need to know what the problem was.  
OP: Me Me too, Becky  
  
Comedy gold."
83,"Yup, it's got an SD card reader! The weird thing is that the machine has been running for a year without issues, and we've had the printer on other machines for probably a decade now, and this is the first time it's happened."
84,"In the mid 1990's I worked internal tech support for a electronics chain. If it plugged in and wasn't merchandise, we fixed it. One of my stores had an ex Marine DI as a manager. I had some issues with broken keyboards at this store (the boards in them were known to crack down the middle due to pressure and bad design, but this store had more problems than my others). One day when checking the security cameras, I saw the store manager looking up something on a terminal on the sales floor. Apparently he didn't like the information, since he promptly punched they keyboard. I billed him for that one and reminded him there were cameras watching."
85,"Them: ""OF COURSE it's plugged in, I checked everything before I called you.""

Me: ""Uh-huh. Tell you what, let me 'check a few things', and while I'm doing that can you unplug everything from both sides - wall, back of the computer, etc. - and then plug it all back in?""

Them: ""Oh... this cord wasn't plugged in... ah... yeah, it's working now.  Uh... thanks for the help, bye.""

99 of 100 times."
86,"You should probably start now looking at other places where those stupid metrics aren't used.

That could actually be a good question from you to them during interviews to filter them out."
87,How much easier would tech support be if you could temporarily swap your brain around to the luser?
88,It's crazy that some people have to go through this tedious process to get pregnant while some people do it as a complete accident 
89,I think it is less shady and just situations being badly handled. We believe the place is being sold and obviously they don't want to release that information to staff at this point. Including the IT department that is doing work already for the sale
90,"This is why we don't let our employees have color printers.  On the downside this means that they come scan things on my printer, because, clearly, a printer that can't print in color also can't scan in color.  I work at a software company.  These people are programmers.  *head desk*"
91,i would upvote this comment. but 69. its just too perfect. 
92,Lol we have a remote user who made the company buy an all in one (with a fax machine) so that she could send us her time sheets that you filled out on a computer and were supposed to email it to accounting. I didnt even know people still used fax machines anymore.
93,"&gt;I took off my name badge and threw it on the table.

Oh, if only you'd had time to think of this...

&gt;I said, ""I'm accidentally dropping my name badge,"" and then I chucked it against the wall."
94,Plot twist: Mom is actually his dad.
