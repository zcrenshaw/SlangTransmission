0,"Rule 1: Never help with printers unless you have to.  
Rule 2: Never do it over the phone.  
Rule 3: There is always a cable (except when there isn't), never believe the user's assertion that there isn't a cable.  
Rule 4: Networked printers are broken printers. (except in a controlled enterprise environment)"
1,Sounds like a RAID controller failed.
2,"""Should I get a laptop?"" 

I can't stop laughing."
3,"How do these people spend hundreds of dollars on a brand new phone, not even knowing what they're buying?"
4,Any printer is a 3-D printer if you use enough paper.
5,"&gt;We're going to pass the error log onto the software developer so they can sort it out.

If something gets fixed as a result of this, that'll be the second win of the story."
6,As a guy who has never had to create a thesis: I find it pretty stupid that people don't have at least 2 other backups and/or a cloud upload of their thesis at all times. 
7,"I had direct orders to help her with the printer. 

She lives 500 miles away, so phone was only option. 

She insisted there was no cable (also she called everything a 'USB Cable')

Networking was the only option, given the information I had. "
8,Well targeted advertising and clueless customers

11,"&gt; After reassembling it, the computer worked great for years after.

It survived all that and still works?"
12,"I hear you pretty well.. I didn't tell the story just because I couldn't find a subreddit that fits.

I'm working on a GIS project, the frigging project manager - don't you have a project to manage instead of meddle in coding, dude? - decides to ""fix"" a few of the add-ins I wrote for arcmap - a GIS software while I was on paid leave. Result? The add-in now doesn't bother to form relationships in two weeks' worth of data. There simply isn't a way to fix, the whole crew - 30+ operators - will have to delete what they did and redo.

Furthermore, he decides I could take the fall and calls the frigging CEO to a meeting, to explain 300+ manhours of productivity loss with me writing faulty code. Today's Sunday, we met last Friday. The moment he opened his mouth to say it was my fault, the GIS crew leader and the project co-manager chewed him out without me needing to say a single word.

We're hiring for a competent project manager, by the way."
13,"I would have told her the approximate cost to launch a satellite into orbit to track the plane and beam ""the Internet"" to it would be roughly in the ball park of 2&gt;5 billion dollars. If she would like, you would get the ball rolling and start calling around getting approximate costs. That or she could spend the $50 on WiFi. Telling people the price of crazy usually makes them reconsider"
14,Was it the Tree Decimator 3000?
15,"Nope, it's been coded only for Dell desktops and Samsung tablets. You're out of luck."
16,"""No, you should get an Etch-a-Sketch.  Heeeeere's your sign."""
17,Probably saved her life. Good job!
18,"Springfield XD has a grip and trigger safety that both must be depressed at the same time to fire the gun- unless you're squeezing the trigger while pressing on the backstrap, no bang. Either way, safety is something you do, not a switch on a gun- mechanical safeties are defined as ""devices that will fail at the worst possible moment"". "
19,"Stalker is a bit harsh here, she sounds awkward and lonely and nice. "
20,What the actual hell?
21,If something is going to take me more than 30 mins to rewrite then its gets seperate physical and a cloud backups.

26,Ba dum tish. 
27,"I had one simple fix a while back that I was surprised to see fixed. A company sent out my username and password in plaintext on an email and when I clicked the link, it had my username and password in the url. I don't know enough, but I figured that it wasn't as safe as it could be, so I told them about it. A few months later, a colleague had to sign up to that same company and got a more secure version of obtaining your password."
28,it's pretty easy to bend a cable into a U shape so I don't know why you won't solve my problem
29,"To a bug, the warm nooks and crannies of a desktop PC (or gaming console) are heaven"
30,I remember that we had a website for my team in high school that was registered to a guy who had since graduated. It was a massive pain to sort out.
31,"You are very lucky they didn't take his word, and you had backup from co-workers, because typically people like this will blame whoever they can, and  unfortunately, a lot of the time it works. 

This weekend I learned that the guy I replaced said that my backup system was far too complex. Although it was just RAID1 and Acronis. The fact that he didnt bother to fix up anything simpler, made his opinion worthless anyway. 

It's a horrible feeling when someone messes with your project and completely fubars it."

34,"Step 1 of remote hardware troubleshooting.   
  

Ask if they mind starting a Skype, FaceTime, etc video chat on their phone. 

Then you can ask stuff like, ""Ok now go into the server room and show me the blinking lights, up, up, across, no the other way, down, down, show me the back of that big black box on the floor, ok do you see that power cord, can you plug it back in, no not there, on the back, no the other back, yep, yep, no, try to turn it around, ok, there we go, lights. We should be good in a few minutes. ""

I have stepped people through all kinds of remote hardware issues using Skype and a phone. It is the physical support version of teamviewer or logmein.

35,"There's actually a 3D printer out there which creates models by printing on, slicing, and stacking layers of standard letter paper. I forget what it's called offhand, though. "
36,A customer who buys a product without knowing its name is far more likely to have been pushed by a very incentivized salesperson at a carrier's store than an ad.
37,"Disclaimer: OP's customer is a moron. I have my opinions on where it should be, but leaving a loaded gun out in the open with no positive control (holster on person, safe, etc.) is just asking for trouble.

Now, as for ""putting a mag in the gun without putting a cartridge in the chamber,"" that's movie advice. These guns are designed to be carried with a cartridge in the chamber. Racking the slide is not something you want to do in a defensive situation (which is probably the only reason this person leaves a gun right there, out in the open). There are many different methods to safety, e.g. manual safety, pre-cocked striker (Glock-style), decocker, along with ancilliary trigger, grip, etc. safeties. It's up to you what you prefer, but the main thing is not touching the trigger unless you intend to fire the weapon. Holsters cover up the trigger so nothing gets in the trigger guard.

Last, but not least, guns **do not just ""go off""**. The closest you will come is somebody's modified single-stage trigger that trips at the slightest tap. Nobody's production service weapon should have a trigger lighter than a few pounds. (Now, I guess that means you can't trust Billy Bob's random gun, so use caution and keep it pointed in a safe direction if you insist on picking it up...or insist they move it and run like hell if they can't handle it safely.)"
38,A satellite to track a single plane would be quite tricky - it would need to be able to make constant fairly major course corrections and avoid other satellites.  Much simpler to launch a whole geosynchronous network.
39,I'm starting to think that people from HR have literally no brains.
40,"Find me a U cable and I'll agree to this assertion. But in USB the U describes the SB, not the cable."
