13,"I worked for an ISP a few years ago and there was a major fiber cut that took out the Internet for most of Boston, including Logan Airport.  We didn't own the fiber but if you know how ISPs peer with each other you'll understand why such a major fiber cut is bad news. In fact, it was such a large outage it made it onto the news.

Well,  we had a customer call in (I worked in the NOC at the time) and demand that we prioritize his repairs.  I tried explaining to him that this was beyond our control and that the owner of the fiber line is working to repair the problem and that even the airport is affected.  He was having none of that.  People just don't listen sometimes."

23,"Surely the account ""smb"" already existed and would have kicked back an error upon creation? I dont understand how this was the fault of the guy creating accounts. I mean, if he tried to create Richard Oot as ""root"", the server would throw a fit. If the account didn't already exist, how did it end up in Groups? It sounds like your server guys didn't properly secure their servers."
24,"It's like if a major bridge is out and everyone who is stuck in traffic on the side streets wants the police to clear out the side streets so they can go to work, when in reality EVERY SINGLE PERSON who needed to use that bridge is now stuck in traffic.  No, the city can't fix your crowded side street, and the police can only do so much rerouting to fix the issue.  EVERYONE is going to be slow until the bridge is fixed.

I- Is there even a Linux version of ME? Google tells me that [there is... of sorts](http://www.gamersonlinux.com/forum/threads/mass-effect-guide.182) (WINE is not emulation, but it's not exactly like this version of ME was made with Linux in mind). That said, just because something runs on the 32-bit kernel, it's no guarantee that the ARM kernel will be so kind... [As, it seems, someone has already found out.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=122573&amp;f=91)

Maybe, as OP's title suggests, it just needs more RAM... ^(and a complete kernel change.)"
42,If only there was some kind of governmental agency to properly regulate that kind of fuckery.
43,So...where is the South Dakota of the UK? Australia?
44,"Alternatively, she was brand new, hence being sent a copy of the company mission statement, probably some orientation material.  If computer skills were a job requirement and a new hire didn't know the difference between a pdf and a mp4, or more generally a document and a video, then letting them go was probably the right thing to do."
45,"The correct analogy according to OP, would be that because the bridge, you can no longer use any of the other 50 bridges either... If it refers to the outage in 2009, Comcast paid billions in compensation because they refused to allow any rerouting and had the network simply drop the connections that were supposed to have gone over the link, instead of routing it to the other paths and tried defending doing that, because the other paths would have cost more."

48,"&gt; around the turn of the century

Kind of gives them a little wiggle room. This was pre-Google so having all of industry's best practices at your finger tips wasn't quite as common as it is today. Not that they didn't have an obligation then to do the best they could, but I'm just saying...they probably deserve a little slack."

50,"The problem isn't an already existing user, it's an already existing group. By default useradd will create a group with the same name as the user you're trying to create, I suppose useradd didn't warn that the group already existed and just added the new account to it."
51,"And this one learned something new, thanked the person who told her, and incorporated it into her work. Around here, that's pure gold. "
52,"Poor lady. I don't understand why it takes so long for some people to ask for help. Everyone should have a certain self-reliance, but asking for help is logical because it allows you to avoid the mistakes made when learning."

54,"My mom organizes flea markets for a charity (mostly clothing &amp; toys that children have grown out of but are still in good enough condition). People get to clear out their attics without having to do any of the work, and the charity keeps a modest sum for its other projects. The workers (my mom included) are all volunteers.

One year she had to cancel the event because my grandmother died and my mom had to take care of the funeral etc (not to mention y'know, grieving). Most people were very understanding, but this one lady called and wanted to register her stuff for sale. When told that the event was cancelled because of a death in the family, she said ""Well that's very inconvenient!"" before hanging up.

Yeah sorry, we'll tell Granny to kick it at a more convenient time next time. Of all the inconsiderate, self-centered things people can say... ugh."

69,"I've worked in call centers for about 8 years now. OP, you fucked up when you told them you were new. Every call center I've ever worked in has banned those words (""I'm new"") for a good reason. As soon as your caller knows you're new, they lose all faith in your ability to solve their problem. If you're ever asked how long you've been with the company or working in a given industry, just say ""a while"". "
