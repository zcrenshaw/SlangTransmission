And they're boned."
1,"""I'd like you to die so I can watch TV""

&gt; User: Leg disabled.

3,"Anyone who's ever had a long, ongoing problem that a telco refuses to take any responsibility for will tell you- if you showed up on time, went looking for problems, took ownership of any you found and fixed them, and still stayed until the reason you originally came was complete- you might as well be Jesus because what you've given them is essentially a salvation.  "
4,"&gt;I calculated where I was on hours worked vs. hours paid, taking into account the initial front money. It was good, so I kept working.

You have no idea how happy I was to read this. So many stories are some variation on ""so I kept working even though I wasn't getting paid, and then things went to hell and I was out of pocket""."
5,everyone has a test environment some are just lucky enough to have a production environment too XD
6,So the Whole thing boils down to a lowly serf dared to have self respect against the noble class.
7,"&gt;We do not require any education in IT to apply (some of our best tech supports are just high school or college graduates), we give new applicants a test and base our decision mostly on that.

There needs to be more employers like this in the world. I mean fuck, I see so many people getting IT degrees just to work at jobs that barely pay well enough to keep their lights on."
8,"Test environments exist for a reason, harsh way to learn it."
9,"&gt;judged it to be ""bloody hot""

Hey man, not all of us are IT guys here, you gotta tone it down with the technical jargon!"
10,Am I the only one who was hoping there was going to be a drug lord coming into the 21st century using shipping software for their products?
11,"yay, new Patches story

EDIT: wow, this is my highest rated comment, and its probably one of my least profound comments"
12,"Also

&gt;  When I hit the one week mark (the amount of the initial advance), I keep working but I stop uploading the source code.

He was even willing to give him a second chance."
13,This sub needs a bot that summarizes every post in one line just like this. 
14,"&gt; When I reached the end of the paid hours, I stopped working, and stopped uploading.

This is the part that impressed me the most. So many people would just keep working and hope they could argue the money out of the employer."
15,"Yeah a couple of months ago, I got a ticket that just said, ""I'm disabled."" I was sitting there thinking *That's not really an IT issue...*

EDIT: Dug up the ticket. [Here's a screenshot of the email.](http://i.imgur.com/UQoFfd4.jpg)"
16,"Minicomputer. Nice.

And I have to wonder if debugging via university students was common in the day, or this was an oddity."
17,"Do a loss of management productivity estimate, add the cost of workaround #2 (new scanner) and send to your department head. "
18,"SIR, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A HOT PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP! ^^^r/me_irl  
  
"
19,I guess this was inevitable.
20,Ken Boned. 
21,"Yeah... Not America. No districts, no superintendents.

And I'm afraid to say this was not the worse that $principal ever did. 

But he did end up getting banned for life from the island we were on. That count?"
22,They should make PCs that can spit coffee out of the USB or headphone port
23,"Not sure why you said phones don't come with instructions because they typically do. If it isn't a physical copy, there is a digital copy somewhere on the phone itself typically under settings - help. If it's digital then there's usually some piece of paper that details where it is digitally."
24,"no no no you need to talk to the superintendent $principal boss.
because what he did is blatantly illegal
he tried to order you into hazrdous life threatening conditions with no hazard pay no chance at fixing it, for a non work related reason, at a minimum hes lookin at abuse of his position and misuse of district property,
i hope to high hell you managed to get him fired for it."
25,"That computer must be a Mac. It's not very...**PC**

Sorry I'll see myself out."
26,"I got called into one of those once for some shit that I'd said that had managed to make it's way up to someone who cared, but not someone who was as high up as my boss.

Turned out the highest person in the meeting was also a person who had been sending me increasingly incensed emails about a side project I was working on which had been dragging out for several days (which was about 50% me being that overworked and about 50% me being so burned out that everything was behind.) She didn't know this...I was the last man standing in a coder group, so the ticket was assigned to the group, and I was responding as the group.

So her schmucky flunky starts going off on some crap, and I absolutely was rude to said flunky because she wouldn't stop wasting my time with some bullshit to do with a bad software purchase they'd made without seeing if it was compatible...Amazingly not my problem, buy a different package, fuck off, and stop wasting my time. Thus the meeting.

So she's going off about whatever it was I said, and I'm spacing out, and her boss asks me to ""explain myself.""

I said, ""Look, there is a list of supported software. This isn't on it. I can't write an interface for it. I'm too busy with crap for (corporate finance).""

Bigwig says, ""I'm **in** (corporate finance).""

I said, ""Do you know (Finance VP who keeps sending me nasty emails)?""

She said, ""I *am* (Finance VP who keeps sending nasty emails)!""

I said, ""Oh, good. I am the entire (critical support team) trying to fix your (critical issue). Your subordinate has wasted a huge amount of my time this week because she didn't bother to read the software purchasing guidelines.""

Silence. Finally (Finance VP) says, ""Who is your manager?""

I said, ""(Super Mega VP CIO East Coast).""

She says, ""No, your *direct* manager.""

I said, ""(Super Mega VP CIO East Coast). Everyone between me and him has been laid off, so I report to him directly. Feel free to call him.""

So couple days later, I get an email from my boss. Close all work for that group. We don't support that anymore. Cool. Now I'm only absurdly overloaded.

The very next day, I get the *same fucking ticket* assigned to a different group I'm also a member of...Basically the same group, but for the Northeast region instead of the Southeast region...And I'm the only dumbass in *that* group too. Send it to my boss, same response. Close the group.

Next day, same ticket. Forwarded from corporate help desk to my actual group, but with a pathetic priority...Literally 100+ items down in my queue which is so low I can't even pretend it'll ever get done. I immediately forget about it.

A week later my phone rings, I pick it up, it's (Financial VP) bitching about how no one's doing her ticket. I say, ""Look, it's way down in my queue. If you need the priority bumped, you need to talk to my boss (Super Mega VP CIO East Coast).""

She laughs bitterly, ""Seems like he's *everyone's* boss.""

I say, ""No. I'm the same guy."" 

Silence. 

""There used to be about ten guys and gals who did this sort of thing, and I'm the lucky one who didn't get laid off when the bottom dropped out. I still have ten people's worth of work though, so it's going to take me a while to get to your ticket."" 

Silence.  

I say, ""I can forward it to (group that probably can't help you)?""

Frostily, she says, ""Please *do*.""

Two weeks later it's back in my queue. Three of the four people who transferred it mentioned me by name in the work notes. The other guy mentioned the two groups that I was the only member of.

She calls me back, ""Look, what's it going to take to get this done.""

I said, ""You gotta call my boss.""

She says, ""I already have. Look, you were working on it before!""

I said, ""Well, yea, but I wasn't supposed to. I'm only supposed to do (big horrible finance consolidation thing). I was just doing your thing because I felt like I needed an easy win. For *morale*.""

Silence, the silence of a soul who now knows they are never going to get what they want.

Spoiler alert: that ticket was still in my queue a year later when I quit. Higher priority stuff kept landing on top of it. It was probably pointless anyway."
27,"&gt; Unfortunately for him, he didn't realise my position in the company and is no longer working with us.

Ahhh, sweet sweet catharsis."
28,"He saved them from shitty internet and cable, that's doing God's work, he might as well be Jesus"
29,We regularly have customers asking why their servers / NAS don't turn on automatically after a power-outage. This is the scenario we tell them as a reason...
30,"Helldesk: How did it happen?
User: ...acid."
31,That'd be an impressive AI project.
32,"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is a period of civil war.

33,"Reminds me of a lovely incident several years ago, when I had asked for a not entirely trivial purchase of extra hardware in a large bureaucratic organisation. For whatever reason, the meeting that was called to discuss this had about 18 or 20 staff, including several seniors. After they had discussed my proposal for **two hours**, I plucked up my courage and said:

&gt; Excuse me for interrupting, but could I have your attention for a moment, please? I've just been doing some calculations, and so far this meeting has cost nearly 20% of the investment I am asking for.

I got approval about a minute later.
"
34,Not all my stories fall under TFTS.  /r/patches765 covers a lot more topics.
35,"&gt; Helldesk: Sorry, you're not what?


&gt; User: Disabled.  

The fact that we are having this conversation contradicts your assertion."
36,Getting FBI boned is like the polar opposite of getting Ken Boned.
37,"Oh, I've been doing this eight years or so. I told her we'd have to order it in, and that the earliest it might make it here is Thursday. 

Sadly, I'm extremely adept in providing alternative facts to customers. I maintain the repair technician's daily prayer is ""Dear Lord please don't hold me responsible for the lies I have to tell idiots. Amen."" "
38,It's silly that PCs have coffee cup holders but no coffee maker 
39,"This is the weirdest thing to me, I've had one payroll fuckup from one company and another that was under the table before and in the later case twice the guy tried to not pay/under pay me. When I quit ex coworkers would ask why I left. It's baffling how people don't understand the employer/employee relationship. I do ______ you pay me I'm not here for fun or for free and I don't care if you can't manage your finances well enough to pay your employees properly"
40,"I had someone like this too, there was something wrong with his brain. Otherwise a fast learner and in some areas a genius, but like this character 'Drax' in Guardians of the Galaxy, he took most of the things we said way too serious, and he was unable to get irony or sarcasm while talking, only later when he had time to think about it. Being a hospital and such, we made the effort to teach the rest of the users about his disadvantages (don't know if this is the proper word), so after some time our users got used to getting the ugly naked truth from him. The 8 months he was with us were the best, you just had to listen to his calls if you were in a bad mood:  

&amp;nbsp;

""Yeah, this is the same error as the last 8 times you called us. Yes, this happens if you click the wrong butto... no, this does not happen on itse... yes ma'am, I understand, it IS interrupting your work, but if you don't click X the next time, your work won't get interrupted and you won't have to call us for the tenth time in a day. Thank you ma'am, have a nice day too!""

&amp;nbsp;

Glorious days."
41,"TL;DR, Jesus raises clear connections from the dead. "
42,How does that school function? It's sounds like you actually need the internet to get legal stuff done but at the speeds you'd be able to get with that type of speed means that it'd almost be faster to mail people.
43,"And if the bot malfunction, we have plenty people that can fix him, right guys?

^^Guys?"
44,"Way downgraded story but my manager when I worked in an electronics store called and ordered me to drive the 20 miles in on ice. I told him to hang on (18 at the time with my dads car), asked my dad if I could drive to work, he laughed. I laughed. Told my manager I'm not making it in.  
Told him on the phone I'm not risking my car or well being in this weather for 8 an hour when the store will probably be almost empty my entire shift anyways.  
I ended up getting respect from him when I came back. No write up. "
45,"How dare you not lick managements boots? Its not enough that they get paid more money in a year than you will ever see in one place, they have to *feel* like they own you."
46,"That was the first and only time I've spoken to the FBI about work-related stuff. Hope I never will again. It was unnerving. Especially on a Saturday morning, being woken from a sound sleep. 

...btw, the agent sounded just like they do on TV. "
47,"This is why I think **any** power supply should have a control light, to signal that it has power. Many laptop power supplies don't."
48,"&gt; $FBI: Yes, but $BM got some advice from you at the time? He says you can confirm the incident.

Sounds like $BM was hoping OP would back him up, which is why he pointed the FBI OP's way."
49,"To be honest, until ""Gets paid well"" I was afraid this was going to end (especially after the friend doing photos) with the guy trying to stiff you after all the work. At least it was working in the end, despite all the issues. :)"
50,"I work in computer operations.  Getting someone with experience is often hit or miss.  It's weird.  You get people that left there last job cause they were burned out - and where still burned out, you get people that were too good for computer ops - but never sucessfully leave the department.

But... give me someone with a background in a warehouse.  Give me that guy any day.  I have had terrific luck with these people.  "
51,"&gt; These are executives and even the CEO, so let's say the average hourly rate is *$25*.

Oh dear."
52,So the guy didn't even care you almost died. Tbh it was really smart to ssh the fire alarm
53,Don't mention it was there the whole time. Only say that you now have the part. Also don't compromise on the wait time. She can go in the queue like everyone else.
54,"I hope that there was a notation made on the account about the customer being abusive and swearing at you and your rep over her own screwup...  
Having said that, nicely handled. I especially like the calling of her bluff at the end."
55,"IT joking in the workplace? No, never.

We are mindless robots afterall :)"
56,"... The title?

Honestly, its a better title than I could ever come up with."
57,"Oh, that's beautiful.

73 emails. Let's say there's 100 managers and executives. Let's say each one spent 5 minutes reading each email.

73 * 100 * 5 / 60 = 608 hours.

These are executives and even the CEO, so let's say the average hourly rate is $25.

The email chain has cost $15,000 and *it's not over*. There's still the Monday morning meeting and fallout.

I don't think this is the way non-IT management intended to prove their point, but they're right - you shouldn't use workarounds because *they* can't cope."
58,"At what point were you expected to lie?

The cost of the operating systems would be minuscule compared to the cost in losing the system that 1. He paid you to build, and 2. Contains company data."
59,"fairly common.

Still is."
60,"9 times out of 10 when people say ""IT are being unhelpful"" what they actually mean is ""IT won't bail me out of this mess I made for myself"". "
61,"Federal government requires you use the web. 

School has spotty satellite at the best of times, no cell reception, and would require laying cable across a sea to get anything else. 

The government isn't quite in touch with ""remote"". "
62,"IT: ""Citrix cannot see it.""

HoF: ""What about carrier pigeon?"""
63,Yeah... thats where I initially thought this was going.
64,"Pretty much this. There is no point in turning it on again until whatever shut it down is fixed.  
Worst case is probably that it works again without anyone noticing that there was a problem in the first place and then crashing during something important"
65,"Warehouse, restaurant, and low level FoH (reception, customer service, etc) always work way harder and complain less than *anyone* I worked with in offices, corps, etc.

Once they realize you're going to treat them better an pay them more? They'll do anything for you."
66,No... No... It was young and stupid. Scaring a bunch of animals who are deciding whether or not to eat you? Got a 50/50 chance of coming out of that one.
67,"Who thinks like this? ""It may be crushed enough to fit in a cup, but hey, I didn't lose it!"". Entitled people need to get retail jobs."
68,Respect might require a higher IQ than $principal may have possessed. Like actually understanding there was danger in his suggestion. 
69,There's a bot that does a good job of reducing news articles by about 70%.  With a few changes to its settings we might be able to do it.
70,"several years ago i started a new job and when the first payday rolled around my direct deposit never hit my bank account. told my manager and he said he would look into it. fast forward a week and nothing. i went back to my manager and he told me i'd have to work it out with my bank. i looked at him like ""wtmf?"" and called my bank. they told me they couldn't find any problems so i told my manager the problem had to be on payrolls end. he stressed that payroll said the money was going out so it had to be on my banks end but he'd have them look into it again.

next payday rolls around and no direct deposit. i walk into my managers office, sit down and tell him either we get it fixed today or i won't be coming in until it's fixed. he acted as if i was being unreasonable because ""it's not like you're not going to get paid!"" i had to set up a conference call with my manager, my bank, and payroll to find out that payroll (even after resubmitting my banking info) had transposed the last two numbers in my bank account.

luckily i was in a position that a month gap in pay wasn't going to bankrupt me but i was gobsmacked at my managers attitude that i was going to get the money owed at SOME point so i should just keep working until then. nah. that's not how this works. that's not how any of this works."
71,And that folks is why anyone bar the people who **REALLY** know what they're doing should not have admin privileges.
72,"You've written this well enough that even most non tech users could grasp what's happening, but it would help if you went in edit and put space-space- Enter after each dialog line. Phones suck because they always want to put a period for two spaces.."
73,"&gt; *Critically* important we have ABC! 

That kind of talk lands on my desk all the time. My boss adopted an interesting response. 

If you give us enough warning, no problem. 

If not, here's a 300 page form for emergency delivery. No exceptions. "
74,You won't see someone *this* fucked again until at least next Fucktember or Fuckuary.
75,"My grandmother was the first in the family to get a smartphone. Real boundary-pusher, too: she got a Lumia 920 as her first mobile device.

She couldn't read the small manual so she took it to kinkos, who had it blown up to letter size and she read the hell out of it. Every nook and cranny was explored. She knew that phone like the back of her hand.

She loved the phone to death. literally, three years later I handed it down to my father who still uses it; his biggest complaint has come from a shorter battery life as the lipo degrades.
"
76,"Customer is happy the fix was in, and you even did all sorts of amazing diagnostics! Boss is happy because you made the company 2 hours of support money! You are happy because you make customer and boss happy and make the company money and thus are in line for a raise."
77,"&gt;about work-related stuff

So... how many other times? lol"
78,"The next time sales fail to land a big account, send them an email saying ""you should have tried harder""."
79,"they call it ""open beta"", lol"
80,"This story, for a reason that currently eludes me, made me remember a story my mother used to tell, about a rather clunky &amp; noisy counting machine she had the dubious pleasure of using, back when they had those things. 


The way it works, way kinda like how Turing's machine worked, if I may direct your attention to the recent film, except instead of rotating knobs, it had rising and falling bars, as it did its calculations.


One day that machine stopped working, and it took an entire team of engineers a whole day to fix it. Turns out one of the moving pillars of calculation severed a cable."
81,Nice tale of leaving the world a better place instead of just whining about users :)
