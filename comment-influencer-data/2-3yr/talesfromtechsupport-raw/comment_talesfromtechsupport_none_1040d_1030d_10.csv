0,Oh and I just found out that the student has been reprimanded for abusing the emergency line and using the printing facilities for personal use. Win!
1,"If you have a more competent and productive tech, you bill more for their time rather than have them pad their hours.  In the end it's still cheaper for the client than getting the incompetent tech."
2,"Who decided the policy of no personal prints when they charge for the prints?

At my uni I can print whatever I want as long as I have a positive prepaid balance. Also it's impossible for students to even get a negative balance. For every page, the printer checks it in a central database.

Ninja edit: staff can get a negative balance (which they don't really have to pay ever) and for them there's a no personal stuff policy."
3,"You know, IT people are sometimes prone to the imposter syndrome. Where we think we aren't as good as other people assume, or that we need to be. Almost all of us are guilty of this, including me. However, even at the darkest depths of my depravity...long before I hated even a single user, and would still willingly touch a printer...I never wondered how to make a capital number."
4,"With Excel involved I always expect a story similar to what my co-workers do, pull out a calculator to add up cells... I guess your colleague found another way of counting up cells by not using Excel.

EDIT: I also really like the mindset of ""let me do it my way"", especially if it's wrapped up in a ""I always do it this way"", as if seniority (of a way of doing something) is somehow relevant for efficiency."
5,"You've just become techsupport, regardless of your actual job.  I believe the relevant quote for this is from the English translation of Dante's work *The Divine Comedy:*

&gt; ***All hope abandon ye who enter here.***"
6,Did you look at the target for the shortcut to tell you where the video was?
7,"&gt; Talked with $Bossman and asked him how he'd bill 4 hours for that? 

Well he'd have billed 4 hours for that because he'd be screwing with cables and drivers and turning it off and back on again for 3 hours, 58 minutes and then 1 minute removing the plastic over the print nozzle and doing a test print. "
8,"Towards the end they started sending me on ""prebilled"" calls, where they'd have a flat fee for a service. I had suggested this early on, as the value would be the same to the end customer, if not worth more. I'd rather have a tech charge me $300 and be done in a hour than $100 an hour for 3 hours of waiting for him to fix it. "
9,He is the reason we can't have nice things.
10,"Netflix is important, just like Fakebook. Methinks it is time to remote into the network and do a little management on that port of the switch, and perhaps a little DNS redirection. Redirection to the work intranet should do fine, and there can be absolutely no reason to change it again."
11,"Should've been: 

&gt;SP: I dont know... Can you go down to local computer store and get it for me?

&gt;DegenSHT: ~~I´m afraid I´m quite busy today, but I might be able to get it later. I cant guarantee it though.~~ No."
12,"That right there is a duh moment. I wouldn't have thought of that, but I've honestly never dealt with this shortcut issue."
13,In the US we consider universal printcare to be socialism.
14,He is the reason somebody has nice things.

17,"Man, reading this was like starting your car and finding out you're out of pretzels. "
18,He wasn't that type. Now $TypeA would have been all over that. 
19,"I redirect Netflix and Facebook to http://www.sanger.dk at many of my client sites. Whenever someone in a cube lets out a startled ""what the fuck?"" I know someone isn't working. "
20,"It's not like you need a straight out no, which could be construed as being unnecessarily rude. There are plenty of legitimate excuses:

&gt; * We're only allowed to order from approved suppliers. If you provide your own, we don't care where it comes from

&gt; * If I buy it, I can't claim it back because it's not my expense. 

&gt; * We're not allowed to leave the office when we're working

&gt; * What the fuck am I, your *small thing* fetching bitch?"
21,"Very good.  In the mechanical world there is a book that sets out how many hours you bill for a job.  Get it done faster?  Bully for you, you can take more jobs and get more money.  Takes longer?  Too bad.  

No one likes dealing with a situation where they don't know what their bill is gonna look like once they're done.  "
22,"&gt; as if seniority (of a way of doing something) is somehow relevant for efficiency.

There's always the question of a learning curve, and whether the time it takes to learn how to do something a new way will actually be repaid by the time you save with it later. But some users shock me with their appraisal of this math; if you use computers *for many hours every day at work*, how can it be time-effective to remain ""NOT A COMPUTER PERSON""? Do they ride home on a bus driven by ""NOT A CAR PERSON""?"
23,"*blink*

EVERY shortcut is to an individual file.

Those to a drive?  Actually shortcut to the root directory of said drive.

Everything else is to a file; be it a directory file, a video file, an executable file (and some ought to be drug out back and executed IMO!), etc.

26,"I was actually thinking about this the other day.

There are many people that work on a computer, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, that barely understand the machine they are attempting to operate. And somehow, this is considered acceptable by employers.

Could you imagine this type of situation with any other type of job?

Let's pretend you're the owner or whatever of some truck driving company. One day you find out one of your drivers doesn't know how to use the windshield wipers.

&gt;You: Well then what do you do when it rains?

&gt;Driver: Well I can't see with all the rain drops, so I just pull over until the rain stops.

&gt;You: You stop driving for *hours*, waiting for the weather to clear up?!

&gt;Driver: Oh don't worry, I leave the truck running and put the heater on so I don't get cold.

Now this is the time that most people would black out for a few hours, before waking up, covered in blood, in a jail cell. But the bosses of office workers would think it's a clever work around or something."
27,"My favorite line to end an argument with an End User was ""Do you take your keys to McDonald's, slam them on the table, and demand they fix your car?""  there's typically a long pause.. then they quietly say no.  ""Then why are you still talking with me?"""
28,"Should have told him how to do it tbh. 
"
29,"&gt; No one likes dealing with a situation where they don't know what their bill is gonna look like once they're done. 

Yet the US healthcare system thinks this is totally ok."
30,"Companies run by people like that eventually enter a death spiral.

Customers leave because they're paying so much. They figure out they're being screwed or they can't afford the service or they just find someone cheaper. Then the company has trouble paying the bills so they have to charge the customers they do have more. Which drives more customers away  which leads to more overcharging ..."
31,It's a pug licking the screen
32,"This presents an interesting question; is your son already as intelligent as the average user, or is the average user only as intelligent as an eight-year-old?"
33,"I'd guess it's a CYA policy of some sort that isn't really enforced unless there's an issue like this.

Like, the school gets a deal on toner and printers and the fine print says ""printers are for educational use only"" or perhaps there's a line in the usage document for students that says equipment is for educational use only.

In the long run, no one cares and the definition would probably be stretched to include stuff like printing resumes and such. If the students are paid up, I doubt any bored work-study lab monitor really cares what is being printed... as long as they let the work study monitor study/sleep/play Warcraft/whatever.

Then again, the college I attended and later worked at caught a couple students in an Art/Communications program making fake IDs on the *really* nice printer. The really nice printer that used a roll with a 'page' of each CMYK color for each print, and the roll could be opened up leaving negatives of each print."
34,"Sadly we've all been there. But I learned. And everyone learned. And every other tech will learn, what the meaning of this one question truly is.

36,"Just to tack on to that, 2K DCP's are usually wayyyyyyyy more than 30GB. 1920x1080 Pro Res 4444 deliverables for a feature film usually run around 120GB. "
37,"The overwhelming majority of problems here are caused by user stupidity.  Right now I can't stop laughing my ass off about this.  Techs don't know where a printer is so they just print blank pages until someone calls them?  Well, it works but could be an HR action."
38,"&gt; He is the reason somebody has **his** nice things.

FTFY"
39,Users typically have no idea what they are talking about and they will always argue with people who do. It's best to just nod and smile. 
40,"I dealt with my imposter syndrome by becoming a conman. I am tricking everyone that I am an engineer and that I can code, I go to work and pretend to make good code. Hah! The fools, I have them all tricked!"
41,"Recently a coworker wanted to get some summary stats (sums, averages, etc.) from a CSV dataset that was about 170mb. It was well beyond Excel's limits to open the whole thing.

I offered to help him write a little program to get those stats for him. This person is a trained economist from Yale--an intelligent, educated person who could definitely learn the necessary code quickly and easily. His mother is actually a programmer at a ""unicorn"" company, so it's not like he's never been exposed to it. But he absolutely refused to learn even a little bit of programming. In some bizarre act of self-flagellation, he was determined to do this with Excel.

So I left him be while he tried to copy and paste tens of thousands of lines from Notepad into different Excel notebooks, thus getting around row limits. What would've taken him 5 minutes in R or python took him the rest of the day, and some of his weekend.

If there's one thing that makes me lose respect for a person, it's an outright refusal to learn new things that will help you in big ways."
42,"Wait, I'm confused.

Can't she just sync it or log in to the same account? It shouldn't take more than a few minutes."
43,"Wait, what?! There are actually insurance policies that cover this huge pile of steaming shitfuck?

Best. Insurance. Policy. Ever.

And yeah, those old WRT54G's just don't die."
44,"Yup. And after some confirmation from higher ups I gave him a bit of a verbal spanking with a dose of fear mongering, too, for his own good."
45,At least he didn't lose any data...
46,"Sounds like it's a uni. If the student doesn't pay it, they probably either can't register for next semester until it's paid or will have it added to the amount owed for next semester. Most likely the former. "
47,"&gt; I didn't think people got much stupider than ""Hello there, I'm gonna blatantly ask you to help me commit insurance fraud, on this here recorded phone line, after confirming my identity in multiple ways,""

Hey, what's a little insurance fraud between complete strangers?"
48,"SIR, I TOLD YOU I AM NOT A CLOCK PERSON!"
49,"I also had somebody who decided to go hunting right before their flight, ""bagged a big one,"" and missed the flight to clean and butcher it. Could not understand why we weren't going to be reimbursing their ticket. Got offended when told to call the airline. Repeatedly asked what they pay us for. "
50,"Reminds me of the Key and Peele sketch where they are planning to rob a bank.  The plan is to interview and convince the bank that they are going to be good employees, and then every two weeks, the bank will just hand them over a bit of their money.  As long as they keep under the radar and do a good job, nobody will ever notice the bank is just giving them their money. Easiest bank robbery in the world, just takes a lot longer."
51,"That wasn't a technophobe. That was a guy who just didn't understand why something didn't work. It sounds like he still understood that technology is an OK thing, he just wasn't very good at it.

A technophobe actively avoids doing any work on tech, is unwilling to learn new practices or standards, and will sometimes go so far as to sabotage tech to prove their point. "

65,"We got a similar lecture when I was working in the Tech Shop of a small retail computer chain.  We sold a Virus Check and Removal service for (at the time $59.99, it has since gone up).  The guys that worked in the shop at the time had come up with a string of services we would run to get a user's system as clean as possible without having to wipe and restore, and it worked rather well.  It took all day, but a majority of the time it was on auto-pilot while the system was being scanned, allowing us to focus on more ""tech involved"" type operations.

Well, our shop was one of the top performing of the chain, both in income and customer sat surveys, so corporate came down to see us, take notes, and tell the other shops why we were so damned good.

A couple of weeks after their visit, we got official notification that we were to stop using our method of dealing with ""Virus check and removal"" in favor of the corporate method - Run the customer's AV, and send it home to them regardless of results.  If possible, sell them the software we had a deal with (and we'd get a buck ot two bonus if we sold enough of them)

Needless to say, we were dumbfounded.  They basically told us to screw the customer, because (in our minds) if their AV could have fixed/prevented the infection, why the hell did they come to us???"
