17,"I like this story, a lot, and as a father I wonder if you realize what you really did for them. Imagine working, growing a life, career, getting married, then maybe between 30-40 you have a beautiful boy. Your hopes, dreams, legacy, all culminated in this new little human.

Then the worst of the worst happens, anger, frustration, financial strain, blame, loss and then years later you lose every image of your child. 

Maybe you can't have another, maybe it's too late in life. Every day after that for years you try to hang on to the memories of who they almost were and hold on to what they looked like, sounded, smelled, felt like, all the while fading as time tends to do.

Sure you remember, but the most subtle details of a photo bring back so much, the way their hair was, their favourite shirt, the goofy smiles. To me that is very scary, to not even be able to look and remember, particularly in an age where there is so much visual record of things, we rely less and less on our memory and more on the ability to access those memories.

Then to have those back by chance, is incredible. I can tell you that night and many nights after they were looking at those photos crying, laughing, seeing and recalling all the little details of children that make them so special to us. You brought him back to them in a way.

I wonder if they look at his picture before they go to sleep, hoping to dream about him, be with him, if only for a while.

edit: TY for the gold and my highest comment thing! Go hug your kid, family, friend, loved one!

22,"This is part of the reason that I *never* wipe a device with personal data, and *never* neglect to save personal data. I've got a hard drive at my desk with about 100GB of personal photos from employees that are gone, but I'm not wiping it. They might come back years from now and ask for pictures of a dead loved one or something, so a few old, slow (but functional) HDDs are worth it."

26,"This sounds like a story an engineering student at a university told me years ago. There was a team of senior students working on an optical project for a professor. It was complicated, with sections spread out across the lab space. All was going well, but then they noticed measurements were changing between morning and afternoon.  They would re-calibrate everything and all would be well. 

Then one day a student noticed the equipment settings were changing while they were gone for lunch. Someone was messing with things while the lab was empty. So signs went up to warn visitors not to touch anything. It helped for a few days, but then it started again. Finally one student had an idea. He went off to do do a quick and dirty build, resulting in a box with a big red button on it and a fogged plexiglass window. Above this was black text displaying: 

'DO NOT PRESS BUTTON'. 

The box was left next to some of the more interesting looking gear.  The others in the group blinked and asked 'What does it do? Sound an alarm? Or fire off a smoke bomb?'.  'No, just wait' 

So they went to lunch again. Upon coming back they found the culprit, a sophomore from another part of the building. He was standing near the gear, shaking, one finger pressing the button. He called out, ""What do I do?' and pointed with the other to the now red lit window that said:

'RELEASE BUTTON TO DETONATE'"

Also reminds me of a story from somewhere on reddit. Guy gets a sysadmin job at a small business, where the last guy didn't properly implement anything. New sysadmin rebuilds network/server from scratch, with redundant failovers and offline backups, with an entire new network from 10/100 to gigabit.

46,"Ah users. They hear a phrase once and it sort of sticks but they never get it right. It's a little like people who have theasurus syndrome.

Sometime, somewhere, she heard someone say ""the server is down"" in reference to a computer problem (defined as ""a problem involving absolutely anything that plugs into a wall"").

Since she doesn't understand anything she therefore decided this magic phrase was the explanation for any problem. There's a computer problem (since her phone plugs into the wall therefore it's a computer problem) and that means ""the server is down"".

She thinks she's found a magic way to cut through the BS and embarrassment of admitting ignorance and actually answering all of our annoying questions she doesn't know how to answer, and just get IT to fix the dam problem by speaking in their own arcane gobbledygook and now she's mad at you for failing to do your part, respond to the magic words, and fix her problem."

72,"The worst things that have ever happened to me all happened close together like that. Kind of like the ""bad things come in 3s"" theory but sometimes it's 4, or 2. They do seem to come close together though and that's the roughest times. 

2 years ago my mom died, then my dog died a month later then the 2 buildings next to ours caught fire and burned down which spread to ours. Our place caught fire also but thankfully it was ok. We had damage but it was salvageable. 

The previous time I had a terrible 3 was 2005- my girlfriend committed suicide, I ended up on the streets homeless and then once I got a new place (and got my stuff out of storage to move into it) hurricane Katrina hit and I lost everything again. 

There's other clumps of tragedy that are actually almost as bad as those but this isn't my life-story time. I was just thinking when I read your comment that I identify with bad things happening all at once. I am glad I'm not a parent because losing a child is like the worst thing I can imagine.

Neat note - the latest STIGs for Windows suggests that ""Domain Admins"" be denied the ""log on locally/remotely"" user rights for all computers that are not used solely for managing AD.
