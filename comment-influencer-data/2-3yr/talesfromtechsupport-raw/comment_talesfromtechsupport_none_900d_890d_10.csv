yes ma'am, that's exactly what I meant.

""can you put some recipe books in there for me ?""

yes ma'am, what kind ?

""Oh, I'm good with Solitaire, it's enough for me.""

""It can be very convenient, not just other games, there's books and ..""

""You're very kind, but no thank you.""

""You don't understand, there's *recipe books*. Specifically *delicious pie recipe books*. I really think it would be, uhh, beneficial if you'd consider the pie or pastry recipe books.."""
4,"I feel sorry for Marie having to deal with everyone quitting. She seems like a pretty great person, shame she had everything screwed up by Jim."
5,"He was the snitch, and the laptop belonged to the sales manager."
6,"Marie is awesome.  She backed me up 100% after the biggest TIFU moment of my professional life.  (Yes that's another story, but I may not be able to post that one for a long while, as it's going to take some serious thinking to figure out how to anonymize it properly.)  I'll always be grateful to her for that. "
7,"Take all my upvotes. Fantastic story. I once got to help a couple of blind people with their computer issues, and while not nearly as heart-wrenching as your experience, it was still very rewarding to be able to assist people who had additional disadvantages beyond the norm, not to mention earning their trust and respect."

10,Please tell me you got something other than 1 day off paid for this . .  .
11,"Oh man, did not see the relationship twist coming.  Undisclosed relationships between managers and employees are just bad news for everyone...and that's on top of everything else.  

What a terrible thing to have gone through.  Hopefully your department recovers ok."
12,"I wish I could tell you that.  But I can't, because I didn't. I got my job back, that was about it. "
13,"My grandparents made it up to the 130,000th game of solitaire before they upgraded their old computer, I doubt they'd want to do anything else as well"
14,"&gt; My boss does not like snitches. He came up from my position and understands the value of downtime in IT and knows that a bored IT person is a bad IT person.

This is a very true thing.  Bored IT people go looking for jobs elsewhere.

Many years ago, when I was sole IT guy for a smallish database company, the CTO was in his office with one of the senior devs (who happened to be my best drinking buddy), and through his glass walls he spies me sat in my corner in the midst of a Quake 3 deathmatch.

CTO: ""What do we actually pay him for if he's just playing games""    
DevBuddy: ""Is your email working""    
CTO: ""Yeah, why?""    
DevBuddy: ""Are all our websites up and running?""    
CTO: ""Yeah...""    
DevBuddy: ""Are we waiting for any more DB servers to be built""    
CTO: ""No...""    
DevBuddy: ""That's what we pay him for"".    
CTO: ""I see your point"".

29,"I dunno about the laws in whatever country you work in (or the terms of your employment or what the company you work for is like, I probably wouldn't do this to a decent employer), but it seems like a pretty damn clear case of unfair dismissal to me. And considering you let M go to voicemail, you probably even have evidence to prove it.

Having a company begging for you to come back after an unfair dismissal seems like it would put you in a very good negotiating position (either to get a raise/more days of holiday, or to get rid of J). Especially if there's emails or answer phone messages to prove it."

49,"One day in a large factory with a long assembly line a critical piece of equipment suddenly stopped working. This one machine brought the factory’s entire assembly line to a complete halt.  Partially finished products were backed up all through the factory. The company that owned the factory was in a complete panic as they were losing tens of thousands of dollars for every minute that the factory was shut down.  The workers were nervous, as they didn’t know what to do or say to bring this machine back to life.  No amount of fiddling by the operators or floor engineers could get the machine fired up. No one on the factory floor knew how to get this critical component back online.

The managers and executives were in a frenzy and didn’t know what to do either.  They knew there had to be a way to get this resolved and online or they would lose an enormous amount of money.

The chief mechanic was called in and he insisted that there was only one expert who he knew could correct the problem quickly so the factory could be online making money again.  Needless to say, the expert was called in. 

When the expert arrived, he examined the halted machine from this angle and that angle, skillfully moving all around for about ten minutes.  He then went and removed a hammer from his toolbox.  He walked up to the machine and inspected one specific spot before he struck the machine once with the hammer.  A loud whack was heard throughout the factory floor.  Suddenly the machine came back to life and started running at full capacity. Goods started moving smoothly down the assembly line at full rate and the factory was back online.  The workers sighed a sigh of relief. 

The corporate executives rejoiced.

The expert then presented the chief mechanic with a bill for $10,000. “This is outrageous!” the mechanic exclaimed “10,000 dollars to hit a machine with a hammer? You spent ten minutes here just to hit it with a hammer!!!! I’ll require an itemized bill for this!”


The expert pulled out an invoice sheet, wrote a few things down and then presented the chief mechanic with the following itemized invoice:

• Hitting machine with hammer $1.00

• Knowing where to hit machine $9,999.00"

65,"well, i just learned something "
66,"As long as one person is not above the other in the same chain of command, it usually isn't an issue...but it has to be disclosed anyway. At least that's how it works in my company. There are lots of couples who work here (some that met here, which is kind of adorable) and as long as stuff is disclosed and there aren't any chain of command issues, it's not a problem.

That clearly wasn't the case here. I mean, the sales manager could've been married and had an open relationship and the snitch could have been his partner, which would be super awkward to figure out how to disclose to the company, or even if it should be disclosed. So many people don't understand open relationships. But the moment they went and started the whole snitching thing, they needed to get the boot no matter what their relationship status was.

Edit: holy run-on sentence, Batman!"

70,"I used to have a regular customer that everyone loved. He was pleasant and friendly to everyone. To this day, I'd still say he was one of my favorite customers - he was loyal through the years and never complained about anything.

One night, he walked in just before closing time and was very rude to the person who helped him. Everyone there at the time, myself included, was shocked. We couldn't believe he had acted that way with no provocation.

The next day, he came in to apologize. His father had suddenly passed away and it had really shaken him up.

74,"As a deaf tech who used to assist deaf people whenever they come up the counter, I wish more techs were like you! 

Good job applying your ASL skills and there was one time when I was called for assistance to an emergency at a store in a different state so I flew over there and met the acting supervisor who will be supervising the store for a week. I was surprised to find out he know sign language and the HQ specifically requested him to accompany me because they knew I was deaf. 

We got along really quick and it was smooth sailing at the store. At the end of the week, we went back to our home states and before we went our way, my acting supervisor told me to tell my supervisor that he needs to learn sign language because he felt that bosses should learn sign language if they have a deaf employee. He added that if my supervisor don't learn sign language, I should transfer over to his store! 

He was awesome and he did share the same first and last name with a deceased, yet very famous musician. "

80,"I have a Jim in my life (chemistry, not tech support) that was an absolute fucking asshole like this guy. Went over my head and tried to sabotage me - would go so far as to talk over me in meetings because he was leading them as the lab director. I left that company because I couldn't stand him and of course better pay. 

Fast forward a year and he has run the lab into the ground and is looking for new jobs as the lab is beginning to fully fail and I get an e-mail with his new non-compete, resume, etc. Oooh, what's this? he's looking for new jobs while working and under a non-compete? Even better, it's with a direct competitor and in direct violation of his non-compete AND nondisclosure agreements (the same ones I had to sign). 

Turns out the idiot had been scanning all of this AT WORK using the company scanner and didn't bother to change the default e-mail address (my personal address I had used to setup the machine since I was the defacto IT person at this small lab). He didn't test the machine before sending it to himself to make sure it was going to his personal e-mail first and boom, landed right in my lap. He called me frantically and e-mailed incessantly for about a week and I just let him hang in the breeze. That was a very good week as I got to tell the story to my former colleagues and current boss who had all dealt with him and also hated his guts. "
