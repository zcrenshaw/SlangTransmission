0,I'll buy it from you for $200! :D
1,10/10 title
2,"My God, a happy ending. Are you new here?"
3,"&gt;make them join this conference call.

Nope. 

You did both of them a favor by not doing that."
4,That...that seems like at the very least several somebodies should be pulled into remedial meetings about proper reporting and escalation procedures.  Ideally the entire department.  You do not idle for multiple days because one tech was out!
5,"I have had to be one to ask for such a mass call to go out. The initial answer I got from our front office was ""can't you send it in a mass email?"""
6,"Wow.

I was expecting the shock of realization, but instead got: 

&gt;""Why is everybody saying the same stuff over and over again, i have a feeling you work with them too""


That's....  something
"
7,"You know, I get the feeling that someday he'll show up, demand his computer back, insist he doesn't have to pay the storage fees and threatens to call the cops in case you don't hand it over immediately..."
8,"""Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark. Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss.""

Edit: TY for the gold kind pixel friend."
9,"Step 1. Try not to cry.

Step 2. Cry a lot."
10,"&gt;had no idea that could trigger the fire alarm

To be fair I didn't know that either. The smoke detectors in my apartment are super sensitive and will go off if I make toast without turning on my kitchen fan. I've never had them go off because of vaping. I even blew directly at the smoke detector to see if it would set it off. It didn't.

I guess different smoke detectors work differently and what might set one off won't set another one off.

Edit: Also, I don't want this to sound too personal but how much do you make an hour? I used to work ""security"" for an upper-class neighbourhood (i.e. I watched YouTube/Netflix from 11:00pm to 7:00am and opened a gate about once a week if someone needed to come in). I got $17/hr for doing that (everyone that lived there was rich so the job paid well).

I've been considering getting another graveyard ""security"" job as they tend to pay well and are pretty easy.

I'm just sort of wondering what a graveyard shift at a data center pays."
11,I just don't understand how they went for 3 days without even their higher ups or managers making a fuss about it.
12,Capitalism hooooooo! 
13,"""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!"""
14,Wow! The stories in this sub always seem to make me feel a bit smarter and a bit more sad for the world in which we live. This one is definitely a good one. Thanks for sharing.
15,"""I've been to 7 doctors. They all say I have Herpes. Ya just want to get more money out of me. I bet ya'll are working together."""
16,"It's astonishing what some people believe IT and software development is. No it's not magical, and no most changes/updates/fixes are not instantaneous."
17,"I don't think that was the actual reason they didn't pick up the PC.

EDIT: I meant they they wouldn't have taken the PC regardless of the family emergency."
18,"We're a tiny company and they have been instructed to forward calls if the client says it's urgent or if they are upset. 

Client service is more important than forcing compliance. "
19,"Commiserations on your job loss. Good luck to you in your future endeavours. 

As for the director, he's a typical luser. If it's not *inside* the machine, it has nothing to do with it. If it *is* inside the machine, then it's one of the two parts he knows of, the 'computer' or the 'hard drive'. Everything *inside* falls into one of those categories."
20,"It's really sad that people will try absolutely nothing before they ask for help. 

Like, she didn't even look at her keyboard. "
21,user too shortsighted to see issue is right in her face
22,.  * ~~yard~~ Edna's estate sale
23,does your front desk just connect any caller to anyone they ask for?
24,"His refusal to accept the idea that maybe the power outage caused &lt;other software&gt; to stop working makes me think that either: 1) he was looking for someone to shout at who'd be obligated to take it, or 2) was looking for an excuse to avoid work."
25,"&gt;You're gonna pay for nifty princess dresses my daughters wanted.

That's close to one I heard in an industrial facility once  
&gt;From what I'm hearing, y'all just bought me a new Mini convertible"
26,"Yeah, this is pretty much SCREAMING ill intent. It would not be the first time people just don the right costume, and get access to pretty much whatever they want... It would definitely be the first time that an ISP is the one that is actually being the proactive one- And especially just out of the blue like that. ""garbage data"" just sounds like a good excuse to get in..."
27,"I'm sure you are, but make damn sure that your arse is covered. Document everything you have done to attempt to return the computer."
28,OP's titling scheme has peaked today. 
29,"Yeah, a friend of mine works at an another shop in the same city and the guy was there too. My friend didnt tell him nothing like i did. He told him only to leave the laptop with him so he can look and find the problem. He said then: ""Nope, i dont trust you enough with my data, i will wait here on the counter until you do it."" Friend said nope and they left with cursing him out...Real Crazy!"
30,And the cops would say it's a civil matter and tell you to take it up in court.
31,"Ok, need you to aim the pistol at the boot. Is your foot still in there? 

No

Ok, because, if you pull the trigger and your foot is in there, its gonna hurt. Do you understand?

Yes. 

Ok, pull the trigger. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!

"
32,"To be fair, the family emergency was probably fairly unhappy.   Maybe they deserved it though..."
33,"17/hr?

Hahahahahaha, no I make 9.50/hr here

Working for Securitas though, not the data center specifically, I make 2-3 an hour less than the lowest paid ""actual"" employee here.

Honestly this place is a joke, and I'm trying to switch sites to somewhere with better hours and pay, but they are extremely reluctant to move me as ""this is an important position"" 

Edit: Your name tho, 10/10"
34,"Bob's the sort of guy who screams at baristas, isn't he."
35,"A rig with a 1070 for $100 is incredible! Enjoy it, dude. "
36,"Its secure because every attaker gets so confused in the network, they just leave. "
37,"TL;DR, Penny pincher provokes pyrotechnic precipitation. "
38,"""Super important"" ""pays $9.50"". Sounds right. Security payscales are pulled out of someones ass, I swear. 

Head office of a bank, full access control and dealing with servers? 50 cents over minimum. Nightshift at at a shipping yard, involving Netflix and making sure the place isn't on fire? 3 dollars more. 

Legit job switch I had to make years ago. Had to argue with HR to get it to. They couldn't understand, because the bank job was ""prestigious"", and they needed good guards. 

They should pay better if they want good guards. "
39,"This sounds like something the end users at my company would do. We have a ticketing system, but they all refuse to use it.

If I'm on vacation or unavailable, they email all issues to me directly.

If it's Friday, the one day my co-worker always have off, better email him.

Then cue complaining that we are too slow to respond.  Never mind we both have autoresponders setup on our work emails stating they should submit their email to the ticketing system, or it may not be answered in a timely manner.  They don't read those, or those emails are ""too confusing"".

I also can't get management to buy into making the ticketing system mandatory for getting assistance. We're a sales organization, so we cannot possibly make the sales people learn something new. It might make them unhappy and then they won't sell, or some bullcrap excuse along those lines."
40,I'll buy it for $300 :D
41,Heh. No way I'm calling you back if you're not going to be a part of the solution. 
42,"&gt;We need to call IT to make sure it's ok for IT to do IT!

Yeah, I get this from time to time because my organization is so big and when I make desk calls people don't realize how high up the food chain I am... I'll just sit back and watch as they call the help desk and get told that I outrank everyone there and can do what I please to their computer."
43,Did you call 0118 999 881 999 119 7253?
44,"Exactly. Definitely sounds like a case of looking at procedure to see if it was either followed or needs updating, and in either case, who needs a good kicking!"
45,Poor guy. I hope he managed to get it all sorted.
46,or because the family emergency involved the owner of that computer no longer being able to use it.
47,Somethings off... do you drink the blood of the innocent or something? 
48,"Having the image of someone hanging from the rafters by a rope of CAT6 could prove to be the deterrent you were looking for. Questions like ""Is he twitching, or is it the gentle breezes of the air-conditioning units?"" can be a great conversation starter.


Of course, logistically speaking, they might have been lacking a quiet (relatively speaking) place for their prayers. With the neighbourhood as it is, the server room might have been the safest place to do so."
49,"Some times the ""I have no clue what I'm doing but I'll try"" users are better. Ok, you have to be simpler, but they are more afraid of messing up so they follow instructions to the letter."
50,"1 year later...

*Phone rings*

&gt;This is Library, $Director says that you pulled something out of their computer and *Yesterday* the network went down. Clearly you maliciously broke something, come fix it now or we'll sue! No we won't pay you, YOU broke it a year ago!."
51,"*groans repeatedly*

*hands alcohol to OP*
"
52,Forward a log of that to his direct superior and yours.
53,"I mean really you never know... something extremely chaotic could have happened in the family... with that many notices and over 100 days. Considering they just spent a bunch of money on the other parts, it is unlikely that it was a money issue for that $100 vs the value of the computer. My best guess would have to be a split in the family unless there was some serious sudden financial bad luck.

In any case, sucks for them to just end up throwing away a ton of money like that. Awesome for OP though."
54,"Who puts pennies in a fusebox? That is asking to be burned down in their sleep.  

&gt;$EVP - Try not to burn the building down this time $ME.  

Do. Or do not. There is no try."

56,"This made me smile.  Back in the day when I used to train new techs, I pulled the ""set up your own"" all the time.     
First day of work, I'd give them a work space and someone's old computer. I'd tell them to clean it up and get it ready to use. You can find out exactly how much your new tech knows by seeing what he does with that. Some techs would dive right in, pulling pieces apart, testing, cleaning up, and asking where the install files were. Others would give me that helpless look...   

If I got the first kind, I knew all I had to do was show them how to work the ticket system and let them go to town. If I got the second kind, they'd be someone's cable crawler for at least a couple of months. 

(And I didn't make them keep the old ""set up"" computer for more than a few weeks. We'd ""get in"" a new order. But hey, I'd get a good clean computer for the loaner pool! I don't think anyone ever saw through that...but I could be wrong.)"
57,"Things like this are why I'm getting my psych degree to change careers. 

25 years of this same shit

After my degree, I'll be able to work on the root cause of all these issues... the users

You all can thank me later"
58,"OP, take this amazing deal!  

$200! = $7.8865786736... × 10^374  


/r/unexpectedfactorial"
59,That's why you don't buy power supplies built from explodium.
60,I'm actually impressed at your users dedication to policy. Half our clients would probably help a burglar pack up his van with their equipment.
61,"Updates, updates, updates!"
62,"This happened to me the other day..

This woman was trying to scroll up in the browser but she had a book on the space bar, while it was still in her hand.."
63,"I used to work in a computer repair shop. We had a policy almost identical to OP's re: taking possession of the repaired PC after 90 days if it isn't picked up. We had people show up as much as 3 *years* after they brought their shit in to be fixed, and would *still* get pissed when we'd tell them it's gone. "
64,"If I were the tech in that situation, I'd view it as a win.

Best case: they agree to buy equipment from me with my mark-up, and I get to set up the network the way I want to from scratch.

Worst case: they don't want to buy anything, I present my invoice and toddle off.

Not my fault they terminated a contract without reading it.
"
65,He... He what... I may not be in an industrial setting (due to not being interested and not at the proper industrial working age) but even I know you shouldn't do that...
66,What? You've never sat at the couch drinking a beer when suddenly it hits you that you left your PC at the repair shop 3 years ago? You're weird.
67,"He would probably order the most complicated thing available, changing his mind mid-order, being unclear which options he actually wanted and then scream when they get it wrong."
68,"This is really shocking. A website to process job applications and It's one big ball of HTML-JavaScript-CSS. No error messages or apparent debugging. 

I hope it at least was **https**, and not **http**."
69,"How do you know about aluminium hats?!

*Nervously fondles aluminium hat.*"
70,"God, there should be a basic aptitude test to pass before you are hired for anyone who works with basic technology."
71,"Ah, but you've forgotten the ""modem"", which is the big box on the floor under the desk with all the wires coming out of it."
72,"&gt; but apparently she ""checked"" that nothing was blocking the camera as I asked before.

Rule 1: Users lie."
73,I spit my margarita on my keyboard thanks to you. :D 
74,"It's unlikely that anything will happen in the next 24 hours (and we're headed into a weekend). However, when something does happen I'll reply to your comment. :)"
75,I just have no tolerance for people who feel the need to scream at the folks trying to help them.
76,"Ah the old \**try every default password you can think of until you get logged in*\* trick. ""It works 60% of the time, *every* time.""

After recently starting my new job at an MSP, I find this works far, *far* too much for comfort."
77,"Never let users set their own priority levels. Best case, you get woken at 3am to restore someone's Outlook shortcut. Worst case, a vital server is offline for days because the secretary figured 'no one will need the computer over the weekend.'"
78,How about £501!
79,I love your writing so much that even though this was a fairly mundane event (especially compared some of your other stories) I still enjoyed it right to the very end. Keep up the good work!
80,"""Why didn't you tell me it would hurt my foot?!!""

""I just did.""

""What? I wasn't paying attention to what you were saying.""
