0,"&gt; calls his work, which us a place that uses me as a consultant and tells them not to use me anymore.

What the fuck? Are you sure he's your dad?"
1,This.  Shitbag dad of the month candidate here.
2,Nice touch with the voicemail attachment.
3,"They won initiative, but then fumbled their attack roll."
4,Guess the phishing people were not expecting THAT to happen.
5,"""In England, we don't have a gun culture so it comes as a shock to see one pointing at you.""

Hello from the USA mate.
It's still scary to have a gun pointed at you over here."
6,"I work t1 for a major university, one day a guy from the security department came to visit.

$sec: We have successfully made it impossible for our users to be hit by phishing emails

$me: oh wow, how is that even possible?

$sec: all mail servers are down, get ready for the shitstorm


edit: Thank you anonymous gilder!"
7,"&gt;We ask her if she has a cat or dog. No, she says, she doesn't.

Couple days later 

&gt;but she does have a pet rabbit

Obviously not the brightest crayon in the box. "
8,"&gt;TL;DR I wrote a script to ""Wake-on-LAN"" a lot of big machines in a factory and forgot about timing, leading to a blackout in a whole district (400 sq.km. / 250 sq.miles)

AND you got away with it."
9,"My place of employment started a program a while back to phish itself. Users are sent some of the worst ""phishing"" emails I have ever seen, and if they click the link or open the attachment they are dropped into a training program about recognizing phising emails that literally looks like it was designed as a kids edutainment program.

Do you know how much this has helped? It has not been measurable. User-stupidity is an endless well, we cannot bail fast enough."
10,"dont know what it is about parents and technology. My dad likes to think he knows what hes doing. More often than not i get a call about some purchase advice for tech. Give him pros and cons of a few things and say WHATEVER YOU DO DONT BUY PRODUCT XYZ.

Talk to them a few weeks later to find they did buy XYZ because the nice man at pc world was selling it cheap. Oh and by the way its not working can you fix it...

#facepalm"
11,"Windows, go to properties of the shortcut on the desktop, change the icon to IE and rename the shortcut. My father hates firefox as well.  so I installed the new Internet Explorer update.....

sorry to hear about him calling your place of employment. I wish you the best of luck!"
12,"I love how Google Voice has the feature to let you block people so they get the ""This number is no longer in service"" message. *It makes me so hot.*"
13,"&gt; CEO: I don't understand how any of this works, but I'm in charge! And if there's a problem that I can't blame on someone else, then I'm going to lie about it!

I swear, it's like it happened in my own office."
14,"&gt;you'd think someone who uses computers as much as you would know not to install google. I guess there are some things you just don't understand

Man, what a freaking idiot."
15,"For the record, its also not at all normal or commonplace. "
16,"Yea, in my America I wake up every morning, put on my cowboy boots, mount up in my American flag painted f-450 and go driving down the highway shooting people on the way to work.  After I arrive to the office a bit early i notice the doors are still locked, no problem, I jump into the bed of my truck and unload on the doors with my mounted vulcan minigun.  Sheryl the secretary and a cleaning lady unfortunately sustained minor death.  After i shoot my way to the kitchen i pour a cup of coffee in a styrofoam cup, which i blow a hole in so i can guzzle that delicious black nectar into my gob.  Finally I arrive at my desk, login to stormfront and am ready to begin the day.  "
17,"Is it safe to assume that ""it's an intern's fault and he got fired for it"" means that it's all an executive's fault?"
18,From the sound of it anyone who knows anything about computers probably learned to ignore this guy a long time ago 
19,"You build a user-proof system, and they just go and build a dumber user."
20,"To be fair this is far better than my mom. I'm the one in the family with a CS degree, my brother failed out the fake engineering degree they offer. She always asks for his advice first and when I interrupt saying it's wrong she tells me ""he's your brother, don't argue with him, beside he knows what he's doing"". 

Fine

A week or two later I get a call to fix whatever he was working on because it magically ""broke"" right after she followed his advice. I've gotten to the point where if my mom takes his advice after I said it was wrong I won't go back and fix it."
21,"I felt a slight pain as I read that, nobody should treat computers like that, breaks my heart"
22,"I would say, ""at least they tried,"" but some people should know their limitations."
23,"I don't know what America you live in but I wake up in the morning with guns in the bed with me, brush my teeth with a gun and then drive a gun to work where I wave it around. Everyone else is also waving their guns, it's all about guns here."
24,"&gt; He had tried to connect his (SATA) SSD [Yeah. He didn't do anything to the PC since he bought it.] to the IDE port of his motherboard with jumper cables.

How would you even begin doing this? The pinouts don't match up in any possible way so did he just connect random things together and hoped it would work? "
25,"Tech support: Putting your sanity **and** life at risk!

But on a serious not that must have been scary and I'm glad I wasn't in that position."
26,"At least you got 2 weeks notice, something like this would've came to me on a Friday afternoon notifying me this was needed Monday morning, with the same result."
27,"Posts like this genuinely disgust me 

How can you go an entire day without a single national anthem? "
28,Op is one lucky son of a bitch and totally deserved to get away with it
29,"""Did you hear me? I said he put the google on there!"""
30,"You should send him a link to this thread, so he can see a bunch of Internet strangers talking about what an ignorant jackass he is. 

Or just tell him he's an ignorant jackass. If he doesn't believe you, he likely won't believe anyone else. "
31,Yep. Anything that causes my shredded wheat to get soggy is going to cost them big time.
32,In fairness this is one of the more forgivable errors I've seen on here. And her solution was really logical except for not turning off the wifi
33,Users like this gave me this username.
34,"Very often, yes."
35,"&gt; all mail servers are down

I mean, he is technically correct (the best kind of correct), but damn does that take some talent

"
36,"Shhh, don't put too much effort into understanding it, you'll just hurt yourself."
37,"&gt; Frankly I hope it costs her her job.

Firing her for this would be a bit harsh IMHO, but if I were her manager I would give her a written warning, and I would require her to ring you back to apologise."
38,This is how I got my grandparents to start using Chrome with adblock so they would stop clicking on ads.
39,I got so pissed reading this story.
40,"My favourite version of this is the malapropism ""sharpest bulb in the box"" -- which is of course the one that's broken."
41,"""That's nice, John. *click*"""
42,"Most definitely. What was the boss thinking, firing up a script written by a 16 year old intern without making sure it worked (as intended) first"
43,"For one instance? No, but you know that if she is acting like this instantly without anything provoking her to do so then this likely isn't the first or last instance. It would all depend on if others she is doing this to are reporting it as well."
44,I hope you billed it as emergency rates with a fat minimum. =) 
45,"And I thought the police searching our store for heroin that end up being thermal paste was unfortunate.


Glad to hear you remained calm and took care of the device, and didn't freak out and end up at r/techsupportgore"
46,"&gt; And I'm happy to say that HR learned their lesson and moved their server to the data center.

&gt; Na, just kidding. Server stayed were it was.

You tease!"
47,"It's delicious. Just make it so your google number ports all calls and texts to your phone. Tell everyone you changed your number, only give that number out from then on, then when someone starts to bug you - block em! At least in the US, they get that classic *""Doot doot doot, I'm sorry, the number you're calling has been disconnected or is no longer in service.""*

For a while there you couldn't get pictures or videos on that number, but now you can - it just goes to your email.

Edit: Also, you can set custom voicemail greetings for different people. "
48,"... and the dear old man didn't say anything about remembering hearing you name that brand in particular? 'Cause that's a bit of a classic too. I've reverted to naming the others as the others, and only naming the products/brands that are options. That way, if they weren't listening properly, and only remember the brand names, I've only named the ones that I can live with... 

But yes, I do agree! Parents! They're kind of hopeless! But I can realise the difference. Had a discussion with a friends son who's 10. And told him that I didn't have a computer at home until high school. And dial up Internet that I could use sometimes. And no mobile... Jeez, I'm old! :o"
49,"I agree, and would agree wholeheartedly if she hadn't been one of the educators in a computer lab for adults for a few years. Training them in MsOffice and such. She really thought she knew it all, and hence caused more than one issue for me to fix. I then had to find a way to tell her in a way that never said anything about her doing anything or being wrong. I've since let her get her own wifi-devices (she's on a mobile solution now) and leave the support to the professionals. "
50,"&gt;when somewhere, something very forcefully exploded.

I guess this was the moment you suddenly stopped remembering if you could code at all.


Damn dude, you got away with it too.. Amazing."
51,"I doesn't matter who wrote it, that's a script that needs a *lot* of testing before you fire it off."
52,"I might have been inclined to not even respond to her problem with that much of an unprofessional conduct, and send that email much, much earlier. "
53,"Helo this is the redit moderador, you have to give me the credit card money. Warning the FBI is behind you! Call this number!"
54,Google Voice?
55,Life Pro Tip: Don't keep a man in his 50's from his fiber. It will end poorly for you.
56,"Computer make Noice. I fix. Computer to bad for my fix? I Kick PC. Give 2 it for repairs. Get home. Download migetp0rn.exe. Blame repair shop.

""No biggie. Because Repair shop doesn't care."""
57,Not-for-profit? Sounds like it's made by communists to me.
58,"yea, advertisements and old people.  Crazy how people will click anything that says ""Click here"". "
59,"Sounds like a conservative conspiritard.  (I should know, my family is full of them)

Not to make this political, but when it comes to believing anti-technology bullshit...some conservatives are right up there with the Amish.

Fun story, I told my aunt's brother (who owns a construction firm) back in [Christmas 2012 to invest in Tesla](http://ir.tesla.com/stocklookup.cfm).  He laughed at me and told me that electric cars were hippie leftist bullshit.  Yep... *that* happened.

"
60,"&gt;I was working...

Well, its a good thing you no longer work there.

&gt;It was the year 2012, we were still using Windows XP

Well, at least it wasn't Windows ME...

&gt; came into my office and reminded me how important this training was

Look, the work will be done when it is done.  You coming here constantly asking only slows me down.

&gt;By the way, we only need 4 notebooks

You could have told me sooner!  You said 14!

&gt;Apparently I have been very unfriendly to her when I delivered the notebooks for the training.

And she kept pestering you about getting the job  done...Ungrateful user.
"
61,"That's a special button reserved for the day you retire.

""Well, it's been fun everyone, guess I'll log out one last time and -- oh, would you look at that? Looks like I misclicked and hit the reset all button by mistake! Terribly sorry. Thanks for the cake!""

*Walks out*"
62,"I wonder what made he think ""firefox is evil""..."
63,"I mean I don't blame them. There are some seriously deceptive online ads that sometimes say some scary shit. ""YOUR COMPUTER IS INFECTED WITH A BAJILLION VIRSUS AND THE IRS IS GOING TO COME AND TAKE YOU AWAY IF YOU DON'T CLICK HERE"" to someone who doesn't know how their computer works aside from Facebook and Solitaire can be quite scary."
64,"&gt; but damn does that take some talent

66,"frankly I'm kinda surprised she didn't suspect the rabbit, even if she didnt know what the rabbit *did*.

GF has them a couple bunnies and their amazing ability is to get into *everything*. If you don't rabbit-proof the house &amp; put stuff entirely out of reach you have to assume they'll screw with it. "
67,"At first I thought, ""Man, that sucks that he stole your script,"" but then I thought, ""Hey, good thing he stole your script!"""
68,I agree. The professional thing to do is to fix the immediate issue and deal with the personal issue afterward. I think you did it right.
69,"Well ""person handled gun with safety and care"" doesn't make international headlines. So I'm afraid, yeah, you kinda do have that stereotype going for you. 

Edit: I'm not at all saying that you're all gun toting superpsychos. I know the average gun owner, anywhere in the world, is a responsible one. "
70,Uninstall your brother. 
71,"My art teacher would have said ""the sharpest crayon in the box""."
72,"I think you swapped the Friday and Monday in your sentence. At least that's how it works for me.

""So-and-so's been here for 3 days, why can't I phone them yet?"" ""Because this is the first I've ever heard of them?"""
73,"&gt; future requests for help

I wouldn't even call him on Father's Day after that, much less fix his computer."
74,"I found out recently my company does this as well. Turns out they included some options in the url so they can track which users click the link.

When the email came through, I immediately recognized it as a phish. But something was funny about the url - it linked directly to an ip address... an internal 10.238.x.x address. Seeing this piqued my curiosity; this must have come from within the network! So I copied the url over to my Linux vm to see what it looked like, saw the standard username/password form and more hints that it was a phish. Shut it down and went on with my day, confused as to why my own company tried to phish my login info.

Got the email with a link to the training program a week later. Bastards."
75,"&gt; Everyone was happy until a minute later, when somewhere, something very forcefully exploded

This needs to be on the subreddit banner
"
76,"This reminds me of the time I went to replace some toner in a printer, and found what looked like a phototransistor on the floor... Thought ""Where the hell did this come from?"" put it in my pocket, changed out the toner and went on my way.

Shortly after that, a request came in. ""Mail postage machine isn't working for some reason"".

Took a look and sure enough, there was a little sensor that was supposed to figure out whether a cartridge was fitted or not. I did my investigating, and discovered that the office administrator (in her ongoing quest to do away with people like me) had attempted to replace the cartridge and had tried inserting it backwards, before violently shoving it in so hard that she had ripped the phototransistor clean off its circuit board. Then of course she'd not told me what she did and instead claimed it had mysteriously stopped working.

I pulled out the phototransistor and said ""Yeah, well someone has mistreated this machine to the point this was ripped out of it. I know I've had nothing to do with this machine, so I do hope you'll track down the person responsible for this...""

I got silence in reply, told them to call the manufacturer for a replacement and washed my hands of the issue.

I can fix machines, but unfortunately I can't fix stupidity that doesn't want to be fixed."

78,"""Only two things are infinite... the universe and human stupidity."""
79,"&gt; being written by a 16 year old intern makes it WORSE

Can confirm, was 16 year old Intern last year - my code was awful. 

This year, as a 17 year old intern, I totally know what I am doing^/s"
80,Noooo not the artic silver! That's my good shit! Daddy needs his fix!
81,"If you don't hunt or target shoot in the US, you have a good chance of never seeing a real-life gun besides the one in an officer's holster. We have a lot of guns, but most people don't show them off to strangers."
82,"I'd answer that onewith ""kindly see solution outlined in email regarding previous ticket"", then I'd close this one..."
83,&gt;your lungs got to be at working asphyxiation level to operate
84,He might not pay him to fix his computer for free anymore.
85,"That stood out to me as well. I can't think of a good reason. In fact, it's the least evil in that it's produced by a not-for-profit and the rest are made by for-profits. I don't personally think that matter a whole lot but still."
86,"""Welp, seeing as how I don't understand computers, I guess I won't be helping you with yours anymore.""

Would be my response, followed by turning on my heel and walking out. What a fuckhead."
87,I was indeed inclined not to help but I would have had to deal with it eventually so I stayed on it.
88,Go on....
89,It may be time for the OP to stop over at r/raisedbynarcissists ...
90,"It's beautiful!

But you are not to blame, you did not know that there was some hardware limit of the power grid."
91,"They were trying to use dialup?

How is their internet displaying webpages correctly? I was under the impression that webpages today are a bit much for older internet conection methods due to the amount of data they have now?"
92,"In other words, ""Out of scope"""

94,Sounds like any future requests for help should be accepted only with a contract that he is not to question what you are telling him and an agreed hourly rate.
95,Atleast he's trying to better himself.
96,"""What's the ticket number of the phone installation request you submitted for them two weeks before they started, like the head of HR mandated in the process manual you are required to read and follow?"""
97,My grandparents recently received a phone call from a guy saying that he worked at Windows and their computer was infected with tons of viruses. They told him that I would take a look at it. They were freaking out when they called me because they didn't understand how the computer that I just built them already had viruses. I just laughed because their new PC is running Ubuntu.
98,"There's a damn good chance this is how she always reacts to anything and should be a known problem employee

People like her ALWAYS do this crap till fired "
99,"Reminds me of one time during my freshman year of high school.  I was a drummer in the band, and we were at a football game; as I headed to my seat, I stumbled and one of my drum mallets lightly bumped one of the trombones, knocking it over.  I was horrified.  The owner of the trombone comes over, moves the slide a bit, gets this funny look on his face, and says ""Holy shit, it's actually working *better*."""
100,"If one of my users did that to me, I'd just stick the laptop out of the way and wait for them to come back.  
  
Lady: ""I'm here to pick up my laptop.""  
Me: ""Here you go.""  
Lady: ""It doesn't look like you did anything to it!""  
Me: ""I did everything you asked me to do to it."""
101,"Yes, I agree. I'm just saying, being written by a 16 year old intern makes it WORSE.

If a senior developer of 10+ years wrote it, at least it could be seen as the boss trusting his expertise or something. But a 16 year old intern?"
102,"Oh sorry!

105,"&gt; but some people should know their limitations.

you're assuming that people have the intelligence to recognize this. You must be new to IT. (sorry if this makes me sound like an ass. I can't think of a gentler way to say it at the moment.)"
106,"&gt; No it's not the same as before, so it's broken. Please just fix it.

I don't want to believe they actually said that, but unfortunately I do."
