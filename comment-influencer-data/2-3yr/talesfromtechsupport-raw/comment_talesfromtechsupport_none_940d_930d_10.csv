5,But it's through the air!
6," &gt;While doing tech support for my elderly inlaws, I remind myself that they grew up in an era where they didnâ€™t initially have indoor plumbing or electrical wiring inside their farm homes.  They patiently raised their kids into successful adults.  I can cut them a little slack when it comes to teaching them how to use twenty-first-century tools.

Perspective is a wonderful thing to have."
7,"That's why I save every fucking email.

One time, I was working for a large energy distribution company, I was in the IT security department where the main part of my job was to setup users' accounts, and remove users' accounts.  Well, a day came for the big Windows 7 deployment push.  Three additional subcontractors were brought on to assist with the deploy.

Deskside services manager sends in the proper request to add the three employees into the system, and indicates which permissions they require for the deploy.  I look at it, and it seems a little light for a standard deskside support user.  So I email her back and said, ""I'm going to process these user accounts, but can you confirm that this is all they need access to?""

She wrote a very curt email back to me saying, ""Yes.""

I wrote back and said, ""Ok.  I just want to be clear that they won't be able to access some of these systems with this access request.  Typically, deskside gets these access permissions.""

She wrote back, ""I know what I asked for.  They don't need that!""

So I wrote back, ""Ok.  No problem.  I'll just give them access to X and Y then, and not Z.  But, if you find out they need access to Z, let me know and I'll get on it as soon as possible.""

She wrote: ""No, they don't!""

So, I set them up exactly as she asked, provided her the credentials, etc.  A few days go by and my manager came up to me.  ""b-monster666, you set these deskside support people up, right?""

""Yes I did.  I remember that very well.""

""Well, deskside manager told me that you didn't set them up properly.""

""Oh?  How so?""  I knew where this was going.

""They need access to Z, and you didn't provide them with that access.""

""Yes, I'm aware.  I asked deskside manager several times if they needed access to Z and she said no.  Would you like the emails?""

So, I sent my manager the emails who in turn sent it to the general IT manager.

One thing I loathed about working in large corporations was the freaking office politics that goes on.  Everyone's trying to backstab everyone else in order to advance."

29,"One thing I learned a long time ago is that options or multiple choice answers are like brain plague to users.

So for example, windows box, I need them to get to some remote portal. I don't ask what kind of browser because who knows what or how they reference it, and digging through their mind is usually pointless for that portion.

Just direct traffic, Sir/Ma'am do you see an E on the bottom of your screen anywhere? No ok, do you see the start button? No, ok can you move whatever post it notes or things covering the bottom left of your screen. Great, click on that button down there on the left... 

Anytime you give them a choice or multiple possible answers it just seems to become brain overload and now your in a quagmire of questions and a race condition between logic and.. Whatever is going on on the other end of that phone.

39,"In an old telecommunication switch manual a toggle was described to do the opposite of what it really did back in the 80's. This caused a small telephone company in the PNW to keep dropping or even failing to connect people's calls. The technician from the large two-letter-abbreviated company couldn't figure out what was wrong until he found out the manuals had been printed before the toggle design had been changed. The telecommunications company went bankrupt and my father (he was the CFO) took a large financial hit from it and caused us (while my mom was pregnant with me) to go bankrupt as well. Growing up, we lived below the poverty line and one winter all we had to eat was watery potato soup. I still can't eat potato soup anymore to this day. It tastes like poverty."

When I send a message during the day, it shows the time, not the date. 
At around 11pm it shows the date as well, because the server time is past midnight, so it will show the date of the first text you send that day (even though it's an hour off as local time for me and for our SMS server are different).

A candle analogy covers a few other potential issues too, because at the end of the day, they're both electromagnetic radiation.

Interference = too many lights in NYC, not enough range = candle is too far away to see, WiFi on device turned off = you're eyes are closed, WiFi on access point turned off = candle isn't lit, device with no WiFi = you're blind, can't be bothered to format list into a table = use commas and equals signs instead, etc"
