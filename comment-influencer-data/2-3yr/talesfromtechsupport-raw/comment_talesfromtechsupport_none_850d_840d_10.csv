0,&gt;TL;DR: Customer's PC had ~~a~~ multiple bugs I wasn't able to fix.
1,"I'd tell HR ""not my circus, not my monkeys""."
2,"Oh yeah I refused, it's not my job to tell a user they got termed. The problem was that termed users still need to access their pay stubs, and they still do it online, but instead of going to the SSO we have, they need to go straight to the software through another link. All stuff HR is supposed to give to the user when they get termed.

Also, update, just got a call back from the user and they haven't heard from HR. I have them the HR person's phone number (that told me to call) and hopefully everything will work itself out and I won't get termed.

I think the confusion was this particular HR person didn't know what the termed user's login and password would be, but neither does IT. HR is supposed to generate all of that when we term the user. Our HR department is really bad and I could seriously write a short story about all of their shortcomings."
3,"&gt;""Normal size! What else!""

Rule #1: ALL USERS LIE

Rule #2: USERS ARE ALWAYS LYING

Rule #3: USERS DO NOT TELL THE TRUTH"
4,"Though it's probably a typo, I'm choosing to interpret that ""no"" as a very thick Scottish accent."
5,Is it not possible to boot a surface pro off a USB stick with Linux on it?
6,Bees? You should have walked him through setting up a RAID.
7,You're an absolute lunatic.
8,"You should take your time and type up a nice report about redundancy and downtime, it's a very professional ""I told you so"""
9,"What possible printing job requires nearly 400+ pages of printer paper, on larger than normal paper, that isn't for work. At that point just send the job off to like FedEx or something."
10,all I could think is where the heck this library is located where you can print 400 pages for 12$. I think my local library is 10 cents a page.
11,"[It is, you just need an UEFI-formatted flash drive.](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage-files-and-folders/boot-surface-from-usb-recovery-device?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined)

[You can use Rufus to force an UEFI bootloader onto the drive.](https://rufus.akeo.ie/)

[You can also launch the Command Prompt (and use that to recover the files) from the Windows Startup Recovery which OP was able to start.](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-fix-issues-your-boot-records)

[If the Windows partition cannot be loaded, load up TestDisk onto a flash drive and use it from the command prompt.](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)

Edit: I know Rufus isn't the only way to make an UEFI-bootable flash drive, it's just the solution that I find to be the fastest and easiest to use, because 9/10 times when I'm confronted with a similar situation I just drag-and-drop the appropriate ISO onto the application and choose the target partition type (MBR/UEFI)."
12,"completely filled with bees sounds like just the sort of bug a programmer would never think to plan for. 

if you were a real genie you could have fixed the problem remotely tho. "
13,"&gt; Our HR department is really bad and I could seriously write a short story about all of their shortcomings. 

Please do. That'll be hilarious."
14,"""Yes sir, let me get you on the line with our cable stretching department""  
Click"
15,"...and, as a result, likely to survive Tech Support without a mental breakdown."
16,"I have had users press the F key, and then the 1 key twice.  "
17,THA'S NO A PASSWOHD YA DAFT TIT
18,Daaaaaaaaaad
19,"Alternate key combo from back in the day: Alt + enter  

Rarer these days but some programs use it instead of F11"
20,"""There's a landmine buried in the middle of this footpath.""


""We know but people can just hop over it or walk around it. We may remove it in the future."""
21,"Yeah this is the correct answer.  Not saying ""I told you so"" is all about using tact and avoiding blame.  If you write up an impartial report using passive voice (therefore no implication of fault) talking in bottom line terms (how much $$$ it cost the company in that downtime vs how much it would have cost to order the hardware you asked for in the first place).

Dollars and cents is all they understand.  They don't care about downtime as long as it works mostly alright and doesn't affect their budget or get them in trouble.  Show how it affects the budget and they'll pay attention."
22,"Obligatory ""I'm not a phone person! You're refusing to help me so I'm going to hang up!"""
23,"I probably should have clarified, he already had about 28 dollars on his card and had recently added 12 at circulation. For whatever reason, he was really only concerned about the 12 he had just added."
24,"I kept reading ""genie-oos"" as ""genie-o's"" (like a weird cereal), instead of like ""genius""."
25,I've always wished that computers bee-hived.
26,As soon as you said dissertation I knew the surface was toast. You probably saved that guy from a full tilt nervous breakdown.
27,"That was painful to read, I just heard an absolutely functional machine get destroyed for absolutely no reason.

* You could have literally just created a windows USB, booted setup, hit shift + f10 to open command prompt, and copy files out that way via cmd. You don't need anything fancy or custom, that would have worked just fine, and also booted on a surface. [Microsoft has a free program for this purpose](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool).
* Any UEFI bootable device would have worked. [Ubuntu USB would have worked](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows).
* Surfaces are notoriously stupidly difficult to repair. [Ifixit gives it a 1 out of 10 on repairability](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Microsoft_Surface_Pro). I'd have tried *anything* else before trying to crack it open.
* The data wasn't going anywhere, regardless of time frame. If you aren't sure, you should have seeked outside help.

I mean, at the end of the day, yeah you got the data and it was more valuable then the hardware. But you had so, so many other options that would have been better."
28,That sounds like something an ant would say.
29,"*ring*  ""IT.""  
""You told me to press F11, but I can't find the 11 key.  I know it was on my old keyboard, but you all keep messing with stuff and it's so hard to keep up!  I want my old keyboard back!""  "
30,"&gt;please go to the next gas station and buy a quarter gallon of gasoline.
&gt;
&gt;Pour the gasoline over the pc. No need to open it.
&gt;
&gt;Throw a match onto the pc.

Problem solved remotely."
31,"For what its worth, I flew across the entire united states to tighten a ground screw. I feel your pain, though. Thats why you get paid!"
32,I wouldnt put great odds on that ;)
33,"I have to convince my wife to actually *pay* for quality all the time, for reasons exactly like this"
34,"You said:

&gt;I do tech support for an online learning (LMS) company.

The correct answer is:

&gt;I do tech support for an online learning (LMS) company."
35,"""YouTube Uptime Verification duties""

I might have to steal this line for future use lol


Edit: my most popular comment lol"
36,Lying and being wrong are not the same thing. Never attribute to malice that which can be explained through ignorance or incompetence.
37,"Alt+Enter is still very common in games nowadays, very useful for quickly switching between fullscreen and fullscreen windowed for screenshots/multitasking."
38,"Half of IT is learning how to speak ""computer illiterate"""
39,I've seen a password on a post-it note stuck on a monitor in a public area of a hospital. They could at least use proper security and stick the post-it to the bottom of the keyboard like everyone else.
40,"I'm willing to bet that Tech1 knew that as well, but didn't want to lose his job, so stuck to the script.  Just his luck that he got someone with a good bit of knowledge instead of the usual sheep-brained (l)user."
41,"Plot twist: Internet was up, switches/router were powered down to plug in the popcorn machine for the office party..."
42,Some people should just be forbidden to even touch a computer ...
43,Online learning services are notorious about having apparently matching answers that are wrong. It's usually because a different unicode character was used for a math problem or spaces are different.
44,You say that as if you had the option to change it. 
45,".....wow.
I just. I can't even. Good on you for keeping your cool and getting a raise out of it!"
46,I've never heard a *short* story regarding HR shortcomings. We need a /r/talesfrompeoplewhohavetoworkwithHRalot because we could easily fill an encyclopedia-sized collection with anecdotes. 
47,"""Let me see your phone. Is it powered up?""

""Yes, but the screen is off.""

""But it's still on, isn't it?"""
48,"&gt; I'M NOT A PHONE PERSON! YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO HANG UP!


FTFY"
49,You and your coworker each have something to learn from each other. 
50,"Now I want to see this as a real department in IT.


&gt; ""Hello cable stretching department, how long would you like it sir?"""
51,"That actually does make me feel better!  Ill never forget the time I drove 165 miles to plug a printer in.  ""OFCOURSE I checked the cables! Just come fix it!"".  "
52,"It was his dissertation . That's not about GPA. If the man didn't turn it in, he doesn't graduate.

"
53,"The other item you dodged? Assuming this was a single printer and if OD had successfully started his printing **AND** it was a single print job, HB would have somehow made it your fault that OD wasn't done yet. Then she would have started demanding that the OD print job be stopped so she could get what she wanted."
54,"Not my dog, not my fleas."
55,"I can't stand people like that. Ones who only hear and retain what they *want* to hear, not what was actually *said*."
56,"We had an agent that was termed. HR killed their badge access to the building as per policy but the user had a temp badge the day before so security thought they were blocked for that, reactivated their access they come in sat down and try log in.  No access. 

They come to me for unlock assistance. I pulled up their ADID and it's termed. Ouch not gonna be fun they never should have been in the building. 

Second issue is that since I could see who had temp badges the day before anytime I had to do an unlock I'd pulled up the badge logs and see if they had a temp badge the day before and then if they did, ask if security had to manually let them in. If they said yes,  I'd joke ""oh you weren't supposed to be let in today,, joking here is your temp password.  It was well known is make this joke it almost was like a dad joke at this point.

Well I asked user how they got in and they said they had a temp badge yesterday and security had to reactivate them, yeah yeah I know I'm termed where's my temp password? 

Uh uh one second.   Swivel around in my and motion for my boss to come out. He gets up and see the employee and turns bright red, glances at my monitor to verify what we all knew. 

Thankfully he took over from there.

"
57,It was right next to the any key.
58,I want it long... And thick... Oh yeah...
59,"At the risk of breaking rules, here's the fabled laptop:  http://i.imgur.com/0bnCDRT.jpg"
60,"A lot of stories.  Ive been doing this for 10 years (Where I am, 3 years is the normal burnout time for the frontline technical helpdesk) XD

I couldnt say any one event is responsible for me being a little unhinged.  But ive absolutely crossed that threshold.

That said if I do think of any more good stories that i can actually tell properly.."
61,"Teeny tiny arrows, and users that click randomly on the screen."
62,"As someone working in IT, I wish we could ship these people off to an island somewhere so the rest of the world can just move on. They can form their own colony of fellow technophobes and have Sunday mass on the sacred tenants of speaking with the manager for a login issue."
63,"Yeah, sadly it's a typo but I'm leaving it "
64,"I think most of the problem is email programs like Incredimail, which push malware to you on a regular basis causing this particular rift.

Regular users will find and ask for everything from:

* Outlook Express 

* Outlook (Office 2003 through 2016) 

* Incredimail 

* Sometimes Thunderbird (for the more savvy users, but they probably won't need help) 

* Windows Live Mail (unsupported by Microsoft) 

* Windows Mail 

* Mail (Windows 10) 

* Mail (OSX) 

* etc etc.  

But they will inherently *all* be referred to as ***Outlook Express***."
65,I want a nice paying job where I can be an incompetent imbecile. I can only find jobs where they expect results and hard work...it's exhausting.
