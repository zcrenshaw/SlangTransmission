0,Plot twist...  She unplugged the keyboard to make room for her phone charger cable.
1,You have a nice supervisor. 
2,How do people get jobs without knowing what an internet browser is?
3,"I actually love this story, it's like an old man who just needs someone to hang around with."
4,"Women's clothing store manager: 

""Eye wot! Are you tryinna mug me off? You're an arsehole, brown an crispy! I'll tell the rozzers on you, me and all my shop mates 'll get the word out! You ainna customer, yous a feef!"""
5,"Lady failed to plan, tries to blame IT.  Gets herself in trouble instead.

This can't be real.  This just does not happen in IT."
6,"And as the tech left, the man was suddenly consumed by the crowd. Their thirst for cat memes had driven them to madness."
7,It has to do with the TPM (trusted platform module) on the motherboard of the laptop. It resets itself after a number of sequential power cycles. So if it becomes 'corrupt' then you get the missing OS message on boot. When it resets then it passes the boot test and your computer boots properly. How do I know this? 20 or so years of experience and first hand experience :)
8,"""I'm sorry, are you from the past?"""
9,"I really, really, REALLY want to know why this works."
10,Well they did make [iOS before Apple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS)
11,"He worked as a CSR like me for 3 years so he gets it. Doesn't take shit from customers and always stands his ground,  he's a top bloke."
12,"Because they put ""Proficient with Internet/E-Mail, Word, Excel, DNS, and TCP/IP""* on their resume and nobody checks or holds them accountable for it.  They just tell them to call the Help Desk.


^*Seriously, ^I ^get ^resumes ^all ^the ^time ^that ^say ^this ^exact ^thing."
13,"Unfortunately, this is most likely what happened. "
14,He is probably still completely disoriented after deleting 'compass app'
15,The choice of name ensured that I read all of Vladimir's lines in an extraordinarily strong caricature of a Russian accent. It was wonderful   
16,"Give any website address and I can tell you its IP address.  Go on, quiz me!"
17,At least she thanked you. I know many users who would just walk away thinking they solved your problem.
18,"My first question in the interview would be, ""What exactly do you mean proficient with DNS?"""
19,"&gt;  rozzers

noun BRITISH informal

plural noun: rozzers

a police officer."
20,"One of these days, winrar will start banning people."
21,And this makes it fucking difficult when you're trying to fix weird undocumented issues with iOS devices because once you get out of the top 10k issues its just sysadmins with broken phone systems. 
22,"Had a similar thing when I was installing TV satellite dishes. Customer called and asked for the guy who did his install, but didn't want to give any details, just wanted to know if I was the guy or not. 

I don't know if I am, I do 4 installs a day, 5 days a week, and I'm not the only one who works here. Give me something to work with here.

After some back and forth I just outright asked him if I broke something, did I hit on his wife, did I owe him money, was he suing me? That's when he realized he was being ridiculous and gave me a few details. Can't remember now what he wanted but it was inanely simple."
23,"Oy, this is one where I hope the calls are recorded.    Some crazy end-user complains to management, so there's a support meeting.

Everyone there listens to the recording and starts wondering, ""Did she really say she doesn't know anything about those 'puters, despite having a job that requires using one?""   Then they laugh and recommend she goes in for training and be put on probation."
24,Why did $c have permission to delete data on the bootcamp partition? Couldn't that be protected?
25,I struggle to understand people still using winrar... 7zip all the way
26,"&gt; ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT!""

Can't? Clearly, I can. I think you meant to say ""You may not do that,"" but the contract clearly states that access will never be compromised, and in the event that it is, that I have the right to regain access.  
So: I can, I may, and - as you may have noticed - I already have.  
Any questions? Feel free to address them to this hole in the wall."
27,"&gt;*I've gone ahead and disabled her IT access due to leaving a machine unattended*

You.  I like you."
28,"Dat last minute desperate save attempt... ""My name is Carol!"" - that's one for the ages.

Also, how do these people expect anything to happen if they don't mention their address or anything... it's just mind-blowingly stupid. And rude."
29,found the australian
30,Let's see. R.edd.it 18.544.920. Yep that's the one. 
31,Nö problem. Jeep up the good work.
32,"It's their computer that they bought in for a couple weeks, I reported that to department manager but she said just let it through"
33,"What the fuck is really all I can say. I've had plenty of users confused by the term ""Internet Browser"" but to not even seem to know how they get to the internet or have a browser icon is dumbfounding"
34,"Man.... I used to work helpdesk at a newspaper in the late 90s. At one point, they started giving employees laptops. Some of them were reporters. Before each person got one, you had to come down to IT and take a training class. One of the main thing covered by this training class was, and this was emphasized REPEATEDLY during the class, absolutely, positively never, ever unplug the cord from the phone in your hotel room and plug it into your laptop's modem. It would physically fry the modem (something about the analog modems couldn't handle digital signals). There actually was a time for a while when the phones in hotel rooms had a jack you on the side you could plug your modem into. If the phone didn't have this, you were pretty much screwed.
 
At any rate, imagine all of the irate calls from reporters. WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S BROKEN? I HAVE TO FILE THIS STORY IN 20 MINUTES? 
 
I felt bad for them, but I sat in one of those training sessions. When someone tells you something repeatedly, maybe there's a reason it's being emphasized."
35,"""Jeep up"" wasn't obvious enough? Since jeeps are naturally upside down, if it's up, OP must be upside down."
36,Silence followed by a loud FFS! Then I got to go home early ;).
37,"At first I thought this was going to be another Bob, overly attached to you for helping them. Glad I am wrong! Glad to see some end users still appreciate tech supoort. There's too many negative (although funny) stories of lusers seeing a story like this is refreshing."
38,I REQUIRE IMAGE MACROS FOR SUSTENANCE
39,"Once again, Sales going ""Sure, we can do it, of course""....  
And then the tech departments have to get it working because ""We already sold it"".

I know that Sales gets the customers that pay our paychecks, but sometimes I really hate their ""Gotta get this sell, no matter what"" attitude.

You really dodged a bullet there in getting the customer to agree you wouldn't be setting up the GFS2 cluster"
40,Nice!! Glad to hear an explanation of what was clearly black magic otherwise!
41,"1. Good for the kid; being able to recognize similarities across platforms and apply that basic knowledge to accomplish tasks in an unfamiliar computing environment is a skill most adults lack.  

2.  Good for the mom; some adults aren't  even phased when their kid gets grabby.  Hopefully she corrected his behavior."
42,"A 5yo came to the shop the other day with him mom and while we were talking, he quietly picked up the tablet I keep around for card payments, plopped himself on the couch and proceeded to navigate to the games folder, pick one and start playing. Mom was irritated he hadn't asked for permission, but I thought it was pretty interesting that he could successfully navigate around a strange-to-him tablet with no hesitation. He did tell me I needed 'more fun' games, though."
43,"Users. If they are not whining, they are stealing women's clothing."
44,"&gt; $seniorTech: Yeah, you just unplugged the router to charge the thing. That's why the wifi went out.

Any idiot tax on the bill? Hope it was said loudly so everyone could hear, instead of it being a small office.

Somewhat  related, I am starting to transition some of my own set up into power over ethernet for such issues just to reduce cord clutter, and optimize the number of UPSes I have in my apartment."
45,"Right, but who's more likely to try and fix undocumented issues?"
46,"""Vadimir. Vladimir! Vladimir!!! VLADIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!""

""WHAT???""

""...danger zone!"""
47,"The ThinkPad variant (disconnect all power sources, attempt to turn computer on ten times) was to discharge any residual power hanging around in capacitors or whatnot.

Maybe this is similar, there's some widget staying ""alive"" when it shouldn't and power cycling will eventually discharge it.

Edit: go read /u/unwoundwalnut 's post for a more informed reply "
48,There's something very wrong about that IP address.
49,"... or management just do nothing, because they're management after all. Calling out this woman for being dangerously stupid would be anti-hr (or some shit), she will probably get off with a slap on the wrist whilst merrily pondering how the pretty colours on her 'puter screen work - completely oblivious to her stupid demands and sense of entitlement."
50,"Out for dinner one night with some friends, and one of their 4yrold kids. He's playing angrybirds or whatever on his mom's phone, when the battery dies. Of course, he wants to keep playing, so one of the other guys in the group says ""here kid, use my phone""... and slides over his old Blackberry. 

Kid picks it up, pokes the screen a few times, and throws it back, ""your phone doesn't work"". 

And that's when that kid learned the greatest lesson in life: nobody likes Blackberry."
51,Disabling the account... Awesome.
52,File note: User is illiterate.  Notification sent to user's manager for remedial training.
53,"An employee walked up to me one morning to tell me there was a raccoon in the dumpster.   

Employee: ""Hey, there's a raccoon in the dumpster.""  
Me: ""Ok""  
Employee: ""Well?""  
Me: ""Well, what?""  
Employee: ""Aren't you going to do something?""  
Me: ""Does the raccoon require internet access?""  
Employee: ""No!""  
Me: ""Does the raccoon plug into the wall?""  
Employee: ""NO!""  
Me: ""Failed to meet the IT responsibility test, not my problem.""  

She told her manager I was being an ass to her. I got to explain to my boss later when he asked about it.  

He rolled his eyes."

55,"My friend used to work in CS and every Wednesday a lonely old lady would call her and ask to speak to her specifically. Never had any particular problems, was just lonely."
56,Dont you just love users who think they can evade the standard way of doing things
57,"Maybe the mouse and keyboard were plugged into the front USB holes and she pulled out the keyboard for the phone, and didn't want to try to reach around to the back because that's blue collar work. "
58,"""I CAN'T STAND IT! I KNOW YOU PLANNED IT!"""
59,"A kid carrying around a screwdriver at school would likely just get them in trouble now, improvised weapon and all that."
60,"Secret tricks to being good at tech support include:

* Knowing how to Google.
* Reading menus.
* Being able to recognize which plugs go into which ports, even if you've never seen them before.

You'd think most people would've learned that last one around preschool with those shape sorter toys where you put the shapes in the appropriately shaped holes."
61,What did your boss say when he found out that that was the issue?
62,"When an outage occurs at my office, our Support team uses an email marketing program to coordinate delivery of the outage notification and any updates to our customers (each one as its own campaign). It's far from ideal, but it's what we have at the moment.

One day, one of our most vocal customers experienced a fairly major outage. Support tech jumps on the bridge, gets an update on what's going on, types up the verbiage, and sends it to his boss to approve. While waiting, he opens the new campaign, imports the communication template, and gets the recipients configured. Boss approves, and he clicks ""Send.""

... without first copying the message into the template, or really making any changes to it at all.

The customer receives an email that goes something like this:

&gt; **Subject:** Insert subject here  
&gt; **Body:** Insert customer name here:
&gt; 
&gt; Insert detailed status message here
&gt; 
&gt; Insert signature here
&gt;
&gt; &lt;Company logo&gt;

My boss went to the office admin and had a new name plate ordered for said Support tech. When he arrived at work the next day, his nameplate said ""Insert Name Here.""

It's still there."

64,"BYOD...this is often such a clusterfsck for mobile phones, I usually wonder what drugs the decision makers do when they approve BYOD for notebooks."
65,"You'd think it'd be the other way around, with iPhone users outnumbering IOS admins roughly a million to one. "
66,"It's crazy how people don't physically understand that IT doesn't mean we understand every app and program on the face of the earth. 



My go to line to help is, ""We don't specialize in that, it's like asking your dentist to check your hearing. You can talk to 'xyz' about this issue, I'm very sorry I wasn't trained for that."""
67,"&gt;  C: ""But it's just a screen though innit?""  

Nope.  Capacitive touch, gorilla glass, etc.  There's quite a bit of tech rolled up into that shattered little dream you call a screen..."
68,Who are all of these crazy people who have jobs? Shouldn't they be unemployed?
69,"Yeah haha, I am really looking forward to his next email. I am super curious what happened afterwards :P"
70,"&gt; I also paid for a license years and years ago.

So you're the guy..."
71,"to be clear, youre saying someone tried to print on to toilet paper?"
72,"Very nice.

Everything is indeed IT.  My favorite ticket for IT was a complaint about geese in the parking lot.  Actually, I should say tickets.  ... yes, there was more than one.  The phrase ""this affects my ability to work"" was indeed included. "
73,"The obvious solution:  just wash the whole thing and hang dry it, should be good as new just like this laptop!

Find a shabbily dressed guy in a blue police box. Maybe he can take you back in time before the deadline closed."

78,"&gt; Standard disclaimer: Not IT. Worked for a number of years in my University days as IT for family and friends, due to my ability to google things and make logical guesses as to which plugs fit into which ports.

84,"&gt;Me: mmhh, kind of hard to explain something if you don't ask.

Surprising how sometimes that doesn't get through to people."
85,"Our Chromebooks also do this on occasion. And that's the solution. 

The Dell Venues are even worse. When I shipped mine to another school, I emailed the tech over there: 

""Here's a list of 3 or 4 things to try if they *just won't turn on*. Run through this list, one at a time. One should work, but no telling which one. If none work? Run through it again. It'll work eventually.""

So no, no idiot tax applied. Yet."
94,I miss the days when they tried to train users. 
95,"It always surprises me how rude users can be when they need your help. Especially when its something they did wrong. I literally asked a user once
