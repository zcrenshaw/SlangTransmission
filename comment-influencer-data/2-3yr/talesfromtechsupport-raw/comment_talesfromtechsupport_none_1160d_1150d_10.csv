4,"okay, my mom can top that. She once plugged a DVI into a VGA port by simply rasping every pin that wasn't fitting. I never saw such a thing ever again."
5,"Of course it's not. 

&gt; I still can't believe this guy opened up a computer store.

I don't believe it either. Seriously, the owner pays for the inventory when it comes in the back, he knows what the merchandise is worth. "
6,I don't even understand how she thought that would do anything

15,"&gt; I demand you to push your little buttons and fix this problem 


yes.. because that's how tech support works. "
16,"Your response to that is:

Yes sir, i can get right on top of that. I can be on site within 12 hours. Matt I have your email address for invoice processing?  We require 75% non refundable deposit before we dispatch our techs. 

Then send him an invoice for like $20,000. "
17,"&gt;$LEM: ""Glad you're here, I REALLY F****D IT UP NOW.""

The fact that he said **I** and not **YOU** in that sentence immediately qualifies him for favored status."
18,"Holy crap, why would anyone think that would work.

No offense."
19,I really want to say that whoever coded the site did that to troll someone.
20,Tech aura ftw!

You should make that your flair. Sums up IT work in SO many ways

~~5th~~ Step 0?  is backing up important folder/files if you need anything critical, if at all possible.

Edit for logic"
26,"I would move the backup step from 5 to 1, but hey, whatever works for you."

28,"This went from ""idiotic user doesn't want to admit he's an idiot"" to ""I understand this poor (still idiotic) woman."" Nice one!"
29,But you have so much internet to use. You couldn't give them a helping of it?
30,"Had to Google that one! Slip in Dutch means women's underwear so I was like ""fired with cake and pink panties?""

31,I knew a guy who thought you only needed 2 intact pins on a CPU for it to work.... yeah...
32,"If he has to ask for help at that stage, he certainly shouldn't be attempting the process on his own... And knowing words like ""boot-nuke"" makes me think he learned just enough here and there to be dangerous."
33,Maybe... But he can definitely do something about that massive burn
34,"Years ago, I was talking to a locksmith, who was sharing some stories of the good ol' days.

He said you should never be too quick when you pick a lock, open a file cabinet etc. For one thing, it makes the owner lookk bad because he spend money on something that was so easily defeated, and for another, it makes them less likely to want to pay you.

Case in point. A guy calls up one night to get his car unlocked. This was in the early 70s, back when the normal charge was only $15.00. This was in the evening, though, so he quoted him $20.00. Customer agrees to the charge, so he goes in with the slim jim. Hooks the door latch (*not* the lock), pulls upward and click, the door swings right open. Easy as pi.  

""$20.00 please.""

""What! I ain't paying no twenty dollars for that!""

""Suit yourself, sir."" He slams the door and starts walking back to the service truck. Now note, he'd only defeated the latch, never touched the lock itself . . . so the button is still down, and the lock is still in the locking position.

Guy tries to get into the car. What do you know. It's still locked.

""*Hey!!* Get back here!""

""Yes, *sir*?""

""All right, I'll pay you! Now open the car!""

""That'll be $40.00, please. In advance.""

""What!! You just said it was twenty!""

""Sure, but now I have to do it twice.""

(And yes, the guy paid the 40, because what else was he going to do? Call another locksmith?)"

37,"3.5"" floppy? She wouldn't be the first to call one of those a ""hard disk"", and if the boss said ""copy the hard disk every night""...  Also, RAPID  - Redundant Array of Pictures of Inexpensive Disks.  "
38,"Mom: ""We don't negotiate with terrorists. You'll just have to kill my son."""
39,"All those extra pins probably just go to ground, and we all know you can just cut those off."
40,Thats literally called learning it. You described learning it.
41,"To be honest, it's more in this case (my opinion anyway),  
an *insulting tax*, with stupidity added on.  
Implying OP's skills are worthless and not needed - anyone can do it.  
Turns out, the customer was ***even more mindless*** than what he thought OP was."
42,"This was not an option. You see, my boss was a shady fucker and...well....that's a whole other story...."
43,But it makes for a hell of a firewall.

45,"I was expecting something along the lines of ""We knocked this wall down and now we've broken our network because we destroyed cables inside the wall."""
46,"For someone who probably has very little technical knowledge, that's not a terrible chain of logic. She sees something that doesn't look like it belongs on the website (because it doesn't, probably), which leads her to think that the website might have been compromised (which I'd call fairly reasonable), which then makes her worried that her own computer is at risk for visiting it (which, if the website *is* compromised, is a good assumption to make). "
47,"Asked a caller to back up the storage server prior to blowing away the RAID array and rebuilding it. Five seconds later he tells me he was finished with the back up. He placed a floppy in the drive and copied the three icons on the desktop to the disk. 

He was also bragging about how he was the head of IT for this big company and how a ""High School drop out making minimum wage"" should not be telling him how to run his backups. 

I always thought this was the worst backup fail I had seen, you just topped my list. "
48,"""Make a copy of this disk,  write the date on it, and put it in a safe place.""

 Guarantee that's what happened."
49,My favorite editor for Cup of Tea is Harbor IDE.
50,"Right, it was 3.5 inch floppy and she did refer to it as a hard disk.  She told me with a straight face that the hard disk backups were done every night before she left the office.  I honestly thought I was being pranked, but no - it was for real.  To give some perspective, this wasn't a high tech office at all, it was an office in a factory and the workers were pretty ignorant to technology, or perhaps a better phrase is ""computer illiterate""."
51,"I worked for the cow spotted computer company back when the founder still ran it.

Our store manager had no clue. He would have done that if he didn't have an SOP to tell him."
52,Why did you push the little buttons to break it in the first place?
53,I've been actively looking elsewhere for work. The red flags I'm seeing are insane.
54,Love the tl;dr. I'm a teacher and I'm going to need to use that one in the classroom. 
55,Does she also expect Google to roll out a patch for her iPad?
56,"""Well, Your Honor, I Googled 'tech support' and it was the first link that came up. I believe that carries a distinct responsibility."""
57,At the end I was thinking I might have been in /r/nosleep
58,"Getting interrupted like that is a pet peeve of mine. After a couple of times I usually let them finish talking and wait several seconds just looking at them to be sure they're actually done before I start again. If there's another interruption I again wait and start my previous response over again, word for word, identical intonation. Most people take the hint that their interruptions are just slowing things down and start letting me finish. "
59,"Oh, it wouldn't be the first time my tech aura has fixed something."
60,"The bill would be going to her for the engineer that had to go out there and the money that had to be spent because of ignorance, ""pride"" and stupidity"
61,"It doesn't surprise me at all.

I once worked at Harvard. Outside my office was a desk, at which sat a professor's secretary... an elderly woman nearing retirement. She was always very sweet. She knocked timidly on my office door one day, and asked me for help with her computer. Having some support experience, I didn't make any assumptions, and asked in detail what she was trying to do. 

The hard drive was full, and she was getting an error trying to save a letter with Wordperfect. I asked a lot of details, and learned that she sent this same letter for the professor about 3 times a week, and kept a copy in the filing cabinet... 3 times a week, every week, for years, she would take that copy out, retype the letter, print it, and save it. Never opened the file from the hard drive again, she just saved it, with the current date in the filename. 

So there were thousands of copies of the same letter saved, in multiple folders. I had to delete most of them. When I showed her how to load a previously saved document, it was as if the heavens had opened and a choir of angels sang my praises to her. She was so grateful, she had never imagined that files could be *opened* after they were saved. "
62,I regret not doing this. Brilliant.
63,"They've forgotten the golden rule of retail:

""The customer is always unfathomably stupid"""

Your roof is leaking, why don't you fix it? I can't fix it while it's raining. Why don't you fix it when it's not raining? Because it's not leaking then."
66,"Just a word of advice: when the client has described their issue, don't reply with ""no problem"". It's a phrase that can inflame them because, to them, it very much is a problem. Try ""OK, I understand"", or ""OK, let me bring that up""; ""Let me follow up on that""; or, often best of all ""Can you help me with a few more details ... "" leading into your questions.

Don't think I'm picking on your response because I'm not. It's just that one in 20 callers or so will instantly be annoyed by being told ""No problem""."
67,"&gt;Me: Have you tried Googling the problem?
TS: Yes, but I couldn't find anything. I also left a message on a forum and I don't have any replies yet.

This means they are idiots. It was most likely the first thing to pop up in Google. If they get no replies it is usually a good indicator that they are asking a stupid question they could find dozens of answers to if they Googled it. I hear things like this daily, no effort."

72,"I gave them a helping of my time, they'll be billed for that later. At the rate they're going, we're probably going to be losing them as a client. They're behind with us too, but my boss has a soft spot for charity places and can be a bit lax. But even he can go so far. "
73,Probably someone instructed her to make a copy of the disc...

""You mean the box? There's nothing on top of it."""

79,"You're a lawyer huh? Great, you can fix my legal issue then. No, I won't tell you what the issue is, I demand you fix it anyway."
80,"&gt; US CEO: Again, no clue. I'm the CEO. I'm on the board. I run the damn company. Is that not enough information for you?

This kills me.  Yes, you blowhard, I know that.  THAT'S WHY YOUR ACCOUNT IS SO IMPORTANT TO SECURE.  That's why I'm going to have to be REALLY CAREFUL that I don't give YOUR account away to some social engineering attack.  You should be happy that I'm this stringent about your account.

Of course, that's just a pipe dream.  Hell, we had a CEO of a client company that went fucking ballistic on us because we refused to make his account ""ceo"" and password ""ceo"".  Not joking at all, it went way up to SVPs and such on our side before he was finally told to pound sand and accepted it."

88,"Something similar happened to me years ago. The company hired a new CIO, he wanted me out from the day he walked in the door, his friend who was a network engineer needed a job, and yea he was gonna get my job.

Anyway, I wasn't working there anymore, I get a phone call from the CFO,

CFO: Hey Marakush how's it going?

Me: okay what's up?

CFO: hey we had an issue here with the server clusters, do you have a copy of the install codes, and encryption keys and stuff like that?

Me: Nope, but there is a directory on my old computer it is encrypted the passphrase is 'CIO_loves_the_cock' there is also a hard-copy in my locked file cabinet in the office, keys are in my desk.

Now a friend was still working there he told me that the new CIO and his buddy network engineer were in my office and threw all my hard files away, and were laughing as they formatted my computer just 2 days before all of this happened.
