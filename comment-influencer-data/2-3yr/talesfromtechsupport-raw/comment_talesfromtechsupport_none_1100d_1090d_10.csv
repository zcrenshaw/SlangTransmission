0,"You should NOT remote in and help him correct the return date because he's obviously still very, very sick... "
1,"That's where you escalate your user contact. If the user becomes unavailable on a high-priority ticket, you contact the user's manager. If they're unavailable, you escalate again. Interrupt people important enough (""I'm sorry, but as this is a top priority ticket, we are required to follow up until it is resolved.""), and the shit will start flowing down the appropriate side of the hill.

Also, everybody thinks their issue is high priority, because it is to them. Try adding text labels by the scale of the impact instead."
2,This means that somewhere two non-IT types are talking to each other trying to figure out their problems.
3,"Yeah, IT is often hated. Because we don't 'earn money' for the company, only spend it. and as long as everything works, people can't see what use we are. "
4,"&gt; I just thought

No you haven't."
5,"Theory.  Customer calls one IT department, realizes they called the wrong number, immediately calls the correct IT department, realizes that they didn't hang up first, and then hangs up on both right as you both pick up the phone.

Sounds like a reasonable chain of events for someone who needs IT."
6,You can't take sick days for the disease that guy has...
7,"&gt;$Usr - Why do we have a pdf printer if it doesn't print pdf's?

You have to admit, there is a some logic to his reasoning."
8,"&gt;Are you a rubbish chat bot sent to test me?

I LOL'd. This is the the type of user that every IT support personnel dreads. Ouch."
9,"Congratulations, you will now be supporting this until the end of your career (at that company). :)"
10,"That's a great story, but what's better is that she realized she would need your time as well and actually booked for an hour, instead of turning up and expecting an hours worth of training in five minutes.

Glad to hear that your business is gaining recognition.
"
11,Those first two sentences. Had to double check to make sure I wasn't in r/startrek by accident.
12,"You shouldn't stand for that, report him to his manager for incompetence. 

On the other hand, they might try and rope you in to training him in basic IT... "
13,i never realized how important this was till I read this. I always get annoyed when my manager tells me to write the steps down for even  a 2 year old to follow them. 
14,"He bought some nice shampoo and conditioner and followed the instructions.

&gt; Lather  
&gt; Rinse  
&gt; Repeat  

If his wife hadn't come home when she did he might still be in the shower now..."
15,"It is also about salaries, people, who work physically are often thinking that other work is worthless. I hate it, because no honest work is worse or better. Right now I'm an IT manager and this thing is still visible when I'm walking to canteen to eat. Why people have to be so... jealous? I don't even know how to call it, but it makes me feel sad. I would grab a beer with them, they would spit in mine."
16,"""Hello IT, have you tried setting it on fire and putting it out again?"""
17,Isn't that how black holes are created?
18,I think this might be because I didn't updoot a post once.
19,"When a user started to repeatedly ask the same question I would usually just reply with my same answer over and over again. I didn't mind being stuck in an infinite loop, the user would always give up before I did."
20,"Hahahaha! Thank you. But truth be told, my confidence stemmed from proper ticket management and that I followed up numerous times. If I had just passed the ticket along and pretended it was someone else's problem, things might have turned out differently. Now, that I am in management, I try to teach my subordinates to always ask themselves what else they can do. To take a proactive approach to their job. "
21,"I think it's a good idea to plug that computer back in before you leave for the day. With luck, all your problems will be solved by morning."
22,The phone signal was coming from INSIDE YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT!
23,"So you work in a building with no fire detector in your office area, is that even legal?"
24,I love how big your balls are. Welcome to the club of mot being afraid cause someone else isn't doing their job
25,Three weeks later you realise the mouse is missing. 
26,There's a good one about a developer who collapsed from exhaustion in the shower while trying to wash his hair. 
27,"or hits ""Transfer"" instead of ""Release""?"
28,I have no idea. I mean we already don't have clean drinking water and the warehouse is infested with mold. So no fire detectors are the least of my issues here. 
29,"Yeah, we did that over at my MSP:  
Critical - everyone in the company is heavily impacted.  
High - some people are impacted, and can't do their job.  
Moderate - one person can't work, or multiple people are impacted but can work around it.  
Low - single user impacted, but can work around, or request for information.

For example, printer died, but the user has one available in the next office over, that's a low priority. A big MFP died, and it's the only one on the floor? That becomes a moderate or high, depending on where the printer is located."
30,He needed the D:
31,"I had a boss say this to me once. My response was: ""Haha... no. You use it to make money, you'll pay me to fix it, or I won't.""

He thought about it for a minute opened his mouth to say something, then walked away. I do not work for free."
32,"well I suspect that a big part of the hate for IT departments is that we quite often change things for very valid reasons however end users don't see that or understand the reasons, they just see a distruption or change to their workflow.


as an example, I'm currently helping a large chain of car dealerships roll out a new centralised phone system.  Now the IT department has come up with a plan for a standard numbering system across all dealerships and various other good ideas. 

the issue is that that has changed each dealership from being able to dial 0 for their reception to having to dial a 5 digit number instead and further more they didn't actually bother to consult with the dealerships before starting to implement it they just went for it

the end result is that the project has stalled after 3 of 33 dealerships while we work out the kinks and figure out how to keep each dealership happy.  The main upshot everyone hates IT with a passion for rolling out a stupid phone system that doesn't work, even thou it does work, just not the way they are expecting."
33,"Yup.

Either it's company property, and the company pays me to work on it, or it's my property and the company pays me to use it."

36,"Because IT is like retail, all you do is screw stuff up and break shit, so it's okay for you to have to stay. People like the user are important, they have lives outside of work. Everyone knows retail and IT do not. /s

Edit: fixed a word"
37,"Back around the same time, I used to have to write complete RoI's for every computer we bought.  I had to estimate how much actual time (in minutes) each task took on the old computer versus the new one, then I had to work out how often each task was performed by the user, etc.  It would sometimes take me two days to write the RoI. Ridiculously inefficient."
38,"User logic: ""I'm on the wrong line, so I need to 'transfer' my call from this one to the correct one, just like when I 'transfer' between trains!""

(presses transfer button)"
39,"""I'll just put this over here, with the other fire."""
40,My bosses and basically every senior person I've worked with has mentioned in a serious manner about the fact that anyone of us could die at any second and we should make sure that our stuff is documented... least we are unable to know what'd happen. They call it... code as if you're going to get hit by the bus the next day.
41,Yeah I don't really blame the user on this one: there's no reason to expect them to know what virtual printers are. 
42,"From the sound of it you might have straight up saved their life just by listening.  The ""I'm just wasting your time"" thing isn't uncommon for people dealing with severe depression."
43,I have called in stupid before 
44,&gt; But I am back now.
45,Of course supporting this widget that you created will not excuse you from the responsibilities you were hired to do. Aka you will do it in your spare time 
46,"I am currently punishing my users by offering training for everything.  I get a stupid question about pivot tables from a department that relies on them, then I recommend to management that they need more pivot table training, which I'd be HAPPY to ~~drone on about for at least an hour~~ teach (1:15 actually, on how to create a pivot table, which can be done in 3 clicks).  

They can't fault me for providing training, but they've stopped asking questions as much...  Perhaps they've found Google?  Or perhaps I've broken their spirits...  :-)"
47,"Hey, as long as it's me that they are paying to do it then I'm happy"
48,"""Full power test successfully completed, engine and cooling can safely maintain travel at that rate for two full test cycles without issue. You're welcome."""
49,"""You need to go see HR for training on using their system."""
50,"But we can, right?"
51,"It should be possible to have a single-digit call to the reception even if it's a centralized system.  
Works slightly different than the old system = doesn't work.  
but whoever decided not to consult the users should be taken out back and introduced to a length of lead pipe."
52,"1. Open/create document in Word
2. Double-click bottom of document to open footer for editing
3. Go to ""Design"" in the green ""Header &amp; Footer Tools"" area of the ribbon menu
4. Under ""Insert"", click ""Document Info"" and select ""File path""

Bonus points for saving this as a template (*.dotx) so that when double-clicked, a new, otherwise blank document is created that already has this field in the footer (albeit with ""Document1""). It updates itself whenever you print the document or export to PDF/XPS (i.e. it is always accurate), or you can update the path manually by right-clicking the field and selecting ""Update field"". It will not detect any changes automatically if you rename or move the doc and then open it, but doing any of the above (print/export/manual) will force such an update to commence.

57,"I worked in the financial industry.  That log just gave me flashbacks. Like 80% of the calls I got went exactly like that.  I'm blown away that people who can't process a simple message like ""Password expired, please change password"" are managing hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars.  I wanted to try and implement some kind of training but quickly abandoned it because I realized it'd turn into Computers 101 down at the senior center.  We got a voice mail one time that went exactly like this:

""This is $User, my number is 123-456-7890.  I can't give you a brief description of the problem because it's not brief.  This is $User, my number is 123-456-7890. This is $User, my number is 123-456-7890. Getting the problem? This is $User, my number is 123-45-click""

62,At what point is it 'I'll being contacting your manager' stupid? Surely this person exceeds that.

67,"I had a job doing environmental management for a tannery during Uni and part of that was to make sure that the pH of the waste water was at about 10. One time it had been exactly on 10 for a good hour so I pointed this out to my my offsider and asked him to check that the probe was okay.

So he took it out and put it in our reference liquid and it read exactly right so he reported back that it was fine. Only problem was the the reference liquid had a pH of exactly 10 as well.

I think we ended up replacing the probe."

69,"Honestly that's one of the things I really respect about that generation - without immediate communication, things had to be planned ahead, and as a result, people just respected each others' time more. I feel like nowadays with the advent of instant messaging and the ability to easily see and meet up with people we take those experiences (and others' time) for granted :("
70,"Retail/Customer Service def cops it worse than IT tho.

Another contract my company supports is McDonalds. I was on site the other day replacing and reimaging a terminal on the front counter. It was an ultra busy day, and there was just a single girl taking orders. People would keep coming up to me placing their orders, and Id keep having to tell them I dont work there. They were all pleasant enough about it and got back in line.

The girl serving next to me though, copped it all. They blasted her about there only being one person on the counter, why is everything so slow etc etc."

Submited as a priority 1 ticket. No room number. No contact info. Just the name of the person who submitted it. Hunted down that persons schedule and walked into the classroom.

Now. Something you might not know about college professors is they *really* hate having their classes interrupted. And the ones at *community* colleges are worse because they're bitter they have to work at a community college.

So I walked in and he cops an attitude. I explain that a priority 1 ticket needs to be handled *right now* as per our departmental SLA. He doesn't care, kicks me out of his classroom.

            TICKET STATUS: CLOSED
            Notes: User refused service. Closing ticket.

83,"My father was a RIO (radar intercept officer) in an F-14 back in the day, and one night he and his pilot were given leave to fly from the aircraft carrier, which was offshore, to the mainland for some boring task. Well, once they were done, they stopped by a pizza parlor and got a pizza for themselves, ~~since cafeteria food on aircraft carriers left something to be desired.~~ As they were sitting down to enjoy their lovely little dinner, they heard their names barked over the intercom telling them to report to the XO's (executive officer's) office. When they got there, the conversation went something like this: 

""It has come to my attention that you brought a pizza with you! Is this true?""

""Yes...""

""Did you bring enough for everyone?""

""...""

""Then get back out there!""

They then spent a larger portion of the night running what was probably one of the most expensive pizza delivery services to date, made worse by the fact that the only cargo F-14s are designed to hold are the pilots and a whole bunch of assorted missiles, not pizza.

Where I live every year the workers sit down with the company and try to work the salary and benefits adjustment so that we can compensate for the ever growing inflation. When this reunion does not achieve any success for the workers, they go on strike. (Yes, every year) When IT goes on strike no one notices, because everything still works, so IT going on strike means nothing.  

Well...  

We are already hated, right? I am trying to get approved a policy that states something along these lines:
