1,"In cases like this (and this is an extreme as federal crimes are involved) I always think of a bit from Penn and Teller's classic ""How to Play with Your Food"".  

One of the chapters is how to make a pickle glow in the dark.  I have seen it done and it's a fun nerd party trick (the Ba-Tampte pickled tomatoes work even better as they become glowing orbs).  

The text basically says ""You run electric current through the pickle.  If you have to ask any more questions about how, you definitely shouldn't be doing it.""  

EDIT:  Wow, my most popular ever Reddit comment!  Y'all have some great stories and ""Electric Pickle"" will be the name of my Sixties cover band.   For some of you, I think they might have said ""house current"" (it's been a while) which may provide all the info you need.  "

3,"Back in the days of twin half height 5 1/4 inch floppies, I calculated that there were 53 wrong ways for a user to ""insert disk in drive A:"". How is this?

Disk can be inserted in any of 4 orientations.
Repeat except upside down, makes 8.
Repeat except leave the disk in the paper envelope, makes 16.
User takes disk out of the plastic jacket, makes 17.
Out of jacket and upside down, makes 18.
Repeat all of above, but user puts disk in drive B: by mistake, makes 36.
Repeat for gap between the drives, makes 54 ways.

Of the 54 ways, only one is correct."
4,"I work in a hardware store. Had a guy one time ask where the outlets were. Showed them to him, then he asked if there was a difference between indoor and outdoor outlets. I told him I wasn't sure, and before I could say anything else, he cut me off and said ""Why are you here then? What do you do?""

I know better than to change my own outlets without knowing anything about them."
5,My parents have to get a new laptop battery every year. They never turn the computer off and set it on the carpet in between use.
6,"I want, so desperately, to call you a liar. I want to believe that this is just a fairytale, that no one is possibly that inept with technology. 

But I can't."
7,Have a nice what...HAVE A NICE WHAT?!?!
8,Appease her. Buy her the most expensive computer the budget will allow. Let this keep happening until finance puts a stop to it. 
9,These types of people are actually a danger to themselves. They think they're getting one over on Google by going to some potentially shady free app download site and will end up with some other party stealing their data instead.
10,"""I don't want to have to click a button. It's easier for me to call you to have you click the button"""

12,Probably used to it randomly coming up for no reaaon
13,"If I had the knowledge on what was suitable for use and how to install it, would I be making minimum wage selling it to people giving me attitude?  Unless *you* know what you're doing, I'm pretty sure electrical work in your house isn't a DIY project."
14,"Oh my god that is perfect!

She retired this year however, so I guess I'll have to save that plan for the next sap..."
15,"She also fundamentally does not understand version control. 

Or cloud storage. *At all*. This company has never had any kind of shared drives - absolutely everything was in My Documents on your C: drive - until the end of last year.

I could weep."
16,"I work for regional ISP, and we still have 7 dialup users... We have to refer (all of us were dialup problem DIVAS) to our old ass notes.."

20,"I have no sympathy for these people. I don't care how much they want to blame it on those ""crazy newfangled computers""; they're absolutely dead wrong.

The typewriter was invented in 1868, 149 years ago. The QWERTY layout was invented in 1872. There is literally no person alive today who didn't live in an era where keyboards using today's layout couldn't be found, in at least some capacity. If you can't be bothered in the many decades of your life to achieve even basic competency on an everyday technology that literally predates the automobile (1885), the light switch (1884), and even public electricity (1879), I don't think you should be allowed to work in any kind of an important field. Even janitors have to submit logs electronically."
21,I'm impressed.  I wouldn't think someone could screw something up that many different ways.
22,"""Hold on Sir, I call in our Expert""

*calls police*"
23,"&gt; this is why we are meant to be involved in the technical discussions so we can advise of what's possible before it gets to this stage

25,"These people are kind of the anti-vaxxers of the tech world (probably anti-vaxxer for real, too.). Her friend/grandchild/news anchor told her that google is collecting data, so she doesn't want to use google. 

She doesn't think about the context of these actions. She doesn't trust google, it's as simple as that. You can't expect her to know where OP got the app from. For all she knew or cared he could've got it from the store's warehouse. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that she doesn't trust google.

So don't trust google."
26,"""Foolproof"" is a challenge to the world to create a better fool."
27,This aptly describes 80% of my job. I built a admin page for my boss so she could update the news feed on our main page herself instead of having to call me. Nope... kept calling me. At least *someone* (me) uses the tool.
28,"""Power User""..."
29,"Short of running great lengths of Romex, it's really not that difficult. Outlets are stupid simple, I've lost count of how many I've changed out or added. 

But yeah, only after I was certain I knew what the fuck I was doing. Like, *really* certain. Only shocked myself once ðŸ˜‚"
30,"I wish I had more than one upvote for this.
"
31,It wouldn't have shocked me if it were a llÉ™É‘
32,"And at your next performance review you will be docked points because that call was 24 minutes, which increased your average call time, also potentially affecting your next raise.  I hope you are good at keeping that average time down."
33,"Oh god. Recently I finally got through to my mom on the ""PLEASE read what's on your screen before dismissing the window/clicking next/freaking out/calling me/etc"" -- I'm not sure how I did it, but now she keeps telling her friends ""Daughter said to read what's on your screen, and I've been trying it, and it actually works!!"" Then she laughs manically. 

Progress but... like... why do you have to be told that??"

35,At this point you refer them to the police with some made up nonsense about how all they have to do is show cause and the cops will help them.
36,"Closed ticket.

Resolution: Slung printer into WEEE skip. Slapped user. Finished off bottom drawer hooch. Cried a little."
37,"I hear you. Said wife was complaining a few minutes ago because I have admin access locked down and she couldn't load something. Complaining about how I'm the only one in the house who has all access.

Damn fucking straight I'm the only one who has access. She said she'd be responsible with admin access on her school laptop and I said in big capital letters DO NOT LET ANY OF OUR CHILDREN PLAY WITH THIS LAPTOP. IT IS FOR YOUR COLLEGE WORK. And then our youngest loaded up a game on a night she had a paper due. Guess who was up until 1 AM cleaning out a virus so she could submit the paper?

So yeah, that's why I'm the only one with admin access. "
38,"And hence, foolproof systems started being created with limited results."
39,Man I hope people that work at suicide hotlines aren't graded on average call length.
40,I got this same thing once but they had the phone with them. I could tell right off the bat that this gold iPhone in a pink sparkle case wasn't this 45 year old mans. 
41,"I love how people think that the manufacturer is enough information to describe a device

I'll ask someone ""what kind of laptop do you have?"" and they'll respond with ""oh, it's an Acer/ASUS/HP/Dell."" NO CRAP--- I CAN SEE THAT ON THE LID. WHAT'S THE FREAKING MODEL NUMBER AND SPECS"
42,"""Best I can do is 5-10 years."""
43,"You got to know what you're doing, before even attempting to work with electricity. I've killed breakers to rooms to change outlets and still got shocked because the idiot before me didn't do something to code."
44,fixed it haha
45,"&gt;It's like asking me to install Windows into your fridge

Wouldn't shock me if $Placardsales had [this LG fridge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/2/12767932/lg-instaview-fridge-windows-10-ifa-2016) that comes with Windows 10"
46,"Did her computer also get retired to a minor support role in helpdesk, specifically your desk?"
47,"Well that's a new one...

&gt;have you tried turning it ~~off and on again~~ upside down"
48,"Classic. If I had a nickel for every time I've had to explain the scroll feature to a user, I'd have several."
49,"*Sighs*

50,"I remember when I was younger we got a laptop like that from a family friend. It didn't charge, and was slow and outdated so we just used it to play games (from discs because my brother and I agreed not to go on the internet with it since it had no protection). 


Worked great until dad decided to use it on the internet and got lots of viruses. "
51,"Clearly the guy with a 1 minute average is the superior employee! Able to rectify any crisis in a matter of seconds, why wouldn't you grade him on that?

I mean, who cares that the only advice he gives is ""Do it."" Do you *see* that call time?"
52,*I've got a theory... It could be bunnies*
53,"I agree. Imo, if you throw your hands up and go ""i dont know computers"" or ""im not a computer person,"" its not that computers are too hard, its that you arent willing to LEARN anything. You dont need a programmer level knowledge to do basic things like navigation and typing.

I personally think its the difference betwern people who are learning a process, vs learning the steps. The former is about why it works, and the latter is what you need to do to get it done. When theres a problem, the former can usually see what they did wrong and fix it, the latter stops dead and goes ""I DONT KNOW COMPUTERS PLEASE FIX GARBLHARBLCOOKIESBARBL""

Sorry, button issue for me. Im not IT but i work with so many peoples whos jobs are on computers who are completely technically incompetent "
54,The office equivalent of that email from grandma

59,"I work for a Quebec (Canada) ISP and we have maybe a hundred-plus 56k dial-up users. Some users in remote areas have literally no other choice (other than pricey satellite or microwave). And some old people have had 56k for over ten years and although better would now be available, they don't have a reason to change. "
60,"Your English is good, no worries.


And I've been seeing a lot of upside down PC posts as of late. Is this a new worrying trend? People don't know which is up and down?

70,"I wouldn't be surprised if that happened. I dont have a minor role, this was just a minor issue."
71,So you think a murder of crows was watching from the shadows ?
72,The world is winning.
73,So what was the professors reaction to being forced to retire his 56k?   
74,"The previous owner became something of an infamous joke in my parents first house. Apparently he was a very DIY kind of guy, but was clearly incompetent. Felt like we were finding something he fucked up at least once a year for quite a while. "
75,"As a future first time home buyer, this right here scares the shit out of me, more than anything else in this thread. I didn't even think about what kind of hidden, not up to code shit some previous owner could have done."
76,"&gt; She also fundamentally does not understand version control.

I'm curious as to what version control your using for your office.  (Or do you mean the built-in ""version control"" that some word processors have?)"
77,Why not answer the phone?
78,"I gave this comment my upvote, so it's like you have two now"
79,"in order to help customer save face (since admitting they were too stupid to check to make sure it was plugged in) I usually ask them to check the power cord at the peripheral (if it's removable, like the ""D"" cords on computers/monitors) and make sure it's snug.  Then follow it back to the wall or power strip or whatever and make sure the cord isn't loose.  If it looks snug, try unplugging and plugging it back in again.  Make sure the power bar is on and follow its cord back to the wall for a possible replug also.""

This gives them the ""out"" to say the cord was just loose when it was actually unplugged, and ""no one's the wiser to their stupidity"" yet the problem is solved.

Sometimes helping the client save face is just as important (if not moreso) than actually fixing their problem."
80,"The solution is simple. Include in the quote the cost of replacing the 40 Y machines with X machines, along with 240 software installations. If the cost of replacing the 40 machines is prohibitive, that's not *your* problem."
81,"I have one lady who can't read, not literally, she just never reads emails or instructions. So she'll drag me over every time she has a problem. I just have her pull up the online guides and read her the steps to fix her problem. 

Oh and today I had one upper manager text a co-worker in another city because she couldn't get on the internet, my desk is literally 20 feet away from her office. 

I don't get users."
82,You're friend deserves a promotion. I don't think my brain imagine the dumbery required
83,"I like this granny. She might not know what she's getting into, but at least she's apparently thinking about privacy and what she's willing to share. 

Sure, she may not realize that every bit of data ends up everywhere anyway and there may be some safety flaws in her solutions, but she shows that she's aware of what's happening on the internet these days. I'm proud of her."
