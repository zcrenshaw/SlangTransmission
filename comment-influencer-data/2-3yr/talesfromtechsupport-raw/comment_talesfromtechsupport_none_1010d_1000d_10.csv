0,"&gt; I have a certificate of proficiency in computering!

Yes, it came from cheap-online-certificates.com for a discounted price, no study required!"
1,"""Well, OK. We'll drop this one. We're going to be watching you"".

Oh my! we lost face, but because we're incapable of being wrong we'll make a threat of vindictive harassment because we can't be wrong."
2,"Last time I was shopping for an office chair I went into one of those second hand office furniture places and a sales guy approached me and asked what I was looking for.

Saying ""I need a new chair for my desk"" was too generic, this place is like 50,000 sq ft and it's all chairs...

""I'm looking for a chair that I could conceivably put into a volcano-lair and spin around menacingly when my nemesis discovers my location.""

He paused for a minute.... ""I know just the chair.""

It was perfect and I was out the door in 20 minutes after some obligatory arguing over which chair was more volcao-lair-y and sitting on some other options."
3,"Give me about ten minutes...

Edit: [It has begun!](http://i.imgur.com/mVnwdE9.png)

Edit 2: Well, that happened much more quickly than I expected. DNS propagation will take a few hours probably, but uh... Yeah.

Edit 3: To discuss ideas for certs, please take the discussion over to the newly minted CheapOnlineCerificates subreddit at /r/CheapOnlineCerts. (Also, if you have experience as a Mod and would like to volunteer, send me a PM and a $250 nonrefundable application fee.)"
4,"Hahahahaha. 

IM A BIG BUSINESS MAN!!


Hahahahahaha

This manager at work the other day said something similar, she was talking about some sort stupidness, anyway, and the said

&gt;Not that *I'm* not important. 


Jesus Christ you work at a donut shop. "
5,Sounds like the kind of toxic work environment I wouldn't want to work at all.

7,"Only a few people, and they are all gone now."
8,Computering the Bing is my new euphemism for performing tech support. 
9,"TIL a Firewall is actually a piece of hardware sometimes.

After reading this sub for years.

I feel dumb now.

EDIT: Wow, that steamrolled. Just to be clear: I was aware that the firewall in this box still had to be software and that this is not the default case and also that firewalls are used on both personal computers and in some routers. The whole ""there is seperate hardware running exclusively the firewall"" was the one thing that was new.

But it's good to know I'm not the only one on this sub who did not know that. Thanks to everyone who explained!"
10,Ok now you scare me too. XD
11,"&gt; **$CFO** ""Hey $airzonesama - Can you explain this invoice for 2000 lbs. of quicklime and backhoe hire?""

&gt; **$airzonesama** ""Sure - give me a moment""

\* wipes $CFOs devices, locks out his cellphone and orders another 50lbs of quicklime * "
12,More impressive is the self diagnosis of dog barking = crash was not false 
13,I'm glad that's not a real website.
14,"&gt; You IT people always say one thing then backpedal 10 minutes later.

You user people always mishear one thing and then latch onto it until 10 minutes later."
15,Sounds to me like it's time to stop donating. If they're going to bite the hands that feed them you boiler plate up on everything and charge for everything so you can justify everything.
16,I know a guy who can  supply you with piranhas and Persian cats
17,Could have been expecting calls I suppose.
18,I'm sad that's not a real website.
19,Sort of reminds me of something that happened a few years back. A friend calls me and asks if I can help them fix their internet. Turns out they thought that since they want to use WiFi they don't need a Router because it needs cables...
20,People. What a bunch of bastards.
21,"Indeed. Surely everyone has heard about the Pamplona bull run?

Oh, wait - that was about putting all your Basques in one exit."
22,"TLDR: CFO had a hot buldge in his pants, OP told him to unload it in his back yard. "
23,"""When I turn the volume off there's no volume, must be broken"""
24,"&gt; ...not much surprises me any more.


Be careful what you wish for..."
25,"I kinda agree with HR on this one, while your reaction is justified you are a professional and need to act as a professional. 

Trust me, knowing how to call someone a stupid idiot in such a way that he thanks you for it is a very necessary and my favorite soft skill.

"
26,"wow, impressive."
27,"""I don't get the reference""
I'm surprised that anyone doesn't know that reference by now...."
28,"I know it's 0230 where I am...so my brain processing power is a little low.

&gt;me:""So how does one ethernet card affect... Did you put all three authentication servers on the same physical hardware?""

&gt;Ron:""That's our policy- critical instances can only operate on hardware identified as critical""

WHAT THE ACTUAL EFF. I don't understand how in the world he didn't get the bad logic behind this reasoning."
29,Would you believe me if I told you I already have a guy for that? I even have a guy-guy to find me guys for things.
30,"This is one of those threads where we can't say ""they are not a computer person"".

In this case they are not merely a computer person but a fully certified and proficient computering person. They have achieved the next level, I wonder what comes after that."
31,"I love the threats to sue and the ""We'll I'm friends with (CEO) and I'll report you.""

I like to respond with ""That's awesome, I'm sure he'll be glad to know I followed protocol. Thanks so much for calling and have a great night!"" "
32,Wtf is an admin assistant doing associating with such a dumbass AND implicating herself (although in a your word vs hers kind of way) by trying to force you to go through with that shit? Who knows what other shady shit she gets up to.
33,"Can you imagine being that guy? You're not as savvy when it comes to electronics, yet you **swear** that every time your dog barks the PC crashes.

The first few times you just put it down to luck, and get annoyed at your PC. But over time you become more and more sure that your dog is shutting down your PC.

Can you imagine trying to tell someone about your problem? You **know** that it's super unlikely, but you're damn sure at this point there is some correlation. I'd be wondering whether I was going mad."
34,"Not a tech guy, but a mechanic. In my experience this happens when people wrap their life and identity up in something. Whether it be their job or vehicle.
&amp;nbsp;

It happens a lot to mechanics. Assuming you can convince them of a problem, especially when it's their fault, they still adopt an attitude like your still screwing them, they just haven't figured out how yet."
35,"&gt; Well, I still need a new laptop... I don't think i'll be able to fit it on my own.   

Dude, your job is appliance repair. If you can't fit a keyboard, we will send a new laptop to YOUR replacement.."
36,"&gt;Oh wow, you IT people scare me.

Yeah, people generally either assume we don't have access to their emails or can't see it without them knowing. Both are false, and there's two main reasons we don't read their emails: It's rude; and we literally don't care, unless there's a reason to care we don't have the time to waste reading through your BS emails."
37,"&gt;AA: Crook says if you do not do this he will go to police and say you tried to sell him a stolen system. 

Me:  I'm going to go talk to HR now about your attempt to blackmail me into supporting your crime-ring."
38,"Yeah. In some sense the firewall is always software, it's just where you run it. Most of us run a firewall straight from our computer and that's the only place the firewall affects, but they do make boxes who's sole purpose is to run a firewall and that will plug into the router/modem and function for the entire network.

Many routers have firewall functionality as well, but running a dedicated firewall box means you don't have to configure the router every time it breaks or is replaced, especially if it's a new model of router and you have to figure out how the firewall works in the new firmware. Also allows for custom firewall software without having to make custom router software."
39,"If that was the case he could have left his phone near the network port? 

Then again, don't even know if he knows how it all works. "
40,"Can you imagine being that dog?  Eventually the guy starts hollering out the dog's name every time it happens, and the dog is out there thinking, ""What, have you seen the size of the fucking raccoons out here? Just doing my job, ingrate."" "
41,"I've told a boss before that if he wasn't asking me all these questions I could be getting my job done. He also asked me once why some task was taking so long to complete and I told it was because he had me in meetings half of the day, then he cancelled the hour long staff meeting later that day. Obviously this would need to be used in proper circumstance and with proper delivery, but sometimes managers need to be told, gently, to STFU and let us get some work done.

Then again, I'd already told that manager, when asked if I had thought of pursuing a management path, that I liked to actually get things done."
42,"I'm not sure if the worst part of this is that the user couldn't find their shortcut because they renamed it or because they called it ""Google Bing""..."
43,Well obviously you should provide all documentation as a PDF. Never supply documentation in an editable format not only for protection from deletions of trxt but changes as well.
44,"&gt;Computering the Google Bing is my new euphemism for performing tech support.

FTFY

45,"""Generally, I don't care enough to use my permissions to go into your inbox and read your drivel when I have a thousand other things to do that are actually a necessary use of my time.  However, you've made enough noise about my having access I am now curious.  No, don't bother running back to your desk.  I have the backups."""
46,I think the worst part was that someone actually gave her a certificate of proficiency in computering
47,"Well, the speaker may or may not survive, but as the Kindle has no hard drive in it it otherwise will be fine. 

Stick it to an electric motor and it likely will burn it out though, though it will only harm a cellphone speaker as it will tear the internal magnet away from the coil."
48,"I am disappointed. When I saw the title, I thought someone finally bought [one of these...](http://hothardware.com/news/10000-ethernet-cable-claims-earth-shattering-advancement-in-audio-fidelity-if-youre-stupid-enough-to-buy-it)"

Every time she leaned forward the space bar depressed  
She called me to see

Problem solved with a tight fitting vest.

55,Our president-elect. 
56,Fulfilling the letter of a requirement without understanding the spirit.
57,A lot of new wiring is made with soy based shielding which is supposed to make it more environmentally friendly.  What it really does is encourage rodents to eat the wire.  It's been a huge problem for car manufacturers and phone companies.
58,You didn't even try to turn the customer off and on again? Sketchy troubleshooting skills right there...
59,"After apple having started a radio station, a video and a musics store, Amazon having started a chain of supermarkets and being kind of a TV broadcast station, as well and after Facebook having promised to hire a real news redaction... ...and after Facebook actually starting to act as an ISP... ...who knows if she was just asking a few years too early."
60,Having an in with the coppers is important.
61,I mean dude is probably the CFO for a reason.
62,"I should just add an addendum that the old server hadn't been moved from its original location (on the carpet floor against a wall in the office) when it was decomissioned. There was a secret deal between the FM and US IT team that IT would fund and deploy new servers and FM had to locate them somewhere different and keep them hidden from GM. GM was so entrenched in his ways that as long at the old server was in it's original spot, he wouldn't go looking anywhere else."
63,urge to kill... rising
64,"People are fucked.

What kind of ""big business man"" resorts to personal attacks anyways? Much less as a *first* resort?"
65,"There are a few partners at the company where I work. One guy is notoriously frugal. He likes to tell the story about how his first customer was his brother, and he charged him extra because he was family. 

So it's especially entertaining when someone says they know the owner for a discount. ""Really? You know Dave? And he said to give you half off?  That doesn't sound like Dave. Are you sure it was Dave?"" I try to drag it out for a while. "
66,"Unfortunately, creation probably won't clear until tomorrow. But the wheels are turning!"
67,"$SV is alright. Good problem solving and seems to have an upbeat attitude.

It kind of boggles my mind that anyone could be in a room that looks remotely like a server room and think to unplug anything if they have no clue what it is lol."
68,"You sure can! PM me a valid email address and your social security number or other intimate personally identifiable information and I'll have my assistant contact you within two business days.

(Seriously though, I suppose I could actually create some super simple one-click tests and design some spiffy looking certificates. You'll of course have the option to print them yourself at home, or for a small fee you can have the certificate mailed to you on premium vellum or something.)"
69,"what kind of ""big business man"" actually uses the phrase ""I'm a big business man"""
70,"and has a browser and an os.

""Select the proper tool for woodcutting"" (choice of fish, axe, pocketknife). ""Point to the safe end"" (either end of axe pictured), ""Select appropriate thing to chop"" (pictured: Leg, wood, house, playing children)

2 correct answers out of three must be good enough."
79,"Long time lurker and have always wanted to ask this:

Is it just me or is there no reward at all for working in IT? Nobody respects you, everyone shits on you, your skills aren't recognized, and shit happens every day. You're a department a company definitely depends on but you're STILL not liked by most of the other employees. 

What's the point? And I mean it. Genuinely asking with a confused face here. Why are you guys in IT? Other than you just liking computers and such.

I don't work in IT btw, I just like reading the stories here. "
80, Muscle memory is one hell of a thing.
81,"Still better than computers. At least with cars people at least know that they break down, and general not to do things like try to pull a semi trailer with a civic or put diesel into a gas engine.
