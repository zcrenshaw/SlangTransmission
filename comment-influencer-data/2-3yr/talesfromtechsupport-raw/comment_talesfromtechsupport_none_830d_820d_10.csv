0,"Trust me. ""End-user"" is a derogatory term. It often means ""moron"".

1,"hush, they don't need to know it!"
2,I remember a story like this but the user in question was right click copying then unplugging the mouse and moving it to the computer she wanted to paste to.
3,"&gt;Well, I guess he doesn't really want to go to college then.

This guy is an amazing parent. If the lazy sod doesn't want to get up and do the basics then they clearly shouldn't be doing higher education. Actually letting them reap the reprocussions of their inaction is very respectable."
4,"I'm laying bets the reason she was fired is because her 'Internet tech' from Craig's list needed access to her work computer in order to 'move' her webmail. Even if the guy didn't do anything nefarious then it would still have been a massive, terminal, breach of policy."
5,"Yea, see, often it *is* no issue to pass on perfectly good hardware slated for disposal, I've got plenty of hardware passed on to me that way (including the laptop I'm typing this up on) but you absolutely *absolutely* have to have that signed off and documented and covered over and over and over.

I would *hate* for someone to just up and lift something for me, or anyone else. Such risk for all involved, and likely just right up theft, just like this because it just plain turns out that the device or hardware simply isn't *theirs* to give away in the first place."
6,"&gt;and then she got stonewalled right to legal after making that threat.

The best companies are the ones who do that.  One of the companies I worked for would lock your account out of phone support until Legal cleared it.  And legal wouldn't take calls, they would only communicate via mail (paper trail and all).  So when someone threatened to sue?

""Due to potential legal action, we can no longer speak with you over the phone.  Is your address still XXX?  A member of our legal team will be contacting you.  Goodbye."""
7,"Well, you did warn them."
8,"Oh, yeah. She hired the guy to break the protections on her work computer about browsing to mail (apparently their company restricted it), and had him screw with other things on the computer. So yeah. Massive security breach and breach of AUP."
9,"You stupid fucking tech, these wires are for style. I prefer the minimalist wireless look ALWAYS."
10,I like to double-confirm things like that at the risk of appearing dense.  Sometimes I can just tell that whomever it is on the phone has not really thought things through.
11,Gotta say i enjoy your choice of expletives. It really ties the room together.
12,"That's one of those things that almost seems like it should work. At the very least, should be possible to make a mouse that does in fact work like that."
13,Dollars to donuts this man is commiting some form of crime or fraud. 
14,"&gt;can't

FTFY"
15,I feel like everyone has to pay a stupid tax when they start a new job. Something that wastes your time and then you figure out a faster way. You feel dumb but it shortens the process in the future. 
16,"The Titanic isn't sinking, it is ""taking on excessive water""."
17,"Fucking cable management. 

One of our sites just had us roll out 50 or so new machines, and all they said was to make sure they look nice. So we ran the cables down through the cable holes in the desk, and called it good. 

We got called back for ""being totally unacceptable"", because apparently everything was supposed to be routed through the monitor arms and behind the desks, even though there wasn't enough slack in the cables to route things that way. So, we redid it their way. Literally have to unbolt the desks from each wall in order to run cables behind (the way they wanted), and then pinch the cables there when the desk gets bolted back in. 

Got called back in because users snapped a bunch of cables because - surprise - there wasn't enough slack. Redid everything in some unholy configuration of routed and half routed cabling. 

Now, a few months later, we're replacing most of the wireless keyboard and mouse combos they originally ordered with wired versions... because surprise, the wireless ones constantly need replacement batteries, and users keep losing them or stealing other people's mices. 

And because of continued cable slack issues, users have pulled most of the rest of cabling out of the guides and run them back through the cable holes in the desk. 

So, several months later... It looks how it did when we first set it all up."
18,Don't worry they won't read this.
19,"I still remember being told by management to not use several words and phrases in conversation, emails or the call ticketing system.  My favorite was to replace ""problem"" or ""outage"", it isn't a ""problem"" it is a 'service degradation', it isn't an outage it is a 'temporary reduction in the standard service level'
I was working level 2/3 support for a large telecom and didn't talk to end users, I only spoke to other technical groups and senior management types and verbiage is what they wanted to get hung up about.     "
20,"So you couldn't perform magic, then once the minimum requirements were met you achieved everything you were required to do with no issues...and that counts as unhelpful?

Ah users..."
21,A mouse with USB storage could be pretty awesome if possible.
22,"&gt; It's never the network. Unless it is, in which case I will never tell you because you will use it against me for the rest of my career.

No one ever says ""hey, remember those six thousand times that it WASN'T the network?""  
No, it's always ""there was that ONE time..."""
23,"Took me a while to get the ""y""ring pun. Nice."
24,"And even with all my tech savvy, there have been those none headed times where I've missed the obvious on something. We all have. I can sympathize with that poor user. "
25,It's called CYA.  Never stop.
26,"It didn't happen often, but when it did it was usually ""no, wait, I didn't mean---""  CLICK"
27,"&gt;i work for a POS company

Don't we all."
28,That is delicious. 
29,"I think the biggest tell is that he documented that he returned the laptops to the cabinet, when he did not. He knew he wasn't supposed to have them, or else he would have documented that he took them.  I'm willing to bet that if you have security cameras, and you can find the time he removed them from the property, it's likely after hours, and he's looking over his shoulder a lot."
30,We just spent several hundred kilobucks redoing a very small area of a lab so that the director of the lab would not have to see wires for computers/mice.  
31,"We did have a guy a few months ago who unplugged and rearranged the wires so it will look ""nice"". Had to spend another 2 hours setting it all back up again because he didnt think the cords needed to be plugged into the same ports. 

I have to give him points for cable management i guess."
32,"My company used to do giveaway days, where they'd hoard all the old hardware for 6 months or a year, and then just pile it all by the door for anyone to take. I've gotten a few good servers, desktops, and laptops from it. Some SOB who was faster than me got an LCD projector once. "
33,They...I.....there isn't enough head shaking for this without possibly dislocating my head from my neck
34,"They would never RTFTFTS^ReadTheFuckingTalesFromTechSupport

35,And grounds for termination.  
36,D...Doofenshmritz?
37,"That was the way my parents functioned. I learned quite a few lessons the hard way, but I learned them well."
38,"&gt;His statement to the police said he took items that were slated for disposal and were otherwise garbage and did not think this was an issue. 

Hanlon's razor - Perhaps he really is just that fucking stupid.



"
39,"The Hindenberg didn't explode, it overclocked a non-overclockable component using a method not supported by the vendor. "
40,At least you remembered to zip your flies.
41,"People really don't understand that a legal threat is, well, a legal threat. You don't talk to people that are considering legal action against you, that's what the lawyer does. It's on par with saying you're going to kill someone. Once you say it, whether you mean it or not isn't relevant anymore. "
42,"This.

It's akin to the guy who thinks everyone's out to screw and cheat him...  Usually it's because he's out screwing and cheating everyone.

Can confirm.  Had a former boss like this.
"
43,"&gt; I hired one of your internet people


So she thought that everyone on the internet are affiliated with her ISP? That's some stupid shit right there. "
44,"No, I think he's trying to use stupid as an excuse, I've spoken at length to him, he knew, he's not stupid. "
45,"Just USB storage is easy.  Pretty sure it does exist.  Full on ""universal"" copy paste is a bit trickier.  Should still be possible though."
46,"Fair enough, but what if you *could* save data to your mouse in the way the customer thought?"
47,"""Good judgement comes from experience.  Experience comes from bad judgement.""  "
48,My moment was reinstalling the drivers of the sound card before turning on the speakers 
49,"ID-10T error (idiot error),  
PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair),  
PICNIC (Problem In Chair, Not In Computer),  
IBM error (Idiot Behind Machine error)"
50,Covering your ass. 
51,"I love^^^^^^^^^^hate those calls. Best one I received at the end of a semester was a couple weeks ago, where a parent demanded that I give her access to her daughter's grades before they drove up to pick up the daughter. I'm guessing if the daughter didn't get good enough grades, they weren't picking her up for summer?"
52,I'd love to see a bot that replaces expletives with phrases like OP used.
53,"The Hindenburg exceeded it's pressure storage capacity and experienced an exothermic structural integrity degradation event. On the bright side, it did for a fraction of a moment, dramatically increase it's maximum lift capacity, though the phenomenon was short lived. Know that we share your concern for any temporary service interruptions this may have caused.  "
54,"Having a small USB storage on the mouse, then being able to configure that to act as the computers clipboard would need to be done. 

Then need to have the new system be able to have the same setting when the mouse is plugged in to allow the CTRL-V. 

Storage = easy
Clipboard = maybe not so much"

56,"And thus, the Television Unpluginator 6000 was born!"
57,I don't have the time to rage with you on this. I wish I did because we can't make this shit up.
58,"FWIW I sub-contracted for a healthcare company that asked that we not use the word ""users' when talking about employees as it had a connotation to someone abusing drugs  "
59,Stupidity can get expensive. 
60,"For those who don't get it: the wire was ""split"" like a letter ""y""."
61,"They were too embarrassed. 

You warned them and they said go.

They should have known that would happen and couldn't look you in the eye after that."
62,"Am a locksmith, can confirm. If you don't trust me to do my best to make your building as secure as I'm being paid, hire someone else.  
  
Also, no one is going to risk their bond for your collection of anime figurines and shot glasses from three states. "
63,"&gt; Probably has a certificate of computer proficiency.

It's a certificate IN COMPUTERING

You of *all* people should know this /s

I love these kinds of fixes though, where the issue is solved by nothing more than a glance."
64,"It's the IP directed at your own computer: there's no place like ""home""."
65,A moose once bit my sister.
66,Finally relevant!
67,The internet is a magical world where magic happens. It works because magic and ISPs use magic to magic my computer problems out of existence.
68,"My favorite one is ""looks like a level 8 networking error."""
69,"Absolutely, unfortunately that is the mentality of most of our users.  I won't even get started the attitude you get when you tell them that we only support our software and if they want their Windows password they have to speak to their IT.  They are under the mistaken believe that WE are their IT.  *sigh*"
70,"Alternatives: 

- ID10T

- PEBKAC

- PICNIC

- IBM error"
71,The only unbelievable part of this story is that the *two* people *that were responsible* got fired.

And now everyone takes a shot."
