Helping this fucking idiot woman at a call center, seriously, she was a fucking cocky little moron.

She had already managed to destroy 2 or 3 machines by knocking them off the desk (which is NOT an easy feat) and in one case, spilled pickle juice on one. (and fried electronics in pickle juice is very unsettling) 

Anyway, I see her in my field of view, and see a malware site pop up, I run over (I honestly was tired of fixing her shit) and tell her to stop, and not touch a fucking thing. To not click on the popup that said ""click here to clean the virus off your computer"" I told her to not do it, it was a virus, and she responded with ""Oh go fuck yourself! you don't know what you're talking about, you fucking useless nerd!"" and clicks on it.

At that point she's all shocked and I tell her, very bluntly, to get up and get the hell out of my way and go sit in the break room and not touch anything.

Ending up having to re-image that system. Pissed me off because the image didnt have the very annoying and painful to install software they just purchased on it yet. So I spent 2 hours on the phone with a software vendor to install a piece of proprietary software that needs to almost be completely manually installed.

26,"This reminds me of something that happened to me in the bad old days of the mid 90's.

I was a software engineer in a company with no admins, and our Windows machines had no easy access to the printers on the network. I set up my computer to access the printers which took a bit of skill -- we had no server that wasn't running Novell, so there wasn't a sane place to do this. As an act of kindness, I enabled network shares on my workstation. When I'd gone through two company bankruptcies, I gave up and found another position (paying twice as much). Some weeks after I left, they unplugged my workstation and put it in a corner, and all the printers failed. Since they had no admins, they went without printer support for several months before they came up with a solution.

No one had a clue why things stopped working, and I heard about this a year later when I had dinner with an ex coworker."

Apple didn't even implement true multitasking until iOS 7 - before that, apps were only allowed to use certain APIs while backgrounded. Even when iOS finally implemented true multitasking in iOS 7, the OS intelligently kills apps based on the resources needed by apps in use. At that point, the apps in the switcher (even, yes on iOS 6) are just shortcuts to recently used apps. "

When I complained about it, she asked me why we hadn't paid ... the CFO was asking the Infrastructure Manager about unpaid bills.

The company's lawyer replied-all, said to pay me for the work that was done in pennies, called me a jackass, then tried to rescind the e-mail, which I had told him on a number of occasions doesn't work outside of your own Exchange organization.

78,Happened with me and the School district I worked for.  I was part of the union.  I had recently been elected as a union board member for my campus.  I had a loud argument with one of my techs one day.  We had both had a bad day.  We had a teacher using the principal as a way to force her ticket to the top of the pile.  I sent him to get her to shut up.  He wasn't happy.  When the principal heard about the argument they decided I had threatened him and put me on leave with pay.  The next day I was in the district office in front of the head of HR being told I could resign quietly or be fired in a public board hearing.  I left quietly.  I had written scripts that ran nightly to keep a student database up to date and synchronized with their schedules.  It worked fine for 2 months.  Then the new semester started.  That always required running it manually.  They were furious it didn't work as expected.  They threatened legal action if I didn't come and fix the scripts.  The fun part was the principal had banned me from the campus and if I set foot on the campus I would have been trespassing and been arrested.  He refused to remove the ban and the District office refused to accept my consulting rates.  Eventually they replaced my scripts.  It took them 6 months and they never worked as well.

When you close an app, its memory is preserved, but the app uses zero CPU. Nothing runs in the background. When you open it again, the app is restored using the preserved memory.

When the system starts running out of memory, it starts freeing the reserved memory of ""background"" apps. You can notice this when you go back to an app you've not used for a while and instead of simply opening where you left it, it launches again (e.g. showing logos of developers), because its memory has been freed.

There are a few exceptions, like voip apps or background downloads. An app like Skype is allowed to run in the background, but only when you're actually talking to someone. When you're not, it behaves like any other app.
