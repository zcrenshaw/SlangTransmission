There's got to be some pattern there. Faulty till = mobile phone, mobile phone = chocolate fountain... It's like one of those logic tests they make you take when you apply for support positions."
3,I sincerely hope Drew is doing better; but that last line is icing on the cake.

I like this. I'm taking it. Can you move it to my office for me?"
5,"&gt; I quietly exit the lecture theatre after that.

*white flag waved*"
6,"God, it's nice when stuff like this happens.

This was years ago, but I was having problems with a department within the company.  They were always calling, screaming about little things that weren't my job and verbally abusing my employees.  Just one department.  They complained to the CEO, who stopped by my desk to talk to me about ""Being a team player"" and ""refusing to help others.""

While he was standing there, I was able to put on two different, live phone calls, of people in that department calling and swearing and screaming at techs.  One of them being that we refused to let him run Netflix and the other that we wouldn't let him install a game.

He was shocked.  Then outraged.  Then steaming mad.

Later that day, there were 4 firings and a company wide email praising us for our work and reminding people that abusing internet privileges was grounds for dismissal."
7,"holy hell the flood of call up tech support calls. No matter how refined I got with

&gt;(me) NO!

I get the image that she is trying to feed you vegetables against your will."
9,Have you tried... rebooting it? 
10,"No, you did the right thing. If you jump and run whenever someone neeps, ""My printer's out of paper,"" eventually it'll get to the point where they're calling you because their chair's the wrong height, and they want you to come pull the adjustment lever for them.

From what I've read, in healthcare it's even worse, because then the user will exclaim, ""This affects PATIENT CARE,"" so you have to jump up and run over there *right this second* to wiggle the mouse for them so the screensaver turns off. In an office that never sees patients and has nothing to do with actual medical practice."

So you haven't worked since May?"

24,"&gt; Unfortunately, the retiring works manager believes he can win every argument with me, so he gets me to do it every time. Only 3 more weeks until he goes.

Ugh, managers. I know, I know - TFTS has stories about great managers, but still, there's something to be said about the hellish ones.

User: 'no'

34,"- 6 hours of physical installation and the initial software (which didn't really need much code work as we could reuse existing skeleton code)
- 2 hours to add the gauges, actually needed a bit of coding and testing.
- 4 hours of graphics work, we were nice and didn't bill for integration of the graphics to the software, on which the coder spent unspecified time and we agreed we'd reuse the code probably later on.
- 3 hours to build the web GUI.
- 2 hours to build the logging and reporting.

The hourly rates varied from about $60 to $120 depending on who was doing the work.

We tried to be reasonable with the time spent, we could have spent a lot longer finetuning and tweaking everything

So yeah, you could probably buy a boxful of Raspberries for the price, but I think the moral of the story revolved around specifications and the realization that Raspberry Pi alone out of the box doesn't mysteriously work as an environmental monitoring system. Oh, and as much as we'd like to build stuff for free all day long, money has to come in so someone pays our salaries.

Edit: The bill shouldn't have come as a surprise, as we always give an estimate for everything we do. The customer just yeah-yeah'ed it and was more interested in when it's done."

37,"It was an IIS server, with a back end SQL database, like they didn't cluster it, and it wasn't redundant. You can't fix stupid.

41,I so hope you record calls and send them to the person's supervisor when they complain.
42,"I'm friendly enough with people in the office that if I'm not busy, I'll just play with them when they're being unnecessarily vague.

Them: It's not working.  
Me: It's not working?

Me: That's terrible, why isn't it working?   
Them: I don't know, that's why I'm asking you.  
Me: You're asking me?"

44,"It bugs the crap out of me when a user can't articulate anything other than, ""It's not working."" One of the best tools in my arsenal is this simple question: ""What are you trying to do?""  
I've found it's useful for getting to the core of most issues. Especially for users who *think* they know what they're doing, but don't.  
  
For example:  
User: ""X isn't working.""  
Me: ""What are you trying to do?""  
User: \*insert life story here\* ""...so I'm trying to do Y but X isn't working.""  
Me: ""Ah, I see. X has nothing to do with Y. You'll want to do Z."""

47,"&gt; I asked them a few questions to verify what they're seeing: ACH# this, date, etc., the amount isn't $$$$$$? Oh no, it's different. And this one? This one? And this? no no no, all different.

I would have asked, ""So, what numbers do you see for that account?"" instead of just allowing the answer of ""it's different""."

61,"I work in healthcare and can confirm. I started on the floor and moved into tech. When I was on the floor the number of times that an agent was angry because their ""customer could die without this coverage!"" is astounding. 

The hospital is not going to just let a car crash or heart attack victim die because their insurance is a month out of date. We will have it fixed within 24 hours, chill. "
62,The server was overloaded with too much to do.

Things are changing around Networks while I'm in charge. If management wants uninterrupted access to sites, they should pay for replicated servers. We have MSSQL replication here, so why not for other things. "
67,"I wonder if dialog popups makes them kinda subconsciously panic. Like, there's a popup, and they just kinda go ""Oh no, not again"" and because they ""know"" that they can't *possibly* understand computer jargon, they just give up completely. The words just kinda pass through their brain. 

""Are you sure you want to permanently delete this folder? Yes No""

70,Wait why would accounting ever need administrator privileges?
71,"That type of thing works surprisingly well. From my own experience, we've had several people open extremely high-severity tickets by claiming that, for example, the company would lose hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars for every hour they were down. Note that these were all for single-user workstations. 

Every time I would talk to them, I would start by asking about their disaster recovery plan and why they haven't implemented it yet. When I (inevitably) got complete ignorance in reply, I'd explain that any process which had that kind of impact on the company was required, by policy, to have a disaster recovery plan in place. If they didn't have one, no problem, I could let my management talk to *their* management, and get a plan in place (after I fixed their issue, of course... I'm not a sadist). 

Nearly every time I did that, I got them to allow me to drop the severity down to a reasonable level, along with dropping any need to talk to their management. 

There was that one time, though, where the guy was like ""That's a good idea, we definitely need that. So, can you help me now, or what?"" That's when I knew that one was the real deal. That was an interesting afternoon. "
