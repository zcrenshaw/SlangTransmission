1,I miss the days when it was possible to talk with someone genuinely useful inside the megacorps.
2,"You can't know just what their standards are, but it's clear you've failed them. Like a distant father figure."
3,"&gt; *How.*

The first rule may be ""users lie"" but the second rule is ""never underestimate the ability of a user to screw it up"".  No matter how many safeguards are there, someone will screw up a basic step."
4,"&gt; I liked my old password. 

Apparently not enough to to type it correctly."
5,I'm amazed she would rather ship back or destroy the laptop than keep it or sell it.
6,"yeah, but it's easier this way."
7,"I've changed it to ""Unemployed"". You'll need to go to the employment office to have it changed"
8,"Thats the firat time I've heard a password must, or even can contain a space"
9,"As someone who falls in this role, I either expect payment from family (albeit only token) or expect them to learn, realize their current unlearned status, and make them do basic troubleshooting. 

If my parents/others haven't done the basic steps I simply find or write them a quick guide and don't help them until they attempt. Works pretty well for me!"

12,"1 Users Lie.

1a Users lie, even if they don't know they're lying."
13,"The user may not bring it up again if the offending folder can't be found. If you remind them of it, they will probably accuse you of deleting all traces of it."
14,"In my experience it's always the lower management tier users that are rude. I was always in awe when I had to deal with CTOs, CEOs and the like directly - nicest people ever. Their PA's? Little bitches.

One of these top brass was always answering me, when I was guiding him through some remote troubleshooting with ""yes sir"" and ""no sir"" - without a hint of irony and sounding appreciative and earnest. At a multibillion global company. What a guy."
15,"My fucking company doesn't publish their Windows password requirements. I had to figure out through trial and error (and waiting) that the requirements are: at least 8 characters, including at least one space, special character, capital letter, and lowercase letter. The space alone took me three tries to figure out."

That is because he is secure in the knowledge that he is already at the top.  He isn't a puffed shirt at first tier management that needs to show those 'below' him how important he is by acting like an a-hole.

20,"Also, their time is worth huge money, they just want the issue fixed. Easiest way to fix an issue: listen to an expert. Whom you pay. To fix issues. Because they are the experts."
21,So you and $man had some pillow talk after you finished. I see what is going on here
22,"Early on in my career I was tier 1 overnight helpdesk for a (at the time) tiny contracted phone support service. 

Most nights I was the only one in the call center. 

Had one old lady that had called in initially for a problem with her audio setup (which I fixed handily, fracking Win 3.11 drivers...), all the while going through my normal friendly patter. 

She started sounding choked up in the middle, and by the time it was done, she was sobbing thankfully about how no one in her family would help her or talk to her. 

The phones were usually dead, so I told her we could talk for a while until other calls came it. We just shot the breeze, talked about music and old movies. 

After about 45 mins a call came in and I bid her goodnight. 

Over the next 3 or 4 days, she'd call in about a fake sounding problem 'I think my screen colors are wrong, or 'I hear static from the box sometimes', when all she really wanted to do was talk. 

So I assigned her a established priority number in our system (basically a long-running ticket that bumped call priority to the techs that had worked on the ticket in the past) and told her that if she ever got a different tech from me to pretend something because most other tier 1's didn't give a crap about anything except clock-out. 

Our customers were paying $30 a month for 'white glove' personalized support service, of which maybe 8-12% of them ever even used it any given month, so I figured it wouldn't kill the company's profit if I spent a few minutes a day keeping a kind grandmother company. "

26,"Us ""older generation"" were around when you had to actually *understand* something about how a device works to use it successfully.

The current generation just knows how to get to YouTube and whatever. 

I get the browsing logs from my nephew's computer. He's 14. 

To get to YouTube, he runs Firefox, then types ""Google"" into the address box, which runs a google search that gives him google.com as the first result. He then clicks on ""google.com"" and types ""youtube"" into the Google.com search box, then he clicks on the resulting link.

30,"&gt;the 1000+ Minecraft executables and installers he had laying in the Downloads folder because he thought you had to download it every time you played it. (You read that right, 1000+ files.)

That made me think of the old $ISP story, where a user couldn't internet any more because she didn't have enough space on her HDD.

""We can get rid of some old files.  Go into your \ISP directory.""

""Which one?  \ISP, \ISP1, \ISP2 ......... or \ISP23?""

*huh?* ""How do you connect to the internet if I may ask?""

""I insert your CD, the computer says 'Welcome to $ISP' with the Install and Quit buttons, and I click Install, then Next, and 20 minutes later, I'm in.""

By the end of the month, her entire C: drive was full of $ISP installs. [*shipment of headdesks*](http://wayoutofworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pic-1-11.jpg)"
31,"Well, it's a perfectly logical safety test. Not your fault that's the one time it'd have such a... drastic result."
32,"The most secure password I ever saw was the result of a friend who'd memorized a random 50-digit random number. They typed it in directly on the Linux box when we were setting it up, then went to log in from a Windows box and couldn't. Worked fine on Linux; no go on Windows.

We finally figured out what was going on. He was using the number pad, and while the ""num lock"" light was on, the actual numlock behavior had somehow gotten turned off. His password wasn't 472193etc, it was leftarrow home downarrow end pageup pagedown etc.

I'm pretty sure no bruteforce password cracker on the planet would ever have guessed it.

Sadly, this was impossible to enter on Windows, so he had to change it back to a 50-digit random number."

75,"So...Dilbert. Let's talk about Dilbert.

Before I started my career I never understood Dilbert comics, I thought they were overly pedantic and unfunny. Now that I've worked in an office for some amount of years they are awesome. Maybe it's because they hit a little to close to home or because they are completely true in an office sarcasm kind of way. Either way I love them and I'm not sure if I should feel happy that I understand them or sad that I understand them.

76,"Don't want to spam with another post, but I have another Digital support story, so I'll drop it here:

This was told to me by a friend who worked as a sysadmin at a university. The university bought one of the first VAX 11/780 when they came out in 1977. They knew it was one of the first because it had a two digit serial number (probably in the teens, but my memory isn't that good), let's call it 12 for the sake of the story. The VAX was first used for normal CS education, but after many years of faithful service it was replaced by more powerful machines and was put to work running the accounting for the phone system for the entire university. As far as I know it stayed in that role until maybe 10 years ago when it was replaced by a VoIP system. Somewhere around y2k the VAX started misbehaving so they called Digital (or possibly already Compaq) support. Notice that the machine was already 20-25 years old at that time. The conversation went something like this:

&gt; Uni: Hi, our VAX is dying, we need a technician to come to our site and look at it.

&gt; DEC: Certainly sir, what's the serial number on the machine?

&gt; Uni: Hold on. .... Twelve.

&gt; DEC: I'm sorry, sir, what was the serial number again?

&gt; Uni: Twelve.

&gt; DEC: Eh, that doesn't sound like a serial number, can you look at the metal sign at the back of the machine?

&gt; Uni: I'm looking at the metal piece at the back and it says ""Digital Equipment Corporation, blah blah, model: blah blah, Serial #: 12"".

&gt; DEC: Sir, that's impossible, the field in my form requires 10 digits for serial numbers, the sign must have been damaged.

&gt; Uni: Just enter 0000000012.

&gt; DEC: &lt;clicketi-click&gt; ... Oh. Yes, I can see that there's a support bulletin on this model and component xyzzy is reported to fail prematurely after 20 years, sorry about that, we'll send someone with a replacement in an hour.

An hour later their ancient VAX was running properly again and it kept running until it was peacefully retired after almost 30 years of faithful service."

Correct answer: none of them.  they are not really open.  After running in background for somewhere between 30sec to 1 min, those apps are closed and they stay in that list for quick access.

The only time you should ever have to swipe quit an app is if that app specifically is having an issue.
