It's scary how many websites have two similar-looking textboxes, one of which does a search, the other tells everyone what you just typed..."
7,"I have been given the opportunity to give that issue a lot of thought over my time in IT.

Why are certain users so caught up about seemingly simple changes in their workflow?

Why will they not jump at the chance to reduce the number of clicks and key-presses to achieve the same result they do now? Why do they get so incredibly upset over minor changes in the UI layout from one version of a software to the next? ...

I have come to the conclusion that we approach the issue on two entirely different levels.

I and most other IT people only think of their interactions with the computer in very abstract terms while these sort of users have memorized the exact steps to achieve the result they want. The literally don't know what they are actually doing when they are pressing those buttons.

It is like me trying to memorize a phrase like in Russian or  Mandarin and then being told I had to use a slightly paraphrased version of it. For someone that speaks the language the difference may be hardly worth mentioning, but someone who just memorized the sounds they are supposed to emit without knowing any specific meaning attached to specific sounds will have to simply memorize whole different phrase.

For a computer workflow a competent user might just remember that in the end they need to save the file they have worked on, but a less competent user will just memorize the menus and buttons they need to click. Moving or renaming the buttons will slightly inconvenience the former and completely baffle the later."
8,"Honestly, i wouldnt blame them.. where i was running at an intern they had a few rooms with a pc so they could have a private talk with clients, and on that pc they would remote.connect to their 'own' pc upstairs, 

There was a fight once because a new person thought someone was on their pc (the one in the room) 

I tried to explain and i got the old ""you're just an intern"" 

edit: wtf.. when did this got so many upvotes? well... i'll enjoy my top comment :)"

27,"Ooh!  I did that once!  After high school I did a short stint in the military.  During combat training (you're graduated from basic and you're officially a Marine but you're still fresh as hell) we were digging foxholes.  After we were done, me and some of the other trainees were hanging out in a clearing eating some lunch and waiting for orders when our Sgt comes by to take down our flak jacket sizes so we can get SAPI plates (the actual bullet-proof part) for the range portion of training the following week.  After taking down all our sizes,

&gt;Sgt: Good job everyone.

&gt;All of us: Aye, Sgt.

(Again, fresh as hell).  I was the last one to reply so he singled me out.

&gt;Sgt: (obviously joking) except you, you suck.

&gt;Me: Aye Sgt?

&gt;Sgt: But the important thing is

and here he points at my 'Battle Buddy' (you're assigned a partner for the duration of training)

&gt;Sgt: Do you love him?

&gt;Me: Like a brother in arms, Sgt.

He then looks at my Battle Buddy and asks if he loves me.  He replies with a simple ""yes, Sgt.""  He goes around the whole circling asking everyone if they love me, and everyone says yes (yay!), so when he gets back to me he points at someone else.

&gt;Sgt: Do you love him?

Since everyone else simply said ""yes"" without the ""like a brother"" part, I replied with a simple ""yes, Sgt.""

&gt;Sgt: Like a boyfriend?

&gt;Me: Like a brother in arms.""

&gt;Sgt: Why not like a boyfriend?

And before I could help myself: 

&gt;Me: You're more my type, Sgt.

Dead silence.  He stares at his feet, holds out his hand.

&gt;Sgt: You don't ever talk to me again the rest of the time we're here.

And walks off.  "

42,"All the printers and computers for my entire school district were networked together. I figured out how to print to other schools. 

So I printed about three hundred memes to every single printer in our rival high school one day. Apparently I made it impossible for them to print anything for about two hours cause they were eqch individual print jobs. I delayed a few tests as well. "
43,"&gt;$user: NO! It's for my computer too!! Are you sure you're even a technician?!

You know what?  You're right.  You're so much smarter than me that I can't imagine why you didn't JUST FIX IT YOURSELF, YOU SHREW!"
44,"&gt;you're just an intern


Yep I guess you're right. Good luck by yourself!"
45,"Not only are you absolutely correct, this is the actual science behind it, too. It's heavily linked to literacy in the interface language.

Lower-literacy users don't scan a page or screen for information - if it's not exactly where they expect, they examine everything line by line until they find it. An interesting implication of this is that vertical priority is especially important for these uses, because they won't jump to section headings."

Texts: ""My friend's computer doesn't work. Fix.""

49,"He's probably expecting a room full of empty cubicles with computers that people log into daily, and he wants to know where that room is. 

Most average (non-tech) people don't have a sound grasp of whats meant when the term ""Virtual machine"" gets thrown out.  It's a foreign concept/non layman terms.

To him ""Virtual machine"" is probably another term for him ""Virtually"" logging into ""his computer"" in the cubical farm at the main office. So, to him, it's perfectly logical that he doesn't need his laptop. "
