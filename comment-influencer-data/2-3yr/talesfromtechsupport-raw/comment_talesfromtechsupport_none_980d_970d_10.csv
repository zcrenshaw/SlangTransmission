&gt; So now we are stuck with fifty Windows 10 tablets

""Sorry, *who* is stuck with fifty tablets? The fact that you didn't follow process and ordered non compliant equipment isn't magically changed because you can't return it. If you can't persuade them to take it back, you'll need to get rid of them some other way, because you can't use them on our network."""

24,"I had something similar happen, a credit union finally got big enough to warrant an IS audit and during my review I noted that the Data Center, an entire floor, had no security beyond a key for that specific floor in the elevator and having all stairwells doors being fire doors, only operable from the inside or fire emergency controls, no security guards or CCTV btw. 

I pointed out that its not really sufficient because the keys were widely distributed and even some stored in publicly accessible areas and the stairwell fire doors are easily overridden. They contested it and in the end said they accepted the risk and that was that.

The next year I returned for the annual audit and noted that they'd installed proper security, a whole second layer of walls separating the data center from the rest of the floor with magnetic doors and biometric locks and a few CCTVs at critical points.

When I asked about the sudden change of direction I was told that they had a major robbery, one night someone accessed the floor from the freight elevator, probably using the key that was hanging in the freight area (basement) wall labelled ""IT Floor"". In the space of approximately three hour, as inferred from the grainy CCTV footage from the building next door, they carted all racks into a truck parked in the freight area and drove away. It was only discovered the next morning, no external monitoring notifications, apparently they also had not implemented my recommended SMS alerts for critical events.

Total loss of $2,750,000 worth of equipment. The kicker is everything was insured for but the insurance company refused to pay out because one of the clauses in their policy invalidated their claim if they had not put up sufficient controls to safeguard against theft, it doesn't help that they had a six month old independent audit report from yours truly pointing out this exact risk and them accepting it, that got a *lot* of people ~~fired~~ leaving to pursue further interests or spend time with their family with the company's best wishes. They didn't even contest it past arbitration with the insurance company, a rarity.

In the end it cost them around $6M for the data center equipment, security, new hires, another audit, etc. On the positive side the audit was a breeze, everyone was co-operative, most of their infrastructure was decent and they were *very* responsive to any issues noted and how to fix them."

At this point most tenants just do it instead of arguing. But I got a few who will refuse to open the door. My super went to the apartment and found the breakers were fine. The apartment had power. One room had no lights. The light bulb was fried. The tenant wanted the super to call an electrician to change a light bulb. The super said ok. He called his cousin, asked him to pull on a overall, stick some tools in his pockets and grab a lightbulb and say ""yes"" if the tenant asked if he was a real electrician.

By contrast, MSIE5 for Windows had shoddy CSS support, no support for transparent PNGs at all (not until MSIE7!), no real download manager (opened a separate window for every download, with no resume capabilities), and didn't have any of the nifty extras that were in the Mac version."
