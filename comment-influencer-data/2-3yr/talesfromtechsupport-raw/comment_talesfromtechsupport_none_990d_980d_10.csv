0,"If the accountant is pissed at you for going above his head, he's fucked something up and it's going to come down on him now.  Since you're not on call, let every call from him go to VM so that you can play them all for MD on the 9th.  Enjoy your vacation!"
1,These people vote and operate motor vehicles.
2,"10 YEARS! 10 FUCKING YEARS! And 45 minutes?! That means he eventually got in, every day. Somehow hitting them with no delay. 10 YEARS! And it took him that long to realise there was an issue and to call someone!?! 

If he's in work 240 days a year (100 weekends 25 holiday/sick) that's 10800 minutes a year or 180 hours or 7 and a half weeks every year. Let's say for 7 years.  He's wasted about 52 and a half WEEKS during this time. 

What. The. Fuck."
3,Lots can be forgiven with a sufficient supply of cookies. 
4,"1. Laptop is working
2. Something falls out of laptop
3. Laptop stops working

Doesn't take a genius to figure out that the thing that fell out made the laptop work, does it?"
5,"It's quite simple really. When there are things like ""Go Away"" and ""Whatever"" being said in any conversation, I usually do just that. It's really not my problem anymore. I realise family is usually different, but I'm still not gonna put up with crap just because someone's family. "
6,"Ah yes. This is caused by your tech aura. Because you work with wires and electronics, you have developed your own magnetic gravity, so the vibrations take longer to reach other people. It isn't significant, but people can usually jump to conclusions before the things you say that sound perfectly reasonable reach their ears. 

If you give them a condescending look (light travels faster than sound, remember?) And give them a second to receive your words, they usually correct themselves."
7,I have no intention of answering my phone to anyone but family and a few close friends before I'm back to work.
8,"&gt; $M:""I thought that you would know more than this as you sit around computers modt of the time""

A fitting response would be: ""I do; that's why I told you exactly what would happen and exactly what you should do about it."""
9,And raise their own tiny idiots.
10,But my brother said he used CCleaner to remove all the cookies from the computer?
11,"&gt;there was a VM from the Manager stating not to worry about it

I was so confused wondering what a Virtual Machine has to do with any of this."
12,"&gt;  How long to turn it back on?

Oh, I think it'll finish booting at 8 a.m. on the 16th."
13,"I wouldn't think so, but then this happened. 

It's like when around computers perfectly abled people turn into drones with the mental capacity of an orangutan."
14,"I AM NOT A PHONE PERSON! AS I AM NOT A PHONE PERSON YOU NEED TO MAKE IT WORK FOR ME.

Sorry i think this is what people do. "
15,"It's not like this is a busy time of year for their retail locations, or anything."
16,"I would be very proud, my techy mom can't even figure those ""dang complicated apple boxes"" out "
17,"It's LibreOffice now, not OpenOffice (OpenOffice still exists, but users should be using LibreOffice)."
18,"To be fair, ALL babies are tiny idiots, even the ones raised by tech support. "
19,"You are forgetting to do the time conversion. He is saying 45 *user* minutes, not real minutes. Using the *Standard User Multiplication Factor* of 0.13, he was actually just wasting a little under six minutes.

Always remember the *user factor,* especially when some exec tells you he needs a brand new computer because last year's financials took ""like, over an hour to download."""
20,"&gt; Marketing lead:""Yes. If you were doing your job, we wouldn't have to do yuor job for you""

""If you're not committing felonies across multiple continents, then what the hell are we paying you for""?"
21,If she was head of HR she should know better than misusing company resources on personal issues.
22,Did someone get fired for this? It would be a satisfying ending if someone got fired for this.
23,"&gt;That means he eventually got in, every day. Somehow hitting them with no delay.

Maybe not. I think sticky keys would come up if he hit alt/ctrl 5 times in a row; and that would solve that problem."
24,Forward the messages of him insulting you to his boss.  Then make sure to call him every night at 4am for the duration of the holiday.
25,i dont think it helped that I had pressure from my Mum and Dad to help her.
26,"A fully updates Windows 7 Ultimate VM complete with MS Office. You fire it up and on the deskop is a readme.txt file.

you open readme.txt, it reads:

""don't worry about it"""
27,"&gt; If the accountant *needs to do some emergency finance work at 4 AM on New Year's Day*, he's fucked something up and it's going to come down on him now."
28,Even just a small gesture like a thank you but you're right  cookies are better. 
29,"If you ever get into programming, learn to use more descriptive variables."
30,Did you get to hang him by the ankles over a bridge for 3 days after he admitted to be an infuriating dumbass?
31,I had to double check I wasn't in /r/explainlikeImCalvin
32,"Exactly. This is my response to asinine statements like that.

""Yes, I do, so why is it that when you ask and I answer you don't listen?"""
33,Yeah but the ones raised by tech support grow out of it.
34,"Reminds me of a programmer joke...

Wife asks husband, ""Please go to the store and get me a gallon of milk and if they have fresh bananas, get a dozen.""

Husband comes home later and starts unloading a trunk full of 12 milk jugs to which his confused wife asks, ""Why did you get so much milk!?""

His response... ""They had fresh bananas."""
35,"Speaking on behalf of the orangutan community, I am offended by that comparison."
36,"&gt;Pay me to do his job for him

I was kind of hoping the boss would respond, ""Okay sure, it's not like you do anything else in IT besides turning it on and off so why don't you absorb his role too."""
37,BECAUSE AS I TOLD YOU I AM NOT A COMPUTER PERSON! YOU NEED TO MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE I AM NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK!
38,"""Pay me his entire salary on top of mine and I'll do his job better, more accurately, and on my lunch break."""
39,From a burner phone
40,"When his wife tells him ""get me 2 apples + 2 oranges from the store"" do you think he goes to the store, gets two apples, comes home, goes to the store, gets two oranges, and comes home? "
41,"That's when I'd come out with the fact that I am helping her, she refuses to help herself. If she refuses to follow directions so that the process will work while I'm here then fine she can figure it out on her own. I would have then left."
42,Ever did a house call to a Greek family's residence? I gained 5 pounds that day.
43,Or why the manager went through the trouble of sending him a virtual machine to give him a message
44,"&gt; I just can't understand how she thought ignoring me, leaving it way too late and then snapping at me was a good idea. 

Because you don't have rights, you're not important and your time isn't worth anything. This is often how it is with family, whatever you're doing, but anything they don't understand (technical, legal, mechanical) tends to be the worst offenders."
45,"I find that making them go above their *own* head seems to make them properly evaluate the severity of their problem a lot of the time. Also, always double your expected fix times. 

For example:

&gt; Acc: Not good enough DPG. How long to turn it back on?

""Well, first you need to contact the MD and have him approve it being turned back on in a non-compliant state. When I receive his call telling me it needs doing, I can probably have it back up within 24 hours, assuming the backups haven't left site yet."""
46,Custom ring tone for contact: silence  
47,"Sooooooo, why does he have your personal mobile? Why does anyone from work who's not a friend/drinking buddy? "
48,"&gt;Thumbs-up to our SEO guy for making sure we rank high with the nginx keyword and thumbs-down to the people only reading the phone number but nothing else on our homepage, I guess.  

Do a search for ""nginx + phone number support"" and you get a bunch of phone numbers. I'd bet he just called each one on google until he got someone willing to talk to him rather to plead ignorance and hang up. "
49,[deleted]
50,But who's on first?
51,"""Have some Baklava!  My mother make! IS BEST IN CITY!""

~Literally happened to me."
52,With Darth Vader breathing for 5 minutes every time.
53,He booked me on a course and gave me his number if there was trouble with the hotel.  I had to call him to sort out the hotel room so I believe he saved it from there.
54,"Sorry, terminal? I don't believe I have a flight today."
55,"This actually happened to me (not New Years but it was 3am on a Saturday morning and I **was** the on call at the time).

Server involved was offline over the weekend for scheduled building/cabling maintainance. Approval for which is given weeks in advance.

Me:""*You* want something thats already approved and already actioned to be undone asap? Well, first I'm going to need *you* to call *your* boss who will need to call the on call manager who will approve your request. *Then*, I will require an incident raised with our 1st line guys with details as to *why* the server needs switched back on. They will escalate it to our change management team who will raise a change order to have the server restarted at a scheduled time after identifying the impact to other services. This requires approval from **all** 2nd and 3rd line teams each of which will require a phone call to their respective on-call guy who will need to remote in to the ticketing system to add their approval to the ticket. Once fully approved, the server can be restarted.""

""Okay, okay. How long will that take?""

Me:""As soon *you* get the final approval entered into the system, I can be in the office in an hour.  The server should be up and running an hour after that once I've healthchecked it. Good luck getting the approval from the on call manager though, nevermind the eight other teams involved in the change process. Have a nice night."" *puts phone down, goes back to sleep*

Result: No more phone calls, no incidents, no escalations. The server was back online by 8am Monday anyway. Guess he realised his request could wait or his manager shot him down (my manager never received a call either)"
56,"You can but that's not really a wtf, he's supposed to be a sysadmin and can't change directories in the command prompt or powershell?! Granted, we all need to learn sometime but thats one of the most basic things a sysadmin should know, the terminal/command prompt."
57,"This.  The latest Libreoffice variants are very, very goddamn good.  I use the Linux variants of course but they're dead nuts stable, compatibility with MS formats including later types is excellent, can't say enough good things."
58,"ahhh. being the IT guy in the family. on christmas, there was a conversation about how my uncle had a surplus of firewood, but would not give any to his neighbor because he spent all the time to cut it up, etc, and that you need to charge for a service. in the same breath, i was told to set up the new tablets and laptops that were opened by family members, spending all day, because who doesn't provide a free service on your day off/holiday? rant over."
59,"""I AM NOT A TECHMOLOGIZER, THIS PHONE IS IN TECHMOLOGESE AND IT SCARES ME, TAKE IT AND PERFORM VOODOO RITUALS TO SCARE OUT THE GHOSTS""

""THE PHONE HAS BEEN BROKEN EVER SINCE YOU PERFORMED YOUR MAGIC, YOU MUST HAVE PUT A CURSE ON IT"""
60,"So the guy had like a laptop worth like 25 grand and handed it over to a tech he'd never met before to do a wipe and restore, and never bothered to backup his ""critical, important!"" data? Yeah, fuck that guy. Zero sympathy."
61,I'm just thanking the retail gods for keeping me out of the store for the last two weeks.
