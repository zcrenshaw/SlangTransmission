"I think any size butt via surgery...Wtf is wrong with people. 
Also, doing deep squats will help you develop an ass; maybe not a huge one but def a good one."
"This is why I like Norway. My dad was in ""jail"" because he recieved money from the state whilst working. He didnt go to like a big scary prison with murderers and rapists. No he went to a trust prison. Very little guards and the doors were completly open. They could just walk out. They were trusted to stay there and go to their reform classes and cause no trouble. And they all did. Because going there meant avoiding a lot more serious prison sentence. So whilst my dad was there he learnt some carpentry and had norwegian classes for resumes and shit. Came out one month later. Prison is def not always the choice. Some people need guidance. My dad is still paying back on what he stole as well, so he didnt just get off the hook or anything. This kind of prison was great for me as well. I was young and my dad could call me often from there and he was straigh up on where he was going and what he had done wrong. I have huge respect for my dad for doing that. "
"Queen: Hungarian Rapsody live from Budapest, 1986. It's in HD, filled with 16 cameras. It was the first Western rock concert behind the iron curtain. You'd be showing the person from 1918 rock music, hi-def film, electric guitars, microphones, massive stadiums, and possibly the only images of Europe they've ever seen. Oh, and also some large-breasted Hungarian women, which is always nice."
She asked to be your WCW? Yeesh I am getting old. I def thought that was just an Instagram thing.
