0,"Update: I did have the ‚Äúare we boyfriends?‚Äù talk with him. He laughed and said he thought we already were. Then he asked me if I would be his boyfriend and I said yes, and we kissed. So I guess I‚Äôm definitely not straight."
1,"You get an upvote for ""do they make men like that in gay?"""
2,maybe stop hanging out with them if they are trash people
3,"I've only known one pair of identical twins and they were indeed identical in that way. A gal once made the mistake of suggestively asking them if they were identical ""all over,"" in a misguided attempt to embarrass them, which caused them to simultaneously and unceremoniously drop their shorts in the middle of a dorm party. (They had that sort of goofy nothing-is-sacred sense of humor, particularly when it came to being identical twins.)

Even people who knew them very well couldn't reliably tell them apart, and they made no effort whatsoever to differentiate themselves from each other. (Pulling farce of mistaken identity gags on people never got old with them either.) The only way in which they were not identical was their sexualities, one of them being exclusively heterosexual, and the other being exclusively homosexual. However, that didn't help when it came to figuring out which was which. At least a couple people who thought they had extremely good ""gaydar"" were totally baffled by them, much to their mocking amusement."
4,"I feel like gay-vision would lead to an x-man style ‚Äúfind all the mutants and kill them‚Äù kinda thing. Homophobic governments/groups would just threaten one guy to work for them with ‚Äúyou will identify other gays or we‚Äôll kill your family‚Äù. Then they‚Äôd just start hunting.

So to answer your question, yes absolutely."
5,Who‚Äôs your dealer 
6,"Save all of those messages and provide them to the police. 

DO NOT respond to him at all. "
7,Thanks. I just knew that to get what I want i‚Äôd have to swallow my pride and admit I like boys. This guy is special and i‚Äôd be an idiot to let him go just so I can hold on to some fake notion of straightness.
8,Also. Jacking off with a buddy is way underrated. No condoms required!
9,To be honest I'm more concerned about the drink driving.
10,"You get the biggest upvote I can possibly give for being able to say it on a post that starts with ""I'm straight.""  I give closet cases flak for not owning up to what it is they want, but you may have just come out quicker than I did, and I thought I  came out pretty quick, damn. Full points to you, that's a feat! Also, that story was really nice, especially now in the context of you being so ready to admit this. I suppose if I had a guy I really cared about, I would have come out sooner, but you were willing to come out specifically for this guy.  That's really sweet, good for you! Proud of you."
11,As long as you're aware that every day isn't going to be like that.
12,I thought I was reading a description of me until the big dick part.

15,"Thanks, wanna fuck?"
16,"I hope you fucking report him to the police, for all the guys like me who will never get justice. I was a naive 20 year old, he drugged me up till I couldn't move and raped me. Then left the country, he was visiting for pride. Pride my ass. I'm 44 and I've lived (living) a good successful life but that took a big chunk out of it. Good for you for getting closure. "

1. Rank them in order in your apprehension to tell:  easiest to hardest
1. Tell the easiest, then the next one, then the next.  Most of your guesses will be right, so momentum and confidence will build.  
1. By the time you're telling #10, it's easy.  And even if #10 has a problem with it, you'll know it's not the end of the world.  "

29,"I just wana go live with him in the jungle and cook n clean for him while he builds shit. 

Oh and you know, at night give him massages and anything he wants really. 

God damn is that ever a man. "
30,"This is weirdly adorable if real.

Yoooou *might* want to reconsider your sexuality and relationship status. You spend a lot of time with him, do relatively romantic stuff with him, you have good sex - hell, he's about to introduce you to his parents. 

You, sir, have a boyfriend in all but name.

Congrats on weirdly stumbling into unstraightness, I guess!

Don't keep yourself from getting closer to him just because you identified as straight up to this point. You two seem to have a great thing going."
31,"Ah yes, the gay mating dance"

33,"Um you have done nothing wrong if these allegations are false. You need to find out excactly what the complaint was. You should formally request written evidence of this so called complaint made, which is your right. It is their problem if they are uncomfortable just by your presence. Not sure what country you are in? but if you were dismissed soley due to this alleged alligation, that is false, and hasn't been proved, you could take legal action and take this to an employment tribunal."
34,"&gt; The only way in which they were not identical was their sexualities, one of them being exclusively heterosexual, and the other being exclusively homosexual. 

That is honestly extremely fascinating to me. I wonder how much of our sexuality is predicated on genetics, how much on epigenetics, and how much on early life experiences. "

50,"That‚Äôs really rough. I am so sorry that you are going through this.

Are you going to talk to him soon to know what happened? By reading your first comment it just sounds...weird. "
51,"I was in a pretty short relationship once with this guy where he wanted to call me ""daddy"". Great I love that. But in return he wanted to be called mommy. It was not cute..."
52,Yes. Take out a restraining order. 
53,‚ÄúDating while gay is like job hunting. You either need a referral or need to do it online‚Äù
54,"Well you know, it's ok. Guys can be attractive without being hung. "
55,"I'm completely the same.  For casual sex... I'm pretty much only open to jerkoff buds.  Personally I feel like long intense mutual bate sessions with a bit of other stuff... can be just as hot... or even hotter than penetrative sex since there's no need to worry about getting STIs or the whole ""prepping"" thing.  It's safe, fun, and hot as fuck.  Plus I like that both guys are ""equal"" in it... no top... no bottom.

It's not that I'm not open to anal sex... but definitely wouldn't even consider it with random guys from hook up apps.  Personally... it's not even worth the trouble."
56,But only gays would have this new innovative technology üòâlol

60,"You're so new it's adorable. Grindr is a shitty app full of shitty fuckboys. Your face pic is everything, and ultimately that's what you'll be judged on. You could actually be really handsome but if your face just caught the wrong light or you snapped from a bad angle guys will scroll on past you. It's a cesspool full of bad behavior but we all want to get laid, so we put up with it. Just do not let Grindr define your attractiveness or worth as a person. You'll become hard in due time."

65,"So, in college, I ended up working for the admissions office, and meeting the counselor who ultimately admitted me.

I worte my essay about mixing art and science, and how art was something I was always told to hide, because it would make me too girly and femme, mainly artsy == gay (which I know isnt the case, but that was everyones mindset). Anyway, the juxtaposition is actually what made me stand out.

Forward a year or two later, I ended up writing a whole post about being gay and the struggles of college and coming out, as well as navigating a discipline (mechanical engineering) that is primarily masc male dominated. It is still one of the most viewed posts by the admissions departments, and counselors told me that people were STILL referencing it in interviews, essays, and applications.

So, yes, I echo to be yourself. It shows as more authentic, and ultimately, they just want top quality work."

70,Have a boyfriend.
71,"yes. 

long story short: Met a dude online while i was looking for a place to live, after we hooked up a couple times, he said i could crash in his spare until I left the country (very short time). He worked different hours. I remembered his scent from hooking up, so one day I was passing by his room and saw his drawers on the floor. gave em a sniff and got so turned on. huffed and puffed and blew my load pretty hard. left the drawers where I found them, cleaned myself up and went on my way. 

was it creepy as fuck? definitely. Was it one of my best 'stimulus free' sessions, absolutely."

You just know you could hang out with him for half a day and you wouldn't even need to talk once. "
80,Having sex with somebody who loves me?
81,"You got a really nice guy there that reacted perfecty. Maybe tell him some random reddit guy is proud of him beeing caring :-D.  
But some other thing i want to point out. Young guys like you tend to fall in love with their first sex partners pretty easily. Though this is not neccessarily bad, just be aware that sexual satisfaction and love is not the same and check twice if you actually fit together bevor you go further. Might save you from some disappointments later."

86,Are you me? This is my exact dream. Taking care of my jungle husband as he takes care of me. 
87,"It's not really a go to move as much as something that I enjoy a lot because it makes bottoms legs twitch and they moan alot.

Bottom on his back legs wrapped around me. My arms under him holding him up for support.  Then just lift him on and off my dick. Or I can hold him up and thrust upwards into him. I find that angle while not the most pleasurable for me, hits the prostate on a lot of guys just right. 

First they'll tighten their hold on me with their legs and start bucking and moaning. Some reach for wgatever they can. Its kind of cute really. (One guy grabbed a pillow and was just crushing the fuck out of it and started drooling) Then they're legs will start to tire and involuntarily twitch and hey start losing it big time around then, so they're being held up like that by just my arms at that point, which can be tiring. If they keep with it, and I don't tire my arms out too fast they're going to cum, and cum hard. 

Some guys ask me to stop because it's too much, so I do and I just lay them down on me still fully inserted and move my hips slowly while jacking them off or feeling their body. This rubs the prostate too and it's a more slow and gradual build up. Guys say it feels like they have to piss when I do this. 

I tried my best to describe things and it works for me. I think everyone just needs to find what works best for them and they guy they're with. "
88,"Move, I'm gay!"
89,"Congrats.  Truly, that's wonderful!

Lol... but I will say it is... just a date.  But I get it, it's your first one.  I'm genuinely happy for you, just be yourself and don't go wild with imaginary expectations.  Enjoy it for what it is."

95,"I‚Äôm a bit afraid of not identifying as straight, but I also worry that eventually i‚Äôll have to stop using that term as it applies to myself because he‚Äôs pretty openly gay and having a guy who can‚Äôt commit so far as to call him his boyfriend will scare him off at some point. And I don‚Äôt want to do anything that will cause me to lose him. But coming out as non- straight is also scary, which is weird because people already think of me as gay anyway. My sister said that she and our family saw it coming a long time ago, which was a bit off- putting."
96,"I went through something similar freshman year - had an incel stalker and found out he was threatening to kill me and my group of friends.

It will take time, but see this as a blessing in disguise. "
108,"Don't let them get you down. It's not that hard. It's certainly not always sunshine and rainbows. The hardest part is getting used to being bored together. That happens a lot. Also, learning not to compulsively talk just because the other person is in the room. 

Getting adjusted to each other's lifestyles is tough too. The way that people learn to solve problems is sometimes drastically different. My boyfriend does and says some stuff that has made me cringe, for example, when we're hanging out with friends. But that's just how he handles social encounters and the people he's talking to don't seem to mind.  ¬Ø\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø "

I was just wondering. I just really like hooking up, but I definitely can be monogamous with you."" Several months later, INSISTED that he be in an open relationship with me because monogamy is a ""old way of thinking"" for heterosexual people and that it was just me trying to ""control him"".

159,"That reminds me an article I read about Islamic State members who got a dude's phone and went through their list in order to find his friends who are gay. [This article has some info](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/the-islamic-states-shocking-war-on-homosexuals).

In case you can't read, here there is part of the article:

&gt;Last year, the BBC published the testimony of a gay Iraqi man with the pseudonym Taim who had fled an area overrun by the Islamic State. He lamented the extent to which many in the communities in which he was raised cheered the Islamic State's persecution of perceived homosexuals. (The Islamic State is also known as ISIS and ISIL.) He said:
&gt;
&gt; *Isis are also professional when it comes to tracking gay people. They hunt them down one by one. When they capture people, they go through his phone and his contacts and Facebook friends. They are trying to track down every gay man. And it's like dominoes. If one goes, the others will be taken down too.*
&gt;
&gt; *It's devastating to see the public reaction to the killings. Usually, when Isis posts pictures online, people sympathise with the victims ‚Äî but not if they're gay. You should see the Facebook comments after they post video of the killings. It's devastating. ""We hate Isis but when they do things like this, we love them. God bless you Isis."" ""I am against Isis but I am totally with Isis when they kill gays."" ""Amazing news. This is the least that gays deserve."" ""The most horrible crime on earth is homosexuality. Good job Isis."" ""The scene is ugly but they deserve it."" ""Those dirty people deserve Isis.""*"

163,"For starters, there's nothing wrong with sucking dick (it's actually kinda cool that so many guys are into it).

If you don't want to 'own it.' You could at least try to be neutral about it. If your friends see that it's a soft spot for you they'll keep picking at it. "
164,"It sounds like you are gay and dealing with the repercussions of a lifetime of bigotry against your true nature.  I don't think you will be able to find peace with yourself until you come to terms with your sexuality. Please do not do anything rash.  You are a beautiful human being who deserves love. 

 It really sounds like you could use a therapist to help deal both with the suicidal ideation and your struggles with sexuality.  Try to take good care of yourself.  "

169,"Bisexuality is a thing, and it comes in flavours. Some bi peeps are equally attracted to both sexes, some to only very specific people on one side while being more easily attracted to the other. You don't have to drastically change who you are, come out to everyone you know, or go to Pride. You just gotta be open enough to be able to be happy with your guy.

Just enjoy things with the one guy who made you feel stuff - don't overthink it, and don't feel obligated to explain/justify your relationship with him to people. Oh - and talk to him about what you're saying now - make what you feel known to him.

Just talk with him and be open, I'm sure he'll be of more help than we are."

We hooked up on growlr. He arrived at my door, I was surprised to see how tall he was and he loved how small i was. After hours of messing around and getting off several times later we were resting on my bed, catching our breath after the wild sex we just had.

During, he said no one had ever let him cum in their face before, *ever*. I indicated to him that this would be acceptable to me. 'Come on, then,' were my exact words.

Well, that got him over the line. And he absolutely rinsed me. It was endless. I was virtually gasping for air.

Trans service members don't only deserve our empathy but they deserve our respect. Trans service members fought and advocated for the repeal of DADT. To simply disregard them and fall in line with the propaganda disseminated by the current administration is historically ignorant. 

And to the person that said ""just don't tell anyone"". I question whether that person even served in the military during DADT. While I agree there are personal matters that aren't anyones business however then why are there resources to help service members with family and or marital problems? Are you implying that trans service members and pre-DADT LGB service members should be denied those services too?

Worst: Japan, oh god, Japan.


Edit: Brazilian and Mexican guys wear their heart on their sleeves. This could be a con, because there is sometimes drama over small stuff, but they are really passionate and loyal. I have straight girl friends who had mexican boyfriends propose to them 6-8 months in the relationship.

Japanese guys..... Have a lot of hangups, to say the least. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but they don't see ""being gay"" as a thing, I think they see it as a deviancy. So a lot of weird things stem from that; I had 3 guys in my time there actually tell me they still plan on marrying girls and having children, ""Coming out"" isn't exactly a thing either, and they just don't take you seriously.

Plus, the general stereotypes are true: Japanese people are, generally, distant (Still got referred to with a -san honorific after banging), passive (never wants to do anything) and not all that warm (hugs are simply not a thing either. And this is me being totally shallow: Japanese guys aren't really into working out and their dicks are unwashed."

203,"Heh. You got it. 

So, I can‚Äòt remember what exactly happened the days/weeks before leading up to it, just it was middle of the week and he and I were at the church after a Scouts event, (we were both in the same swim team as well) so there was probably a handful of people on the church grounds, that‚Äôs it. We were goofing off and we randomly remembered there was butterscotch candies in a jar on his dad‚Äôs(the bishop of our ward) office desk and made a beeline for the office. It was locked up and dark, but we were able to sneak in through a window. 

We ransacked the candy, then for whatever reason we started spitting the candy out of our own mouth into the other‚Äôs trying to catch it, then just trying to pass the candy teeth to teeth. That took one round and we were suddenly making out insanely horned with raging boners trying to do all the things at once with each other. Kissing  turned to licking, licking turned to sucking each other, then that turned to me having him over the desk slowly making headway until we could work it all in with a lotta spit. 

That was something like an hour.  After we wrapped up and realized how long we had been gone,  we had to find our parents because we knew they were gonna be pissed off. We thought we were being so clever. We snuck back out of the office and then we went the opposite directions to circle to our parents in front, to look like we hadn‚Äôt been hanging out. 

We made one error that the parents asked. Scout shirts  have your name on them. üôÑ we had to come up with some story that we threw our clothes in the same locker at swim practice earlier and it must have happened then! 

I didn‚Äôt notice the shirt mixup. I was intensely focused on the candy smell. I was terrified because I was sure the butterscotch smell was undeniably obvious, and we both still reeked of butterscotch candy and sweat from the spit all over both of us.

So, yeah, I still get excited whenever I smell  those damned Brach‚Äôs butterscotch candies. 

Ta-da! "

Maybe you should take a step back and consider why you're letting other people affect you that way.

I wasn't there so I can't say for certain, but I can't imagine anyone ""straight up"" telling you you can't be in a club because you are unattractive, and if they did I can't imagine they said that in a vacuum without some sort of prompting from you first. if anything I think you're just using race as an excuse to not look more closely at yourself to see what the real problem is.

247,"I really gave the open relationship a try and all it did was cause me emotional stress that never felt right. I kept pushing that feeling to the back of my mind, saying to myself ""oh I'm just being old fashioned and prudish.""  My BF and I had good sexual relationship and yes we were very open about who we slept with, but in the end it wasn't enough. After we broke up I felt horrible and guilty for being unable to make open work, and he told me he felt horrible and guilty for needing to be open.

I'll follow this up with today, I am in a monogamous relationship and I couldn't be more happy. It feels right and we have an even better sexual relationship. I don't think I would be devastated if cheated on at this point, as living through the open relationship was far more emotionally draining to me. Ultimately for me trust here is very black and white, so I have a rule, if either of us ever cheats on the other, we have to tell each other right away and we must forgive each other. If I find out from some other way, then we are over and done, no questions asked."

Honestly I think you're doing fine though. He seems like he gets off on making you cum more than getting off himself. "

But a mom's gotta mom and she was taking over the household and in all of my stuff.  She was running across all. of. my. stuff!  The bag'o'dildos.  The leather gear.  All of it.    She was stoic through all of it: not mad, not sad, just a trooper.
