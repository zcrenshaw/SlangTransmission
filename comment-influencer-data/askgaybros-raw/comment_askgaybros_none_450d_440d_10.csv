0,"He is definitely making some dangerous and unhealthy choices.

My suggestion is that you buy him a package of sessions with a certified personal trainer as a gift for his newfound interest in fitness. Talk to the trainer in advance and let him know your concerns. That way he can work with your son on setting goals and use that as a way to address both exercise and nutrition. "

6,"So the guy has some internal issues he's dealing with and lol unfortunately (no fault of yours) he unloaded it all on you during sex. 

For some people, sex can be a very serious and an emotional connection, especially if it's their first time. Other people, meh, sex is sex, nothing but a means of release. 

If you care for him, listen to him. Be there for him. Take it one step at a time. He'll open up to you, and eventually give you the best of himself he possibly can. He just needs to sort things out in his head first. "
7,How do I delete other people’s comments
8,"**Do not** under any circumstances go to conversion therapy.

Whatever you have to do to not go, do it.

**DO NOT GO TO CONVERSION THERAPY**

Resist. Get the police involved if you have to. Florida does not have a statewide ban on conversion therapy but your county might. Look up resources and your ability to refuse this procedure as a legal right. Because it's 'doctors' there may be some complication, but you do have rights.

[List of counties that individually ban conversion therapy on minors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._jurisdictions_banning_conversion_therapy_for_minors)

There is no way to properly express how utterly horrible these 'treatments' can be to go through. People lose their lives to 'treatments' like these. Those that don't can be scarred for life. Do not willingly sit in a room for hours with someone who is going to tell you that there is something wrong with you. God help you if you actually start to believe what they say.

You cannot even begin to imagine the nightmarish horrors that these people have inflicted on others under the guise of 'curing' them.

Electric shock therapy. Nausea-inducing drugs. Masturbatory reconditioning. Did you know that doctors can measure your arousal by attaching a band to your genitals and monitoring the blood flow? 

Seek out any friend or relative that can look after you safely and provide for you until you're 18. Don't run away from home, and don't become homeless, but if you value your life **do not** go to this 'therapy'."

He jumped out of bed and then proposed to me while he was still half naked and she was staring right at me. 

Ultimately he blamed my cancer treatments for his cheating and said that he was worried I was going to die. He knew full well that I had a highly treatable form of testicular cancer. "

18,"One of our regular customers came in with this girl he met three months ago and he asks us “Hey, is everyone here?” And we’re just like Uhh... yeah? He then says “Good. I want you guys to witness this.” He hands a box to the girl and says “Will you marry me?” She said yes and we’re all standing there awkwardly, then I start a slow clap. It was so cringy... They broke up about a month later."

Keep on keeping on bro. 
26,"hey kiddo, I know it isn't much, but if you go there frequently, why not contact the restaurant and say something like

&gt; hi, I'm a kid and I ate here with my dad yesterday. He asked for a non-gay waiter, which I think is wrong. I want to say I support that waiter 100% and I think my dad's a bigot.
If we come back here and he does the same thing again, I think it would be extremely funny if you just throw us out on the street so that he learns his lesson.


Obviously, use your own words. And it can be anonymous if you want (you could send them an actual letter on actual paper!)

If it's a big chain restaurant then it's even more important to contact them because the problem might be happening in other towns too. You can look on their website for a complaints link, and message them there.

31,"Omg he’s so sexy, he can put that finger into me"
32,"The reasoning behind his decision is pretty sound (gay men overwhelmingly like slim/athletic/muscular guys, and a guy with your son's stats definitely meets that criteria).

39,"When I was a depressed, lonely, deeply closeted teenager, I would often fantasize about lying next to a future partner in bed. I just wanted someone who I could be close to.

These days, I think I’m fairly OK with being single. I still feel lonely sometimes, but I recognize that in order to be a good boyfriend for someone else, I need to learn to be comfortable with myself first."
40,"No, I didn't even consider it. At that point I was too tired to keep trying to make things work. My life consisted of medical appointments, a busy college schedule (I was signed up for course overload so I was taking over 20 credit hours per semester), and I was also writing half of my ex's college papers for him. I did unfortunately stay with him for another 2 weeks after that. Over time, my self esteem improved, I graduated with honors, and got a clean bill of health. Now I'm with a very considerate  smart, handsome guy. We have a house, a dog  and a cat together."
41,Fuck those people. This is why I can't with some of those self-claimed activists. 
42,"Update us in a year and a half or so when the new relationship rose-colored glasses have fallen away. Those feelings you have of everything being ""so right"" is literally a drug produced in your brain to make you feel that way. I'm not saying the relationship won't last, but people who get together quickly and go the distance are the exception, not the rule. I echo a previous comment in saying that saying ""I told you so"" after two months is like bragging about how well you can drive when you reach the end of the driveway. Best of luck!

43,The edit really makes a world of difference here.

48," I mean, gay raids were part of the history and still commonplace in many parts of the world. Moreover, transgender prostitutes might face harder persecutions (do not take my word for it). The tension is there, however, I believe that more and more the gay community is entrenched in the middle class, and therefore, it is more police-friendly than ever. "

52,"I did not witness this but my parents have a story I’ll share, let your votes judge me. 

1. My dad took my mom around the side of her house by the trash cans, asked her to marry him without a ring. 

2. My mom’s response wasn’t yes or no, it was “as long as you don’t become a pastor” (her grandpa was a pastor who always said my mom would make a good pastor’s wife and she hated that)

3. My dad then asked her parents if he could marry her and they said no and began yelling at each other in front of the whole family (I story I first heard after my dad listened to the song “Rude” and said that was exactly what happened) 

4. My dad eventually got a ring for her and the way he gave it to her was asking her to pick him up after a bike ride, she drove to get him and he was all gross and sweaty and he drove her car back and at a stoplight said “hey babe, I have something for you if you reach in my pocket” 

5. My grandparents encouraged (sent) my mom to a school out of state to get away from my dad. He followed her and she dropped out of college to elope. 

6. Eventually I was born and the family came together once my dad decided to become a pastor after all 

7. Karma is their firstborn son was born gay to be more fabulous to make up for their engagement."

60,I guess he didn't really want to be humiliated.
61,"I think the rejection of the cops also has to do with the brazen and shameless way in which institutions of power (the police force, the fbi, etc) have adopted a shallow facade of support for the pride movement as a means of appearing innocent, progressive, modern, and ultimately 'on the side of the people,' which, in practice, is not how many of these institutions actually work. To allow these institutions to get away with this empty support of the pride movement -- which support, to be clear, is common now only because it is fashionable -- is to turn a blind eye to the injustices that are perpetrated by these same institutions against minorities (sexual, racial, religious, etc). Historically, at least, pride is meant to service the oppressed and marginalized. The police force's desire to be present at pride is not so much about their concern for serving and protecting all people, but rather is about cultivating positive brand recognition. And that's not ok."
62,"Has he identified a ""goal weight""?   142 pounds at 5'10"" is a healthy weight/height, but if he doesn't show any signs of stopping at a particular point, this sounds like body dysmorphia disorder and he needs actual professional help, no different than if you had a straight daughter dealing with anorexia.

63,"&gt;They say it's not conversion therapy, just simple therapy done by Christian doctors who want to eradicate homosexuality.

That is conversion therapy.  I'm really sorry that your parents are trying to force this on you.

How old are you? Do you live in the US (if not, then what country)? Do you have any family members that don't hold similar views to your parents?

64,"&gt;Not every club is a gay bar. 

Not with that attitude."
65,"I can't help but laugh at this.

The only way forward is for you to repeatedly communicate that you thought you were giving him what he wanted and that his dick is fine for you. He's a bottom, I'm guessing, so he really shouldn't care. "
66,I would vote for him if I lived in PA
67,"The first pride march, Stonewall, was a riot against police abuse and harassment of queer people. Cops put trans people in prisons and jails with the opposite gender and were the driving force behind the criminalization of gay bars. It's pretty understandable. "
68,"I am so thankful that your mom backed you up bro. 

It is sad that your dad and brother think this is some kind of ok, it isn’t. 

You only have control over yourself, and sometimes even that is hard, we love you, and hate you have to deal with this kind of family rejection. Stay strong, be real, and don’t take on blame for something other people do. 

It isn’t normal, it isn’t ok, they shouldn’t expect you to be someone you aren’t. "
69,"Yeah, he's totally the kinda of guy which sex would matter *a lot*. I just wish I could do more. "
70,"This is the advice to take in this thread. They will torture you, if not physically then psychologically. Tell your parents whatever it takes to get them to change their mind. Do. Not. Go."
71,I don't think this is true at all. Masc guys are prized in the gay community.

76,My partner and I have been together for nearly 8 years. I’ve cum in his ass from day one.

78,"Only 13! Hang in there lil' gay bro. Your life is going to be so much more amazing when you're away from that toxic asshole. I promise. There's a new and wonderful time ahead of you. Again, like everyone else here, my advice is knuckle down and study so that your ticket out of wherever you are is a good college."
79,"I hate shit like this. I will always be vocal against gays who think we should exclude groups that may have been unhelpful in the past, but have since demonstrated changes.

Alienating groups because of what someone did 30 years ago is not productive. Unless they are being outwardly homophobic RIGHT NOW, there's no reason to spread hate like that"
80,Can't say. That requires me to be called cute in the first place.
81,Im 13 and can't livevalone yet but I'm gonna move out as soon as im 18
82,"The worst one I remember wasn't all that bad, but embarrassing as hell. I was in a car accident in high school. I have some really intense scars on my upper thighs and pelvis from getting crushed. The second time I ever tried hooking up with anyone, I was 22. I'm a smol azn boi, so I'm not exactly swimming in guys who want to date me. I finally meet a nice guy, tall, smokin' hot, I have no idea why he's even talking to me so I'm dtf. 

We get to his place, I try to give him a BJ but I can't fit his chode in my mouth because I'm toothy and my mouth isn't that big. Well that sucks, but he's still good to go. We make out, my clothes come off and he sees the deep scars on my body and says ""Oh"" followed by the longest pause of my life then ""I'm sorry, but that's nasty."" Rest. In. Peace. My. Self-esteem.

I got dressed and walked my sorry ass home and was depressed for weeks. I still think about it sometimes and it's been years."
83,Omggggg how could I forget Cupcakke??? LGBT is my favorite song by her. I wonder if Alexa will play her 🤔
84,Did you not check grindr to see if the dad was on?
85,She does what he says.  Shes not good alone so i think she stays with him.  He loves her and hes nice to her and better than my real dad.  Shes not homophobic or racist or nothing.
86,"I get the same way. I've never had gay friends or really any kinda ""gay life"" outside of Scruff hookups so I think that's the reason. Seeing gay guys out there being confident, not   downplaying their gayness, and socializing with other gay friends or boyfriends is kinda like a reminder that I'm nowhere near that life even though I'm gay too."
87,"All this bullshit to protect the parents, who are grown-ups.

Dude - live your life."
88,You should've asked the waiter for a new step father.
89,"Uncomfortable? No. Slightly irritated? Yes. Like we already have a hard enough time trying to connect with other gay folks without our spaces being inundated with straights. Now it's becoming more of a thing to think ""he might not even be gay/bi"" when you're at a GAY bar or club. I think it's great to be included, but man. The club in my town is becoming more and more populated with straight folks and it's annoying."
90,"I hear this from the youngsters all the time.  With many of them their dislike of the sexual act issues form the fact that they were jumping into bed with a complete stranger.  They were expecting the sexual at itself to provide the meaning and the pleasure.

Many many folks require a human connection for the sex to be good.  They have to know, like, and admire the person they get in bed with.  When you think about it, the sexual act is rather ridiculous.  What gives it the thrill is your admiration and liking of the man you are interacting with.

There is no doubt in my mind that the best sex issues form being in love with the person you get that close to.  For myself, I can't imagine letting anyone that close if I didn't admire and respect and like them."
91,"I'd mostly stay out of it.  Your business is with him directly as he's upset that you didn't loop him in, but this was probably at the brother's behest since he didn't want to come out.  

Best you can do is just be supportive to your casual partner.  

As for what HE should do, probably best to apologize to the brother and ask not to be outed to the family.  It's a bit of a trap because this overreaction is likely why he was scared to come out to the brother in the first place, but if it's padded with enough ""I know you're family, but I was scared"" he might skate by."
92,Definitely not a turn-off. I love pocket gays!
93,Its ok youre both adults
94,Romantic
95,"It's kinda gross that you are expected to bottom when you don't like it and he refuses to do it, that's the first thing I thought when I read this. Anal doesn't have to be part of every relationship. And you can defos enjoy oral with a big peen, you just have to use more comfortable techniques. Contrary to the tide as of porn, there are other (better) ways to stimulate than deepthroat. So just talk about it! Best wishes x"

114,"Not super annoyed or anything, but it really bothers me when straight women go to them and then complain about straight men being there and hitting on them. Like, they go like “ugh those heteros, this is a gay bar”. Bitch, you’re also a hetero and you belong here as much as straight guys do. In fact, the guys hitting on them could be bisexual, which means they belong there infinitely more than they do.

I don’t know if that’s a thing in America, but it’s REALLY common here in my country.

Tl;dr: straight people being in gay bars/clubs don’t really bother me. What bothers me is when straight women think that’s their place and they belong there more than straight men."

This post is a mess."
118,"Ok.....You need to get some practical advice that really is outside the scope of a forum like reddit. I know that you know this already. 

My suggestion is that you make contact with your former councilor and ask for some support therapy. 

It isn't that you have to quit, but you need to understand honestly whether or not you can handle this going forward. 

I was 13 when the guy did me. It lasted about 3 years. It ended no different than yours with nothing criminal happening to him. 

If he was at my workplace and I had to deal with him each day I don't know if I could handle that. So....get in touch with your therapist and see if you think that is a doable task or not. 

Second...model interactions with him with a safe person like a therapist. Give yourself some opportunity to know where to draw lines, what to say, how to say it, what to do if he ever does cross the line. Figure out how to be alone when you want to be alone. How to excuse yourself to a private restroom or other place where you can get away from him and control your personal space. 

You need to be proactive and take some supportive actions now for dealing with what you are going through. Get counselling.  "

If it doesn't work, try to find someone to help you, you are in the US, there are people who will help you. Investigate if there is any organization to help you. Maybe someone in your school?"

Don't tell the boyfriend, just tell the dad. When he sees you naked say, ""Oh, could you give me a second to get dressed?"" When he shows you his cock, just say, ""Something told me I should have used the stall"". When you go on the backpacking trip, just remember that he can't do anything to you, he is thinking that you must want it because you were so promiscuous. So just tell him. ""I need some privacy right now please"" or ""Don't touch me, I don't want that"". 

If you stand up for yourself it will be more effective with stopping it than it will be to tell your boyfriend. "

So I got on the train and went down to Baltimore, getting hornier with each passing mile.

He met me (and I about bent him over right there in Penn Station) and we walked over to his place. On the way someone yelled out of their car ""PUT YOUR DICK IN HIS BUTT"" and I yelled back ""OH I INTEND TO""

Which, after we smoked some weed, I did. For three hours. 3 loads and 3 condoms later, he finally tapped out. Oh, and he was incredibly verbal. 

Only to get 3 more in the morning for another marathon session.

Haven't had sex like that ever since. I often wonder what happened to him. Once I put up a missed connection ad in Baltimore's Craigslist looking for him but noone replied. "

186,"I’m originally from the UK and I loved seeing the police (and fire/ambulance/armed services) at pride, but I think these institutions need to defend the community before they get to be a part of it. (Note I’m speaking on an institutional level here, of course there are LGBT+ individuals in those institutions but that doesn’t mean squat if the whole force more often oppresses than protects.)

That means protecting the whole community. Yeah they’re mostly okay with (straight-passing) white queer dudes but what about POC and trans/GNC folks? If the police routinely pick up trans women for solicitation or POC for walking while black then they don’t get to hold hands and sing kumbya with us for the annual photo-op. 

I think it comes down to a place-by-place decision for that reason. You think Toronto queers want the police anywhere near pride when they begged for years for someone to investigate the serial killer in their midst and everyone turned a blind eye? If these institutions don’t care about us for 364 days of the year then they can sling their hook for the one day they think it’ll make good PR."

I'm out and I love being gay. I wouldn't change my sexuality if I could.

195,"I have an islamic background and my advice is you need to look after yourself. Protect yourself should be priority number one.

Stay in the closet for your own safety. Only tell friends you truly trust and have no affiliation with your family (no friend that talks to your brothers or anything).

Disable all notifications for dating apps and use Nova Launcher and hide all the apps. Depending on how big your religion group is, don't put your face pic up on apps.

A main goal should be getting into college or university. If you dorm, that will give you immense freedom and you can be who you want. If you commute, spend lots of time on campus even if you dont have classes and you can explore.

Get a part-time job ASAP and build a doomsday savings account. If the cat gets out of the bag somehow you'll at least be able to somewhat support yourself.

Once you leave college you can move out then when you come out if they disown you, you've already set yourself up so it won't matter. And if it feels immoral to use them, to me it's more immoral to disown your own children based on their sexual orientation they never chose.

These tips may be a little extreme but they've been what I've been doing for around a year now. Good luck man."

I am myself gay and Christian. after similar people got to me, I prayed to be changed and got my answer, I'm as I should be and I bet if you pray and ask God for a sign he will tell you that you are as you should be too. 

God has a plan for all of us, and our plan involves being gay. Maybe it's to adopt children or support others, we won't know but clearly we're made gay.

""Christian doctors"" means ""religious psychopaths"", they have their unshakable idea of what things should be based on what power seeking humans tell them, not what the Bible or science or even the government says. They know their attempts to change us is wicked, they don't care because they have hate in their hearts.

Pray and ask God for the strength and guidance to help you protect yourself from these wicked ""Christian doctors"", because you are not broken. 

On this month of pride, I hope you find the pride inside you to fight this. That you feel God's love for you in the way he made you, not the hate that mislead and hateful people try to make you feel.

When Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of life, they and their descendants learned what sin was and could feel it. While I felt the pressure of society to be straight until I came out, I never felt sinful for it. I bet you, nor anyone else on this sub has ever felt sinful for being gay.

That's because it's not a sin, it's not a defect ether.

So, I would say to fight this incarceration. You are clearly Christian like I am thought, so pray. God loves his gay boys, regardless of what some redneck carves into a bathroom stall."

212,"We almost broke up because of a bag of rice.

I buy good rice. Rice goes in the rice drawer (yes, I have an entire drawer dedicated solely to my precious rice. Come at me). One day, rice is not in the rice drawer. Oh hell no. Where is the rice? *Where is the rice, Julian*? I ask him where the rice is. He has no idea what I'm talking about. The rice in the rice drawer, I said. Who moved my rice? Cue an hour of intense arguing where we both hate each other.

My boyfriend rips open the rice drawer and effectively pulls it out of the cabinet. We both get showered in a spray of rice. The bag was put in the drawer above and had become lodged way in the back and ripped apart when my boyfriend pulled it out in anger.

We continue arguing about rice, but now because there's a hellish ricescape to clean up."
213,"So to be clear: 

Timeline:

Dec 2017 -comes out to you

March 2018 -doesn't come out to oldest sister

May 2018 -Found Dead 

June 20th 2018 - would have been 16th birthday, but died in early May


Healing from the death of your brother is going to be hard on your family. It will change them. Keeping secrets may seem respectful, but truth honors his memory. You lost your gay brother. That is a fact. You can tell them that if you like. You can ask them if he came out to them. You can choose whether or not to blame them for his death based on their responses....but....and hear me when I say this...none of this will tell them that you are hurting, that you miss him, that you wish you had said something, that you wish he had said something, that you wish it hadn't happened. You should say all those things too. 

There may come a moment when your parents fall apart and say that it is their fault that he died. It isn't true you know. If they could have prevented it I am fairly sure if they had known they would have taken action. 

Are you aware that not every family survives the death of a child? Your parents marriage may suffer. Your Mother may do what you are doing...blame your father for her son's death. Your father may be blaming your mother for it. 

My advice is to talk mainly about **YOUR** feelings. Use ""I"" statements. You can tell them that you wish you knew more about why he chose to die and that you felt like he could have made it through life fine even being gay. 

If you find out they didn't accept it and that he left a suicide note that blamed them for his choice, will you be able to forgive them? Will this revelation destroy your relationship with your parents. It may be appropriate if you really suspect them for driving him to it.

Unless you want to claim he's one of those ""love the sinner hate the sin"" kinda people but frankly I think that is a stupid tactic designed to pass the blame so to speak so people can hate gays but still try to seem like they aren't hateful pieces of shit.
