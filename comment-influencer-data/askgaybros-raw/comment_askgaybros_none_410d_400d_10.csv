0,Embrace it. It's super hot.
1,it seems like you mother is coming along but youre fathers a cunt
2,"Your parents showed up to someone else's house 12 hours earlier than expected and then just...went inside.? They're the ones who should be embarrassed and ashamed for violating someone else's privacy. 

As for what they saw, they'll get over it. It'll take time, but they'll get over it. "
3,"I don‚Äôt have an opinion on the edginess of pizza, but I do have an anecdote: when I was a young child (about 2 y.o) I brought a slice to a sewer grate and tried to bait the Ninja Turtles into coming out. "
4,The bottom shame is strong with this one. 
5,"i think so. they're kinda like statuary in a museum ... nice to look at, but a pain in the ass to do anything useful with. "
6,My trainer got mad when he saw I followed foodporn on instagram. 
7,Told me to choke on his dick on Grindr 
8,"I was expecting a violently sexual story, but I am very pleased with this wholesome twist."
9,"Not gonna lie, if I were him in that situation that would turn me on immensely. Also what kinda snake does he have?"
10,"&gt;I don't get why he felt the need to say that

&gt;the super masc frat type

Who often see bottoming as a less-than-masculine act."
11,Some gay guys decided to be dumb-passive-aggressive towards me because I recommended using condom instead of relying on PreP.
12,"Damn dude, I feel like there's gotta be a story here"
13,"My ex-boyfriend got upset at me for things like that and for following attractive people on insta. He would also be upset if I talked too much to other guys, and wouldn‚Äôt let me be with gay people at all

And then eventually he cheated on me several times.

Funny how things work out. Keep your eye out for other red flags

"
14,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm being fucking spitroasted‚Äù

Your dads going to need therapy. "
15,.....How are your parents entering someone else's home? Do people not lock their doors. Did this even happen?
16,Hopefully a big one lol ;)
17,"No high school sweethearts , no memorable prom experiences, no awkward dates that teach me about relationships until I turned 20, smaller dating pool. It sucks but you work with it. It is what it is."
18,"No such thing as too much precum. Then again I‚Äôm like a suckling calf when there is precum about, so I‚Äôm biased."
19,Did you just explain why you're banned from your local museum?
20,"I like him because 90% of guys are straight, which means that without knowing if a guy is gay or straight, I'll like 9 straight guys for every gay guy.

More importantly: can we stop asking this weekly question?"
21,If I had a dollar for every time a gay tried to justify not using condoms by using prep..... 
22,"No I watched Teen Wolf for the brilliant plotlines, not Dylan O'Brien."
23,"I just fap myself to oblivion, my hand job usually feels better anyway"
24,lmao i wouldve walked in and stuffed them into ur mouth then fucked u silly but thats just me
25,"yeah they're fun to look at and touch but sucking fucking sucks, fucking fucking sucks, even giving a handjob fucking sucks. jaw starts hurting after 2 minutes, butt hurts the entire time, wrist and fingers start cramping up goddamn

not

for

me"
26,I don't even understand why he felt the need to tell people we hooked up
27,Hot guys are hot
28,"Well look at the bright side, you'll never get the ""Are you sure that you're gay?"" question. "
29,He looked at me 
30,"Holy crap, I felt that as I was reading. That‚Äôs fucking brutal bro.

Does your school offer counseling to students? It‚Äôd do you really good to talk to someone about this mentally speaking. Try to call your parents maybe once every couple of days. Sooner or later, you‚Äôll have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù with them. Essentially, both of your worlds got completely flipped upside down. You can always try to rebuild it the same or even better. If all fails, and housing and finances are cut, know that there are always national and local resources of some nature to give you direction.

Good luck bro"
31,I'm jist waiting for all of those diseases to dissapear so I can be the prettiest cumslut.
32,"A kind smile and intense eye contact. Like, trying-to-figure-out-what-my-eye-color-is kind of intense. It made me feel vulnerable and yet I didn't mind it at all."
33,"as someone that works in corporate I can give you the following advice:

1) Do NOT give the intern any reprecussions - simply stop working with him, its not worth causing issues with your boss. do this quietly and act unbothered.

2) talk to your associates and thank them for keeping their composure and not joining in on making fun of you etc. that will let them know you appreciate them and will help in the future if this happens when you aren't there.

3) let your boyfriend know to use a different paralegal. 
"
34,"How interested would you be in talking to a guy on the street with a bag over his head?  Most people would avoid that person at all costs.

Not having a face picture online is the equivalent.  You're not being ridiculous.


"
35,Thats why I love smaller ones :) people tell me that Im lying üôÑ
36,"No we can't.  If you haven't noticed, the gay community loves to contradict itself every way it can.

Gay men cannot chose to be gay, it is inherit to they are.

Straight men can totally chose to be gay or straight, sexuality is fluid!  


It is disrespectful for straight men to try and ""turn"" lesbians straight.

If a gay guy tries to turn a straight man gay, he is just flaunting his sexual prowess!  PROGRESS!

Basically, shitty people fall under all ends of every spectrum."
37,"Some homeless guy was harassing me and wouldn't leave me alone. Then this guy walked up to him and said, ""Hey, he said beat it, now get lost."" My jaw dropped as no one has ever stood up for me like that before. It was an instant turn on."
38,"No because I didn't really have any close friends, but it was soul crushing when the guy I crushed the most in high school openly admitted to me that he did that with other guys as if it was common."
39,"He took me to an inexpensive-but-tasty Japanese diner. when I offhandedly mentioned I‚Äôd have to ask about allergens (I can‚Äôt have any nuts, yes many a person has made a joke about how I‚Äôm gay and can‚Äôt eat nuts), he immediately asked the waitress on my behalf. Just about proposed right there. He also put a lot of effort into helping me, a complete know-nothing in Japanese food, pick a soup that I‚Äôd like, and it was delicious. 

He later told me he wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship. Oh well. "
40,Omg I would‚Äôve married him 
41,But if we do that then we‚Äôll have to deal with the toxicity in ourselves?!?!?
42,That's not cheating. That's being insecure.
43,"Fuck them. PrEP protects against HIV and that's it! There are still a dozen other sexually transmitted diseases that you can contract from not wearing a condom.

Props to you for putting your well-being above an orgasm."
44,Fuckin' goals right here.
45,"When he acknowledges my existence. 

So hot."
46,"Yeah, I noticed this too. I think if it was only OP and his mother, things probably would‚Äôve ended on a better note. 

I hope you feel better, OP. From the look of it, you have an amazing support system in your partner and friends. Hope they, or at least your mom, can come around eventually! :)

"
47,"Clearly you want a relationship more than just sex. Ask your friends to set you up with someone they may know? Try dating using Grindr? Or just simply don't go for hookups if you don't want to. 

I'm guessing the main reason you may be hooking up against your will is ""because everyone is doing it""/""i'm young so I have to do it"" / ""I gotta have some shizz going on"". But honestly, you don't need to. If you don't have sex for ten years because you didn't want to, it doesn't make you any more or less desirable.

Desire will keep coming. And sometimes, just going and hooking up is not such a depraved idea. I mean, cut it some slack too. But if you really don't enjoy getting physical without any connection, then it's like doing a shitty job you don't like. So don't."
48,"One guy took me to a walk in the zoo and offered to buy me a plushie. I didn't like any of the plushies there, but I thought the idea was cute. He bought me macarons, though, which I always like.

There was also one who went to the cinema with me, and when he was paying for our tickets he had to call his credit card company for something. He said something like ""Come on, I'm here with a cute guy and I don't want to make him wait"" and it made me (Íàç ·¥ó Íàç‚úø)"
49,Don't feel too bad. Most closets don't have locks on them.
50,Dentist get high on their own drugs
51,ego. ego. ego. 
52,"That‚Äôs... truly awful, bro. Truly, truly awful.  Please know that those friends that were with you that day, who stood beside you and even physically defended you, represent so much love in your life. That bar owner and waiter who called the police represent how much acceptance society has for us now, and how even bystanders will help people in need."
53,Yeah you should for sure watch Altered Carbon on Netflix 
54,tbh the sex was awful and I'm not desperate enough to ever touch him again.
55,"Turned 65 last spring, so I think I qualify.  Been married 29 years this September.  Came out in 1972."
56,"\*parents walk in on OP getting spit roasted\*

\*dad makes blowjob face with expression of shock and disgust while mom faints and falls on the floor\*

\*record scratch and freeze frame on OP looking back at parents\*

""Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I wound up in this situation..."""
57,awww
58,Best advice a fellow gaybro ever gave me: if you want to hookup with somebody jack off and see if you still want to go. Usually you don't and then you've saved yourself all the time and trouble and not risked getting an STD. 
59,r/humblebrag
60,I didn‚Äôt suck my thumb but I suck dick.
61,No. If he is bi/gay you confronting him into a corner won't do anything but make him feel more uncomfortable about it. Clearly if he's struggling with it he doesn't need his friends adding to that. Just be cool about it. 
62,"I will never understand why people complain about shit like this. Let someone be the most flamboyant, stereotypical, rainbow queen on earth, who cares. Why do they get to draw the line where you are not allowed to be gayer than this point? Its far worse dealing with assholes than it is someone who is comfortable with who they are and wants to share it."
63,Three times?!? You slut!
64,"To answer your question and others in one go:

This is a college town with a lot of those one story houses with basements near campus. We're not the only ones who leave the house unlocked. It didn't even phase us since it's summer and friends come and go. "
65,no clue why he felt the need to even disclose we hooked up
66,"Yes, Subtle discrimination where people aren't outright homophobic is a thing I've dealt with a lot. I feel like many straight people don't see me on the same level when compared to their straight friends. When I get into a new job or new group of people, I always keep my sexuality hidden at first to see signs of how people might treat me once they find out I'm gay. Or I keep it to myself if necessary. If I find out someone is anti-gay even after talking with them awhile, I would put some distance between me and them personally. I don't feel they will ever respect me the same way they respect straight people, even if they say otherwise. That's just me though, do what feels right for you and your friendships/relationships :]"
67,This hits too close to home. I'm so sorry man. Good luck!
68,That's called projecting. Hope your in a better place now.
69,"He's a chest-thumper.  

Probably the kinda guy who, when he was fully straight, would also brag to his bros about ALL the girls he hooked up with and how they were all continually craving the D afterwards.  "
70,"Sounds like a toxic relationship between his parents to. The second she brought up his partner and the dad got all mad, she wanted to be quiet real quick and not bring it up anymore. Dad seems to be the root of most of the problems here"
71,"I guess because if they're mentioning working out at the gym/watching their health/exercising, pizza is seen as a pretty unhealthy option, an ""Oooh, I'm so bad"" little cheat food for them or something.

I don't think I've ever seen that in profiles, though - dunno where YOU'RE looking. I tend to see ""I like living, loving, laughing, and hanging out with friends."" I wound up eventually getting so sick of that generic shit that I put in my old OKC profile that I despise friends, laughter, love, and life, and would prefer to spend my days in stoic isolation in a cryogenic chamber far away from civilization."
72,"im not too sure why ""straight"" is in the title sentence ... smh"
73,Gave me attention 
74,more like... NOT fuck them because... get it? lmao
75,"Yeah but that's because you had an established routine where your dad consistently spent time near and in your apartment. 

OP's parents had to drive multiple days to get to his apartment and they probably did not have a precedent of entering the house like your dad did. "
76,[deleted]
77,"I always took it as saying ""I'm easy going and low maintenace"" like they're just happy hanging out and eating pizza instead of some fancy date. "
78,need me a You
79,It definitely depends on the person.  My boyfriend is about 8.5 but I certainly dont have trouble with it.  I super enjoy it actually
80,"He sees bottoming as shameful, probably. He also wouldn't admit to viewing it that way. You did nothing wrong‚Äî has everything to do with him! Move on and go be a domtop elsewhere, stud."
81,"This tall, handsome German guy who helped tiny, lil me with my luggage. He voluntarily offered to carry this huge luggage of mine while I was attempting to change my train. I was sure he was Gay /Bisexual but the train was scheduled to depart before we could exchange phone numbers. I couldn't even give him a thank you hug and had to climb into my train :("
82,I'm so sorry. Don't contact your father ever again. He's a piece of shit and does not deserve you. Move on with your life and be happy.
83,"Yay! Congrats! See!? Wasn't so bad :). Most people at gyms are actually rather friendly as you noticed by upping the game and asking for help with machines! 

Shower boners... they can happen. Other people get them too :p. Most likely, if you just mind your own business - or if the showers have curtains as my gym does - it is a really infrequent occurrence (it has never happened to me the few times I have used a gym shower, but I have most definitely seen other guys having them - no big deal, just don't stare at it - hard (pun intended) as that may be :-D). "
84,I'd have done exactly the same as you.
85,Too pure. I'm crying. üò¢
86,"Although I agree. I would definitely document this, maybe not report it, but definitely documented so if you are asked about him in the future you can point to this.

This is not acceptable behavior in any workplace. The language alone is unprofessional."
87,"As a guy who has never participated in social media, I find others who do not very refreshing. My bf is all over social media, and it kinda weirds me out. We had to have a difficult conversation about it because he was posting pictures and information about me that I did not want out there. We came to an agreement about it, and everything has been okay since."
88,Probably. I‚Äôm a shy introvert before and after coming out.
89,"Sorry, I don't get this fetishization of straight guys. I have straight buddies and I don't give a damn about them being straight any more than they care about me being queer. 

But they're no more adorable than gay guys. Plus I can score with a gay guy if we find each other attractive. Not gonna happen with a straight guy and life's too short to waste time obsessing over straight dudes. 

Plus I like masculine guys and most of the bears I know are way more masculine than a lot of the metrosexual straight guys in my circle."
90,"I agree. I might find it a little weird if I found a hookup or a guy I've met just a few times sniffing my underwear. But if it was someone I'd been seeing for six weeks who has a key to my house, I would think it was pretty cute. "
91,Next time he wants to get plowed just make him beg for it. I could see this dynamic being kinda hot tbh.
92,I bet your parents never do that again... lol
93,"Did it once watching ugly lesbian porn that was half blocked (like when you‚Äôre hacking the pay per view channel or whatever) at a friends house. 

Also at camp I would wake up a bit earlier to shower first and there was this kid who had the same habit. We ended up stroking together in the stall for like two weeks."
94,Most bottoms don't have porn standard asses either.
95,r/gayculture
96,It‚Äôs an amazing feeling especially when they‚Äôre bigger than you which is typically the case for me at least. Makes you feel safe and secure all while being able to let your guard down. Also knowing they can crush you at any point they want but choose not to is HAAAWWT
97,"months after our last hookup, he texted me out of the blue saying that he had a ticket for ComicCon and wouldn't be able to go, and offered it to me free of charge because he figured I'd be into it."
98,"I'm a literal for pay hooker/whore/escort/prostitute whatever you want to call it; I prefer escort or rentboy,  and I feel like I'm safer than the majority of gay guys in my area who are on PreP.

No bareback ever, I don't smoke meth ever, I don't get drunk and have sex ever, I don't let people nut in my mouth  ever and a variety of other shit.

PreP is awesome and very useful, but condoms are the ultimate protection. The idea of bareback is sort of gross to me, I like condoms because if there's an accident you don't get shit on your dick never mind the not getting STD's.  


I can honestly say I've never had an STD, I realize I probably have HPV with no symptoms, but every check up I've had nothing, and have never caught anything. It will eventually happen I'm sure, but I mean come on, I'm a fucking prostitute and I practice safer sex than a good chunk of guys... blows my mind.

100,I‚Äôm 27... practically an elder in gay years.
101,"So an out of town guy from grindr wanted me to come to his hotel. He asked if he could send me an lyft and i was like dude im a gainfully employed adult its cool...he persisted so i said sure....he sent a huge black escalade. I had taken a bottle of wibe with me because i didn't know if there would be anything and i was in the mood for a little something. It was great...him the sex all of it...he insisted on picking up the lyft again. A couple days later a case of the wine i had brought with me, which wasnt cheap, had been delivered to my building under just my name and a picture of my face. The concierge at my building called me to ask if it was ok to leave it in my foyer and i said i wasn't expecting a delivery he said ""its says its for jack and there's a picture of your face."" I think he might think im an escort now.  "
102,"I get so nervous, I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt get hard "
103,Where do y‚Äôall on this sub find these bi- curious straight boys?
104,"""No honey, you cant have any of these cookies.  Theyre the ones Im taking to the guy Im cheating on you with."" "
105,"I'm 54, but I'm still fairly young. I was a virgin at 27 but have had sex 7 times in the last week, with four different guys (three in their 20s). Number five is tonight, fingers crossed.  "
106,"Welcome to sex. Most people, like 99.9% of us, have lackluster, bad, and/or downright embarrassing first times.

It gets better as you move along and don't pressure yourself to start off as some ULTRA-FUCK SEX GOD. You learn along the way."
107,[deleted]
108,Funny story. So I started talking to this guy on Grindr a few years back cool guy fun to talk to then he disappeared a couple days later. Fast forward to a year and a half ago scrolling through my pictures while chilling with my new boyfriend and find a screenshot of that guys profile (don‚Äôt ask me why I don‚Äôt even remember taking it) Turns out my boyfriend was that guy and neither of us realized it. 
109,Due to the lack of attention they get in real life.
110,"If OP‚Äôs dad is throwing glasses at his son, you can bet he‚Äôs being violent with his wife too. 

Abuse isn‚Äôt easy to escape. "
111,Whenever they kill off the only hot guy on a show I like I start contemplating whether it's worth watching anymore
112,"Use ""when you did -------, it made me feel ------, because ------"" statements, rather than ""you always -----"". And lemme tell you from experience,  it is kind and ethical and more than ok to withold certain truths that would only hurt him to hear, especially if theyre about something impossible for him to change. Dont rise to any bait, this isn't an argument you have to win, you've already decided.  Try to be kinder than you think you need to be.  Best of luck."
113,Leave
114,5-7 friends is way more than me üòÇ your doing fine dude
115,"Maybe, just maybe, ALL men are actually SUPPOSED to be this way.

Maybe sexuality between males was actually intended in the design, regardless of orientation.

Maybe, just maybe, males being sexual and intimate with each other actually enhances and enriches their relationships with females.

Dangerous stuff, eh."
116,Y O U  A R E  M A R R I E D. AS A BI GUY STOP. Unless your partner is okay with it. Then suck away

120,Like 7 out of 10 guys love to play with my precum cause I too ‚Äúleak a lot‚Äù as someone once put it. And I‚Äôm laying back staring down at them playing with it like aight that‚Äôs wassup. Haha embrace it man.

125,".... r/thathappened ....?

I'm sorry bro, that sounds absolutely mortifying. If I were in your shoes I would want all the space and time away from my parents as possible. You should give us an update if anything happens."
126,"I have not. I'd give you shit too but don't actually have a problem with it. Now if my underwear kept coming up missing, then I'd have a problem."
127,"It depends. It's typically very insecure and insane. But if you've just liked the 1609th picture of your ex that you broke up with two months ago and you frequently disappear for two hours and he lives twenty minutes away and you come back freshly showered from the ""gym"" yet you don't have a membership... then I'd say it's pretty reasonable. 

Hard to gauge without context. "
128,Ok then haha just need to remember to bring extra sets of underwear next time :P

Grab dinner with him, see if he might want to go out instead, and if he doesn't, you stay in and watch that goddamn movie.  

This is also with regards to hookups.  Don't ghost and immediately upgrade.  "
131,"Right now I'm taking care of 2 cats and 3 kittens for a friend of mine. The guy I met on grindr came over, walked into my 2nd bedroom that i never even use, and a huge pile of cat shit in the corner of the closet behind a small dresser that i had no idea even existed. He proceeded to put on gloves and deep clean that fucking closet. 

After he was done he was like ""so does this make you like me more or less?""

More, definitely more"
132,"* Quite a bit actually. I use to dry jerk with 3 different friends before I could cum.
* The first time I ever came was with someone else jerking me. Nothing more happened besides jerking off. I still remember the moment very vividly. lol. Once I discovered the joy of cuming, there was no going back. 
* Once we discovered we could cum, we would find every opportunity we could after school. Luckily one of my friend use to have the house to himself until late evening. We tried so many different things like oils, vaseline, and condoms. "
133,"You commented on a post that merely mentioned PreP, wasn't preaching bareback due to it. All you said was:

&gt; use condom

Then when you got hit with downvotes you fire again:

&gt;ok who the fuck downvoted my simple comment? u just use condom.

&gt;PreP won't prevent other STDs, only HIV. You can still catch gonorrhea using PreP **you stupid cum hungry faggots**.

Now you're here whining and complaining and claiming to be some bringer of knowledge, ignorance destroyer. Keep up the good work dude. Clearly namecalling and casual homophobia will crush this public health menace."

135,"He already had gay face, but yeah, it somehow got even gayer."
136,"Senior year of high school, my friend was really desperate to get his dick sucked, and I was desperate too. And he broke up with his toxic ass girlfriend, who was also my neighbor. And he was fucking horny, and I was too, so I sucked his dick. And then a month later, before marching band practice he came over (pun intended) and we did it again. And then I kept being his personal living  fleshlight until he found a girlfriend.
To this day, he still thinks I was the best, mainly because I was the only one who was willing to deepthroat his 8 inch cock, and swallow. "
137,"Lack of foreplay.  It's a lot easier for me to open up (as a bottom) if I feel safe and desired.  So cuddle me, explore my body with your hands, pull me close, tease my hole for a while.  Make out with me a bit.  Say something nice to me.  Get me to the point where I'm just going to fucking **die** if you don't shove your cock in me right now.  

That works a lot better than ""Hi, are you a top or a bottom, oh bottom, great"" **INSERT**"
138,"He made a pretty high level Harry Potter reference to me that only a true fan of the books would know. This same guy also literally caught me out of the air after a bad jump on the ice, when I was supposed to be one of the workshop instructora.

141,"If it makes you feel any better my mom found out I was gay when I was 17 because I filmed my first time with a guy and she was ""cleaning"" and found the tape and watched it. 

She came to school at lunch and took me home to confront me and there was lots of crying and yelling. It was horrible. 

But, she went through the stages many parents go through when they find out their kids are gay pretty fast turned out to be very understanding and even joined PFLAG. 

I hope things turn out as well for you. "

144,"I had a boyfriend during my last two years of high school, and we would sometimes just rub one out together on those occasions when there was no ""appropriate"" place or time for anything more than that, and we both felt a powerful need to let some out. (Make no mistake, we had a lot else in mind for more suitable circumstances.) There could be something kind of fun about that now and then, but it's hard to explain why.

I've never done that with a platonic friend though. One really good buddy of mine (who's gay) has *jokingly* suggested it a couple times, but due to the nature of our relationship we aren't really going to go there."

164,"I once read a comment on Reddit about grief and loss that I saved. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know who the original author is, but it was so powerful to me that I saved it in my Evernote archives:

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks"

I was 29, never had sex, never thought it was going to happend. I was also depressed, resigned, not making any effort, and really it was my fault for not making it happend.

I started putting myself out there. At first posting pics online (because fuck it I'm horny and who knows maybe some weirdo will like it). I realised some cute people actually liked my body. Some people like my dick. Some people think I'm actually kinda cool.

When I actually changed my attitude and start thinking you know what? They might be right maybe I need to stop being a little bitch and be sorry for myself and actually get out there and get a piece of ass cause I'm not that bad.

I went out there, got a piece of ass, got married. I look back and I can't understand why I got so stuck up thinking I was worthless that I missed so many years. I don't regret though, it led me to my husband so I wouldn't change it. Still. It you ask me why I was virgin so late it was my own damn fault.

Sure there are a lot of straight guys, people not in your age range etc. But trust me no matter how annoying or ugly you are, with 6 billions people on earth, someone wants to suck your dick or someone wants to fuck your ass, and within that range someone also want a relationship with you.

But when you're too busy thinking complaining, looking at yourself to even look around, for sure, nothing is going to happend."

Edit: considering mine is not a difficult language and even some of his friends speak it fairly well. "
204,"In my experience, yes. Not just racist but also homophobic and transphobic. 

My housemate was from Cairns (North Queensland) and he would constantly tell me that people back home would use the words Abbo, Wog and Leb (aborigine, Italian expat and Lebanese expat respectively) to describe people and that he had to escape what he called a small town (something like 150,000 people live there). 

I went on a couple of dates with an Australian _diplomat_ who told me that he voted no in the equal marriage postal vote, simply because _the wrong person was heading the campaign_ and he would repeatedly vote against equal marriage; as a cis gay man. He also told me that he doesn‚Äôt view trans people as people because they don‚Äôt identify as the gender their born into, and don‚Äôt get me started on his views on Asians and ‚Äúhow I‚Äôm not a rice queen personally‚Äù. 

Lastly, I had a short run with an Australian guy who turned out to be a complete stalker but besides the In Her Skin storyline, he was a massive racist. Again, he had a great job and was what you would describe as a rich white guy. We were out for dinner one time at a nice sushi place in Chelsea and he scorned when a black family walked in, exclaiming ‚Äúare they really going to let that riff raff dine and ruin the experience for the rest of us‚Äù. _The mother had a Birkin bag._ He also tried to convince me that he‚Äôs been a victim of ‚Äòreverse racism‚Äô and when I tried explaining that it doesn‚Äôt really exist, he said I was wrong and a sheep to the system. He then went on to tell me that he wouldn‚Äôt hire a black employee out of choice because the whole quota system was stupid (God forbid you hire a POC because they‚Äôre highly skilled) and that they should not be let into Oxbridge just because they‚Äôre black. ‚ÄúThey get it too easy, sometimes I wish I was black or Asian or a Paki just so I get all the free handouts‚Äù. 

So yeah, in summary from my experience, Australia is a pretty racist place.

205,"Let's call them A, B, and C. A, B got married to women. But we had full on gay sex for over 5 years. So I am sure they are bi at least. C didn't come out but hasn't married a girl either. I feel for him. A and C had sex with other guys too when we were teens. B has only had gay sex with me. B and I continue to be good friends.

Here is a fun story. I crashed at B's place for a night a month before his wedding. I happened to be in his town. I expected to sleep on his couch because all of this was over a decade and we never talked about it explicitly. He insisted that I share his bed as the couch wasn't that comfortable. I was ok with the couch. Anyways, he insisted and I shared his bed without expecting anything. Once he passed out, he rolled over and flung one of his legs over me. I sleep on my stomach+side. I felt his rock hard cock all night long. I decided not to do anything as our friendship mattered more to me. This was over two years ago, and I still wonder about that moment sometimes. "
206,"Definitely.  In my teens I felt completely ALONE and kinda isolated myself in my own world.  I guess it's just how I coped.  But meanwhile... life was going on for everyone else... dating, sex, some eventually got married.

272,"How is a literally average-sized dick not a ""real cock""? "
273,"&gt;I've been my dad's ""man"" for my whole life and he just saw me taking dick.

Taking dick doesn't make you any less of a man. Sure, maybe your dad believes that, but it isn't true. You haven't changed. You are just as much of a man as you ever were. If your dad feels differently, then it's his decision to hold onto that homophobic (and sexist) belief. It's his decision not to re-evaluate his ideas of what a man are. (Hopefully, he will re-evaluate them, but if he doesn't, that's on him.)

&gt;I just went from responsible son to gay in a split second and I'm just so broken.

Having sex (even gay sex, even a threesome) doesn't mean you aren't responsible. Being gay doesn't mean you aren't responsible. Again: you haven't changed. You haven't become any less responsible. If they think you have, it's their choice to see you that way.

Also, speaking of ""responsible,"" I'd say their actions were pretty irresponsible. Sure, they didn't know you were gay, but even if you were straight, there's plenty of equally (or more) embarrassing stuff they could have walked in on. They should have been aware of that. 

It's not like you knew they were coming early, and chose to risk them walking in on you anyway. Yes, that would be irresponsible and rude. But that isn't what happened.

&gt;I feel like I let them down.

You didn't. Even if they feel like you let them down, you didn't. Once again, it's their choice to feel let down. This isn't something that they'd have good reason to be let down by. You didn't fail your classes because you were too busy partying. You didn't steal your parents' money in order to support a drug habit. You didn't go around having unprotected sex with women and getting them pregnant.

If they think you being gay (or having gay sex, or having a threesome) is something to be disappointed about the way those things are, they have a really warped view of the world. Which doesn't have anything to do with you."
274,"&gt; that type of ""nurture"" may cause repression of his sexuality and actually make him gay

Ok, well that's stupid, no offense, but if that's what made someone gay there would be WAY more gay people in the world.... 

Does he know you are gay? Do your sister and parents? 

If he does, I'd just ask him if he thinks I am ""bad"" and in a childlike way get him to explain that. Am I bad? ""YES!"" Why? ""Because gay!"" Have ever been mean to you? Have I ever done bad things other people? Do you think I am nice? So maybe gay ""isn't bad."" Kids his age can get that. 

I'd tell your mom and sister to fuck off - well, depending on how old  and independent you are. "

Fuck man, I‚Äôm so bummed you have to put up with this. If this world were a bit more decent that kid would be out on his ass. 

"
280,"I dont have kids, but what's the tea, sis?"
281,"Now there's a fun question to ask this sub. Finally something not negative or miserable sounding.

The ""is my straight friend into me?"" and ""how do i bottom?"" questions get old real quick if you browse this sub for more than a day or two.

You got a nice dick buddy. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/wKONq8Z) a dick pic for ya

282,"Oh you know, just big enough to fill up a terrarium "
283,"I think this is just something you‚Äôll have to communicate with your boyfriend. My partner and I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs natural for you to find other guys attractive. In my opinion, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with liking someone‚Äôs photos, etc.  It just depends on how secure and comfortable your partner is in the relationship.  You can‚Äôt just go through life and pretend to not find other people physically attractive. That‚Äôs natural. As I tell my partner, you can look all day but please don‚Äôt touch. üôÇ You just got to communicate those feelings with him. Also, depending on how long you‚Äôve been in the relationship, maybe take it easy on Instagram for a while until he feels more secure in the relationship. He may just be bringing some Insecurities from a past relationship into the mix too. Communication is always key. "
284,"Rude guy.
He was super nice to me and funny, good conversation and all but total lack of respect toward the waitress. 
The way someone treats strangers says a lot about a person. Second date didn't happen."
285,Love getting a scarf at the end of my blowjob. Really rewards my efforts. 
286,No fault on your side mate. Perhaps you caught him at a bad time cause his response was that of an asshole. Plenty more fish in the sea üëç
287,"This needs to be stated every time this question is asked.  It doesn't help, it pushes people further into the closet.  What might help however, is positive words about LGBT that don't relate directly to him."
288,low self-esteem meets guy.
289,"1"" thick?"
290,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH.

Oh my god you got me bitch. "
291,"""try to bring a point without attacking people""

Really?!

Denial is powerful friends"
292,"That‚Äôs ridiculous. 
You‚Äôre missing one of your testicles, big deal. You‚Äôre not handicapped. I assume that your penis is as functioning as it should be. 

You can tell it to him in a funny way, brush it off with a laugh and be confident about it. 
Don‚Äôt go all serious and dramatic like ‚Äúsit down. We need to talk.‚Äù 

In short, I think you‚Äôre overthinking the matter. 

Good luck!"

294,"Don't date/hookup with coworkers.

Don't ask for, or at least don't follow, straight people for advice on dating gay guys.

Don't talk much about my social life at work. "

296,Keep them on the steering wheel.

298,"I'm larger than that, and have spent over forty years in three very long term relationships.  All three of my partners are short and very petite men.  In all three instances we dated and courted and took our time getting to the sex at all.  Then once we got in bed, they were nervous, and we took our time getting to the penetrating.  But once we went there, they positively couldn't get enough.  No bad side effects, or anything.  Perhaps being head over heels in love alters what your body can accommodate?"
299,"Porn and the toxic club and party scene made me feel unattractive for a bit. The standards they set are ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not tall and waxed with a 6 back don‚Äôt bother‚Äù. I‚Äôm relatively short (5/7-5/8‚Äô), and have a hairy sort of athletic bear body going since I have a slight belly. 

I just learned not to care what other people think. "
300,I‚Äôm interested in the replies here too because I also have zero social media presence. Facebook Instagram twitter. Seems to weird some guys out because they believe you‚Äôre hiding something but I‚Äôm like you where it didn‚Äôt make me feel great to be on any social media. 
301,You mean to tell me you don't find a str8 acting masc college boy having a threesome (and bottoming!!!) with his bf and some random in his back yard in the middle of the day believeable?!?!
302,Looks like you found yourself a sugar daddy lol 
303,"Yup, when I‚Äôm horny I‚Äôm just thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna just go for it and eat up everything I jizz idgaf‚Äù then I finish and get immediately grossed out at the thought lmao"
304,"LOL I'm sure they'll find a way to throw in a few ""Do you look at girls sometimes too?"", have no fear. "
305,This should be the only comment in here. WTF. Your dick is the perfect size for anal sex. Anything bigger is just painful
306,Just go talk to a doctor. Hemorrhoids are extremely common and normal and you don't even have to say you got it from sex. Doctors deal with far worse and far weirder on a daily basis.
307,"You lost me at
&gt; Both groups are adamant that they won't go to any gay bars with me

Withdraw your wingman services and explain why."
308,The studio kept her jacked up on amphetamines all thru shooting Wizard of Oz to keep her energetic and skinny from not eating. Bitch was high as fuck thru that whole movie.
