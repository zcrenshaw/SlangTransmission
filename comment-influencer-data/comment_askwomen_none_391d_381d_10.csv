"He asked for my notes in school once and I decided to spray my glitter perfume on them. I rushed the process and the perfume didn‚Äôt dry correctly, leaving the pages crinkled. Anyways, I hand it over to him and the next day I see him in the hallway he says ‚Äúthanks for your notes but why did you freshly perfume them?‚Äù. I cringe just writing this.

EDIT: Whoa, the responses here are amazing. Now I feel less cringey, and more awesome over my silly teenager brain! Thank you guys! üíñ"
"A little generosity of spirit in trivial situations goes a long way.  There‚Äôs no need to be caustic about an annoying interaction, a cancelled plan, or a lukewarm coffee. "
"I had been wanting to break up with him for a while, but the moment I realized I *absolutely had to break up with him* was when I was gonna go home for lunch, but when I saw his car in the driveway, I got annoyed and really disappointed. Then I kept driving and I ate at a restaurant I don't even like eating at (it was the only one nearby)... and it was much more enjoyable than if I had gone home."
The words ‚Äúboys like confidence‚Äù that I had probably read from cosmopolitan‚Äôs snap story were repeating over and over and over again in my head so I seized the moment and tried to make out with him unaware that he hadn‚Äôt finished his mouthful of chips and he started choking and coughed out the words ‚ÄúI was freaking still chewing‚Äù and honestly I haven‚Äôt thought about it in so long I‚Äôm sweating rn 
"I've...come to understand how complicated and troubled she is.

My mom is beautiful.  She's smart.  She's warm.  She's funny.  She has an incredible heart.  She's the sort of person who people genuinely love to be around.  At her best, she is infinitely better than I will ever be.

She also currently lives in a 900 sq. ft. shack that smells like piss and rotten food because she can't clean up after herself and/or pay her mortgage.  She's on her third marriage/sixth engagement.  She just bought a new Range Rover. She doesn't have a job.  She doesn't have retirement savings.  She doesn't have groceries.

As I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate both how charmed *and* how devastatingly dysfunctional my childhood was because of her. Because with her, it is all two sides of the same coin:  You *will* get a lovely vacation to France, and you *will* come home to a house with no electricity that's being foreclosed on. And at no point will it dawn on her that perhaps she should have made a different decision."
Staring at your phone for hours in bed til you fall asleep. 
"I was trying to open a bottle for like 10 minutes. My hand hurt like hell and the cap just wouldn‚Äôt budge so I started crying from anger.

Five minutes later I realized I‚Äôd been turning it in the wrong direction.

Yay period hormones."
Just because you live your life to impress sexual partners doesn't mean I do. 
I feel personally attacked right now.
It's garden variety survivorship bias. More variables than elbow grease went into me entering the middle class. People don't want to acknowledge that. They want a bootstrap story. 
"Second time hanging out after what was supposed to be a one night stand: I got drunk and said ‚Äúif we have babies they‚Äôll have green eyes‚Äù

Five years later were married with a green eyed baby! But I still cringe when I think of that day "
"I let them go ahead and waste their time.  If I'm the expert they actually need they'll get directed back to me eventually.  Let them spend hours talking to people who don't have the information/expertise they need.  No skin off my back, I get way more of my own research done if I don't have to provide technical assistance to others.  "

"The thought of seeing him was tiring, not exciting."
"He said, ""I'd rather live off your parents forever than work in a grocery store."" Shortly after we had begun receiving financial help from my folks to help us with a tough transition. He was unemployed at the time.

A lot of shit happened that following year that made me realize I had married a man with a stubborn and childlike view of where money comes from. It also became clear he viewed my parents' significant retirement savings as his own inheritance eventually. Now we are divorcing and he is making every argument under the sun why I should give him money he is not owed.

He is not a bad person and I stand by that statement, but jesus... I cannot wait for this to end."
"My crush grabbed my arm asking me to stay. I made yeti noises in response.

He ended up letting go."
I wish I didn't have to teach him that he's a beautiful human being worthy of all my affection. Because he is and he's still learning to believe it.

"I couldn't get over someone I met back in 2005 and the first months were awful for me.  I felt like I was seeing him everywhere and every song I heard somehow reminded me of him.  After a year, I still missed him but it felt less painful.  The feeling just became a part of me.  Kind of like damaging your hair after bleaching and waiting until healthy hair grows it out.  After awhile, as time passes, you can finally cut off the damaged bleached ends.  "
"A friend of mine asked ""If you didn't share bills or a home with him, if you lived in a different city, would you go out of your way to visit him?""

First reaction was to start laughing. "
My SO uses his fingers or mouth and ensures I orgasm first before we have penetrative sex.
This one is my favorite. Intentionally misunderstanding the analogy while challenging the manhood. I dig it.
"I assume it's about sex and status, not a relationship.  "
"Small steps. Force yourself to do something small each day until it becomes a habit, then build onto it. My first step was when I knew something quick had to be done that takes less than 30 seconds, I do it immediately. Junk mail? Toss it as soon as I see it instead of letting it sit on the counter. Put the dirty glass in the dishwasher instead of in the sink. Etc. "
"It got worse. When I was young I thought that she and I were allies who dealt with my emotionally abusive dad together, but in my late 20s I realized she was the adult in the situation and could have (and should have!) removed me from it. "
"While I was super stressed out and struggling to change my duvet sheets. My cats would NOT stop jumping on them, so eventually I just gave up and cried. Luckily they noticed my distress and cuddled me. "
"Several years ago, I attempted to go off all medications I'm currently on for anxiety, managing my PCOs, etc. I wanted to prove to myself, and to the people around me, that I was willing to work my damnedest to deal with my issues drug-free.

Of course, this was a total failure. 8 months of pure mental and physical hell. 

My husband was supportive, but as time went on, he was wearing down. Everything made me cry, everything was to intense, and I lost what little tact I have.

It came to a head when I said something very hurtful without realizing how cruel it sounded. He actually shot up from his chair and stormed out of the house. He had never done this before. We don't fight, not like that. It was one of the lowest parts in our relationship, and we both look back on it now as a learning lesson.

After he returned (with ice cream, because he thought I would be furious that he left) and I bawled my eyes out (because he'd forgotten his phone and I was terrified that, in his rage, he would crash his truck and be without any means to contact help), we had a long, quiet talk. I went back on my medications. We began making time for one another again. He began opening up more about his own needs, and I began taking care of myself better so that I didn't need *so* much care from him.

That was about 4 years ago. We're great now, but there are always ups and downs, usually caused my life circumstances more than actual relationship issues. My biggest advice is to always turn towards each other, not away from each other. 

Edit: As pointed out by a user, I BAWLED my eyes out, not BALLED my eyes out. I currently have eyes. "
"Used to do this for my ex. She seemed to really enjoy it. Plus it‚Äôs nice because if you‚Äôve had a long day and don‚Äôt really feel like fuckin, you can at least walk away knowing she came and you got to spend time with your girl."
"Not paying attention to your state of mind and attitude.  If you see the world through shit coloured glasses then all you will see is shit.  
Also spending way too much time on cell phones and computers.  "
I don't understand men's motivation for saying this shit to women. Don't they want to have sex with us? Think of all the fun sex we could all be having if bullshit thinking like this didn't exist. 
"Keeping people around who chip away at your mental health. That friend you've had all your life that drains your emotional energy by being needy, the arguments you get into with your sibling, etc

Surround yourself with people who are supportive, challenge you to be better and are there for you in your times of need... But don't keep toxic relationships for the sake of preserving the relationship you once held but haven't for some time."

"I can't see the makeup trends aging well. Heavy contouring, sparkly highlighter, blocky eyebrows, and bright eyeliner and lipstick will be seen as tacky as powder blue eyeshadow, emo eye makeup, over plucked eyebrows and pale lipstick are now."

I have wistful or melancholic moments a lot where anything sets me off. One time I cried at a flower. A *flower*.
I used to think that she was distant because of the hardships of parent/adulthood; now i realize she just doesn‚Äôt like me.
Surprised to see no one saying on top. I‚Äôm a CO orgasimer and I can only make it to the top of the mountain while on top. Doesn‚Äôt happen every time but the natural rubbing of the position mixed with my SO squeezing my bum is the only way to get there

"I vividly remember the moment.

We had moved across the country to live close to friends after the death of my grandmother (we had been living with her taking care of her as she deteriorated).

Our friends ended up splitting up and left the new state so we were all alone with our cats. One day on the ride home from work, after weeks of feeling alone (he was overboard about video games and the only way to interact with him was to play the game with him) I finally broke down in the car and told him I was feeling suicidal and alone and that I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was spiraling. 

His response? ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I will never forget looking at his face as he said that and just going completely dead inside. 

We broke up weeks later (it had been four years and we were JUST getting a marriage license). I moved back home. Dated a bit. And then married my now husband.

I sincerely couldn‚Äôt be any happier. "
[deleted]
We had been in a long distance relationship. He had flown back in state and he was with his friends all day long. Never came to see me even though he could. And I randomly get a text saying he‚Äôs heading back to his state after him being there for 2 days. After that I just broke it off. But at that point I was already so emotionally done with the relationship it didn‚Äôt hurt me at all. It was really just the final nail in that relationships coffin. 
"That medical stuff is important.

"My co-workers take great pleasure in telling people I'm the Director and they need to talk to me. 


I also tell them that I'm the only one who can legally do what they need.  And then I use my teacher voice and they fall in line like the weak little lambs they really are. "
"Unfortuneately the only way I can come from PIV sex is in missionary, so I can grind my clit on the guy whilst they thrust. But that only works if they're the type of guy that ""lies"" on you, rather than the ones that kind of just kneel above/over you and thrust away. I love doggy and cowgirl but even rubbing my clit at the same time doesn't get me off, it's like there's too much to concentrate on feeling and I can't get into it, plus I usually end up with a bit of a numb clit. - I'd rather just enjoy other positions for what they are than try to come. 

I also need it to be slow to be able to get off - I love fast rough sex  but if I want to have an orgasm I need it to be slow for a while so I can really get into it.  "
"I think they are afraid of equal partnership, emotionally immature themselves, or incredibly shallow. Or all three. "
It's gotten more complex. I love her very much and appreciate everything she has done for me -- but learning your parents are people and make mistakes like anyone else is really hard.
"Leo doesn't just date in the same group. He also almost exclusively dates models and even throws parties just to invite models to meet them. Not a brainer this is not healthy. Same goes for the people who exclusively *seek* significantly younger partners. Power dynamics, commitment issues, immaturity... there are different options for the reason but none is healthy."
"Nope.  Not everyone.  Some need help.  Some need a lot more than others.  I‚Äôll just use my friend for example.  Born to two people who never gave a shit about him, he grew up with abandonment issues, living at friends houses, sometimes for years, sometimes less than a week.  Behavioral problems, dyslexia, and ADHD led to an angry, illiterate, depressed, meth addicted young adult.  

He‚Äôs in his thirties now, and clean for years.  He is alone with a young son.  He has good friends who keep him busy working, and my god can that man work.  He is pulling up on his bootstraps as hard as he can.  Trenching, breaking and pouring concrete in temps above 100f.  It is shitty, shitty work, and he does it without complaining.  

So no, without the help of lifelong friends keeping him mostly employed, helping with housing, coordinating with therapists, he would certainly be homeless, and very likely dead."
"Yes. Last summer my long term (8 years) boyfriend and I bought a house in a new town. He made friends with a woman at work and we started hanging out regularly. She had a girlfriend at the time, so initially I didn't get nervous. But, she's dated men in the past. Then this past winter there were a couple of instances where I felt like maybe he was catching feelings for this woman. 

It was a mess of miscommunication. Instead of just talking to him about it I would get mad without ever explaining why. He thought that I was mad because I didn't want him to have friends (a lot of these hang out sessions involved other guys from work, this girl is 'one of the guys'). So he would get mad right back at me thinking that I wanted to control his social life and prevent him from making new friends. 

When we finally talked about it directly he realized how some of the things that he had said could have seemed in the context that I was thinking about them in and he felt really stupid for not being more sensitive. I realized that I should have just addressed my concerns right off the bat instead of stewing about it. 

Things are much better now."

"When i got into the car with my husband, after getting the phone call it was time to go to the hospital to be induced. I just started balling.

"There was this family that always came in to this cafe I used to work at that was seriously just the most beautiful family ever. Wife was a knockout, handsome hubby, and two beautiful baby girls.

He will make some smart-ass remark back, but just keep treating him like the feral middle schooler in his native environment, who you want to study to understand its ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other good follow-up questions:

""Why do you think that is true?""

""If that is the case, what else would we infer from that?""

""You spend a lot of time and effort on shaming me. Why is that?""

&amp;#x200B;

Just really get into the character of wanting to figure him out, like he's an alien from another planet (have you seen The Arrival? Go all Amy Adams on him). You're not really affected by the words he says, because they don't make any sense to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

He will get REALLY uncomfortable after a fairly short exchange, say something he thinks is cutting, and walk away as though he's won.

But he probably won't do it again. "

"I feel like luck is such a big factor that gets ignored! You can work your ass off, but sometimes getting noticed by the right person and getting just the right promotion is actually what pulls you out of poverty. Sometimes being fortunate enough to be healthy is the difference between being okay and being bankrupt. Just because the opportunity exists doesn't mean you'll land it purely by trying hard enough. There is so much that can happen! "
"Does a love letter count?
One that was later passed around for laughs."
"Yes.  Several years back my wife lost several family members at once in a car accident.  In the aftermath she became severely depressed.  She wasn't dealing with her grief in a healthy way (or at all), it was affecting our sex life, our marriage, and her job performance.  I did everything I could to be supportive but it was just getting worse.  I gently encouraged her multiple times to seek professional help and she refused every time.

Finally one day after a particularly bad series of days and another nasty fight over something stupid I snapped and laid down an ultimatum, either she visits a psychiatrist or I visit a divorce lawyer.  

Looking back I realize it was the wrong thing to say.  I was hurt and frustrated and angry and throwing down an ultimatum like that was not the right way to handle the situation.  But it worked.  It shocked her out of the rut she was in enough that she started seeing a psychiatrist and things slowly started improving.  

It took us quite awhile to get back to normal, but we're in a good place now."

"When he went and bought a car with no hesitation but any movement forward for our relationship took months and years of discussion and still never amounted to anything.

Edit: I hadn‚Äôt realised how common this was, for the record we‚Äôre still sort of friends, like in the same circle. My mum still misses him because he‚Äôs such a good guy otherwise. 

I feel like he wanted to make me happy but anything that involved effort just wasn‚Äôt for him. I‚Äôm quite an outspoken woman and I think he just wanted the quiet life and would agree for the sake of it. Not realising that outspoken and unreasonable are 2 different things. People can say no without me having a breakdown. Unfortunately that has given me the feeling that I try to force people into doing things they don‚Äôt want to do and I have a serious issue with putting forward my opinion now. Thankfully I‚Äôve found a guy who actively wants to see me and has no issue with telling me what he does and doesn‚Äôt want. 

Edit again: Don‚Äôt put up with half assed. You all deserve better. "
"Yes. We did marriage mentoring (not counseling). We met with a trained couple who helped us discuss and work through issues, mainly communication. 

Each of you enter a relationship with a box of hopes, dreams and expectations and give it to the other person but RARELY do we communicate these clearly to each other. We just expect the other person to know. And when they don‚Äôt... we get mad and frustrated and upset. 

We now have weekly marriage meetings (could be relationship meetings) where we go over the week ahead and tasks we need to get done like shopping and cleaning. And we divide them up so household labor division is fair based in each other‚Äôs schedule. Then we also ask each other ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs on your heart?‚Äù It can be anything from ‚ÄúI am still frustrated for X interaction this week when you were sarcastic and put me down and didn‚Äôt acknowledge it hurt my feelings‚Äù to ‚ÄúI really think we should adopt‚Äù. We discuss these things openly and honestly and NOT IN THE MOMENT or heat of disagreement. "

"I slapped him to get his approval.  


It's not what you think. We were walking alone in a park talking about future jobs, and he told me about how some employers sometimes asked things like ""Surprise me."" in order to see how a candidate would react and how spontaneous/creative they could be. And then said crush asked me that same question, I was really at loss for words, didn't know what to do, I tried to come up with surprising facts about myself but he kept saying ""Come on, really? You can do better than that."" It got to a point where I got rather annoyed: 

""You really want me to surprise you?""

""Yes!""

And I turned around to face him and I slapped him.  


He stared at me dumbfounded for like 5 to 10 seconds. Turns out he had hoped that I would kiss him."

"I had the hardest time finding a reliable housekeeper for my vacation rentals. I started at $15 an hour but would have gone up to $20-25 real fast if I could find someone to show up, show up on time, and clean with attention to detail.

"I dated a guy like that once for a couple months. He was an investment banker who made a lot of money and wanted everyone to know it, and was also extremely insecure. Some of the highlights were:

- Always would comment on how I should wear more skirts and designer/professional clothes. When I was dressed casual, would comment negatively on it. All his clothes were very expensive, he got mad at me cause my new kitten was playing with his shoelaces.

- Called me ""ghetto"" for wanting to try a new divey restaurant (as opposed to the usual overpriced ""gastropubs"" where our checks were $100+), and for using my old student ID to get discount on movie tickets. 

- Said he was coming over after happy hour with his friends. Texts me a while later saying he was almost done and just finishing drinks and waiting for the check and I said ok. 45 min later I get a call from him all upset that hes not coming because I never texted him to check on him during the past 45 min and something could've happened to him and I don't care about him.

- Had a best female friend he spent time with at least 3 times a week, who he used to date. Got mad at me for even talking to male friends.

- Would regularly get trashed with his friends at expensive bars. Would not invite me cause I'm too ""trashy"" and ""low class"" (I grew up solidly upper middle class, have a good job, and working on my masters). Would proceed to get drunk and not be able to drive home, then call me to come get him, change his mind and insult me, and then get mad when I didn't come because he was ""testing"" me."
"YUP. He took more time than me getting ready, but that's not what I am talking about -- I will never hate on someone taking care of their physical appearance. You do you!

But he was very, very emotionally high maintenance. He needed constant reassurance that I was really into him. He got weird if I didn't text him daily to check in (yet always expected me to text him first?). He needed constant verbal validation. Like, he would take me out to dinner but then while we were at dinner talk consistently about how nice and expensive the restaurant was if I didn't remark on those things first. And I was young, so I gave him what he asked for without asking for the same things in return and without breaking down the emotional toll that his requests took on me."

"Exactly. I was a diesel mechanic in the army and I had more experience and more time in the motor pool than any of the other male mechanics that were there. Guy from another unit came over and said they needed a licensed driver to back up a fueler for them. I happened to be licensed on everything. The guys I was working with were not. I said I wasn't busy and I would walk over in a few minutes. Guy literally wouldn't even look at me and looked to my senior NCO and asked the same question again from him. My NCO directed his attention to me, then the guy decided all of a sudden that they had a guy in their unit who was probably licensed on the truck. 

I went back to my lunch. If he wants to be a sexist asshole then so be it. I get to finish my lunch and he gets to bother someone else. "
"When I realized that my life would be a constant fight against his mother. She wanted to control what I wore, what I ate, my career, my friends ...

He doesn‚Äôt even like Disney movies... his mother is the Disney fan. wtf? "

"It's a clear example of the same cultural misogyny that lets [men age in Hollywood movies but has them star opposite women the same age forever](http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/leading-men-age-but-their-love-interests-dont.html). It's an indicator of how our culture says that women are their most valuable and attractive in their early 20s, while men get to keep growing more handsome and distinguished. If a man is singularly focused on dating women decades younger than them, it's because they don't respect the value of women their own age.

Note, this isn't about ""any relationship with an age gap."" People meet and fall in love in all sorts of situations, in all sorts of points in their life. But the OP's question was about people who _consistently pursue_ significantly younger partners. And it would be silly to ignore the fact that that's something that happens a lot more with older men pursuing younger women than the reverse."
"I grew up lower income and I‚Äôm definitely more comfortable financially now. I think a lot of it was sheer luck and nothing I did. I also think that while I was ‚Äúpoor‚Äù by some standards that I wasn‚Äôt living in complete abject poverty by many means. I never viewed myself as poor until college. Also, while having little to no cash on hand, because we weren‚Äôt living in deep poverty, my father‚Äôs credit was good enough to co-sign a small loan with me to fund what my scholarships and grants would not cover (I also would work while in school). Additionally, my father and mother were able to maintain employment and had the skill set and health to do so. They are both fairly stable people. So I was blessed in many ways and lucky in others. I had some factors stacked against me but I‚Äôve seen much worse in my own neighborhoods.

I mean, I essentially I think it‚Äôs bullshit. I think the whole rhetoric stems greed, inability to recognize the unlevel playing field, failure to recognize privileges that you have and how they affect all aspects of your life. The whole give a man a fish vs. teach a man to fish line is garbage when you start to realize sometimes you can‚Äôt afford the pole and bait, the pond is too far to get to, you‚Äôre not allowed at the pond, all the fish are dead, the water is poisoned. You can‚Äôt win and get blamed for it"

"The women I know in relationships with men all complain about the lack of daily assistance.

"Realizing they weren't right for me, that there were lots of people out there who were more compatible with me. We were just puzzle pieces that did not align, but there are others out there who do align with me.

"When girls do it it's considered to be fun and cute and owning their sexuality. When guys do it it's considered creepy and stalker-ish.

"I started pole dancing 8 years ago at a dance studio and got that all the time, especially after I started teaching. So I started pointing out that I don't perform, I don't compete, and I don't strip for money. What attention? The studio was women-only. I got plenty of attention from my friends telling people about it but it was always negative attention and I got sick of explaining that it's a fitness thing, and I'm not a stripper. And then I felt badly because without strippers, there would be no pole ""fitness"" and they deserve some credit for basically inventing a full-body workout.

"We were married for nearly ten years. 5 years in, he lost his job. Cut to him moping on the sofa in his underwear for literally 4 years while I worked ten hour days. I'd get off at 7, have a 30 minute commute, do any shopping that needed done (because he couldn't do that - if he tried I'd get bothered at work about where the eggs were in the store - ask someone who works there, don't call me), which put me home at 8:30 to 9 pm. Then, an hour of cooking and maybe we eat by 10. I'd sink down exhausted to listen to him *complain* about how the house isn't clean and he can't concentrate in a messy environment. No thought to clean it himself, mind you, because that was MY job. 

I'd go downstairs to decompress playing WoW or whatever while he webchatted to buddies and recorded podcasts. He made me keep my cat in the basement and acted like it had rabies whenever he was near him, despite my cat being essentially the most affectionate cat in the universe.

His mother was constantly up in our business and whenever we fought I got to listen to her opinions about whatever we fought about, after the fact, secondhand, through him (My mother thinks...)

I loved him. I worked on being better at housework, despite having the shittiest call center job in the world and being under ridiculous stress from that and the home situation, and having next to no time to do it in. I was kind and loving and his pep squad and did my best to cheer him, help him network to find work, helped him start a business, helped him at cons to do promotion and with interpersonal relationships, all the while he *complained* and moaned and complained about how awful his life was and no one appreciated him.

I put on so much weight, because I'm a comfort eater. One day, I started a diet (keto, guys. It works.) I joined a gym, lost about 60 pounds and started feeling so much better about myself. I tried to use this to revitalize our sex life but he just wasn't interested. I begged him to see someone about the depression but he refused - he wasn't crazy, he didn't need THERAPY, for God's sake.

I gave it some serious thought and realized I was the only one putting any work in on the relationship, in between being banished downstairs during recording sessions (I was too distracting). I realized that my marriage, which started out being about love and affection and partnership had become a glorified roommate situation.

And I realized I was SO FUCKING TIRED. I was tired of my horrible job. I was tired of having no friends because he never wanted to do anything, but he hated if I went out without him, despite me trying to include him in any activity I might have tried to do, and it was such a struggle I eventually just stopped trying. I was tired of being his pep squad, and him putting in zero effort - on our home, on our relationship, on his mental health, on our intimacy, on ANYTHING. So I told him I was leaving. He spent 2 weeks trying to save our relationship, but it was just too little, too late. 

Me and my cat moved back home with my mom and dad. I reconnected with high school friends, and ended up finding the love of my life in a friend I'd had since third grade. We had an amazing four years together, he and I and his three awesome kids, and we were planning to get married in October of this year.

My fiance died unexpectedly sixteen days ago.

I'm so tired."
"I never had a great relationship with my mom. We didn't share secrets, she was never my best friend and we never talked about anything personal. As a teen I was very angsty and ran away at 17 and didn't speak to her for 4 years - I resented her for strict/helicopter type parenting. I needed some help a few years ago so I had to make up. Now I'm 25 and I realized that she stayed married to a horrible man, gave up her dreams, her passions and (still) lives a fairly unhappy life to make sacrifices for me. She's 63 this year and is still working a labour job. I didn't realize how hard it was for her to immigrate to Canada in the 80s, never getting an opportunity to learn the language, and how much she gave up to let me live a fairly normal Canadian life. I resented her for a lot of things that I know now were for my benefit. I have such a deep respect for her now. "

"Mine happened without me actually realizing it. The last 6 or so months of the relationship he began nagging me over everything. I kept thinking it would pass, he was having a rough time...etc it wasn't passing though. One night we had this event planned, and I didn't feel well so I stayed home. I had just had my first biopsy of my uterine lining, and I was still emotional over it. Not to mention that hurt pretty bad. Well he went alone, then came home fussing at me because I didn't go. Without even realizing what I was saying I told him he needed to move out. I worried for weeks I messed up. Then he came to pack the rest of his things. Every box he took out the door was like a weight off my shoulders. I thought I would be sad to see him get his things, but I wasn't. I knew in that moment I did the right thing. We were officially over that day."

"I've told this story before but when I was pregnant I started bawling at my husband's work Christmas party because they didn't have Sprite. I don't even like Sprite that often but I was paranoid about caffeine. The bartender in pity, confusion and desperation made me seltzer with juice and fruit. 

I also cried when my son was a week old because I was ""abandoning him."" He was with my husband/his daddy and I was walking a block to buy diapers. Kids play with your emotions."

ETA: More stupid shit I just remembered. I had a huge crush on a customer at the restaurant I worked at. I decided the best thing I could do as a painfully shy person was to write down a cute, funny list of reasons why he should go out with me. I can‚Äôt remember all the things on the list, but one of them was that I gave good head. Thankfully, the universe took pity on me and decided I‚Äôd been cringey enough because I never got the chance to give him that list. "
It depends on who gives it to me honestly. Some random dude giving me a mixtape or a love note I would hate and find creepy and weird. My SO doing it on the other hand would be super sweet and I would love that he took the time out of his day to do so. I like it as long as it's from the person I love.

"Have enough seating is super important.  Dont let people stand around wondering where they might be able to sit.  

When they enter your home it should be clear visually whether it is a shoe or no shoe home.  There should be a recognizable area to hang coats, purses and store shoes.  I hate when I enter a home with my stuff and I dont see where to put my things.  Do I start opening closets?  Interrupt the hostess to ask?  Set it down wherever?  These things should be made obvious.  

Be a good DJ, is this an ambient music crowd?  What music do they like?  Know this stuff beforehand.  A silent room is never okay.  Even if they are there for chatting only there will always be a lull in conversation and with a little background noise those times are way more comfortable.  But it shouldn't ever be so loud that people have to speak over it.  

Other than that just make sure your place is tidy and you have plenty of drinks and snacks to share."
"He got a night job and our schedules became opposite. Instead of being sad at the thought of seeing him so much less, I was excited to sleep alone and only have to be around him for a few hours in the evening after I got home from work, and to just be able to *relax* in peace and quiet without his negative energy crushing me. Being around him was exhausting and I realized I had run out of the strength I needed to deal with him.

"Yeah. 

I was trying to think how to describe my biggest breakup, but this is pretty succinct and does it. 

For me it was a relationship where I always felt like I was in trouble, she would frequently be mad at me about something. She had me convinced that I was this awful boyfriend who would constantly say the wrong thing or accidentally insult her. And I was super apologetic, always trying to explain how it was a misunderstanding, or what I really meant, etc, and apologizing so much. But after a while I started feeling that it was her not me, that I was a pretty good boyfriend and she was just hyper-sensitive and almost like she was trying to find something to be mad about. I think it wasn't intentional, she wasn't being manipulative and trying to be mad, but she was really self-conscious/low-self-esteem and would project that and think everyone was out to get her or something. So it was a while of transition from thinking I sucked as a boyfriend and trying to improve, to feeling like there was just no pleasing this person and that it shouldn't be this hard, that with another girlfriend I wouldn't be in the doghouse often or at all. 

The MOMENT, was just a stupid little thing, we were talking on the phone, her mom was looking to a buy a car, they were thinking about what to look for. I suggested a Honda, and she said her mom doesn't like Hondas and thinks they're not reliable. I was like ""what? they're like the most reliable cars."" - her: ""She had one that broke down in like 1981"" - and I let out a tiny laugh. Maybe not a laugh, just a ""heh."" Just a ""well that's kinda silly."" This was followed by looong pause, and then she said, really pissed off, ""You probably shouldn't have laughed."" and I knew this was the start of her being mad at me about this for the next week or so, usually including me being all apologetic. But this was the breaking point where I felt - ""Yeah, I'm not gonna apologize for that, I don't care.""  I didn't break it off right then, it took a while, and we lived together so it wasn't super easy. But that was the turning point when I really realized that I was Sisyphus trying to push this rock uphill. Felt pretty liberating to just be like ""fuck it, I don't care, I'm not apologizing."" 

Anyway, about a year later I met a new girl, we've been together 8 years, and have basically never had a real fight/argument or had any times where I was ""in the doghouse.""  "
"I‚Äôm not a slob so much as naturally disorganized and distracted. 

A few things that help me:

Put things away in a specific location whenever you‚Äôre done using it. I have a key hook on my wall, so when I get home the first thing I do is put my keys on the hook. I never lose my keys anymore. Put away your jacket when you get home instead of tossing it on a chair. Put away the crock pot, your toothbrush, hair dryer, and shoes as soon as you‚Äôre done with them rather than leave them for ‚Äúlater‚Äù.

Set a timer- a short one, like 10-15 minutes. Clean for that long. Doesn‚Äôt matter what- you can vacuum, do dishes, fold laundry, just spin around putting stuff away and randomly wiping stuff with a Clorox wipe. Do as much as you can in the short amount of time. When the timer is up, you‚Äôll see that you can accomplish a LOT of cleaning in such a short time. It will likely motivate you to finish whatever you‚Äôve started, and seeing that you‚Äôve made progress is helpful when you need to get more done. 

Have less stuff! The more stuff you have, the more easily your space can get cluttered and out of hand.

There was a slow progression from being sad, to starting couples counseling, to stutteringly telling a friend that it could end in divorce if nothing changed, to fights, to silences, to needing a month separation .... but somehow soon after I came back from that separation, it seemed inevitable that we were going to divorce, and I just had to figure out how to make that happen.

And it reminds me that it's 2018 and women are still primarily valued for their appearance/youth/ability to be f*ckable to men above all else which is super not great.  And i would not consider dating a man who was dating me to avoid dating his equal, who couldn't be emotionally vulnerable/mature, who wanted to date me because I have less life experience than him, who wanted to date me for shallow reasons etc ‚Ä¶. i just wouldn't want anything but an equal partnership  and am not interested in a guy who thinks I'm a decoration.

"This is kinda what I went through with someone. I was in the US, he was in India. I had moved away after I got a job. We were really close and he wanted us to be in a relationship. I did too, but didn't want to do it across the distance. 

I asked him if he would visit soon, because I couldn't travel, whereas he could. He said he didn't want to make his first trip abroad all by himself; he wanted to take his parents with him, they had sacrificed so much to get him educated. Fair enough, I too had felt that. While it might be strange to westerners, it's a common sentiment in India, and I was on board with that.

Three months after that conversation, he went to party in Thailand with some friends. Fuck that noise, I stopped looking at him that way right then and there. "

Same goes for almost all of the clothes that end up there. I understand sometimes Nordstrom will send something to, say, Nordstrom Rack if it didn't sell well - hell, I got a $400 jacket for $40 that way once! - but most of the time, it's the designer's ""cheap, rip-off"" line. "

1. When he had to leave with his family over Christmas for a vacation out of the province and I finally got a reprieve from the abuse. I got to clear my head and realized I didn't even like him, let alone love him. I found him disgusting and I was sick of feeling responsible for his actions. 

2. When (different boyfriend) hyped up that he was getting me something really great for Christmas. He went out of his way to tease me with what it was. He was always the type to forget my birthday, get me nothing, etc, so it was really unusual that he was doing this, and I was optimistic that maybe this meant he was starting to mature and become more thoughtful.  Nope. For Christmas I found out he kissed another girl at a party, and got me /nothing/. I didn't care that I wasn't getting a gift, I cared that he lied and lied to me for weeks.

3. When the boyfriend I had lived (a different boyfriend than the two above) with for two years confessed that he lied to me for the entire time we'd known each other about his finances (he liked to give financial advice, lectured me about responsible budgeting, etc and in reality he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt and out of control with credit cards), how old he really was (he was six years older than he told me he was), and that he used to stalk me whenever I left the house with friends. One way ticket to duuuumpsville for him.

4. When I realized (boyfriend 4) would never actually stand up to his domineering mother. He liked to pass on the hurtful things she said about me all the time, but refused to ask her not to say those things about me. We were very in love, and we wanted to get married, but he would /not/ ask his mother for his birth certificate so that we could do the necessary paperwork because she did not like me. I stood up to her, when necessary, and she hated that. I loved him a lot, but he was unable to do anything his mother disapproved of, and would do /anything/ to make people around him like him. I found that attitude made it hard to trust him. I never knew if he was telling me what he really felt, or if he was just trying to make me happy.

5. Years and years later, I married a woman who seemed wonderful at first. Once we were married, however, she became another person. The moment I knew it was over was not (shockingly) the day I was very sick with strep throat and had a seizure while she was in the room. She did nothing. She just watched me, and then went back to watching her movie. I asked her after I recovered why she just let me lie there. She said ""I asked you if you were okay. You said yes.""

I had a /seizure/.

The moment I knew that relationship was over was when she decided to micromanage how cripsy I was cooking a pan of bacon (an ingredient for a dish we were taking to a party). She told me it was going to be too cripsy and so on and so forth. She is a /vegetarian/. She has never cooked bacon in her life, she was never going to eat the bacon, she didn't even have to look at it. 

We divorced shortly after and I have never regretted it. "
"I tend to immediately notice how like...unhealthy/red-flaggy a lot of relationships in media are.

"I think it's really, really common for people to grow up in households where the mother does significantly more housework than the father, so when partners move in together it can be a rude awakening for both people. When we first moved in together, I was surprised that my wonderful, feminist, helpful husband didn't see the importance in equally sharing household chores like cooking dinner, but then I spent a week at his mom's house at it all clicked. His mom is obsessive about feeding everyone, doing everything, and literally never just sits down to hang out. My husband just honestly doesn't realize how much time must be spent on household stuff when one person in the home isn't by default doing everything all the time. We're still working on equalizing things."

"He wanted me to be second to him in everything except looks, wanted a 'hot girlfriend'. 

Salary, job prestige, intelligence, car, etc. He had a Napoleon complex and a huge amount of small dog attitude.

"Being kept waiting for hours for someone to show up when we agreed to hang out. Being kept waiting for days to hear back from them.

"One with a bad ending: I told the guy I had been hanging out w I had a question for him. We had been cuddling every time we saw eachother so I figured I‚Äôd just ask if I could kiss him, but I‚Äôd never asked someone something like that in person. It came out as ‚Äúwanna face punch?‚Äù. We never kissed. I really wish I was kidding.

One with a good ending: I was hanging out with this guy who is now my boyfriend and I‚Äôd been dying to kiss him. I decided I‚Äôd make a move since girls should do that. I was like ‚Äúlol what would you do if I bit you right now?‚Äù Then I went to bite his cheek and he turned and kissed me. It ended well but wow, lesson learned that I am terrible at trying to make moves. He thinks it‚Äôs hilarious. "
"When my anxiety is really high and my brain gets in an endless loop of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù, I focus on literally just one moment at a time.

"I might not be what you're looking for, but I spent 10 years in the service industry clawing my way up from minimum wage to 35k a year, and I recently accepted an office job for about the same amount of money with room for advancement. 

As a numbers game, not everyone can do it.  It's simply impossible for every low level worker to get a management position and make a living wage.

Second, I had tons of help along the way.  I'm lucky to be OK looking and thin but not pretty enough to be threatening.  My parents taught me good grammar and the importance of showing up on time and working hard.  I don't have problems with time management or anger.

Third, I had a friend get me the interview.  Without connections it's very hard to switch industries.

No, not everyone can do it, and that's why I support a high minimum wage and universal health care.  All people deserve some standards of life even if they are lazy/dumb/whatever BS thing people use to excuse their callousness towards others."
"A friend of my husband.

He'd refer to himself as ""Only slightly picky"", but:

- Insists on having one day a week where he has 0 responsibilities, including things like ""do dishes"" or ""Shower"".  He throws a fit and turns into a cranky mess if this doesn't happen, even if it was due to something he wanted to do.

- Insists on being the expert at.. a lot of things.  He needs to be ""The Expert"" on anime, computer software, obscure role-playing games.  If someone else learns more than he does about something, that subject is immediately dropped and no longer matters.  If someone refuses to acknowledge his superior knowledge, the tantrum re-emerges.

 - He also tries to play ""I have this Superior Physical Ability"" games.  The most recent being that he swears to god that he can ""Zoom and enhance"" his vision in on far away objects and thus see far better than the rest of us.  The far-away objects, in this case, were freeway signs (the kind mounted on overpasses to tell you the upcoming exits) at about a quarter mile.  We keep telling him that if he's impressed at being able to see overpasses, he needs glasses.  Another common claim is that sugar allows him to slow down his perception of time, allowing him to move faster than other humans.  As with being The Expert, if we refuse to agree with these claims or insist that other people can do some of them too and it's normal, tantrums occur.

- Refuses to even consider following social norms, especially with his appearance.  You'd think that this would lend itself to the opposite of high maintenance, but... you'd be wrong.  He's rather aggressive in his refusal to do things like even *own* business-casual clothing or get haircuts.  Unfortunately, we're all approaching 40, so this is starting to actually cost him things like jobs and professional contacts.  People don't take him seriously, which leads to him not being The Expert, which leads to A Tantrum. 

 - Alternately, he expects us (His Fiance, his friends) to fuss and nag when he does need to show up to something dressed to a certain minimum level.  He'll get loud and insistent about how little he knows about ""these things"", then waits with a grin on his face for one of us to come over and ""fix him"".  If this doesn't happen, he sulks through the entire event.  This includes things like job interviews, or attending the opera, and almost everything inbetween.


- Divides issues into ""His problems"" and ""Not his problems"".  If an issue is ""Not his problem"" (such as: cleaning up after his fiance's cats, who he lives with, while she's on vacation), he will only care about it if the person begs.  If it's ""His problem"", everyone needs to help him out with it RIGHT NOW.

- Has issues with anything he's ""done before"" if it didn't lead to permanent superiority in something.  We used to play WoW, and every expansion he'd get rather pissed at having to go out and quest and run dungeons for new gear.  We're not sure why he played a game where that is *the central mechanic*.  It extends to most hobbies, however, in one form or another.  The guys took up rock climbing for fun and exercise.  Mr. High Maintenance imimediately pushed himself as hard as he could to climb the hardest routes and try the trickiest holds.  However, he never learned proper form or technique, so while he was able to brute-force a lot of it, now that the other guys (who have been practicing and learning) are catching up and surpassing him, he's starting to complain, and one of the complaints is ""But I've done the lower level ones already"".   It's also ""The Expert"" problem - he's not 'the expert' climber, so rock climbing is suddenly not as interesting, and he's ""bored"" or ""not feeling well"".

- He never gives out emotional validation until he gets his fill.  I don't know how his fiance puts up with him.  If he has an issue - and I've never seen the man without issues - he steals the spotlight until he feels validated.  This will include simply wading in and walking over other people's conversations to grab their attention.  He also needs everyone's validation for it to count - if I'm off talking to his fiance, he needs to come steal me and make me listen to his problems, even if he's been talking to everyone else in the room.  Then, and only then, is he willing to listen and be supportive.  It's draining, because we have to prepare for this onslaught every time we hang out with the two of them.  And just like all the others - if this doesn't happen, tantrum.  


As far as we know (and my husband's known him and his family since they were teens), he has never been diagnosed with any sort of mental issue."

"I worked with a guy who was 30 years old. His criteria for a woman was: between 21-23 years of age, shorter than him (he was only about 5‚Äô 7‚Äù), must not weigh more than 110lbs and she must be down to get married and immediately have babies. He also wanted someone incredible dumb based off of the girls he attempted to date. 

In my opinion he had real insecurity issues and was looking to be the one with the power in the relationship. I think that‚Äôs the real problem with that kind of criteria. It‚Äôs a power play and could be a very unhealthy relationship. "

"I didn't like the role he wanted me to assume. My role would've been 100% giving, 24/7, without receiving an equal measure of support. We broke up, argued afterward, tried to be friends, but it was an exhausting level of aggression, blame, and neediness from him. I don't miss any of it. "
"We did end up dating in university! I guess it worked?

Actually... he later told me that he was really attracted to me in high school but couldn't bring himself to ask me out because of how weird and uncomfortable I was. So, there's that.

My favorite though is because I answer the phone, people think I'm the receptionist. They'll ask to speak to sales or a technician, and when I say ""that's me!"" they start off sounding really unsure about speaking with me.

"Wait.

Are you saying there are women that can have an orgasm from non-clitoris related things?

Like I know there are outliers like that woman who has an orgasm every time she brushes her teeth or whatever. But for like most women, can most women orgasm without stimulating the clitoris?!

My friends know that I keep extra clothes in a closet just in case they just feel like getting comfy and being lazy. I always have food and wine to offer, so that's a plus.

Best thing to do is not to play on the same field, because it gives importance and validate his field if you do.

People go nuts if you make them question their own frame of reference. Cognitive dissonance to the max.

"34, female, software development.

I think, and this is going to sound racist so I'm going to try to make it sound less racist to fit in with this sub, the most instances of sexism I've encountered have been with the first generation or fresh off the boat Indian developers.  To be honest, I don't really hold it against them, it's cultural a lot of time - they are taught from a young age that women are less than men, therefore when they come over here they treat the women at work the same way.  I look at it as an opportunity to prove their biases wrong.  There's a lot of dismissing my ideas, ignoring me initially, and not wanting to do things assigned by me, but one by one, they all eventually start changing their tune.  ;)

It was funny, when the uber story first hit the media, I was like, ""Oh, I bet their entire development staff is indian guys"" and immediately looked on linked in.  Low and behold, it was basically all indian people, 2 white girls, and a couple white guys.  That's how some of these tech companies get so in trouble with these sexist departments in development - because they have fresh off the boat and first generation employees who literally don't see anything wrong with the way they are treating women - it is how things are done, until someone complains about it, and BAM, you're in the news.

I think in software development at least, there's a lot more gray area that people care to admit because the amount of workers here on visa's with different cultural norms makes this issue more complex.  When you talk about sexism in the industry, most people are picturing people with the same ideals and values, but it's not that way at all.  There's an entire culture shift that has to happen first, which no one is really addressing.  I mean, checking out this article, [more than half of Seattle's developers are born outside of the US](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/more-than-half-of-seattles-software-developers-were-born-outside-u-s/).  It leads to a very complex problem, which is multi-faced and not easily addressed.

I think it's interesting to note as well, that I - as a white women - have noticed that I get treated leagues better than my Indian female counter parts by the male Indian developers.  I can't tell if it's because I demand respect, and they don't because it's ingrained in them as well that the males are somehow better?  Or if it's because the males just recognize that I'm american so they can't treat me the same way they do indian female developers?  I'm so confused by the dynamics here, but it's also a very difficult thing to bring up in office conversation."
"Going on a juice diet. 2012, I watch that documentary ""Fat Sick and Nearly Dead"" and this guy is just pumping up how great going on a juice diet is for you. I think, hey, that sounds good and healthy or something, so I'll give it a go. I do and it kind of sucks cause I'm constantly hungry, but I power through it. 4 days in, I've eaten nothing solid, and am at the grocery store in a dress, going to pick up more produce when, as I'm walking, my leg feels wet. I look down and there is SHIT running down the inside of my leg. I ditch my cart and run to the bathroom to discover I was having the experience of ""anal leakage"" for the first (and last!) time because I hadn't eaten solid food. So...don't think I'll give that one a go, again."

"Your mileage may vary depending on where you live, but look into civil service. I‚Äôm a police officer and all I really needed to get on was 2 years of school (didn‚Äôt have to be criminal justice related), decent physical fitness, and a clean record. Similarly, for corrections, 911 operator, traffic agent, school safety etc you don‚Äôt need much. NYC has open competitive exams that come out every month for these jobs. The benefits are great, a lot of opportunities for growth, and in 5.5 years for me (6.5 I think for new hires under the latest contract) most cops hit 6 figures with OT easily. My first year on I made $56k, with a base pay of $46k and not even doing crazy OT. I get two holiday bonuses a year, an annual uniform check (about $700), and 12 vacation days (27 after 5.5 years).

And at least in NYPD there‚Äôs a lot you can do under the title of ‚Äúpolice officer‚Äù that don‚Äôt have anything to do with police work, especially if you have special skills. There‚Äôs cops whose sole job is to play in the marching band, who work in building maintenance, who teach, who translate uncommon languages, who maintain the department‚Äôs social media platforms, whose only job is to drive a high-ranking boss, etc. There‚Äôs units I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

"This had always been close to my handling as well. If someone who works for me can answer their questions, great, I've saved time and energy. If not they have to come back with a better attitude and setting the respect of the team. "
"I have had to accept that she is oblivious, that she lives in her own bubble where she assumes she knows what is best for literally everyone and no one else‚Äôs opinion counts. That she simply DOES NOT SEE how she walks over, ignores, or otherwise dismisses other people. 

Example: My father has a nasty easy chair. She says she want to buy him a new chair, ELECTRIC! So he can push himself in and out of it when his legs are weak. He says, no. She proceeds to email my brothers and me asking if we want to help buy him an electric chair for Christmas. He says, no I don‚Äôt want an electric chair. I say, mom, dad said he doesn‚Äôt want an electric chair. She buys it anyway. 

Example: She hates looking at my ratty briefcase every year so she buys me a new one at the beginning of each school year. I don‚Äôt ask her to. She just does it for five years. I suggest on year six that she might buy a more hardy one, instead of the 35$ one from target and it would last longer, but if not, she doesn‚Äôt need to get me a new briefcase this year, I will save up for my own. She brings me a new briefcase from target. I say thank you, but no. She brings me ANOTHER ONE, from goodwill. I say thank you, but no. She brings me A THIRD, from ANOTHER GOODWILL, I say, thank you, BUT NO. And then I say, this has nothing to do with the gift, thank you for thinking of me, but you ARE NOT LISTENING. And she pouts. She sulks. She acts like I‚Äôm being ungrateful because I am saying no to the gifts that I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HER NOT TO BUY ME BECAUSE I WOULD NOT USE THEM. I try to tell her that I‚Äôm not angry about the gifts, that I am upset about her continued dismissal of my DIRECT WISHES. 

There are many wonderful things about my mother. She is smart, ambitious, worked hard to care for me and my brothers and put us through school as a single mom. She is a woman of faith and forgiveness. She accepted my brother without question when he came out of the closet. She is the peacemaker of her siblings and an excellent cook. She is gentle and polite and politic in conversation - everything I‚Äôm not. 

But she never left my abusive, drug addict father. She never made that decision. The three of us had to suffer because she couldn‚Äôt make the right decision. Because in her head, SHE IS SURE of what is right for everyone and gives no one else the chance to make their own decisions. 

The worst thing about it? It‚Äôs NEVER ON PURPOSE. Ever. She never insults me on purpose. She never makes a remark that hurts me ON PURPOSE. It is always thoughtless. It is always without the faintest idea that it might hurt me. I‚Äôve always thought that was the most terrible part, because at least if she were hurting me on purpose, judging me on purpose, dismissing me ON PURPOSE, it would be because she thought enough about me to make those decisions. Instead, they‚Äôre just her assumptions about who I am. 

I was playing the lead in a show that she came to see? First thing out of her mouth is a criticism of it. 
I started thinking about buying a house? First thing out of her mouth was how little I knew about mortgages, how I couldn‚Äôt possibly understand. When I told her about the research I‚Äôd done, her response was, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôve never heard of any of that ...‚Äù like it couldn‚Äôt be real if she hadn‚Äôt heard of it. 
I‚Äôm buying a dress for a family wedding: ‚ÄúWell wouldn‚Äôt you like to wear something that‚Äôs more slimming, like a black?‚Äù 
Two years ago she forgot my birthday. She was literally the only other person who was there and forgot what day I was born. 
I coach a team that competes at TOURNAMENTS, not Meets, but despite multiple corrections, she continues to call them MEETS. I have literally never called the competitions meets, she just decided that was what they were. 
We‚Äôre arguing and I am in the middle of trying to explain how I feel. SHE JUST STOPS TALKING, pauses for two minutes of silence, AND THEN STARTS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. 

A typical conversation goes like this: I‚Äôm talking about something, like a house inspection and I say,
‚ÄúWell (boyfriend‚Äôs brother)  is a certified inspector ‚Ä¶ 
MOM : and city inspectors just don‚Äôt work because they always want some kind of pay back
Dad: It‚Äôs good you know an inspector.
Me: Yeah it‚Äôs good to have one in the family.
MOM: He‚Äôs a certified inspector?
Dad: ‚Ä¶. She just said that
MOM: Residential?
Me: i just said that. 

She just does that. She just DOES NOT LISTEN. Subconsciously, NOT EVEN CONSCIOUSLY, she has decided that I‚Äôm not worth listening to. So her mind just shuts me off. AND SHE IS NOT EVEN AWARE THAT SHE‚ÄôS DOING IT. 

Which is the fucking worst. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm going to therapy. It‚Äôs working a little. But I‚Äôve had to accept that she lives in her own universe and it still runs me ragged that someone can be so DEEPLY unaware of how dismissive they are of others.
