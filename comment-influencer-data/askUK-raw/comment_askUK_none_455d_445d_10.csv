"Mate, it's hard to explain.

It's just like one day you'll just be with your mates having a look in JD, and you might fancy curry club at the 'Spoons - but your lad Callum who's an absolute ledge and the Archbishop of Banterbury will be like ""brevs lets have a cheeky nandos instead."" 

And you'll think ""Top. Let's smash it."""

"£20 bag of coke that I shared with my boss on a night out about 20 years ago. He had a great night, never stopped talking about and when a promotion opportunity came up for me, I got the job thanks to my boss."

"Before you do anything, do your daughter a favour and go see your GP or a qualified counsellor. I’d worry that what you’re feeling is actually depression or some kind of emotional problem and that giving your child away might destroy both of you "
"Mate, your uni will have a counselling service and hardship funds student services will be able to point you in the right direction. You are dealing with a lot stuff all in one go and i doubt anyone wouldnt have similar thoughts. You dont have to do this alone. "

"This may sound awful - but Cancer Research UK.

I was feeling charitable at Uni so called up to begin donating £3 a month. No matter, it's nothing and maybe it will help a bit.

A year later they called me up to ask if I would consider doubling my donation. I said I'd be willing to up it to £5.

Almost to the day they called a year later with a similar story about how although my donation helps to change lives they need more. Again, they asked if I would be willing to double to £10. I reluctantly agreed to set it at £8.

Once again, the yearly call came, almost the same scripted lines read out to me about how they need more. Would I be willing to increase my donation to £15pm? Maybe they caught me on a bad day, but I told them to cancel the donation entirely. I think the rep on the phone didn't expect that.

I appreciate that charities need to raise funds but when the aggressive salesman like pressure begins to surface, they don't become a charity in my eyes any more."

"Lots of posters have suggested contacting your GP which is great advice. However as someone who has worked with children's services I strongly recommend you get in touch with them. (Google children's services in your area for contact details). They are not an evil group of baby snatchers, instead they will be able to put together a package of support for you, and, ultimately arrange adoption if that turns out to be best for all. It maybe that with some additional support you will feel differently. "
"Alright buddy, it's hard to explain.

It's like you're hanging out with your dudes at the shooting range and you're feeling like a Wendy's but your pal Chad who's a total boss is like ""Bros, let's get chicken shack"" and you'll think ""Great, let's eat""."

"Shitting, shaving, washing, changing, changing babies, consuming drugs, masturbating, having sex, avoiding a panic attack, vomiting, treating a minor injury, stealing the toilet paper one sheet at a time, sleeping, using it as the only private carriage on the train, adjusting or maintaining artificial limbs. 

Or is that all just me?"
"This is something that me and my colleagues were discussing just last week. We work at a college where there is no uniform, and no dress code beyond don't be nude and don't be offensive.

We have all worked at multiple schools and have experience with multiple different policies and senior management personnel. A general consensus is that a lot of people that make it to SLT and hence have a say in the school policies have never worked outside the education system, and therefore don't really have a great idea of what it is like in the ""real world"". They enforce traditional and archaic policies because that's the way it has always been and the way they feel it will be when students move into the world of work.

Many teachers disagree wholeheartedly with the policies they are told to enforce and would rather remove conflict with their students, but someone up the food chain needs to feel powerful and convince themselves it is for the good of the students."

Hi mate I'm English born and circumcised.  Blokes seem to like my schlong and it's often seen as a nice novelty so I'm sure you'll be fine.  And please have a fab time in Blighty!
"Under £500? That would be the fancy Dyson fan I got for my mum when she came out of hospital.

I mean, she's still dying, but at least she's comfortable! So there's that!"
It's is customary to wear trousers (pants) or shorts here so follow these fashions and no one will know! 
The crazy thing is school boys used to be forbidden from wearing trousers in most schools....

My Kindle. I can take hundreds of books with me everywhere I go meaning I'm never at a loss for something to do. I didn't read for years before I got it but it's seriously my most valued possession 
You might be right but I don’t even have the finances to bring her up anymore. I’m 23 and just entering my 4th year at uni. I bring her up and maintain myself with the maintenance loans plus bursaries. My girlfriend at the time got pregnant but we decided to still have the child. I know you’re going to think that we were being stupid but at the time we were so excited and felt so ready to do this even if we weren’t. When our daughter was around 13 months old my girlfriend passed away and neither of us are close to our families and I’m doing this all alone whilst studying for uni. I’m about to enter my 4th year at uni for a masters in chemical engineering and I don’t know if I should see this through or just drop out. I’m finding this so hard and I don’t have the resources to bring her up and I’m so confused as to what to do. Another family who are financially sound and can provide her with the time and love for her is probably the best thing for her and I genuinely feel adoption is the best thing for her
"Letting the air out of your tyres will impact the structural integrity of them, so I would argue it's criminal damage. Criminal damage doesn't mean permanent damage either (from my quick Google on the subject so take with a pinch of salt!) - [here's the Criminal Damage Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48)

Could potentially also be an offence under [s22A Road Traffic Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/22A):

A person is guilty of an offence if he intentionally and without lawful authority or reasonable cause—

* Causes anything to be on or over a road, or

* **Interferes with a motor vehicle**, trailer or cycle, or

* Interferes (directly or indirectly) with traffic equipment,

in such circumstances that it would be **obvious to a reasonable person that to do so would be dangerous.**

"Someone having a bad day. You didn't say anything wrong.

Maybe she just resents the fact that Scotland is still part of the UK."
"It's a non issue, it's not a normal occurance to be circumcised here but plenty of blokes still are because of medical or religious reasons and I've seen a few in the wild. Because you're American most people would automatically presume you were cut anyway.
Have fun! "
"Forward thinking, I like it. ‘Bought it for your Mum’..."
"Definitely just a stuck up idiot. Looking to get patriotic without necessity. England is in the UK. If I said I cooked some bacon in my kitchen someone wouldn't correct me and say 'don't you mean in your frying pan?' 

If you'd said Scotland I'd understand as England &lt;&gt; Scotland. But Scotland and England do = the UK and vice versa."
They're avoiding the weirdo outside who's monitoring their toilet use.
"Basically everyone has to have read at least one of his plays to pass an English GCSE at school (in England, can't speak for the rest of the UK). I had my GCSE on Romeo and Juliet and I'm pretty sure I had Macbeth in my SATs (smaller tests that happen halfway through secondary school and don't really mean anything).

I've seen a few of his plays both here and abroad. I'm going to see Richard III in a few weeks. I don't consider myself to be a particularly big fan of Shakespeare but here we are!"

"Jesus, I'm so sorry to hear that, and for what it's worth, you've been hugely strong in trying to raise your daughter and study full time. Before you do anything, I would second what r/mulborough is saying. Try and get yourself to a counsellor before you make any rash decisions. You may very well live to regret them one day. "
"Letting your tyres down is really going to encourage you to move your car!

"Post partum depression exists for males as well. You need to speak to your GP, sharpish. 
I didn't properly love my second son until he was over a year old and I'm completely unashamed to admit it. There were lots of different reasons why, but post partum depression was the main reason, and PND typically isn't feeling sad - the number one symptom is not bonding with 
and feeling detached your child. Ever feel like just running away? Escaping? Intrusive scary thoughts about hurting her or just leaving her somewhere? Hello PND. 
Social services will do absolutely everything they can to stop you from giving her up, there is no drop off point you can leave her, and they will unlikely take her from you unless you have been through counselling, had family support services, and assessments to track your progress.  
What support do you have in place? Does she go to nursery? Toddlers are fucking arse holes and PND just turns the volume up to 11. Have you spoken to your HV about how you feel? 
Please please talk to a professional. "

"was it part of the actual application, or something that would be separated from it, like asking for ethnicity, sexuality etc? Those things get asked as part of equal opportunity monitoring and are for statistical purposes, not part of the decision making. I can see how they might want to know as part of that, to see if they're getting possible candidates from  a wide pool of social classes. "
"""One train, please."""
"I came here to say the same, I despise Cancer Research UK and their methods of upping the donation, I still get calls every 6 months about what my money used to do and how I can help again, hopefully I won't get it under GDPR as last time I said that if they called again, I'd call the police and report them for harassment (same as I did for my local Labour Party who kept calling for donations).

What's stupid is that I don't disagree and would gladly donate but the issue is how they keep wanting to squeeze more out of you whereas the Alzheimer's Society haven't asked me to up my donation, they just keep updating me on all the fantastic work they do, needless to say, I give them more money than ever."

"Childcare is not that expensive when you work it out.  It averages £232 for a five-day week, which is about £4.70 an hour.  You have a staff:child ratio of at least 1:4 if the kids are under 3, so those 4 kids are paying £18 ish an hour, and costing £8 in salary alone.  Add in on-costs (pension, sick leave etc etc) and the staffing cost for 4 kids comes in closer to £11.  Then you are paying for food, rent, power/heating, admin etc - there's not a lot of profit in there.  A lot of childcare providers are losing money, and it's not a profitable sector at all.

"I read that as ""English and born circumcised"" I was wondering how that would happen"
"More or less. More people are living longer and are living with chronic rather than cureable conditions. Funding cuts to social care have also had knock-on effects to hospitals. Sometimes people aren’t sick enough for hospital but need care they can’t get at home. But the hospital can’t release them because they have nowhere to go. So they stay, sometimes for months.

"While I feel sorry for the guy he's affecting your quality of life. Even though he may not be able to do much about the pain there are things he could do about letting the noise travel (sleeping in a room that doesn't adjoin neighbours, putting up sound proofing etc)

If not I'd start to treat it like any other noise nuisance."

"I, personally, am not a fan of uniforms. I understand why some people think they are necessary, but they do not need to be as restrictive as they are. An example would be hair cuts, a child's hair cut is in no way going to affect their education, yet the school I was at last year would put children in isolation for 2 days if their hair was cut shorter than a 2. The same students would persistently come in with a 1 every month or so and be put in isolation.

No workplace is going to care if your hair is a 1 or a 2, but the school's stance was that it was setting the standard for the pupils that they would face in the future.

All it did was give the pupils that wanted to miss lessons a really easy way of getting out of them."
"Kids charities. 

Stuff like 

* Ryanair trying to flog raffle tickets in the name of generic *childrens charities*

* Chuggers on the streets trying to get me to donate to unspecific ""kids with cancer"" and 

* the ridiculous Childs Play charity funnelling millions to huge game corporations so rich (albeit sick) american kids can play the latest video games in hospital

I'm sure there are plenty of worthy causes in the category but it's the go-to guilt trip for shady bastards trying to enrich themselves."
"Ah, don't worry about that. I am writing crime stories and thrillers. I have been on those lists for years. 😅 "

"I was in exactly the same position as you a single parent at uni, your grants should be hefty, I was extremely comfortable at uni as they were throwing money at me to be there and to be brutally honest, I think saying you don't have the resources is a cop out. I just don't think you have the SUPPORT. Married families, single mums and dad's, grannies bringing their grandchildren - Everybody struggles financially bringing children up. 
I think being on your own now has given you a sharp dose of the complexity and reality of bringing up a child, and what you need to do now is get yourself some counselling. Speak to your health visitor. Visit children's centres. Contact Gingerbread, the single parent charity. Talk to someone. Me even. I've got two living kids, ones learning disabled, the others on the spectrum and I've got one that didn't make it out crying whose ashes are scattered around a tree, carving out a life for me and my children. Life with kids is brutal and fucking hard but it is easier with the right support. "
"This.

"&gt; I appreciate that charities need to raise funds but when the aggressive salesman like pressure begins to surface, they don't become a charity in my eyes any more.

I worked for a company that fundraises for charities over the phone when I was 18.  It was absolutely soul-destroying and I feel sorry for people who do that job now.
I had to call people non-stop from 12 until 9pm, Mon-Sat, and we only had a 30min break, which was spent queueing with my colleagues for the toilet.  

Every one of the people calling you is on commission to get 20p extra for every “successful call resolution.”  A “successful call” is one where you put the phone down and have the bank details and ideally a few quid over the minimum donation level.  Once you have this, as you’ve worked out, your name gets greyed out until the contract between the charity and the company re-opens.
Cancelling your donation sometimes doesn’t have the desired effect of “maybe they’ll leave me alone”, often your name is just flagged as “give them time to cool off and call again.  Start from tier 1 again.”

Every call I made was monitored and if I didn’t hit my ever increasing targets, I was frog marched into a room to listen to my calls and find out where I went wrong trying to convince 85 year old Doris, struggling to keep herself warm, to fork over £30 a month to whatever charity we were working on that week.

I remember one such time, where my monitor told me that he didn’t care about the sob stories of “the customer”, and to just focus on the key points to leverage getting money from them.  Absolutely astounding.

This company still operates and have since learned that for every £1 an employee manages to get from a donation, 40p of that goes to the company.  The remaining 60p obviously goes to the charity, but then that’s often eaten up in overheads, advertising, blahblahblah... so you’d be lucky if 5p even went to the cause you were donating to.

Cancer Research UK are absolutely the worst for selling these contracts to companies like the one I worked for and I will always think twice about donating to the likes of them."

"75&amp;#37; of the donkeys in the UK are in The Donkey Sanctuary but it's a big charity with 10 different sites so you're probably seeing lots of branches of the same charity. They've done their job too well in the UK and apparently British donkeys are the best treated in the world, but they do a lot of work in Europe and Africa where there are massive amounts of mistreated working donkeys - and import donkeys needing rescue from Europe as well.

It is funny (not haha funny but people are eccentric/odd funny) that the donkey sanctuary often gets better funded than children's charities though. People have a real soft spot for donkeys."
"&gt;Finding it hard to believe that the average is £27k. 

Because the word 'average' is misleading.  That's the *mean* average, e.g. add them all together and divide by ~~half~~ ETA: the number of weddings dur dur, which results in a figure skewed high by super mega expensive million pound weddings.

What you're likely interested in is the *median* wedding, which is the point where half of all weddings are cheaper than the median, and half are more expensive.  And apparently that is about **£8,000** not 27k. [source](https://www.themoneypages.com/latest-news/how-much-does-the-average-british-wedding-cost/)"
"It seems like you're at a crisis point. It happens to lots of us, in different ways and for different reasons. It's NOTHING to be ashamed of, it's a very normal reaction to very stressful circumstances. 

First, take a deep breath. Then take another.

Right, so what we're dealing with here is that you're struggling with parenting as well as all the other stuff going on in your life. From reading your other posts you're grieving, bringing up a toddler, and trying to finish uni. That's a hell of a lot, I have so much admiration for you but fuck me, no wonder you're in pain. My partner died 4 years ago and it's the hardest thing in the world. It's bewildering, and traumatic, and terrifying, and a whole load of of stuff that can't even be put into words.

You need to break down everything that's going on in your life into segments. 

In terms of the death of your girlfriend I really would recommend speaking to your GP and your uni about counselling. There's also an organisation called Widowed and Young who are a charity that supports people under 50 who have lost a partner. Don't worry about the fact that you weren't married, they support EVERYONE. Look them up online and if you have £20 join today, then join their FB group and tell your story, you will find people who understand. If you don't have £20 email them and explain your situation, they will help people who can't afford the fee.

Ok so then we've got uni. Talk to your lecturers, talk to your department, talk to your student counselling services. Look up every available source of information available on your uni website. Tell them what's going on with you, tell them you're feeling lost but you're trying to work it out, tell them that you need to know what support and options are available to you, in terms of both academic support and personal support. I honestly think they should be impressed with that you're trying to finish your studies while dealing with all of this. 

Finally - and here is where I wish I could give you a big hug - your daughter. If you decide that you can't look after her then that is what you need to do. But before you make that decision you need to make sure your head is clear, and because of everything else you've got going on, I'm not sure if it is. A lot of my friends are single parents, and it is HARD. My best friend loves her son more than life itself but still rang me in tears (when he was about 2) saying ""I just want to kick him out of the window"". She never would, but she wanted to, and she despised herself for it. Every parent I know wishes they could just walk away sometimes, and that's especially hard when you're on your own. Unfortunately there aren't so many single dads out there, and I think too often they're seen as heroes which risks minimising the struggles they're going through. There's nothing worse than being told that you're strong and coping when you feel like the opposite. This is where a chat with Social Services might help, or an organisation like Gingerbread or Sure Start. I think another poster suggested CAB, I think that's a really good idea as you can tell them your situation and they might be able to signpost you to local organisations. Maybe we there are some parenting subreddits you could talk to? It might be worth asking in r/menslib, it's not parenting related but it is a very supportive community for men, you could just ask if there's a section of Reddit for single fathers. What you need right now is support. Once you have that, if you still think your daughter would be better off with someone else then you will be making an informed decision. But try some other stuff first.

You're a good dad. You're thinking of your daughter's needs. Just don't forget your own. It's ok to need help and it's ok to get help. Whatever happens I really wish you all the best, just please make sure that whatever happens is a well thought through decision having explored all the alternatives. I honestly believe that if you reach out for help (which you've already started doing by making this post) you will be able to make it the right one decision for you and your daughter. "
"The ones set up after their child dies, looking at you Bradley Lowery foundation, I’m just a cynical person wondering how much they keep over what gets donated. Also the ones that put the charity bags through the letter box, thanks for the bin bags."
"At my school we let the kids wear PE shorts when it's as hot as it is at the moment and I know of several local schools that do the same. They're still part of the uniform with the school logo on them and they all own a pair. There is absolutely no reason for forcing kids to be uncomfortable, irritable, and more likely to misbehave."

"It is weird and terrifying but totally totally normal and a result of our fucked up brains. Give it a few years, with some close friends who are also parents (a vital addition you need to add to your life) and you will be AMAZED at what you can admit to each other.  
I was once making a cup of tea and thought about pouring the kettle over my 3 day old first born and years later I found out that my friend had very similar thoughts. I also sometimes get vivid thoughts about my youngest being hurt in horrific ways like burning or being under a lawnmower or just the most horrific things. Its just your brain having a bit of a fart. 
Your GP will have heard all of this before, nobody will think you're a psychopath. Nobody will treat you badly. They will try and help you, I promise. "
