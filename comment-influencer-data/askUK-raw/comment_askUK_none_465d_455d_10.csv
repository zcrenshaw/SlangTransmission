Groups of people who walk side by side on pavements and won’t tuck in for someone coming the other way. You expect me to step into the road so you can all walk next to each other? These days I just going - they either give way or bounce off.

"Full brexit mode

Spoons for 9am brekky and double carling with the lads.

Move to the next pub for half 11 for another carling and to pick up some England flags on the way.

Then at half twelve a trip to the off licence and chippy for a 4 pack of carling, obligatory one fingered salute to France on the way to the park.

Then go to the pub with the biggest TV for two to get a good spot, on the way middle fingers up to Germany. At the pub buy 6 pints so to be sure not to run out during the game.

Get passport ready for destruction as if we win I'll never need to leave the country again.

Tweet Nigel Farage to ask him why the rest of europe is so inadequate.

Middle Fingers to Spain, Italy, Belgium and Greece.

Google nice places to live in Burnley.

Empty my savings to put a bet on England to win, Kane to score, 4 corners in the 45'-70' and one concussion.

Buy an extra couple of carlings just to be sure.

Belt out the national anthem at the start of the game boo whoever we're playing.

When we win drink enough carling to make full use of the NHS

Carlings: 15+

Brexits: 5/5"

"First of all try avoiding being too pally with the kids. Thwy can smell fear, eagerness, and desperation and will seek to destroy for no reason than they are bored by 3rd peroid. 

Enjoy the massive amounts of holidays pal!"
"When she’s looking for anything care-related ensure that she’s looking for a role that’s (usually) listed as a support worker. These usually don’t require qualifications and they are absolutely crying out for staff.

Make sure her CV bigs up the fact that she has been a full-time family carer for 30 years and what that entailed. "
Most first-year students live in university accommodation. Most non-first-year students do not. 
No. Absolutely not. 
"As others have said, go to GP or a nurse based at a GP surgery and they'll give you a load for free. 

Word of warning though: you get what you're given. The first time I did this I got a load of leftover condoms from a clearly unsuccessful partnership between a condom brand and the band JLS. They all had JLS's faces on and the words ""JUST LOVE SAFE"". Weird as. "
"Get clear of short term debts

Increase emergency funds

Also, robes aren’t cheap to hire, so it could be a kick in the teeth for the less well off."

"As an employer, I'd be pissed off with someone IMing their resignation to me.  Let them know you need to speak (preferably in person) urgently, if they can't/refuse, then do it.

You might not like or want this job, but a reference might be useful in the future and a bad exit isn't conducive to helping

EDIT:  you have to give him a day or two, 24 hours notice isn't enough for a meeting"
"When a car stops to let me cross a road and there's nothing behind them for miles. I could have crossed more quickly if they'd kept driving at speed, instead of me having to look at the driver to make sure they're letting me cross and not just slowing down for some other reason."
I’ve been a science teacher for a decade. Ignore students they do not know what’s best for them. Be consistent and persistent. That is the key.

"People who walk out if a shop and then stop, looking around as if surprised to find themselves outside.

"Alright dude! I'm in a similar situation in terms of free time. Here's what my week looks like:

* Learning Web Development ([Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)) - 12 hours/wk
* Learning Java ([Helsinki MOOC](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/)) - 8 hours/wk
* Learning Drawing ([DrawABox](http://drawabox.com)) - 5 hours/wk
* Learning Spanish (Duolingo) - 5 hours/wk

That's 30 hours per week of largely solo desk based learning. I can do more of any if I desire to, once all the goals are met. To balance out being at a desk for 30+ hours per week I run and I kickbox, ensuring I do a minimum of 5 sessions of one or the other per week, although preferably just working out every day. None of the above is at all related to my regular job.

I also aim to do at least one cooking/baking project per week, whether it's making my own dough or just researching and cooking something I've never cooked with before (this week will be beef short ribs).

Personally speaking if I abandon any of the above four learning projects, or if I get better at managing my hours and feel comfortable to add another 5 hours per week in I'll probably start on piano.

In terms of C.V. improvement, there is very little that *everyone* will actually give a shit about. You've got two choices really, either you do you and then hope that companies you're applying for like that you're doing the things you do (they probably will, but to what extent is totally variable). The other option is that you decide what you want to aim your C.V. towards and then work on developing skills for that.

If you want to be a lifeguard at a swimming pool being able to program is not really helpful. If you want to be a marketing specialist, having an in depth knowledge of Cathars in 13th century France probably won't help you.

Pick your route, either it's self development for the sake of self-development, or tailoring skills towards specific kind of jobs you're interested in :)

If you've got the ability to could you restructure your hours and commence learning a trade at your local college? I'm only on land half the time so can't do conventional college courses but if someone paid me what I'm paid now to train I'd be learning to work wood right now myself."
"I think you'd be looking more at a temp administrative role than anything else, the skills you've discussed aren't inherently 'IT' as such. Looking for IT jobs will probably result in you finding 1st line support type things.

I'm an IT professional and a lot of customers we have, have employees who are a dab-hand at Excel/MS Office but struggle to switch a PC on. The two don't always go hand-in-hand.

EDIT: When I say administrative, I mean *office* admin not systems admin."
"I'd call the non emergency line to the police on 101 to start with. They may be able to advise, given this person is threatening a crime."

"I don't know if this constitutes ""impoliteness"" but I hate when a group of people are not only walking at a painfully slow pace but they're obnoxiously taking up the entire width of the pavement. Please adopt a more ""when in Rome"" approach and don't do this if you decide to visit London."

"If they haven't got the decency to keep you updated on what's gone on, especially if they are well outside the time period they've given you, then they don't sound like the type of people you'd want to work for anyway.

Secondly, I found [this charity](https://www.cruse.org.uk/bereavement-services/get-help)  which may be of use. They have a 24/7 free helpline and seem to support people of all ages.

Last- please do not in any way question whether your grief is somehow less valid or real because you weren’t married.  Legally you may not be a widow, but in my opinion after 10 years together it makes absolutely no difference if you were married or not!! Please do not minimise or discount the pain you are in. Your feelings are valid and real."

"You don't like our health service, you don't want to pay our taxes, and you don't want to live on the same salary that a British person does. Also you come across as a bit of a tosser so you'll likely find it difficult to make friends here. It doesn't sound like you'd like living in the UK very much, so it would probably be better to just stay put. "

"One of my classmates asked our new American teacher if she had a rubber he could borrow. To avoid repeating her mistakes,  you should be aware that this is the British word for an eraser, and doesn't generally require anyone to be given detention."
No. The only time you should do it is if your appearance is part of the job.

"I was a secondary science student until a couple of years ago, and now I'm a university science student. 

This might seem obvious, but it is 100% the defining thing that separates a good teacher from a bad one. Engage your students. Be interesting and make your lessons interesting. The classes that people fail aren't the difficult ones, or the ones they don't like - it's the ones where the teacher didn't engage them, so they switched off and didn't pay any attention. 

Make the classes interesting. Do practical work when you can - kids love that, especially when you can show them something completely unexpected like how copper burns green (or blue? I can never remember).

Be friendly and kind. Some kids will hate you no matter what because you're a teacher, but if you make the odd joke, help the students and don't have boring classes, you'll do great. "

Also as someone who works in the NHS and seeing the sheer number of non UK staff who work here I seriously worry for the future of our healthcare.

"I know they do it in the States, but DO NOT put your photo on your CV, and advise your friends against it too. 

Gender, race and age are protected characteristics and companies shouldn't be hiring based upon them. Any HR department worth its salt (and certainly any recruitment agency) will remove your photo (often along with contact details, and sometimes even name) at the earliest opportunity because managers/hirers are meant to review CVs without bias.

"Absolute carnage.

Wetherspoons selling 24 million breakfasts on match day, the Army is called in to organise beer convoys into the major cities to make sure that vital supplies don't run out. Reservists getting their draft orders to man the beer pumps and breakfast pans to maintain order. Blokes will be panic-buying Carling and Stella before the big day. By 7am the streets will be filled with overweight men singing about the Ten German Bombers over and over, already on their 34th pint. By match day it will be utter scenes in every town in the country as the gassy lager is literally flowing in the streets. White vans will be driving in formation at 10mph on every major road, tooting their horns to that England clapping rhythm from The Italian Job.

When England beats Germany in the final on penalties, 52 years of repressed madness will flow out in one final spasm of glory. The inevitable football riot will be made worse by the fact that this time even the filth will be joining in, as mobs of van drivers and builders roam the streets singing the Dambusters March, painting the red and white cross on every public facade and building in the land. Prince Philip will emerge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace waving a half-empty bottle of sherry and screaming obscenities about 'Jerry' and how it is now Two World Wars and Two World Cups. 

And finally, the following morning when the nation arises with the worst collective hangover for 70 years, a stoic bulldog (awoken for his morning walk, but his owner, Paul, 43, plasterer from Thurrock, is still in bed with a half-eaten kebab on his face) will stand on the end of his street and stoically take in the scenes around him and make a single contented bark.

Because it's fucking coming home lads."
