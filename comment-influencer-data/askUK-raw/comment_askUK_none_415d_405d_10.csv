"You can buy a cheap knackered out old car with 6 months left on the MOT at auction, for about 100 quid I believe.

You can also buy a wheel clamp from Halfords for about 40 quid.

"It's bad for the environment, it doesn't get *that* hot in our heatwaves (it rarely breaks 30°) and putting up with a few warm days a year isn't so much hassle that you need aircon. "
"People will bitch and complain about each other as a way of letting off steam. It's quite common in many workplaces.

The key is not to be too serious or personal and not to take it too seriously or personally.

It can become a problem when it becomes bitter, nasty and persistent. It will take a bit of experience to judge when this crosses the line.

Culturally it's quite normal for British people to grumble about things with each other as a way of social bonding. Done correctly it is harmless and actually beneficial. A lot of people from other cultures find this difficult to grasp and confuse grumbling with genuine vitriol. Usually because it is often done deadpan whereas in other countries it is done with obvious humor signals such as smiles, laughs, and clear exaggeration.

Raise the issue with your boss by all means, but be careful. You don't want to come across as a miserable, humourless arsehole who makes serious complaints about colleagues behind their backs to their bosses."

"There's a phrase said to kids by their parents as they put them to bed in the UK, that mostly goes ""night night, sleep tight, and don't let the bedbugs bite"".

As a kid/teen I thought 'bedbugs' were some made up thing just for that rhyme, because I had never seen one and no one ever mentioned them outside of the rhyme."

"I've hired loads of people - I can honestly say that the sport they've played has made no difference whatsoever.  At best, if you're the treasurer of a club and can put down that you're trusted with money, know how to handle transactions, refunds etc. that could be good. If you want to get into marketing, being responsible for promoting the club could be a small advantage.

But just being on a team? No. Sorry. Out in the real world it doesn't matter which balls you kick around. If you were the captain you could spin some yarn about inspiring the team, showing leadership, bringing people together - maybe. But there's a huge difference between the sports-field and the shop-floor.

Part of being an adult is learning how to have difficult conversations and understanding other people's desires.  You need to talk to your dad. Is he doing this because he gave up a sport as a kid and regrets it? Does he want to cheer from the sidelines? Is he worried that you're outgrowing him? Is this the last summer you'll spend together before you don't need your old man any more?

Good luck!"

"I work with kids. Ecigs are what they use nowadays. A bottle of liquid costs 3 or 4 quid and lasts all week. A decent ecig costs about £25. So you can vape all month for the cost of a few packets of fags.

"They are British. 

EDITED (noted because people whine about the fact my post is edited despite the fact it changes nothing) And to clarify for anyone who goes 'oh George I was German therefore the entire family over the last 300 years are German' well, yes, he was. But he was also a great-grandson of King James VI &amp; I. The present queen is a descendant of the Tudors, the Stewarts/Stuarts. And also, every monarch since (and including) George III were born in the U.K. That's over 200 years of family being born and raised in the U.K. Usually less than that is good enough for someone to be considered 'British' enough so why do we have to cling to the idea that the royal family are German when that is patently not the case?"

"Lol. I did this once but it was a mates car that he was going to scrap that still had 4 months tax and MOT left on it. Let him know there was a drink in it and we parked it in front of the offenders house with a sign aimed towards his front door advertising a sale price of £5,000.

Police actually still came and asked me to move it but it was all 100% above board so nothing they could do.

This prick had vandalised multiple cars and houses on the estate and had also physically attacked me and others. Petty but worth it for the £50 I spent."
"Your GP will just ask some questions about how you are coping and feeling, how your day to day life is and stuff like that. They will probably prescribe some medication and you may get on a waiting list for some therapy.

"Bad because it uses so much electricity, yes. Can you imagine the bump in electricity usage if half the homes and workplaces in Britain were suddenly using aircon all day every day during the summer?

We need to fight climate change, not retreat inside and watch the world burn from our lovely cool houses."
"For me, it's not been so hot that I've felt I've needed air conditioning. Looking at local weather stats, June had a maximum temperature of 27.4 and an average temperature of 13.9 and July had a maximum temperature of 26.8 and an average temperature of 16.6. That's warm but I'm still able to cool my house to a comfortable level just with natural ventilation.

Also, you mention the install cost of air condition but what about the running cost? And what about all that extra energy that would be needed if everyone had air conditioning?"

"Very normal in my experience. Happened in every place I've ever worked.

Probably a side-effect of the UK's increasingly long working hours and erosion of the division between personal/work time - leads people to bring more of their ""personal"" behaviours and habits (ie. Gossiping and interpersonal drama) into a professional environment.

Best way to avoid it is to seperate your work life from personal life as much as you can; these people aren't your friends, they're your colleagues. When you're in work, you are ""work guy"", and you leave that personna at the door when you go home."

"I did one of those starve diets. Aimed for a month before I started getting anger issues (and I'm a very calm not angry guy). I ate powder packets and water 3 times a day. It was a fucking nightmare.

"Do you want to fit in in halls? That's pretty much what it boils down to.


If you're expecting a quiet place where nobody bothers you too much and leaves all your shit alone then it's probably not for you.


If you're content with noise, a bunch of kids who have never lived away from home so inevitably will never comprehend washing up for the entire first year, and a great social opportunity (that is a little bit of a lottery) then rock on. Embrace the atmosphere and make an effort with who you live in, no worries. Age is no barrier.

The plan is to launch ""Later this year"" (pushed back from April) but we'll see how that goes.

"A couple of quick points:

- choose a different font. It looks like there’s spacing missing between some words and I think a sans-serif font would fix that (unless there are missing spaces in which case, put them in). For an example see the lack of space between your hobbies and the commas. Arial or Trebuchet are good options. 

- put your reason for leaving your last job if you chose to leave. Saying you left for further education is fine. It’s up to them to ask if you completed it or not. 

- I actually think it’s fine to list a year of education even if you did drop out but others may disagree. 

- your first listed skill seems a bit buzzwordy, I read it a couple of times and still not entirely sure what you’re talking about. "

"I know one woman who started vaping without previously smoking cigarettes. She was quite large and was always trying to lose weight, but had a sweet tooth so would snack on sweets and cake a lot. She started vaping with some really sickly sweet nicotine free vape flavours. Whenever she had a craving for sweets she would vape instead to get her sweet tooth fix and she began losing weight fast. I know neither are particularly healthy, but I think nicotine free vaping is probably a bit healthier than consuming that amount of sugar and calories she previously did."

Looks to me like Germans are having kids younger than us 

What you’ve seen is deprived areas and cheap resorts in Spain where you’re more likely to see working class mothers who are more likely to have kids young due to lack of job prospects "

To be honest, the idea that stuff is worth stealing from the toilets is bonkers.

Back in the day, when we were students, a couple of people I knew who lived in a rented house when most of their year lived in uni accommodation, used to raid the uni toilets and steal toilet paper. But if I went in the staff toilets now, I honestly can't see anything I could steal."

I always wear a tie to an interview. If they're lax on their dress code then you can always leave the tie at home once you've got the job. Looking professional is an important part (IMO) of getting the job in the first place.
