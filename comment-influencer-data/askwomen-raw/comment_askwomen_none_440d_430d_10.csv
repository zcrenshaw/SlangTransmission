0,"I'm going to give a very detailed response because simple statements like ""you work well as a team"" or ""you respect each other"" aren't sufficient. Important, yes, but not sufficient.

You know your partner is the right one to marry when you love them, are willing to make sacrifices for their happiness, they are willing to make sacrifices for your happiness, and you have thoroughly and exhaustively discussed and considered the following list of items which frequently lead to marital strife and divorce.

* Finances. How do you view money? Spend money? Save money? What are your goals, expectations, habits? How do you feel about debt? How much debt do you each currently have? How will that impact your marital life? Finances is a huge source of stress on a relationship. Be on the same page.

* Family planning and parenting. Kids / no kids? How many? When? What to do if you have an oops pregnancy? How would you handle infertility? How do they feel about adoption? How do they view division of labor in parenting? How would they discipline?

* Household labor and standard of cleanliness. How much dirt, clutter, or messiness are they willing to tolerate vs how much you are willing to tolerate? If you feel you do a little bit more than you should now, that will become a LOT more than you should after you have kids. Make sure you and your partner are on the same page here because it does not get better and usually gets worse.

* Religion and politics. You don't have to be in perfect alignment, but you do need to be able to respect one another's views and logic. People's religion and politics do change over time, but they tend to get more extreme not less. Look into the future to see how life will look in this area especially if you have kids. It's one thing to agree to disagree before kids, but it's quite a different matter to watch your partner teach your child things you disagree with.

* Extended family expectations. How close are you to your family? How close is your partner to their family? How do you each feel about each other's families? How do your families feel about you and your partner? Will you be cool seeing these people for every major holiday for the rest of your life? How will you handle elderly parents who need assistance? Take a look at any of the toxic family subreddits to see just how much havoc the inlaws can wreck on an otherwise happy marriage.

* Careers. How important is your career to you? Your partner's to them? Who will sacrifice in this area if one of you needs to move for a major promotion or opportunity? Does your job require you live in a specific area? How do you feel about living abroad for a while? Does one of you want to be a stay at home parent? How do you each feel about that? What if one of you has to stay home because you can't afford childcare? How will you handle that? How will division of labor change? Does your partner respect your career even if you don't earn as much? Would you respect your partner for earning less? Wage inequality can do weird things to power dynamics in marriage. It can lead to lack of respect or a feeling of superiority or inferiority.

* Sex and fidelity. You need similar sex drives. If one person feels pressured for sex all the time while the other feels sexually frustrated all the time, it will kill your relationship. Be on the same page from the start. Settle into the relationship to get past the honeymoon phase where you boink like bunnies to see what your real sex drive and sexual needs are. You need to be able to discuss sex candidly without embarrassment or shame. Fidelity goes beyond affairs. How do you feel about outside sexual influences? Discuss porn, online chats, ""gone wild"" content, flirting, dancing, close relationships with people you're attracted to outside of your marriage. Everyone's line here is different. You need to know what exactly will be hurtful for your partner, and your partner needs to know what will be hurtful to you. Does it bother you when your partner looks at other people with sexual desire? Does it bother them when you do? Discuss your boundaries thoroughly. Really think about anything that's bothering you in this area because it will not change when you get married. People have this idea that their partner will ""fully commit"" to them and stop any wandering or flirting once married, but that's rarely the case. People are who they are. Decide if you can live with who your partner is.

* Communication. Does your partner make you feel good about yourself? Do you share a sense of humor or at least respect each other's senses of humor? Do you handle problems as a team? Do they ""fight"" fair? Are arguments productive? Do they listen to your side and really consider what you say, or are they set on ""winning"" every argument? Communication problems are like a magnifying glass for the original issue. If you don't communicate well and kindly, you will drive a wedge in your relationship. If the communication problems are on your end, fix this about yourself before getting into any relationship.

* Hobbies and leisure time. What are your expectations? How much money is appropriate to spend on hobbies? Do you share at least one interest in common that you can do as a couple? Do you respect your partner's hobbies? How will your leisure time change with marriage? With children? A mismatch in this area can leave you feeling alone or abandoned. It can leave you feeling disrespected and belittled if your partner is the one who doesn't respect or support your interests. People's hobbies and interests change over time, but how passionate they are about their current hobbies and interests generally stays constant. If your partner spends 20 hours a week on hobbies now, they will always want to spend 20 hours a week on hobbies even if those hobbies change. Kids can really magnify an imbalance in this area especially if one partner is constantly off enjoying themselves while the other partner gets stuck at home with the kids.

* Red flags. Is there anything bothering you? Does your partner drink a little too much? Treat wait staff a a tad poorly? Drive aggressively? Defer to you on everything? Put their family before you? Spend money recklessly? Tease you a little too pointedly? Push your boundaries? Sulk when you say no? Make you feel guilty? Pick arguments over inconsequential stuff? Blow hot and cold? Whatever it is that gives you that little check in your gut, listen to it. Analyze it. Take your time to watch that element closely and decide if you can live with it for the rest of your life.

You will grow and change over time and so will your spouse, but if you start on the same page in these areas and maintain good communication, you will greatly increase your odds of growing together in the same direction. Those 80 year old couples who've been married 60 years and still hold hands in the park are still together because they walked the same path side by side every day of their lives. If you don't even start out on the same path, how can you stay on it?"
1,"Healthy relationships don't tend to be super interesting, don't create a lot of conflict to make a good plot."
2,"That we're all attracted to baseless confidence.

Confidence is nice if it's earned, but few things are a bigger turnoff than when a guy acts like the sun shines out his own ass just for existing. "
3,"My parents used to work in the same office and were close friends before they started dating.

One day my mom's boss, the head of HR and a supervisor/manager calls them both into a meeting. They sit down and the boss goes to my mom ""There have been rumors going around in the office that you two have started seeing each other. And as a friend of your husband (my mom was married before my dad) I think it would be innapropriate to be doing so. Is there anything you wish to say to us?""

My mom takes a deep breath and says ""this meeting is not related to my or his work performance at all, then?""

""No, we just wanted to have a casual chat about this""

""Well, I just don't see how this is relevant. If you must know about my personal life, I would prefer to use facts rather than rumors. Like the fact that my husband and I have been separated for over a year. Not that it matters what I do outside this office. But if you must insist on discussing office rumors, I'm happy to talk about some of yours. Word around here is that you (boss) do cocaine. And that you (HR guy) can't get your wife pregnant. They are also saying that you (supervisor) cheat on your wife with other men""

*they all start to sweat*
""Wait, you don't have to be like that, (my mom), we were just curious. But who is saying these things?""

""Doesn't matter. Just rumors, right? So if you don't mind I'm going to go back to work""

She got up and left. My dad in full shock never opened his mouth throughout the whole thing and left right behind her. Those rumors all turned out to be true and they never bothered my parents again. My dad loved how ballsy my mom was. 30 years later they going strong.

Edit: grammar and clarity"
4,"I have naturally really rosy cheeks.  When I'm mad, excited, or hot they tend to get even redder.  A co-worker's office was really stuffy, and I was talking to him and another co-worker in there.


One of them asked me why I would wear so much blush, because it was too much.  So I licked my middle finger and ran it down my cheek, telling him it was natural and to mind his business. 


Seriously though, how much or how little make-up I'm wearing isn't up for commentary. "
5,"That women are innately more emotional and less logical than men, rather than just having been socialised differently to be more outwardly emotional. And a lot of men conveniently don't consider stuff like anger to be an emotional response."
6,[deleted]
7,Those damn hippies picked up a hitchhiker on the way to the hospital to have me lol.
8,Puff pastry. That shit is $2 at the grocery store and will easily consume a few hours if you try to make it from scratch
9,"That's true. My last relationship was mostly cuddling and Chipotle. That's a commercial, not a movie. "
10,When life throws a curveball at you and your partners reaction is “how do we get through this”. You’re a team. 
11,We recently moved into a new neighborhood. It’s a gated community and everybody waves at each other etc. I was (and still am) looking forward to meeting everybody and establishing some friendships. The other day I was out for a run and  I stopped to say hello and introduce myself to a woman and her husband because they seemed to want to meet me. When I reached them I pulled out my earbuds and the first thing the woman said to me was “well aren’t you fit and pretty”.  It was said with an acid tongue.  She’s a woman in her 60s probably and during our conversation she implied that I didn’t have kids (how would she know?!) I told her I have two grown kids who are out of the house. She asked how old I am and when I told her I’m 49 she quickly ended the conversation. I’ve never seen such a ridiculous display of insecurities. Why do women do that to each other?
12,"That D/DD = huge boobs. 

A 36B is the same as a 32D or 30DD as far as boob size. Bra sizing doesn’t work like you think. "
13,"I have been told multiple times that I should not wear heels because I am 6’3”. Fuck that shit. If I want to tower over everyone I’m going to. It’s also been commented several times that it’ll be hard for me to find a partner taller than me. Wow. I don’t fucking care how tall my partner is, and if me being taller bothers my partner then we were never going to work out anyways. I also get the obligatory “smile” comments because I have severe resting bitch face. "
14,"We had both recently ended other relationships we were in, and moved out of a flat we shared. Two things happened: 

1. Because we weren't flatmates anymore, we actually had to schedule time to see each other. That little change made our hang outs feel WAY more like dates.
2. I was pretty good friends with his ex girlfriend. This one time, we were hanging out and I was trying to figure out why he broke up with her and we just ended up spending hours talking about romantic relationships and what we each wanted in a partner. We were pretty much describing each other. I didn't realize it at the time, but apparently he did.

We've been married for 5 years now. It's been great. We did good."
15,"That we all secretly hate other women behind their backs. You have no idea how many men in my life are genuinely confused whenever I tell them how supportive other girls are, even strangers! They seem to think that we're all jealous and catty and feel the need to be the alpha woman."
16,"My husband cheated on me. He pretended to feel guilty and gave me a bunch of this ""you deserve better"" bullshit and expected me to walk away, but I decided our family was too important and I wanted to work through it. So he told me the other woman was his soulmate and being married to me  was keeping him from being happy, and he's divorcing me.  "
17,"Check your pm's for the answer my friend. 


edit: though I did slide in OP's pm's, I just want to clarify I did not actually send them a dick pic. 


edit2: update: disregard the first edit. I did not send them an *unsolicited* dick pic."
18,"That every decision related to what we look like (clothing choices, makeup, haircuts, etc) is made with men in mind.  As far as I can tell, some men think all men are attracted to the same things they happen to be attracted to, and that all women who do something ""unattractive"" meant to be attractive, but didn't know what men were into and need to be told about their mistake.  I hate to tell you guys, but I know what most men don't like.  You guys have been telling me everyday since I was a preteen.  Most other women also already know, it's not like you guys keep it a secret.  If I'm doing something ""unattractive"" anyway my goal probably isn't to attract the largest number of men possible.  My goal is sometimes to repulse as many men as possible, sometimes to impress women, sometimes to attract a particular man who I happen to know pretty well, sometimes just to be comfortable, etc.  Random dudes are never on the list of people I wish to impress or attract.    "
19,"I was the only female in my physics class and I had a pink calculator, and for some reason the guys found it so amusing that there I was with my little pink calculator, it was so patronising. 

Also, I'm the only female in my family with three brothers and all my cousins are male. On top of that, my mom is not into makeup, fashion, manicures, etc so everything I do seems to be noticed and judged. I feel like it caused me to be a late bloomer with having the courage to wear makeup and indulge my 'girly-girl' nature. Even now I'm too nervous to wear heels."
20,i think i's because healthy relationships are drama-free and ''boring''. simple as that. many people can't tolerate a healthy relationship because they think it has to be super exciting and dramatic to be love.
21,"I think a lot of guys hear ""confidence is good"" and think ""OK better be cocky!"" when really it just means ""be comfortable with yourself and in your skin."""
22,"My parents used to host these wild pool parties. Us kids were allowed to attend for the first few hours, but after that, it was adults only. Not only did I find out they were doing copious amounts of cocaine, but my philandering father used to invite his mistresses to these parties. As my mom was neither stupid nor blind, she used to do some crazy things to these women. She would spike their drinks with jalapeno juice, have them go to the basement to get more beer and lock them in, right up outright fist fights. Our screen was torn for weeks. Didn't find out until years later that my mother literally hurled a woman through it. "
23,"He just sort of stopped. Stopped giving physical attention. Stopped listening when I talked. Stopped coming over and stayed out later and later than ever with friends. Stopped showering. Stopped using deodorant. Stopped feeding and caring for our dogs. Have you ever seen someone try to walk a cat, but the cat just lays down and goes limp and you just end up dragging it until you give up? That's how our relationship ended. Like a cat on a leash. "
24,"While I was growing up I only would ever see my dad drink on Super Bowl Sunday and even then it was only a beer or two. Turns out my dad used to really like to party. He recently told me about how he once went out for a couple of drinks with buddies after work in NYC. Somehow the group ended up in Ohio the next day, hungover and not  knowing how they got there."
25,"My mom got arrested for possession of weed back in the 70's. A lot of weed. Before weighing it, the cops actually left her alone in the squad room with her stash on the desk. She proceeded to stuff as much of it into her mouth as possible and by the time the cops got back, she'd practically demolished it and was only charged with a misdemeanor. I once tried to eat a little nug just to see if I could do it and I couldn't. My  mom is a fucking bad ass hippie, y'all."
26,"I hate this. My coworkers will call a woman quietly walking to the bathroom to cry is 'so emotional' but the guy screaming and punching his monitor behind a closed door is totally emotionally stable.

"
27,"Not me, but this happened to a friend of mine yrs ago. She was in her early 20s and a bit overweight. She had irregular periods. She came to visit me one day and kept telling me her stomach felt strange...like it felt ""hard"" and it felt like gas pains, but ""squirmy"". She wondered if she was pregnant. She showed me her stomach, and even tho she was on the ""heavier"" side, her stomach was pretty flat.  I told her I didn't think she was pregnant. Two days later, her mother rushed her to the hospital with severe abdominal pains...turned out that she was in labor and within minutes gave birth to a perfect, full term, full-sized baby girl! Perfectly healthy despite no prenatal care! "
28,"That you're just happy being (existing) together. I've seen too many couples that seem to be waiting for the next exciting event together, whether it be marriage, kids, arguing,  events etc... Then that happens and they realise that with nothing going on they're bored of eachother and the next even becomes the divorce. Simply going through your everyday lives together and still just being happy existing together is the big thing for me. "
29,"That we are a monolith &amp; we all think and act the same way, which is absolutely always different from the way the monolith of man thinks and acts."
30,The being told to smile when I'm doing a bland job or task and not in the front of customers really pisses me off. I have a Male coworker who thinks it's acceptable to say this to most of the women he works with. He's a huge baby and will have a problem at work at least twice a week so now we all wait until he's pissy and then one by one ask him why he isn't smiling. My go to answer is wouldn't it look creepy if I smile like an idiot while sweeping or stocking.  
31,"I've recently came across the idea that  we all like those froufrou coffee drinks from Starbucks. 

We also dont all drink wine all day "
32,"Dang I wanna print this out and out this on a clip board to do intake on a first date

Edit: My highest rated comment both has a spelling mistake and expresses my desperation slash enthusiasm slash crushing loneliness. Yippee kayak mother fuckers! If you want it then you shoulda put an ethically manufactured diamond ring on it! "
33,"I'm marrying him.

I've had to learn to clearly tell him things in a straightforward manner, especially social things I think are obvious. He will chuckle and seem to brush me off when I have to confront him about certain things, but I definitely notice he doesn't really do that thing again either."
34,"It was a Friday night and I was sick with a terrible flu. He called late and asked if we had leftovers from dinner, said he was working late, again.. I told him I’m going to bed and there was food in the refrigerator. I ended up falling asleep on the couch holding our son, and was woken up by laughter .. he brought a female in our home. It was as if he wanted me to attack them both so he can call police on me. I was so dazed, I walked away holding our son and fell asleep in the nursery. Yeah, I called a lawyer on Monday morning... he definitely was not surprised..."
35,"Yup, we broke up 9 months after we started dating because we were both afraid of where the relationship was heading, and it lead to excuses to push the other away.  The official reason was ""we don't have enough time together.""

&gt;Where is the relationship now?

We're married.

&gt;Did you ever reconcile or rekindle?

Yup.

&gt;Did you do no contact?

Yup.

&gt;Did you regret the decision?

I actually don't know.  At the time I did (which lead us to reconciling 4 months later), but I don't know if we'd be together now if we didn't break up then.

&gt;Are you happy?

Extremely."
36,"When I was losing weight, people were always like ""you don't look *that* bad/fat"". Also that I should be careful about losing too much since I might lose some fat in my breasts and ass and that might make me look less attractive. "
37,I honestly think some men think the women in porn videos are genuinely enjoying themselves 🙄
38,"My husband has a buddy from college that we've seen a couple of times, but not any more. This guy is awful to his wife and is condescending towards women in general, and he was raised that way - we met his parents and through their interactions, saw the same treatment his gives his wife. His dad would tell his mom to Hush Up, Woman. When his giant dog plopped a giant poo right by the entrance and his mom weakly asked him to clean it up, he totally ignored her. 

Like his dad, he likes women seen and not heard. We were all having dinner and when his wife was speaking, he would *tap his glass repeatedly on the table while giving her a stern look* until she stopped talking. This would continue throughout the night. Anything I said to the table in general was not engaged at all by him. 

We went mini golfing and his wife and I were having a grand time. We were both terrible and laughing over it and finally moved the ball where we wanted or just dropped it into the hole and laughed. He got so angry and kept trying to tell us we weren't doing it right. Well, duh, we were having fun. 

Then he flip-flopped from ignoring me to trying to ""teach me things."" He tried to make himself the center of all knowledge, and I wasn't having any of it.

My husband was not happy with his former schoolmate, and we have not gone out of our way to socialize with him again."
39,"
I knew I wanted to marry my husband because of two things: every time I imagined the future, he was in it, and he treats me 100% like his equal. 

Love is not enough. You need respect too."
40,"My mother was a groupie in the 70s and slept with lots of really famous musicians, including David Bowie when she was definitely underage. Always makes me feel icky, not because of the whole being a groupie thing but the underage bit. 

And a few years ago my dad told me he'd had a relationship with a man in his 20s and he still thought about him often but couldn't pursue it as a black man in the early 70s. That one just makes me sad. He also used to smoke a lot of weed with Jimi Hendrix, which is much less sad.

Basically the 70s were a wild time overall for my parents."
41,"We were practicing safe sex. And I had a very irregular period. The first symptom was missed period but since I only get my period after a month or two, I wasnt worried. Second was loss of appetite. I loved eating and always had cheat days when working out, suddenly I stopped eating a lot and only ate cheese bagels and iced coffees everyday. I couldnt get through the day without coffee. I love coffee but this was just too much. I thought I was just tired from teaching and handling kids everyday and coffee gave me the energy I needed. Then I felt dead tired, I felt like I had the flu. My body was heavy and I felt really sick. I thought it was food poisoning because I ate street foods the day before I felt sick. Until one Monday morning I threw up everything. The only thing that I can drink without throwing up is brewed coffee. That's when I told my SO everything. And I said 'Damn I think I have the flu.'. My boyfriend was quiet on the phone before ""Babe, I think youre pregnant."" 

I laughed at first but then realize it was quite possible. He went to visit me and bought a generic pregnancy kit. Yep, positive.

Went to the doctor immediately and found out Im 8 weeks pregnant. Already on my 5th month right now. 

Apparently my baby loves coffee. "
42,"When I wear a flattering outfit and they shriek ""you look skinny!!"" as if it's the best compliment in the world."
43,"When I was a small kid learning gymnastics the teacher often commented that we had to hold our stomachs and butts in (standard and fair) because ""otherwise you look like bananas and boys don't like that"". Like excuse me? When did I say I wanted guys to like how I look in a leotard at freaking 7ish? Why should I care? Why should I ever care? Ffs.

Also turns out a lot of guys very much like breasts and butt out so she failed on that point too."
44,"When more than one person has to preface his interactions, more than like 2x/ year under extreme circumstances, with: ""That's not how he usually is. He must be really tired/ stressed/ under pressure/ drunk."" Yes, everyone has bad moods, but at a certain point, it's an M.O., not a mood or fluke. 

Related: when doing something that's not exactly their ""thing"" will make them pouty and sulky and not engage with the group. I have a friend whose BF is one of those ""above small-talk"" types that is really obnoxious unless the activity in question is a LAN party or beer tasting, or something that he likes. If it's not, he's a total wet blanket and will siiigggghhhh heavily in the corner, subtly pout, and have some issue that he needs her to address, until it's time to leave. "
45,"“Do you think you could ever see us dating”

“Yes I could”

And now we’re married "
46,"Can confirm. Had a rocky pregnancy (I shouldn't have survived to be honest.) And he basically just was like ""yup. This is fine. We are fine. We will get through this"".

I needed daily injections that I *couldn't* do to myself. He would sit with me for 30 minutes if needed to give me my injection every day because I was shit terrified of needles. We had a process and he never deviated from it. I would apologize for making him nearly late for work each time but he always said it was fine and he didn't care so long as I was safe and healthy.

We are now going through some major fertility issues having our second and I had a bad appointment today. Came home in tears and he just scooped me up and said "" we will get through this"" didn't question, didn't hesitate or anything. Even when I said if this next step fails we need to get aggressive which means potentially large amounts of money and large amounts of time off work he just responded with ""so we will save more money now and see where we are in a few months!""

Supporting your partner during the rough times is kind of a big deal."
47,"Being attracted to and preferring bad boys/aggressive alpha male types. There are many, many women who have zero attraction nor any kind of interest in even engaging with those kinds of men."
48,"I live in a series of male dominated hobbies/industries, which leads to a lot of frustrating sexism happening. The other week one of my clubmates made a snide comment about the fact that my gear bags etc are all bright pink. 

I turned around and said ""alright dude, if I'm gonna spend half my life in a male-dominated environment like this, the least I can do is have a pink bag if I want to. You do not get to make judgments about me based on my favourite colour."" 

To which he put his hands in the air and went ""woah, okay, sorry, do what you like"" which isn't *exactly* a victory but technically there was an apology in there."
49,"I was about 13 yo, participating as an artist in a local sidewalk chalk art competition in a park. It's August in the American southwest, so it's 100+°F and I'm wearing a tank top as I sit in the sun for hours working on my piece. For context, I'm very busty, and I developed early.

A woman comes by carrying a fancy camera, says she's from a local publication. She wants to take a picture of me working on my artwork! Great.

I'm sitting down on my piece of sidewalk, chalk pastels in hand. She squats beside me for a photo. She asks me to bend over my artwork a little and look really into it. I oblige, but she immediately notices that this gives her a perfect look down my shirt at my cleavage. This is when she indignantly shouts at me, a child: ""Woah, sit up a little! This isn't THAT kind of magazine!""

I still feel mad about it to this day. I, a 13 yo, instantly went from feeling proud of my hard work to ashamed of my body. She could have just calmly asked me to sit back up a little, but instead she felt the need to sexualize me."
50,"you've been through some kind of big event that has shaken your relationship to the core, and have shown commitment to making it through it together. marriage is about staying together no matter what.

(note, i'm talking stuff like deaths in families, serious illnesses, being a victim of a crime etc. NOT abuse or cheating)."
51,"A group of our friends were supposed to go see Iron Man in theaters. For some reason or another everyone canceled but the two of us. There was always silly flirting and banter between the two of us so we got over the initial awkward of hey it’s just us pretty quickly. After the movie, we grabbed dinner and just talked all night. Even after we went our separate ways, we texted all night. Now we’ve been married for seven years and looking back, I can’t thank our friends enough for canceling that day :)"
52,"I loathe the notion that you can't be ""girly"" AND smart/focused simultaneously."
53,"Yes, twice actually. Both my fault.

We started as fuck buddies after I got out of a long and serious relationship with my ex (he cheated and we broke up). Fuck buddy lived about 45 mins away and I had a very busy schedule between work and classes. Normally, saw each other on Sundays and spent the whole day together, sometimes with Sat night thrown in. We started catching feelings, this scared the fuck out of me and around the same time I was offered the opportunity to take a 2 year contract in Hawaii. I used this as my out. We did not talk for a couple of months, and I ended up not taking the job for an unrelated reason (I left the company as a whole). He messaged me out of the blue one night, and I realized I had feelings for him still and I must mean something to him, too if he'd reach out after all this time. So we rekindled and such, and a few months later I started to spook again. I wanted to break it off, and just live my life alone without an SO or any partners. (I have depression and it was a pretty dark time in my life. Lowest I've ever been.) I lived on my own and wasn't about to give all that up and make myself vulnerable again. I just wasn't ready for a commitment, despite my feelings, and it wasn't fair to him. Fast forward to some time later and we started talking *again.* 

By this time I realized I have been such an asshole, and I love him more than anything. I still regret what I did, and it still hurts me because he didn't deserve that at all. He's an incredible man. That was 6 years ago. 


Where is the relationship now?

Since then, I pulled my head out of my ass, we moved in together, got engaged, bought a house, and a year and a half later we married. Now, I'm 21 weeks pregnant with our first child, a boy, and we couldn't be happier. :)"
54,"Not me but my sister-in law was driving her friend home from a party because her friend started to have severe ""stomach cramps"". Her friend gave birth in the front seat of my sister-in law's car! She never knew she was pregnant. She was very obese to start with so she never noticed any unusual weight gain and I'm assuming she was on birth control or something that would have normally stopped her periods. The funny thing is that she has had a child before. It's hard to believe but it really does happen. "
55,I like the way it looks and feels. And it doesn’t take a huge amount of time. I don’t think it’s any of my business what other women do. 
56,Your mom is straight up my hero. What a Billie-Bad-Ass. When I grow up.... 
57,Anything by Margaret Atwood! 
58,"The one that comes to mind for me is going to get my legs sugared and while I like the woman that does it, I want to get my money’s worth and I don’t feel like shaving so it’s usually when my leg hair is long enough to pass for a man’s leg. She doesn’t have a problem with this, especially bc the sugar holds longer hairs better.

But just about EVERY time (I’ve gone around 3-4 times), she’ll say, “ooh I bet your husband is gonna feel your leg and say, ‘whoa, you feel like a woman again!’”

I know she doesn’t say it to be a jerk/try to convince me to come and pay up more often. She is rather young too. But my husband never thought I wasn’t a woman...so why would my legs make any difference? He’s more attracted to the shape of them than them being smooth anyway. It’s not like we get in bed and he runs his finger down my leg to check the texture. It’s just a strange comment that I’m kind of sick of."
59,"When you’re in the cute beginning stage where you want to know things about someone... if you ask questions, he/she answers but never asks you anything (nonsexual). Makes me bail immediately. "
60,"Yup. I have rosacea just on the tops of my cheeks. My sister in law thinks it’s very pretty. 


Im a physiotherapist and I too have gotten the dreaded “maybe you should wear way way less blush because you don’t wear any other makeup with it” snotty comment from a coworker. 


I simply said “I don’t wear blush” but this would have been such a better way to do it..."
61,"Ugh. I was in a restaurant with my brothers and bro's SO and the waitress complimented my hair, &amp; I complimented hers, and so naturally I was all smiles. My brother said it was all fake because women hate each other and all our compliments are backhanded. His SO and I had to explain that that's just a movie/tv trope."
62,"That all women can get dates whenever they want to.  Maybe if they're supermodel hot, but most of us aren't.  It's like when they think of women, they only think about conventionally attractive women, and those of us who are average-looking or below simply don't exist."
63,"Sex &amp; dates.

Logistically, I was crashing at his place after a beer festival &amp; I cuddled up to him on the couch. Then one thing led to another and we suddenly had a big sexy secret to keep from the rest of the friend group.

We started going on dates the following weekend &amp; just never stopped hanging out. We told our friends about 2 months in. One of them said, ""that makes sense."" The rest were a little surprised, but supportive."
64,"There was a guy in my AP Chemistry class who had a pink calculator (I think it was passed down from an older sister, but that didn’t really matter). A lot of the other guys in our class would make fun of him, and one day he just looked up really casually and said, “I guess I just don’t need a manly-colored calculator to reassure me that I have a penis” and went back to doing his homework.

The joking mostly died down after that."
65,"I haven't got any sent to just me, but also I haven't done any online dating and have my social media locked down."
66,I think you just like saying VaginaGoblin lol
67,"I think normally people only do this if they have mixed feelings about you. Like I had an ex who really cared about me as a person but didn’t feel like I was the one. So he didn’t break up with me but just got ridiculously demanding and every time I compromised and sorted things out with him then he made even more demands on me and criticised things about me.
If they don’t feel anything for you they’d just break up with you. So basically, the signs are criticising you, picking arguments and making demands without trying to resolve them and making minimum relationship effort."
68,Mine would've been when I realized that I would leave a man if he treated me the way my father treats my mother when they argue. 
69,"I'm still hesitant to have my legs or feet hangout over my bed. I like to be completely tucked in and covered in case a monster comes. It's not like I think it will happen, but something feels unsettled if I'm not tucked in. "
70,Unless you're making it to impress your friends/family/partner: Macarons. The taste to effort ratio is just not worth it. Holy shit are they fickle af. 
71,"We really got to be friends by talking about comics at a coffeeshop. Months later, I already knew he had a crush on me. We spent lots of time together, we knew everything about each other. We got drunk and slept together, I thought it was a mistake at first; I was trying really hard to take a year to just work on myself. Asked to still keep it platonic. So we did. He said he'd rather keep me as a friend than lose me, but he wouldn't stop caring about me. Things went on as they were: I picked him up from work to hang out. We texted in the dead of night. We spent hours together just talking. Then something clicked for me while we were in the car together. I said out loud ""DAMNIT, we're dating aren't we?"" He said yup. We get married in two weeks. "
72,"Well there was the one where I walked in the bathroom and the bride and 3/4 of the bridesmaids were doing lines of cocaine off the sink. 

The groom spent his entire time outside with his buddies drinking beer after beer and chain smoking. And then people got drunk and started tearing the venue apart (the best man ran into a wood bannister at full speed to knock it over, people were throwing glasses everywhere, etc). 

Oh and the bride’s brother came up to everyone in the wedding party (my then boyfriend was a groomsmen) and said they all needed to fork over $200 because they were going to pay for the photographer for the couple. This was about halfway through the reception. BF opened our card to give him the $200 that we were planning to give in the card and the brother said “oh you should still give a regular gift in your card, this is additional”. 

Also, I didn’t have a place card or a place to sit at the wedding. The bride claimed she made a mistake but she actively despised me. BF and I had been dating for four years at that point. The groom managed to make some room for me but the bride threw a fit when I sat next to my then boyfriend because then her friend that was trying to hook up with my boyfriend which the bride had purposely sat next to him at that table didn’t have a place to sit. I was sent to another table in the back. BF switched to sit next to me which angered the bride a ton. 

Needless to say they were divorced within two months, my “then boyfriend” and I have been together for nine years and married for almost two years. "
73,"I loved him very much.  We lived together and wanted to get married.  But.  He was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic and I did not want to live that kind of life.  I thought perhaps without the responsibility of providing for another person, he could get a handle on his problems.
I have no idea where he is now.
We did not reconcile.
I do not regret the decision.
I am completely happy."
74,"My dad apparently has gone to jail several times, for the crime of refusing to pay his traffic tickets, no less.  Also driving without a license because his license was revoked due to unpaid tickets.  He thinks traffic tickets are a government conspiracy to make money and won't pay them until he has to to get out of jail.  All it's done is lost him more time and money in the long run, but he's still doing it 'til this day.  There were a couple ""business trips"" my mom said he was on when I was a kid, where he was really in jail."
75,That we all want to get married and have babies. 
76,"My dad once smoked weed with Aerosmith before they were famous.

He grew up in a city with a lot of famous people. He’s friends with Eli Roth and my aunt once went on a date with Matt LeBlanc."
77,"We met freshman year of college and became pretty good friends towards the end of that year and throughout the summer before sophomore year. He’s naturally flirty and just a good human and in the back of my head I was thinking, “Wow, he’d make a great boyfriend.” 

During sophomore year our friends were making bets on whether we would get together soon because we were getting increasingly flirty around each other. One night we had a sleepover with all our friends and I decided to share a bed with him. He kissed me when it was dark. I liked it. One thing led to another and thus began our relationship.

We kept it from our friends for about a week because we didn’t want them to win the bet. At the end they found out by watching us make out through a window (it was terrifying to open my eyes and see someone staring at us). The person who bet on us was so happy he predicted it that he gave us the money that he had won. It was a winning situation.

He and I are approaching a year together and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been :)"
78,"I'm 4'11'' and I've been told I *should* wear heels. I disagree. I value comfort and heels aren't for me. Wear whatever footwear you like, fuck what other people think."
79,"that we're nags - nope, If we're 'nagging' you it's because the apartment looks like a third world country and you didn't notice/care for days and after multiple reminders to do your half of the chore wheel and this is the last ditch effort to get through to you.  



So when she nags you, what she's really saying is something like:



 ""are you really so bad at adulting that you can't clean the dishes in the sink or do you just not give a sh@t?!  I mean if you weren't learning the basics of adulting this whole time, then what have you been doing with your whole adult life exactly!?  OR are you just being purposely incompetent so that I have to do your work because you don't care about me?  Also, it's become increasingly more challenging for me to be sexually attracted to a man who A. is playing the role of my child, and B. seemingly doesn't care for me."""
80,Great relationship advice from the great Ron Swanson: Don't mistake drama for happiness.
81,"I don't know if this is a perfect system, but I monitor myself for signs of deteriorating mental health, and watch for situations likely to exacerbate my mental health concerns, and take that as a signal to be vigilant about self-care. It's much easier when you catch it early."
82,"She had a girlfriend in high school, so being bi runs in the family I guess.

Before he met my mom, my dad got a hooker pregnant overseas and married her."
83,I’d watch that. 
84,"Been told by a manager I should 'stick to what I know - like typing'.

I used to work for an engineering firm. They were discussing the best ways to fireproof something. I jokingly said I'd heard of this new thing called Asbestos. It was an obvious joke.

10 minutes later he couldn't get his computer to work. Big panic. He'd tried everything. We put new batteries in the wireless mouse etc. Turns out the cleaner had turned it off at the wall and he hadn't checked.

I was like, 'Should I still stick to what I know? Because you couldn't even turn your fucking computer on.'"
85,"My mum secretly saved up and bought a motorbike when she was 17, storing it at a friend's house to keep it hidden. One day she was out riding when she skidded and fell off the bike, and cracked her two front teeth. She had to confess to her mother who took her to a dentist to get it fixed. But she was too scared to tell her father and he literally never found out. He passed away a few years ago, never knowing that his daughter had dentures. Or a motorbike."
86,If they always interrupt you/talk over you/don’t listen to what you say. First step in making you feel worthless.
87,Way too common. One of my sisters is openly a lesbian and even she gets them sometimes. 
88,"Honestly I think you can't win either way. Whether or not you perform femininity is just background noise for people who want to and frequently do disrespect women. Making that sort of performative behaviour (makeup, fashion, etc.) both a necessity and a reason to tear women down keeps us a little off balance and that's how you control people. 

In my life it's ranged from being considered incompetent and silly for being conventionally attractive and interested in fashion, to having men tell me I'd better shave my legs so I don't come across as a lesbian, which they considered a prime insult. 

It's been particularly bad in academia, which is part of the reason why I'm not involved in it anymore. I'd be told I was too pretty to worry about my subject matter and at the same time my supervisor would get complaints from honest to god adult men about my skirts being too short. Fortunately he was really good about it, otherwise I could have had a serious issue. "
89,"My boyfriend’s one made me laugh when I read it properly (I actually went left the first time I saw him) it was ‘not looking for anything serious, just a wife or something’"
90,"Met up with a guy for the first time from a site. Just a brief get together/chat(not a date). While we talked outside a store he got a phone call from a friend and  flat out lied to him about where was and what he was doing. There were no feelings of guilt after his friend hung up. If he can lie to his friends that casually, he'll probably have no qualms about lying to you as well.
 
He also said he was proud of me for waiting until I was in my 20s to engage in sexual activity. It was a rare thing to find girls who didn't put out so easily at our age and he respected me for it. (Wtf? but whatever, maybe he's just young and awkward.).  20min after I left, he sent me a text asking if I could give him blowjob. 

So lying without a care in the world and holding weird sexual double standards has problems written all over it."
91,"Am OP, can confirm."
92,"Used to be 30lbs overweight, lost about 60lbs and am now quite thin.

I always hated people telling me I had a ""pretty face."" It's backhanded but plausibly deniable, because they *could* just be giving you an innocent compliment about having nice facial features, right? So it's not like you can really call it out or say anything about it. But now that I'm skinny, literally no one *ever* says this to me. When people give me looks-based compliments, they never specifically exclude my body anymore."
93,"Once I became a wife I saw my dad through the eyes of a married woman Irealized that the way he treated my mom was so wrong.

Once I became a mother and saw my mom through the eyes of a mom I realized that the way she treated me was so abusive."
94,"That guy could've been like a serial killer lol 

""High my name's Ted and I eat newborn babies."" "
95,"&gt;For some reason or another everyone canceled but the two of us

96,"I think the thing that surprised me most was the reason my actual hermit mother left the woods - she was formerly a very well established belly dancer in the area, and some Sultan from somewhere was coming to visit and her old troupe leader sweet talked her into returning to lead the final week of shows.

I saw videos years ago of her performing for a crowd, the picture of sensuality and confidence, and it blew my mind. "
97,"A friend of mine from high school met a guy through an online version of Prison Penpals while he was doing time for sexual assault of a minor.

Within a couple weeks of him getting out of prison, she was pregnant. This would be his 5th kid with 4 different women. They got married at a barbecue joint a few months later and her dad wouldn't speak to anyone at the reception because he was so pissed that this was happening.

They got divorced a couple months after the baby was born, and I think the bride's dad was much more excited to pay for the divorce than the wedding."
98,"I'm not going near the macaron craze. They taste good, but not good enough for that effort.

I've made pasta from scratch and it depends on the type and what you want. With a pasta maker, basic linguini from scratch can be worth while. Stuffed pasta from scratch is usually not worth the time.

Good ramen and pho depend on getting the broth right. Generally not worth it for small batches at home."

100,"Definitely not. They have both been married and divorced multiple times since they were married to each other. I always joke that my family is like trailer trash with money. I love them all, but they are absolutely insane. "
101,"In my experience, marriage is an educated gamble with varying levels of risk. You just try to make the most informed choice based on feelings and compatibilities. "
102,"That women have low libidos, or at least not nearly as high of a libido as men. That teenage boys have a libido through the roof but no way that could be true for a teenage girl. I don't know if it's because they think they can just randomly think about sex any time of day but women only think about it when they turn us on, or what.

Also, thinking that just because of the mere mention of sex we are going to be turned on and ready to go, because that's how it works for them as an individual or for men as a whole. 

Blanket generalizations surrounding sex and libido due to being a male or female, as opposed to individuals, to sum it up.

Oh, and that all feminist are lesbians or asexual beings who hate men."
103,"for YEARS, my mom was convinced that makeup was only for stupid girls. I’ve mostly trained it out of
her, but I think it’s because people criticized her a lot for not being feminine enough when she was younger. for example, her coworkers used to snipe at her, a woman with a doctorate, about wearing makeup, a skirt suit and heels to work.
she’s now actually interested in learning how to wear makeup (despite being absolutely TERRIFIED of mascara), but not after years of criticizing me for liking it."
104,This makes me so sad to read. I'm glad you got out of that relationship and I hope you've found someone more deserving of you.
105,We work together as a team; if there is a problem we tackle it together whether that's taking action or talking about something. We have no resentment or jealous feelings towards one another because usually if something benefits one of us it benefits the other even if it's just the pleasure of seeing the other happy. Even after 7 years we are still both stupidly happy to see one another after work. We obviously have spats but usually about the stupid things; bigger issues get discussed and I think that's important to be able to do. 
106,"Not VaginaGoblin but I have siblings with aspergers. Most social things are not realizing what they say is mean, they dont realize when to end the conversation or debate, and cant realize when they're annoying someone or boring them. They dont pick on body language or certain key phrases like most people can. Idk what VaginaGoblin experiences but these are pretty common traits I've noticed "
107,"My husband has high-functioning autism. I love him.Autistic people need love too, they have feelings too. And if you're willing to listen and work on stuff with them and are patient, it's no different than a neurotypical relationship. In fact, I think it's a better pay off. I know he loves me and sure, sometimes arguments get intense because he just cannot get what I'm trying to say, or doesn't understand empathy and stuff (I'm too empathetic tbh). We're total opposites in that way. But, we learned to appreciate and understand and love each other's strengths and 'weaknesses'.

I would do it again and again and again and again."
108,"I carry almost all my weight in my stomach and my arms, legs, and face are thin by comparison.  So many people ask me when I’m due or even touch me.  I used to get embarrassed but now I just look them dead in the eye and say I’m not or ask why they are grabbing my fat.  Watching the horror wash over their face is fun.  My motto is ‘If they are uncomfortable with how I look, they can look somewhere else.’  "

111,“You just haven’t had sex with the right guy yet. Here’s a picture of my dick to change your mind”
112,"When I was very pregnant with my son (around 38 weeks), I went out in shorts, a tank top, and flip flops because it’s New Mexico and it’s hotter than hell in March (and just all year in general and I was pregnant so extra hot). I felt cute! Then I had someone ask me, “what’s the point in flaunting your legs when you’re already pregnant? It’s useless to find a mate now.” 🙄 I am happily married, and my husband and I don’t wear wedding bands because of our jobs (food industry for me and he’s a scientist). But like. Maybe I was just super pregnant and super hot in the fucking desert and wanted to be cool?? Maybe I wasn’t trying to tickle your pickle??"
113,"I replied to a comment in a thread where a guy was feeling insecure about his SO wearing revealing clothing, explaining that I too enjoy wearing revealing clothing from time to time even though I have an SO (because getting dolled up and pretty for a party is fun yada yada). Later I get a DM from a guy saying something like ""Stop wearing revealing clothing and show some respect for your dad"". I was honestly shocked, tried arguing back for a bit but quickly realised we're probably from different cultures and it was a lost case. Blocked."
114,"""Ugh women never tell us what they are thinking and expect us to read their minds!""

Woman: ""nothing""


Man: ""ugh c'mon tell me!"" 


Woman: ""im upset you haven't done any of your chores this week when you said you would""


Man: ""ugh stop nagging me!""


Women have been conditioned through their unequal relationships to not speak their mind as they get berated for it and called names (nag) when they do. "
115,"That there has to be an underlying reason why a woman doesn't like another woman, i.e we must be jealous, feel threatened by them, anything other than just not liking them as a person. "

117,"My son was about 4 and would not stop slamming his bedroom door. After various talkings-to, timeouts, and such didn’t convince him to stop slamming the door, he lost door privileges. I calmly told him exactly that... having a door is a privilege and he didn’t deserve one. Then I pulled the hinge pins and removed the door. He was without a door for at least 3 weeks. Honestly, it was really annoying for me and Husband during that time, as we had to be a lot quieter after his bedtime. Also, the cats would pester him during the night because he couldn’t shut them out.

He’s 9 now and almost never slams doors. "
118,"I don’t get it either. I once went out with my boyfriend for drinks and decided that I felt like looking nice that evening. As I was getting dressed I asked my boyfriend which dress was better, which socks, etc. When we got to the bar a girl (obviously interested in my boyfriend) came up to us and started mocking my outfit, how silly it was that I tried so hard, I guess she thought she could get my boyfriend on her side or something. But jokes on her, my boyfriend picked out my tall socks and thinks I look pretty. "

122,"Not me, but my mom (pregnant with my little sister). She was on the pill and didn’t have a single symptom of pregnancy. She was getting what she *thought* was her period every month, but later learned that it was a small placenta bleed or something that mimicked her period pattern. She has always had back problems, so when it was feeling worse than usual for a while, she goes to the doctor to see what’s going on, and that’s when he asks her if she’s knows that she’s 7 months pregnant. That was a BIG no. We figured we had at best 2 months to prepare for a baby, which was relatively easy since she’s done it before. Sister came early, I mean, early as in 3 weeks after my mom found out she was pregnant, she was giving birth. She came so fast that she even got to go to her own baby shower, at a whole 9 days old."

129,"This one reminds me of an askmen thread I read years ago where all the guys were saying confidence is unattractive in a woman. They kept telling me that for men, confidence is earned, but for women confidence is just vanity.  It made my head spin, because they tell each other to be confident to attract ladies...

-edit to add-

In that thread I kept questioning them what they meant by that. They all explained to me that confidence= overconfidence. So wen I asked why they didn’t just say overconfidence was a turnoff, they would say that women were the ones equivocating confidence with overconfidence."

136,"I did not just know at all, and I hated hearing that because it only made me feel MORE unsure (since I didn't). I had no gut feeling. I am naturally a very indecisive person and never feel confident in any decision, big or small - so knowing that about myself now, I understand it's unlikely I'd ever have felt like this about marrying anyone (despite imagining I would and I was missing out on that magical feeling).

Basically, how I decided to look at it was - this is just a choice in life, like anything else. Once my choice was made, it was up to me to not look back or dwell on the path not taken. At the crossroads of deciding, I had no real idea how my life would go either way. Maybe if I didn't marry my husband, I'd date around and meet someone better; or maybe I'd end up with someone who cheated on me and broke my heart. Maybe if I did marry him, he'd have to move for a job and I'd resent him for having to put my needs and career backseat to uproot my life; or maybe we'd have a wonderful life together. Point being, there's a lot you can't control outside of your own attitude and mindset. 

So the question came down to - if I did decide to marry him, did I think he would help me be happy with my/our life? Is he the type of guy to figure out things together with me when they get tough, or our situation changes? Is he the type to listen to me if I do end up resentful, or dissatisfied, or struggling, and do his best to lift me up? Or is he the type that will leave me to figure things out on my own, or blame me if he's struggling. While he isn't without faults, I knew in my heart he's a good man committed to a life with me, and so I just took the leap despite not ""knowing with my gut"".  I'm so happy I did. Having that certainty that no matter what, we're there for each other...not having one foot out the door...it's added a depth to my life that I had no idea could exist. But I only really figured that out after feeling massive anxiety over a commitment this big which didn't go away really until the deed was done."
137,"For me, it's GOT to be that the ""size"" of your vagina/shape of your labia = how much sex you've had. It's seriously worrying the amount of men that believe this is true.

Mate, it's not a pair of leather shoes that can be broken in with constant wear! Labia come in all shapes, sizes, and colours and you can in no way estimate a person's sexual past by how ""tight"" they are. By that logic, everyone in the world's arseholes should be gigantic gaping chasms by the time they're in their 20s due to the amount of big phallic-looking turds that have been shoved through there.

138,"Hubby and I wanted to start a family, so we weren't using contraception, but I have PCOS. I went 18 months without having a period, during which time I had several blood tests which confirmed I wasn't ovulating, so we were put on the waiting list to try fertility treatment. Whilst we were still waiting, hubby and I both came down with the flu, throwing up, aching muscles, coughing, sneezing, the works. After a week or so, hubby recovered but I was still tired and sickly. It was coming up to the millennium, so I was desperately hoping to be better for the big celebrations. As it turned out, I couldn't face any alcohol and fell asleep on the sofa, missing the whole thing. A couple of days later, I was still throwing up, so I went to the doctor. Turns out I was 9 weeks pregnant."
139,"Honestly, unless you're making it for a crowd, sushi (I'm talking specifically about makizushi because that's what I know best). It's really not difficult but prepping the ingredients (i.e. cutting up the filler ingredients, making and cooling the rice) is time consuming. Recently, a friend asked if I wanted to make sushi together for fun at her place since she had never done it before. I agreed. Hours later (and several rolls later because we had so many filler ingredients to use up), my friend said, ""I'd rather pay $20 at a sushi restaurant.""

Also, for me personally, macarons. The heating in my oven is uneven and can be temperamental, but you really do need even heating to ensure your macaron shells don't crack. Consequently, I always end up with a few cracked shells, and considering you need 2 shells to make 1 macaron, the yield per batch is pityingly low. In the same amount of time, I could whip up a couple dozen cupcakes and decorate them nicely. One Christmas, I made it a thing to make little boxes of macarons for some close friends (about 9 macarons per box) and it took me *days*. Never again. I will make macarons if a close friend or family member requests it for a special occasion, but I don't really make them casually or for fun anymore."

143,"&gt; Random dudes are never on the list of people I wish to impress or attract

This is everything.  Though everything else you said is spot on.  "
144,"That woman is full of hurt and regrets. Be happy you are not her.

If we do ever catch ourselves being jealous of another woman, we are human and it happens, we should just that as fuel to analyze what about our life we are unhappy with. "
145,"I used depo pro era, and had the shot every 3 months or so. I was pretty depressed at the time, my boyfriend had just died, so I was always really fatigued and slept 12 hours a day. Never felt great, didn’t eat much. Then when I did eat I threw it back up. Sometimes I would throw up without even eating, just water. I thought it was like a manifestation of how stressed and anxious and depressed I was. I started to feel bloated a lot, my stomach was firmer (I thought because I wasn’t eating and was throwing up what I did eat), I had constant heart burn. There were times where I felt like I couldn’t breathe out all the way, which is a frustrating feeling. It wasn’t until I could feel just how hard my stomach was that I realized what was up. I think if I had someone in my life at the time it would have been obvious when I was randomly throwing up, but I was so depressed and tired and sick feeling *all the time,* that it just felt like one more thing. Like great I can’t go a day without crying, can’t get off the couch, can hardly eat, *and* I’m now throwing up, when will it end??

Didn’t realize until 5.5 months in, a little over 4 months after my boyfriend died."
146,"Dad helped Mom break into her own house. She was a ""latchkey kid,"" with a long list of chores and homework to do. And she'd locked herself out. (And she couldn't wait around for Grandma or Grandpa to get back; there would be hell to pay if that stuff wasn't done, regardless of *why* it wasn't done.) So Dad (who was her next door neighbor) went in through one of the basement windows to get her inside. "
147,Wow that's pretty damn slick.
148,"When my mom was chatting with some old high school flame behind my Dad's back. She even went so far as to set up a date with this guy. I told her that's fucked up and she needs to talk to Dad if she's feeling lonely and unfulfilled, not go to some random dude.

My Dad has carried her through all of life's ups and downs and he deserves way better than that.

My Dad is an amazing person &amp; I've never lost any respect for him. "
149,"When I was a teenager, I went to a wedding that had local businesses as ""sponsors"". They made announcements about it and featured them in the bulletin. I thought it was a little weird."
150,"All these pie crust comments hurt my soul! To each their own, of course, but I always prefer a homemade pie or tart crust. 

I'll say mousse. It's *so good* from scratch but it's so hard to make. Just use the powdered mousse stuff if you want to make it. The alternative is a nightmare unless you're super dedicated to doing it. 

**Edit:** Alright I get it; mousse is easy for loads of you. Rub it in. :)"
151,"When I was in school I was sat across this tiny little girly girl. I wasn't a complete tomboy but I was hyperactive and on the school football team which was mixed and I didn't watch myself in trying to look delicate. Anyway, one day I was rubbing my eye with the base of my palm/thumb, and she was horrified. ""Girls don't rub their eyes like that!! You're meant to do it like this!!"", she then proceeded to demonstrate the ""girl way"" by rubbing the side of her index finger on her eye and then blinking prettily. 20 years later I still haven't forgotten that bizarre WTF moment. "
152,Kids and babies. But they failed. I still do not like being around kids and babies and I show zero interest in looking at photos of them.
153,When his relationships with friends and family are erratic and he changes his opinions about people quickly and often. That kind of thing means he could put you on his shit list for any reason at any time. 
154,"The LOOKS! I guess every overweight/obese woman knows what I'm talking about. 

I'm eating in public? - There will be at least a couple of people that have a disgusting look in their face saying that I better shouldn't eat.

I'm having fun in public? - How dare I? I'm fat and should be at home feeling bad and losing weight until I'm thin and ""allowed"" to lead a ""normal"" life. 

Basically whatever I'm doing in public gets me those ""looks"" as if I'm not good enough to participate in public life and that I should better stay at home until I'm thin/worthy enough in their eyes to come out again. 
"
155,This thread is my version of /r/nosleep 
156,"yep. i hung out with a couple of coworkers a few weeks ago and i ended up finding out one of them was a redpiller/MGTOW-er. he said something along those lines, and i was like, “so all of these male shooters are driven by, what? not emotion? not anger at something/someone?” and he explained how men’s emotions are slow-burning and build up and women see puppies and instantaneously react like “OMG HOW CUTE IT’S A PUPPY!!!!!11” 🙄"
157,Too fucking common. I could open a fucking gallery with how many I've received. No one would attend that though.
158,"It happens very rare but I get this with color pink sometimes. I can dress black, white, blue, grey from head to toe and nobody has a comment to make about it. But when I do the same with pink, some people take me less seriously and there's some infantalizing comment/look about this. How bizarre it is we almost gave personas to COLORS and no doubt pink getting seen as silly is about misogyny."
159,"Hands down, having large breasts. When I was growing up, there was always a fuss about covering them up and making sure I didn’t have cleavage. My school teachers and administrators harangued me and other large-chested classmates because we were “distracting the boys.” Our principal actually enacted a rule about “no form-fitting shirts”, which of course, only applied to those of us who weren’t flat-chested. One time, a large-chested classmate was wearing the *same* high-collared shirt as her flat-chested friend, but was forced to change because it was too form fitting.

When I became an adult, my breasts were perky enough in my 20s that I was constantly asked if they were fake. When I took this as insult, I was told I should be flattered that someone would think they were fake. 

My first professional job was in the conservative U.S. South, and once again, colleagues (male and female) saw fit to give me a hard time if I wore anything that didn’t resemble a loose-fitting potato sack. Anytime I wore a professional dress to work, an older, female colleague would say a variation of, “Oh, do you have a date after work today/Are you going to Happy Hour?” I remember seeing a very thin colleague wear a sweater dress that I also happened to own to work one day. Because of my curves, I knew I couldn’t, in a million years wear something like that without catching sh*t.

Now that I’m older, the thing I hate most looking back is that I actually looked pretty good, but was shamed so much that I hated my body. Every now and then something will be in the news about girls getting harassed in schools for their clothing and it makes me sick that our society still does this to them."
160,"Not quite the same, but I’ve got rather sunken in eye sockets and tend to have really dark circles under my eyes. No amount of sleep will make them go away. I once had someone ask me why I put make up on to make it look like I’ve got dark circles under my eyes. I looked at him in utter confusion, why would anyone do that? And what business is it of yours if they do?. "
161,"In a similar vein, the assumption that women want men with bulging muscles/hyper-masculine bodies. I love a skinny dude with no pecs."
162,"We were long distance and I couldn't deal with it. 

He responded by stalking me, accusing me of cheating, blackmailing me with nudes and threatened to assault my male friends and coworkers. That killed any love I had QUICK. It was an insane switch to extremely controlling and paranoid behavior. 

He emails me twice a year (Christmas and anniversary) to tell me how I ruined his life and insult me. Last I heard he has a house and a gf and they make fun of me together. 

We broke up 5 years ago. XD some people gotta stay bitter "
163,I found out my mom was 'given' to my dad and his first wife at fourteen. He always made it sound like her took her in benevolently and cared for her but nope. They weren't religiously weird or anything either; he's just nasty.
164,"I agree with this, the first time I heard about the question of ""what do women want"" I was so confused. Like, which women? What are they doing at the moment? Some of them might be hungry; Some women might want more money or more friends... I was only 9 so not being deliberately feminist. I just didn't understand the question"
165,Being ignored.
166,"When they say “ughhhh I’m having a fat day, I feel so ugly” then look at me and say “no offence”.
Also, I have pcos so I’m trying to lose weight to ease the symptoms. My mum always says to me, “just think how gorgeous you’ll be when you lose that weight”.
"
167,"Invited but didn’t go.  It was a 2-day ‘wedfest’ with ‘guests’ expected to work catering shifts on day 2.  Different people were invited to different days, so the guest list was very blatantly tiered.  Plus constant begging emails saying “you don’t have to work a shift but please remember to sign up for one and also please pay for our two honeymoons!”."
168,"Putting salt in other people’s sugar doesn’t make yours any sweeter. I wish way more people understood that. 

Hopefully she lets go of whatever she’s holding onto. Must be a miserable person to be so unnecessarily rude. "
169,"There's some stuff that I've found was actually more expensive making from scratch rather than buying. Like pesto. The amount of basil you need to make even a small amount is crazy. It is a lot yummier but I feel bad guzzling down multiple basil plants just to make one pasta dish.

But generally I'd make everything from scratch as far as possible. I love baking bread, making pie crusts, I make my own sausages, cure my own meat... if you enjoy it then it's worth it."
170,"I am actually on the autism spectrum. I have dated my ex who was also autistic. We broke up for reasons unrelated to autism. The relationship was hard, but I think half of it had to do with distance issues. It would be hypocritical for me to say that I wouldn't date someone that's autistic when I am myself. I would date someone who was autistic again if I was single, but I am married to a NT husband who does his best to understand and accept autism. "
171,"What classics do you like? Women have been being published for longer than you'd expect! (I recently learned that the earliest named author that we know of was a woman, a Sumerian priestess named Inheduana).

If you enjoy 19th century literature (my favorite time period, so the main one I have recommendations for), I've loved just about everything I've read by Jane Austen, the Brontës (if you're interested in grim realism, Anne is especially good), Maria Edgeworth, Sofia Khvoschinskaya, George Eliot, and George Sand, off the top of my head. 

The Diary of Anne Frank is another favorite of mine - not only a look into a horrifying historical period, but also a really relatable story about becoming a teenage girl. 

Naomi Alderman's recent novel The Power is a sci-if exploration of the experience of being a woman particularly in regards to the almost subconscious fears of living in a word in which men have historically held the power. But also just a very entertaining book. 

Could possibly recommend more if you say what kind of books you already like! 
"
172,"That everyone agrees that they are attractive.

I used to think that everyone I was interested in was out of my league because if *I* was interested in them, then obvious *everyone* was interested in them and they had their pick of the litter."
173,"Are your parents still together?

Mom seems like a fighter."
174,"I'm not supermodel hot -- I'm overweight, and overall average in appearance. That said, I can absolutely get a date whenever I want. The question is: is it a date I want to go on? Probably not. Probably it will be someone who didn't bother to brush his hair (much less shower). Based on my experiences (and this is with guys I actually try to do some vetting of beforehand), odds are he'll check at least two of these traits: 

- Shitty job
- Smoker
- Chip on his shoulder about women
- Uncontrolled mental illness
- Drinking problem
- criminal record

Probably he won't shut up the whole time, and will assume I had an awesome time. He may make allusions to our future relationship. 

So... sure, I could get a date most nights out of the week. But that doesn't mean it would be a *fun* date with a legit potential partner."
175,"My aunt married an abusive drug lord. I was too young to remember all the details but his teen daughter was dressed in a red dress with a split right up to... well, it left little to the imagination. And at the reception the best man read a poem about how all women are prostitutes. 

The marriage was annulled very shortly after."
176,"That everything we do is for their attention.

No, it really isn't. I'm not wearing that dress or my hair this way or whatever else for the attention of men. Even when single, on a regular basis I'm truly just not thinking of any man's opinion on how I look or how they might perceive my interests. "
177,"I will never be “good enough” ...

But I’ll be damned if I didn’t get a lot of small things done today. 


I’m a failure in the big picture...

But cleaning the kitchen, working on a project, and getting my work uniform clean and ironed make me feel otherwise.

Baby steps.

Small things.

I’m not going to fix all of the mistakes overnight, but- I can keep my life held together one small piece at a time.

"
178,"We got married after 8 years together. Not much changed.

If you last that long and you're still happy together, get married, don't get married, it's your choice.

Now I wouldn't recommend marrying someone you're not living with. People are different when you live with them."
179,"I asked one of my colleagues why he did this once, told him it wasn't appropriate for him to dictate how people react to the world or to him.  Turned out he was a bit damaged himself, felt that he had to be the funny one who cheered everyone up.  

I felt sorry for him.

Still it was wildly inappropriate for him to insist that a child cheer up and smile.  The kid had just told me his dad had died.  "
180,"So, basically I was feeling kind of unattractive after all of my friends went home with guys after a night of clubbing. I don't really like clubs, and I had never had a one night stand, and wasn't planning on it, but they all went home with someone and I got home feeling bummed, despite the fact that's not my style at all. I ended up taking sexy pictures to make myself feel better, and after a while of too much emotion and being ""stuck"" in my apartment, I decided to send them to a guy. He was the one in my phone that I knew a bit, and seemed nice enough to be respectful and appreciative. Then it turned out I wasn't even OP"
181,I was pulled into a closet by my church pastor and his wife when I was 12 or 13.  They told me my shirt was too revealing for Sunday school and that I was distracting their sons.  It was a hoodie with a tank top underneath and I was a fucking child who didn’t even have breasts yet.  It was my first reality check/wake up call that people are sexist assholes.  They made me sit in the hallway on a bench until my mom arrived and I ended up walking home and never went to church again.  I remember feeling so nauseated for the rest of the week. 
182,Sounds like depression.
183,"Absolutely, it's like they think ""emotional"" = ""crying."" I have never once heard a guy with a temper get called emotional. "
184,"Yes, me too. I always wore As and Bs until I learned to measure myself. 34D. My husband sees my bras, I've shown him the tags. He knows they fit. Still insists that I'm not really a D because Ds are big, and I'm not. "
185,"He started revealing things that he knew would turn me away from him - his worst insecurities, while muttering that I was probably going to leave him. I, on the other hand, was flabbergasted and was open to compromise. 

He also stopped sharing things with me, flaked on going out, left me in the dark for days, and when he did talk, our conversations were very superficial &amp; shallow. 

This after 2-3 months of being an attentive, upbeat boyfriend who always wanted to talk &amp; hang out. 

The change was very disappointing. "
186,"Not my parents, but I dated someone whose parents dated another swingers couple, the two sets of parents fell in love with the other set of parents, got divorced, and married the other set of parents. i.e.  Dad A, Mom A and Dad B, Mom B, both got divorced and then got married as Dad A, Mom B, and Dad B,  Mom A.  There were 4-5 kids involved.  I don't know if the ABs or the BAs had kids of their own."
187,"Oh yeah. The next, like, half a day was a wild ride, and she ended up getting pretty sick. Said it was totally worth it and she'd do it again in a heartbeat to avoid the felony charge, though!"
188,It's a shame cause growing up I thought my mom was a bad mom cause she wasn't at home baking cookies and shit for us like the ones on tv and I regret not appreciating her more. I only realized how strong she was later in life. Now desperately trying to make up for it every day though :)
189,"My aunt is about 6’2 and always wears heels because “I’m already taller than everyone else anyway, so why does it matter?”"
190,"I can only speak for myself, but -   
  
I don't like being compared to other women, even in a flattering manner. ""You're [blank], not like other women"", etc. It doesn't make me feel special, which I think is the goal of the comment, it makes me think they don't have female friends or have baggage with women, because it's always something that is common in my experience, like being funny or knowledgeable about a topic.  
  
I don't like degradation, choking, or name-calling in the bedroom (like slut, bitch, etc). Some guys seem to think that is universally appealing to women, and while I know some like it, it's a massive turn off for me (and choking is an absolute dealbreaker).  
  
I don't like some stereotypical ""girly"" gifts like teddy bears, heart shaped jewelry, chocolates. I have no use or attachment to stuffed animals at all, they will go in a closet. I don't wear heart shaped jewelry, and I'm not a big fan of chocolate in general. I like other ""girly"" things like flowers though! But I prefer fruit-based treats over chocolate and am pretty particular about jewelry. "
191,"I used to work the bar at a number of weddings. Whilst I wasn’t a guest there were a number of trashy weddings I was at.
- There was one where the groom got so drunk he had to be put to bed at like 9? The bride got super upset (she was pretty drunk too) and spend an hour crying in the bathroom about it.
- The one where the bridesmaids all wore these strapless dresses that were really short. Like you could pretty much see the bottom of their ass cheeks short. And showed off way too much boob. They were light turquoise as well and 2 bridesmaids wore black g-strings that you could clearly see through the dresses. Some of the men were pretty handsy with the bridesmaids as well
- The one where it turned out that the groom had slept with the all of the bridesmaids at some point in time
- The one where it turned out (so the drunk MoH told me, whilst I was washing my hands in the bathroom) that the bride was sleeping with the grooms much more attractive younger brother (who was his best man). However the groom was making a lot more money that the best man.
- Finally the grooms divorced father was caught screwing the brides moms twin sister in a cupboard (do if it’s *that* trashy as loss of people hook up at weddings)

EDIT: There were defo more than just these 5, but they’re the ones that sprang to mind when I wrote the comment, lol."
192,"I've been a bit on the heavier side my whole life, but in the past couple years it's gotten really out of control. What really annoys me is when people 'pretend' that I'm not heavy. There's a couple ways this comes about. An example is if they ask where I got a shirt or something and I tell them it's from a store that only sells plus size. They'll say, ""what? Plus size? Why do you shop there? You don't look like plus size!"" I do look plus size. I am aware that I need to work on my body. Pretending otherwise is not as nice as they think it is. I am actively working on my body and pretending that I don't need to change is almost pitying. It makes it seem like they think I will fail, or what's worse, that they thought that I'm oblivious to my own size. It's hard to explain, but it would be better if they just said something like ""Oh, okay. That's a bummer, I really wanted to get one, it's a really cute top.""
"
193,You can’t be honest with us because we’ll get upset/ fly off the handle at the smallest thing. I definitely get more upset when I find out you lied to me rather than telling me what was actually up. 
194,"Ahaha yeah this. And also the related myth, that women get all kinds of free stuff just for being women. Maybe super conventionally hot women do, but most of us aren’t super hot women. 

"
195,"All their pictures were mirror selfies of them brushing their teeth. Their bio said ""And I floss too."""
196,I had a friend who was extremely overweight and didn't find out she was pregnant until 7 months in. She was also a heavy drinker. Kid was fine. 
197,"That women wear nice clothes and do their make up for men’s viewing pleasure.

Some guy argued with me about his."
198,"My teenager once spent an entire day in his room, only being allowed to come out to use the bathroom (I fed him sandwiches and drinks in his room at meal times) with no technology because he decided that it was TOTALLY fine to yell and scream in my face and try to slap me.

Nope..that shit does NOT fly around here, special needs or not. He was mad that I hadn't helped him find something he'd lost and when I wasn't helping in the correct manner, he got even more pissed off. So I said fine, I'm done. You're done. You're going to your room until you calm your ass down and until I'm over wanting to hang you from the ceiling fan by your toes while I turn it on high."
199,"That girl was a sweetheart, I’m so glad you at least won a friend out of this.

If it makes you feel better, any woman that respect herself won’t date a guy like him, going after everybody kills any attraction someone may feel for you. I stopped talking to guy literally because of something like this, he was chasing after everybody."
200,"Also that if a woman says she wants a bad boy she probably means a guy who dresses in that aesthetic and is confident, I have very rarely seen someone say they want a 'bad boy' and actually mean a bad guy."
201,"A friend’s brother’s wedding. The bride and groom wore camo, and the ceremony’s grand finale was for the two of them to shoot an exploding target...except they both kept missing and kept having to move closer. Dude was in the military, so I imagine that was not his proudest moment, lol. My husband and I could barely keep a straight face. The couple then decided to disinvite us from the reception because of nonexistent space issues. I wasn’t terribly bothered—it saved me a night of listening to shitty country music surrounded by future Trump supporters. "
202,"My dad is the same! He only ever has 2/3 beers maybe four times a year. When him and my mom met they were both pretty big partiers, then they got married and pregnant and my mom settled down but dad didn’t. While mom was 6+mo pregnant with my brother, my dad drove drunk and flipped his truck on a curve near their house. He crawled out the back window and walked home, in the morning mom took him back to his truck and there was a police officer waiting for them. The officer took one look at my heavily pregnant mother and said “I think you’ve got a handle on this” and left. "
203,"My mom was a hardcore gangbanger back in the day. One time like 20 years ago, some girl smacked the crap out of my uncle (he probably deserved it knowing him) at like a rave in a warehouse and my mom got a bunch of her people to go raid it and beat that girl up. 

You'll never see it now because she kind of 'whitewashed' herself to run a business. We're upper middle class now so she wanted to rise above that stuff. sometimes I'll mess with her and call her ice cube from boys in the hood because she didn't really change in attitude until I was like 12 years old so I remember what she was like.  "
204,"I was set up for a date night once and when my date noticed me looking around I was interrogated as to why i kept craning my neck to see everyone. 
“I want to see everyone’s dresses! Everyone looks so good all dressed up tonight.”
He responded saying I need not worry, I look so beautiful and I shouldn’t think about the other girls and how they look compared to me... 
Naturally it went completely downhill from there but I was so insulted he even insinuated that AND that his validation would somehow make a difference?! Absurd.
In fact, I then went to the bathroom and a group of women I didn’t know helped me fix my smudged eyeliner! "
205,"In my experience, when I was a teen I had a ridiculous libido. The only difference between me and teenage boys was they were allowed to express their sexuality freely, but if I did I was considered scum. It’s almost like years of guilt and shame make women not wanna express their sexuality 🤷🏻‍♀️"
206,"My cousin is getting married in August and I’m one of her bridesmaids. 

We were hanging out at my house and she says “So the other day future mother in law calls me and says I have to add a plus one for a COUPLE. This way ‘Jeffrey’ can come.” (Jeffrey is an adult. Not sure why He can’t get his own invite but whatever.) 

So she just kinda says ‘uh okay.’ And then talks to her fiancé. She’s like “Who is Jeffrey?! He is not on your list and I’ve never even heard of him.” 

Her fiancé says “Well that’s my cousin. But there’s two cousin Jefferys. I’m not sure which one she’s talking about. It could be the DJ or the one that just got out of jail.” 

What did he just get out of jail for? Murder. 

This wedding is gonna be bomb. "
207,"My dad married his 2nd wife (who I did not get along with) ***on my 18th birthday*** which in Australia is right up there with the 21st in terms of milestones. The wedding itself was nice, but a real trashy move.

Especially because mybirthday is in a really weird time between Christmas day and NYE so it's a massive pain in the ass to have events then (everyone is busy and tired and broke). Also, there was another date available 2 weeks prior to Christmas but that date 'would have been too hard' due to the holiday season lol, so my 18th was the more convenient option.

Multiple family members at the ceremony mentioned how inappropriate it was, especially considering the wedding was 2hrs from the city and everyone had to stay overnight in hotels, so I was away from my friends and mum's side of the family.

Had a lot of people go out of their way to give me gifts at the actual reception, and my uncle had the pianist play Happy Birthday, while the entire room of guests sang along (I didn't see her face but I'm sure the bride was THRILLED).

On the bright side it was an open bar and I got hammered for free with my family. But I'm now in my 20s and as I get older I realise more and more what an immature and dickish move that was."
208,Being dumb. The guy literally said he doesn’t understand why the state can’t just print more money so that no one would be poor. He’s 27. 
209,"Berating others when they make a mistake.

Inability to admit that they are wrong.

When asked what their ambitions are, or hopes &amp; dreams, and they say they don’t have any.

Easily angered over bullshit."
210,"Eh, speaking from personal experience this isn’t always the case. 

Before I got married my SO and I had an insanely stressful summer. Within two weeks I had major emergency surgery (and was on bed rest for the following 8 weeks), his grandmother died, and an out apartment caught fire. We did fine through these, rallying together and supporting each other. That felt good. 

On the other hand, this bonding made it easy to overlook some fundamental incompatibilities we had. When I’d get frustrated and want to break up, I’d look back at the rough time and think, “we’ve been through worse, we can get through this.”  Having the traumatic experience together made it harder for me to let go. 

Eventually we both agreed that it just wasn’t working and I’m now very happily divorced. "
211,The five second rule. It's really just an excuse for me not to waste that delicious food I just dropped because I'm clumsy.
212,I usually tell them it's to counteract the reek of dick in the gym
213,People being surprised at the clothes size I wear. I'm chubby but only 4ft 11. I usually get a medium in clothes. But at my height that's some decent chub! Short girls show a few extra pounds way faster in my experience. 
214,"Maybe? It was long distance and I still loved him but he got very inconsiderate and disrespectful. I guess you could say it was partially (maybe mostly) about the circumstances like the distance between us but it was also he was afraid of commitment and some other issues I didn't realize at the time. It was devastating and the most difficult heartbreak I needed to deal with but it was definitely the right decision to end it. (We got back together several times for a short period actually, those were mistakes.) For years I wondered if things would have been the same if there was no distance between us. We stayed in touch through social media and having short chats every now and then. Over time it became clear we would still break up if the circumstances were different. We had/have some major incompatibility elements."

216,"People who like to ""play devil's advocate""/argue for the sake of arguing. I don't need everything to become an argument and I find that kind of behavior exhausting. "
217,"Sprinkles. I saw a video of a YouTuber making their own sprinkles and I can't imagine using my time to make sprinkles. They're so cheap and diverse, I'd rather just buy them. There is even a sprinkles subscription box that you can get every month! "
218,"My brother has been growing his hair out and one day I was playing with it and jokingly I gave him a little pigtail. Maybe 30 minutes later my dad comes down and asks “what I’m trying to do”. If you know my dad then you’ll know he’s the kind of person to say things to back you up into a corner and then lunge. I asked him what he meant and he puttered about and then finally said what’s up with your brothers hair? Did you do that? I told him yes and asked if there was an issue. He immediately started raising his voice and saying that he doesn’t know “what I’m learning out there [in the street]” but he doesn’t want me bringing my “feminist bullshit” into the house and “polluting” my brother with it. I told him 1) my brother is 15 and can do whatever he wants to his hair, 2) he needs to educate himself about feminism, 3) if he thinks a pigtail is going to “pollute” my brother then he should probably reconstruct his idea of masculinity, and 4) if he’s giving my brother and I shit about hairstyles then he best believe I’m going to call him out on that sad excuse of a man bun he’s been walking around with for the past 10 years. 

This is turned into a 2 hour argument that I voice recorded. Hands down some of the most nonsensical ideas I’ve ever heard came out of his mouth that evening.

*Where is the relationship now?*  
We have short, polite conversations every now and again. 

*Did you ever reconcile or rekindle?*  
I wanted to get back together with him when I was away but it wouldn't have worked with the time and distance and what had happened in between. He ended up finding someone, getting a job, and having the life he always wanted. 

*Did you do no contact?*  
For a bit. It was more of a forced no-contact. 

*Did you regret the decision?*  
I wish I had handled things differently for sure. 

*Are you happy?*  
No. I'm just getting out of another relationship and I'm realizing how much stuff I never dealt with. I'm not in a great place right now but I'm getting help and I'm working on things. "

They lived together. In the morning he was all lovey dovey, in the evening he was distant. Then he started to ask some bizarre questions about their future and if he couldn't start a problem with her answer, he would say something *she* would clearly have a problem with like he would talk about having kids out of the blue and then say if they ever have a kid, she should be the primary caretaker because he wasn't going to have time unlike what he always said before that. Then one night he didn't come home. Didn't answer her calls. When she called his friend turned out they were at a party and he asked the friend to lie to my friend he wasn't there. I honestly don't think there was cheating or anything (his friend was confused why he asked him to lie he wasn't there and my friend wouldn't have a problem if he went to a party without her.) They had a fight when he came home. He listened to everything she had to say careless and said some insulting BS. They broke up that night. He actually called her and cried several times but didn't want to get back together."

When I was about 2 years old, my dad bought a bar. For some reason, he did not tell my mom or anyone else in our family. My mom, who was usually at home with me and my siblings, decided to go out with a girlfriend one night. The club they went to was where everyone in the town used to go. When they got there, the place was dead. My mom asked the owner why no one was there, and he responded, ""Are you kidding? You know they're all at your husband's place."" She had no idea. She rolled into my father's new bar with a full fur coat and proceeded to beat his ass in the parking lot. "

Not that I would never enjoy food again - I do enjoy it now - but I needed to stop looking to it for enjoyment for a while until better eating habits were established.  That mindset enabled me to overcome my food cravings, and it felt really freeing.  Eating healthier became much easier, and food overall became more satisfying."

238,"A random man eating lunch next to me asking if I'm wearing bright lipstick to attract men, my sister telling me I should stop wearing make-up because ""I'm covering up my natural beauty because I don't like the way I look without it"", and refusing to believe I just enjoy it as a way of self-expression, my mother saying red lipstick is too provocative and telling me, the day before my grandfather's \*funeral\* not to wear too much bright makeup and definitely not to wear red lipstick, as if I can't make judgements about what make-up is appropriate for what situation myself...

While my mother, at the same time, keeps saying I should wear more skirts and feminine blouses rather than jeans and t-shirts, BUT when I show the tiniest bit of cleavage she tells me off for dressing too provocatively  even if I can't help it that my rather large boobs mean that even regular tank tops just give me a lot of cleavage. If I cover up I'm not feminine enough, and if I don't I'm dressed too provocatively. I can't win.

EDIT: I do krav maga, which my mother hates because it's not a girly thing to do and she's afraid that I'll become too buff (??). Men who partner with me often treat me like I can't handle anything, saying 'I'll go easy on you' and then getting incredulous when I tell them they can go harder, and grumpy when I kick their butt. The other women there are much more fun to partner with, because they actually make me work hard. I'm a short, curvy woman, with longish, brightly coloured nails, and probably don't look like I work out at all, but I'm strong and actually good at krav, but not taken seriously by most of the men there, nor by my family who never ask about it and like to pretend I'm not doing anything as 'weird' as krav."
239,"From experience with a friend, who everyone knows is in love with me. Few things that made me back away from him, 

1. He tried to control me

example:

When I tried wearing eyeglasses, he said ""Remove those. You look snobbish.""

When we're sitting in a vehicle next to each other, he touched my cheek romantically. I obviously got pissed at this. He said ""Don't put on that face when we're together."" lol wut

2. Blamed me when I'm obviously a victim

example:

In college, we had rescue training, one scenario we had to enact was going in building blindfolded (fire rescue or something, can't remember). We were made to line up and hold on to the shoulder of the person in our front. The dude behind me accidentally grabbed my side boobs. I was pissed, he let go and apologized. Later, friend came up to me, visibly angry, saying that I didn't even do anything to prevent it.

When that didn't work, he started accusing me of sleeping with other people and calling me all sorts of derogatory names, and then he started asking things like if he's a good kisser (after over a year, nothing suss there), and talking about other girls all the time. I did eventually snap at him, after about a month of this shit. I told him that if he wanted to end it, he needed to grow up and fucking end it, because this was pathetic and I wasn't going to help him out. 

It was a really fucked relationship. I'm still not sure - part of me thinks I should have cut my losses and ran as soon as he started that shit, but the other part of me was terrified to break up with him for fear that hed revenge porn me. Also i kind of didn't want to give him the satisfaction; not that I was happy to stay in the relationship, but I'd spent the whole time doing all the emotional labour, the least he could do was handle the fucking break up.

246,"Exercising isn't going to lose as much weight as controlling your diet will. There's scientific reasoning behind this: https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11518804/weight-loss-exercise-myth-burn-calories

__The fundamental rule is to consume lesser calories than you burn.__ _It's that simple._

Eat these:
Veggies. Salads. Fruits. Yogurt. 

Avoid:
Fast Food. Soft drinks. Alcohol. Breads.

It's that simple. You don't need to exercise too much (just a short run or jog or even a walk each day will suffice). What you need to do is control what you eat.

There are tonnes of apps which will help you monitor calorie intake, like MyFitnessPal.

I guarantee you, 100%. This is the best, healthiest, and fastest way to lose weight.

Feeling hungry? Craving a snack? Don't reach for that packet of crisps. Instead, take an apple out of the fridge. You need to control temptation, and eat what you need, not what you want. 

You'd be surprised at how few calories are required for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Your apps will recommend a daily intake amount. *Follow it*.

I've seen that especially in some parts of the world like the US, portions in food chains and restaurants are _massive_. This is NOT what you need.

Lastly, get an appropriate amount of sleep. 7-8 hours.

Follow this advice, and I promise you, you'll see a very noticeable change in just a couple of weeks.

248,"i have, but they were the type of person who tends to see themselves as ''above'' feelings, empathy, social conventions, and the like. as a consequence they were a total jerk and abuser.

most people on the spectrum, in my experience, are genuinely distraught when they've hurt someone's feelings or behaved badly, and really don't need excessive explaining to help them pinpoint how they've fucked up and why it was wrong. they might not fully get it, but they don't solidly refuse to empathize until you've convinced them with an hours long debate exactly what about their behaviour is wrong and why you're justified in being upset. they're just sorry and try their best not to do it again.

tl;dr a person on the spectrum genuinely doing their best, 10/10 would date. a jerkass on the spectrum who uses it as an excuse to act like an edgelord or abuse, never again"

Okay, so I live in a pretty rural part of Florida. It's pretty much mostly rednecks and weird drugs dealers. lots of unnecessarily jacked up trucks. 
It was around spring a few years ago (give or take I have no sense of time) and mine and my friend's families were at a funeral for this girl who got hit by a drunk driver. 
Unsurprisingly, my friend's brother's ex was there (almost everyone knows everyone around here) and they'd been staring at each other the whole service. 
So right as the pastor's about to finish up the service, the brother yells ""hey Jess (not her real name), marry me? Right here. Right now."" The whole church is like ""wtf Richard"" (not his real name, I just really like that vine) but he's having none of it. He's like ""LIFE'S SHORT I WANNA MARRY THIS GIRL."" She's toxic, but that's another story. 
The pastor was friggin flabbergasted, so when the brother took his now fiancee up to him, he just started the marriage speil. 
At least 8 people left because of it, talking various amounts of trash. My friend and I were trying not to laugh so hard but I couldn't hold out til the end and when they said ""I do"" right in front of this girl's portrait I lost my fucking mind.  They're still together and have two kids.

Maybe it is ""hot"", but it feels awful for it to be reduced to that when it is *so much more.*"

Fast forward like about 18 months, I’d broken up with my girlfriend, we’d finished university and happened to be living quite close to each other. We saw each other quite a bit and hung out a fair amount. 

It actually took a mutual friend to intervene and be like “you know you two like each other right?”. We started going on some dates, but it was kinda weird. Like are we on “dates” or just friends hanging out. She wasn’t super keen on PDA, however privately we’d be making out quite a lot and sleeping with each other. Which was also kinda confusing, because are we FWB or actually dating. However it wasn’t all about the sex. Sometimes she’d stay over, say, and we’d just fall asleep on the sofa in each other’s arms, watching some crappy movie.

I didn’t want to tell any of our friends until I knew where we stood. Eventually, being the dummy that I am at reading signals, I plucked up the courage to ask her. Turns out she assumed we were dating and had even told her mom she had a new girlfriend, lol. Fast forward to now, and we’re very happily married 😍."
305,"Yep, because OMG PUPPY! is on the same level as, ""the woman I've been stalking refuses to date me so I'll murder her and everyone she loves."" Yep! Makes total sense. "
306,"Everything smelled weird. My toddler was not sleeping through the night and I was working more than full time, so was exhausted. I pleaded with my husband to figure out why the house smelled like garbage and left on a business trip to Vegas. It was a regular company trip and co-workers had significant debauchery planned. I’d have a glass of wine with dinner then nearly fall asleep over dessert. And everything still smelled weird. I bailed on all the plans since my tolerance was so low, slept a lot and still felt exhausted. Saw the doctor when I got back and found out I was in week 20, maybe, but it was late enough in the pregnancy they couldn’t date it. 

So I warn people I can’t go to Vegas anymore, since I came back pregnant from the last trip."
307,"When I was looking at healing times and risk of infection for various piercings I kept coming across posts like ""do women actually think this looks good or are they just trying to repulse men?"" (and I was like ""yes. both."") I really don't get the thought process of ""people shouldn't look this way because I don't find it attractive!"""
308,"I'm surprised how many men still think that women who sleep around have ""loose"" vaginas. As if you can't have as much sex with a single partner as you can with multiple partners with that logic. And when you try to educate them about how vaginas work, they throw you insults or say you're offended because your vagina is ""loose"". Yeah, right, I'm sorry I know how *my* vagina works."
309,We tried breaking up because I was going to be in China for a year while he was at school in Canada. We just never stopped talking and finally agreed to call it a LTD. We’ve been married for 5 years and are now expecting our first kid!
310,Massive penises. I don’t enjoy my cervix being smashed. 
311,I felt phantom kicks for six months after my last pregnancy. It was really just my organs shifting back into position. 
312,Less hair = less drag so I can be a more aerodynamic cat wrangler. I need every advantage I can get 
313,"Something else about nagging: It wouldn't be ""nagging"" if the person did what I asked them to the first or second time I asked. Usually, if it reaches nagging territory, it's because they kept putting it off until they got annoyed by the request."
314,"Ugh. The whole ""If I'm not having fun, NOBODY is having fun!"" thing. It's allllll about them! "
315,"I also do this. It really puts a light on in some guys heads. I have kids and I noticed it so early on. My boys are very melodramatic sometimes (as all kids can be) and when I call them dramatic everyone, aside from my husband, argues and says they’re not. 

Nobody refrains from calling my 2 year old daughter a drama queen over the smallest crap. Really grinds my gears. "
316,"oH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS ABOUT???

IS IT SO HARD TO TALK TO WOMEN WHO AREN'T YOUR FAVOURITE BODY TYPE

ARE YOU OKAY SIR?????

it makes me so angry skwhhrskd;d;sd"
317,Thought the cheese sandwich I'd brought to Wembley for the 2015 Community Shield had been dodgy. Nope. 7 weeks pregnant. 
318,I am not an immature or shallow woman because I like to keep up on makeup or fashion. I like looking cute and I don’t do it for you. 
319,"This is a very good point. Often times when a couple is in a healthy relationship, the story isn't about them and the movie starts after they've been together for a while."
320,To Kill a Mockingbird. 
321,"Umm... let me think.
 
The one where my dad forced my little sister (4 at the time) to tell CPS that my stepdad molested her?
 
The time he (32) dated a 16yo (I was 15) and encouraged her to slap/scream at me and my siblings?

The time he laughed as his girlfriends son beat me up?

Im still not sure what made me lose the most respect for him. I still have more but these were just the first ones that popped into my head"
322,"I recently gave my dad sunflowers for Father’s Day. I expected him to be like “I’m a man, yuck,” but he immediately put them in water, took a bunch of pictures of them, and sent them to all of his friends.  It was really sweet.  "
323,"Dude, for real. The women in my life are overwhelmingly amazing and so supportive and loving. I have no idea where this trope comes from. "
324,"I think that's the point the OP was making... holding in your stomach and butt is part of standard gymnastic technique for both boys and girls, to do with keeping a good posture. It has NOTHING to do with 'what boys like to look at' or any garbage like that, especially not at age 7."
325,"Cookies.  Simple recipes like peanut butter or butter cookies only require a few ingredients that most people have anyway, they taste better when made at home, *and* you get way more bang for your buck.  "
326,She treated a waitress like a slave.
327,"Thirty-one or thirty-two. But like, any age where you receive a fourteen-year-old girl and decide you're going to have sex with her is too old."
328,There were red flags before... which I ignored. Like him leaving his email account up on the computer with what seemed like an email from a dating site. Naive me thought it to be spam... 
329,It could've been. He seemed pretty happy after we broke up though. 
330,"They are great at being social.


They recieve free things from people (hahahha what??)


They must have great self esteem.


They have not experienced hardships in life.


"
331,"Yep.  ""Don't nag me"" translates to ""stop making me feel guilty for being a lazy dumb ass."""
332,"“Just a Dwight Schrute looking for my Jim Halpert.”

I’ve seen countless “just a jim looking for my pam”"
333,"I ""just knew"" my husband was the one pretty much from day 1. It was mostly a gut feeling based on our initial infatuation. We finally divorced after 10 terribly painful years of clinging to that feeling.

The second time I married, I did so based as much on reason as on feeling. I married my second (and current) husband because he is endlessly kind, excellent at calmly communicating, joyful and affectionate. To me those seemed like qualities that would endure a lifetime.  We didn't marry until we had worked through all major differences between us."
334,[deleted]
335,[deleted]
336,I have no idea. It just did. It’s like one day we woke up and knew nothing was platonic between us anymore. The watershed moment was him telling me how he felt though! 
337,I can’t believe someone would willingly have a child with someone they knew was a sexual predator. Creeps me the fuck out. 
338,"I reeeeaaally hate the non-words. “that“, “down THERE“ your... you know.. 

Same goes for all those incredibly stupid words for period. When some grown up man asks me if I'm in my strawberry week I want to punch them in the face.

If someone doesnt dare to say vagina i feel like I'm making out with a teenager. Major turn-off"
339,is it completely impossible for some people to comprehend that perhaps you are losing weight for reasons OTHER than trying to better fit what their personal idea of attractive is?? :/ it makes me so frustrated to hear that people have felt the need to say that sort of dumb crap to you. 
340,"I mean I don't really believe in it, but everytime I eat watermelon and accidentally eat a black seed, I panic for a split second thinking a watermelon is about to grow inside me. "
341,A little weird but also kind of a brilliant way to save on wedding expenses!
342,[deleted]
343,The tone of shock in their voice when they give you a compliment is always the cherry on top of that cake.
344,My parents and their best friends made screened T-shirt’s back in the late 70’s early 80’s that read SOMF which stood for “Sit On My Face” 
345,"I wish I knew. He wasn't the best looking, most intelligent, kindest, or even the best in bed of the people I've been with. It wasn't the longest running relationship. Literally nothing that I can put my finger on makes him stand out. But he does. I felt fully alive, in an almost sparkling kind of way, when I was with him. "
346,"I got my wife with ""I practice safe sex. I tie you to the bed so you won't fall off"" "
347,"This will get buried but it’s pretty crazy. In fact, whenever I tell people about this —- men and women —- they are absolutely floored.

In short: my fertility was mentioned in a written annual review for a job. 

I sat there in a restaurant for my annual review lunch, 6 months pregnant, listening to my 2 male supervisors reading my annual review out loud and joking that they didn’t expect me to get pregnant right after I just got married. I must be very fertile.

As soon as we were done, I made a copy of the report just in case I ever needed it.

I haven’t worked for that company in 12 years, but I still have that review to remind me of how far I’ve come.

Edit: added a sentence "
348,"Living in Nigeria, a ring actually makes me more attractive to women here, because (I heard this first hand) Nigerian men spend more on their side chick than they will on their wives.  

/Who said romance was dead?"
349,"I went on a date with someone who is autistic, but I’m not sure if it was their autism or them just being outright rude?

They nitpicked idioms that I said, they told me to shut up in my own apartment, and they ignored me when I said I didn’t want to listen to their “music” anymore (they’re a soundcloud dubstep “artist” and bragged about it heavily, but actually it was just trash). I lied and said my friend was coming over so they just up and left. 

I’ve had friends in the past who have autism and they were alright."
350,"Removed everything from his room except the bed and dresser. Took his phone. Tv. Games. Even the door. He was obstinate and disrespectful and I think his goal was to grow up and be a thug. We changed that! He’s a great kid now, at age 23. "
351,"It's so ironic, the more feminine your body is, the less feminine you are ""allowed"" dress. "
352,Nice Try CPS! 
353,low quality junk if you want junk. me and my calories are worth a fresh-baked treat rather than some packaged alternative that doesn't even taste as good as i hoped
354,"I don't know if I'd call it a ""stigma"" but talking about it is frowned upon: People who are average looking or unattractive by mainstream standards acknowledging it and being ok with it. 

I've always been fairly average looking. I don't like the ""everyone's beautiful"" attitude we have as a society these days. Its like people are trying to compensate for shallowness but going the polar opposite direction and it solves nothing. 

You can have a perfectly happy life being fully aware that you are an average Joe or Jane. Its ok to be ok with not being pretty. "
355,"“Alpha males”

Domineering, hyper-masculine douchebags who talk over me, think my “no” is the start of a business negotiation, and are allergic to feelings are honestly fucking frightening, not sexy. I want a partner, not a bossy, emotionally distant father figure. Give me a sensitive, kind man who cares about things like autonomy and my feelings and isn’t afraid to be himself instead of playing power games. Now *that’s* attractive. 

Edit: Thanks so much for the gold! Totally made my morning! :) "
356,One of my friend's older brothers got married at a funeral. 
357,"he was thrilled. he put them up on the windowsill and fussed over them for days while he remarked that they got more beautiful each day, just like our relationship

like damn even i'm never THAT thrilled about getting roses"
358,"Here's a good one... We just started dating and we're walking down the street and he says to ne"" Are you a who're?  Walk on the inside "" as he tries to grab my hand. 

For those of you who don't know - back I  WW2 era men who pimped their women  would  make them walk on the street side so men would  know  they were available.  I'd like to think we've come a loooong way since then. 

I noped tf out of  that. "
359,This is too cute. It's like he knew you were dating and was just waiting for you to realize lol
360,He stuck a McCain bumper sticker over someone's Obama bumper sticker in a parking lot. Then proceeded to mock them when he heard them get upset about it. 
361,"Wow. Wanna know what’s inappropriate? An adult pulling a child into a secluded closet to comment on how they look for any reason whatsoever.  

Sorry that happened to you. :("
362,I can imagine her ride home was... interesting?
363,Does yours check out also?
364,"People who are overly 'edgy'/purposely offensive because they like to get a rise out of people. It's not funny, you're just an immature jerk. "
365,"men expressing emotion (beyond just lust or anger) or otherwise behaving in non-normative ways should be encouraged, not stigmatized. "
366,If they lie to their friends in front of you then they most likely lie to you too. 
367,That they KNOW they’re attractive.
368,"I still have a decent libido (though I think the pill lowered it), but oh my God when I remember my teenage self it's actually embarrassing. I vividly recall that to pass the time on the bus, instead of listening to music or reading a fucking book, I would just drift off thinking about fucking. Every single bus ride, a few times a day. Good thing we don't get boners."
369,"I'd like to add to the extended family part: the right person will defend you to their family. I don't mean you should force them to choose or anything (though that may be necessary in cases of toxic family members), just that they shouldn't let the family pick on you or gossip about you, or even make unfair assumptions about you. A good partner will not only respect you, but demand respect from their family for you. "
370,"I work in an office where we provide a lot of LARCs, so we place iuds and the arm implant. The number of women who find out they’re pregnant when they’re at the appointment where they’re expecting to receive a device that will effectively keep them from becoming pregnant for years is higher than most would expect. It’s always hard to walk into the exam room to tell them they’re pregnant, when they’re expecting the nurse practitioner to be walking in to place the device. "
371,"My dad brought up at a dinner once how he did acid through his eye in college. If you looked at him you would never guess, he's the classic cargo shorts, dad jokes, sports watching dad now.

Edit:  Now that I've left work and realized this is r/askwomen I apologize. The Mr in my name is correct and I am not a woman, but the story is still true"
372,"My mother was extremely harsh to my aunt and her family when they didn't report all of their household income for FAFSA.  (My uncle did some cash construction work and didn't report the income; FAFSA is the application for financial aid for college in the US.)  She went on and on about people who take advantage of the system; the brutal unfairness of her tax dollars paying erroneously for their education; and the importance of honesty.  It lasted for years.

Eventually I'm 22 and applying for FAFSA.  My mom has hit her full (impressive) earning potential and she refused to supply her tax documents to me even though I couldn't complete the form without it.  I offered to fill out everything but her financial info which she could then fill in so I wouldn't see how much she earned.  I attempted to get her in touch with the school's financial aid officer so she'd understand that there was no other way.  She refused.

When it was time for her to pay 'her fair share' all that stuff about responsibility and honesty went out the window. 

I was doing a transfer program at a community college, so it was cheap and sensible.

In the end, my boyfriend and I got married so I could gain 'independent student' status.  February 14, 2019 will be 10 years of marriage, so that's good. :)"
373,"I made pho exactly one time. It took all day, was just okay. I can drive a few miles and get a huge bowl that is perfect for about $8 so I'm just gonna do that. "
374,See this is things they should teach in school because still to this day no clue how cup sizes work 
375,"If I remember right, an artist did open a gallery of said pictures.

377,My ex used to call my tits ‘Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen’. *shudder*
378,"Jesus, kid's a trooper"
379,"That the majority of us are primarily or even exclusively attracted to men according to their income alone, that we all want a serious long term relationship with every guy we happen to sleep with, and that we can't carry heavy stuff. "
380,"I have a very different meaning of ""gangbang"" to your meaning..."
381,"My mother's 2nd marriage. They wore opposing hockey team jerseys and encouraged everyone else to wear jerseys as well. After they did their ""vows"" they went behind a curtain and put on team Canada jerseys. It was just super weird."
382,Old Navy. 
383,'You used to be so intelligent until you opened your mouth'
384,That they're *innately* more emotionally intelligent
385,They become very submissive. The serious ones start wearing lingerie and heels around the house. Pastor says its a sin but I can't help who I am 
386,"i have the tiniest sparse light golden hairs on my legs and never used to shave.
 One day I legit got cornered by a colleague getting out of a car when we were on a field trip and I must have been wearing shorts or a skirt and a hair caught the sunlight. he grabbed another male rep and our (male) manager and they pointed at my legs saying OH MY GOD, SHE'S A MAN"
387,"So, my first kiss with my now husband happened accidentally. 

We were wrapping up a date and were about to part ways at the subway station. Instead, we lingered for a bit and chatted. Finally, since I didn’t want to miss the last train, I said, “I’m ready when you are.”

What I meant was, I’m ready *to leave* when you are. He misinterpreted my intention as, “I’m ready *to kiss* when you are.” So, he went for it!

Happy to say it all worked out — this was 12 years ago and we are still together. :)"
388,I can sell you a sit by my window for 10 bucks. We do all that and we cuddle with **7** cats lying all around us.
389,"That not explicitly saying no means a yes. I know someone out there will read this and think ""You need to communicate better,"" but if I'm telling someone, ""I can't do anything. I'm on my period,"" that is in no way an invitation to whip it out for a bj. "
390,"Easy peasy. 

1. Becoming a parent rocked.

2. Meeting my current partner.

3. Meeting my thesis advisor.

4. Becoming a bookseller. 

5. Retiring. "
391,I'm a 182cm tall master of engineering in flower dresses and heels. Anyone who has a problem with that can be crushed with my amazon legs.
392,"Best line ever for me was:  ""I'm going to ask you up for coffee, and by that, I mean I am thinking I would like to have sex with you.  Is that something you might be interested in too?""  The anticipation was pretty intense during the coffee and he checked in again after the coffee to make sure I was still on the same page.  By that time, he almost got tackled."
393,They can't.. they're two shellfish.
394,"Haha similar. Went to his place after a Halloween party to watch some stand up because my roommate was in a bad mood. His house was cold; I cuddled up to him. He kissed me.

Four and a half years later... here we are."
395,"Nah, there are so many people who are still going to say that. Lots of people lack self-awareness "
396,"That urban legend that ends with ""humans can lick too"" always gets me. Someone letting what they think is their dog lick their hand off the side of the bed but... It's not their dog. It's not their dog at all... 

I can't do it either. Hell, I still have a night light. "
397,"In my experience, not common. I've actually never been sent one"
398,"I have these on my wishlist, but I really want one that says ""do you smell what the rock is cooking?"" With a picture of the rock, but my husband told me no.

401,"Not being religious. 

I am not lost and I do not need to be saved. I certainly do not need you giving me a hard time about my soul after I die. My children will fine if they are not baptized. GTFO it. "
402,"I feel more cared for by women. Though maybe it's just the men I've dated. For me, men are more likely to do  some kind of grand gesture like buy a really nice present on your birthday, and consider ""romantic box ticked"" for a while. But women will send you that text before that presentation you're really nervous about, or say they found that one thing that you were talking about doing for a while...just generally consider you and your feelings more in daily life."
403,I have both online dating profiles and social media and I've never received one.
404,"That women talking critically about men dating significantly younger women is because they're either jealous or they're worried they are going to ""get replaced with a newer model"" like a guy told me once. Most women I know who talk about this wouldn't want to date a guy who is capable of doing this, that's one thing. And statistically they are less likely to work out so anyone who gets critical can actually support their opinion with stats."
405,I wonder how many women are driven away from academic subjects every year by that kind of thing
406,"That eye contact means anything but ""I'm talking/listening to you."" I can't even believe how many guys thought I wanted to have sex because I looked them in the eye.  It's hilarious. "
407,"When someone comments on anything brightly colored or patterned that I own, I make a comment about how its an easy way to reduce the likelihood that someone will walk off with my possessions.  "
408,"Cake pops. I did it once, never again. They were delicious, but way too much work. They turned out so ugly I didn’t want to serve them to a group. I’ll just make a cake or cupcakes instead. "
409,When mom told me women who are raped must have been asking for it and when dad told me women weren't the equal to me because god.
410,"picking fights is a good one! it's like they're secretly hoping that each fight will be the relationship-ender, you pull the trigger, and then they get to act super shocked and sad that you ''walked away''. i'm not even sure if many of them realize that it's exactly what they wanted."
411,"I shave anything that’s going to be visible (so legs in the summer only, for instance), because it’s not worth the negative social responses and judgment. I don’t “do it for me.” I hate shaving. But it’s just not the hill I want to die on. "
412,"I always joke with my husband that I'd make a terrible eyewitness because I never notice stuff about the people around me. I just don't pay attention to people. Now, if a dog robbed that bank, I could give a spot on description."
