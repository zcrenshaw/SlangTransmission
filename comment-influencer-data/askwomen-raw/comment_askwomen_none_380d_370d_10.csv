0,"There was one time it really backfired for the girl. We were having drinks with some friends at a bar and a girl my boyfriend knew from university came up to us.

At first she tried to muss up his hair and sit on his lap. He tried to politely say that she should stop, so instead she “stole” his jacket and ran off with it. My boyfriend went after her while I stayed behind with our friends, it took him a good half hour to come back and he was pretty annoyed when he did. He said the girl’s friends had helped her hide the jacket and that they wouldn’t give it back unless he stayed with them and bought them drinks. He argued with them to get jacket back because it was an expensive damn jacket. In the end he had to get the bar’s staff involved who finally managed to get the jacket back and told the girls to leave. Apparently the girl who’d hit on him had been crying at this point. 

I honestly have no idea why some people think stealing things is a cute way to hit on someone, I never found it anything but annoying."
1,"He gets hit on alllll the time, often in front of me. It doesn’t bother me, and he’s usually pretty good about shutting it down nicely. 

Once early on in our relationship we were at a party, and a woman who was interested in him asked him if we were dating (I was off to the side with a group of people talking but could overhear) and he said yes, and she said “oh wow, I never would have called that” in kind of a snotty tone and he said “yeah, she’s slumming it, God love her”. It was also the first time he referred to what we were doing at the time as dating so I was like eeeeeeek! Hahaha"
2,"This is my parents, but I find it hilarious:



Both of my parents are ripped and go to the gym together everyday.



My dad is a nice dude and smiles at people when they smile at him.



Well, this has lead to a significant number of guys hitting on him in the weight room.




It has gotten to a point that he now introduces guys in the gym to my mother. (His wife)



Well, my mom, being my mom, smiles and nods, then picks a machine/bench next to the guy she was just introduced to and tells them that they are just friends and that he is really shy.



So basically the entire gym thinks he’s in the closet and he doesn’t understand why everyone is hitting on him all the time when he continually tries to tell them that he’s straight.



The funniest part is when he comes home and he’s like, “I hope I didn’t break his heart” and we are just like “oh, you’re too sweet”"
3,"Friend, enemy, random stranger....all shall receive a tampon if they’re caught short."
4,"About two weeks after we made it official we went to a mutual friends birthday party. Mutual friend invited a lot of his friends from high school. Including one girl who, from the moment she laid eyes on my boyfriend, mercilessly hit on him and flirted with him, draping herself all over him. We had been dating a few months and only official a week, but he kept escaping her clutches, but trying to avoid this woman in a small house party was very difficult. 

Eventually she was talking to me about him and asked me how I knew him and I casually said ""Oh he's my boyfriend"". She turned beet red and started apologizing profusely, stuttering the whole time that she had no idea. I forgave her because it was genuine and also my boyfriend and I weren't into PDA or had even walked into the house together. I then pointed out our single friend that was also at the party and also very attractive and gently nudged her in that direction :)"
5,"I had an ex boyfriend who was story stealer. I slowly noticed this over the couple of years we dated. One time he actually told me a story that I had told him, and he swore up and down that it had happened to him. I mean there was no way, it was a very specific event that happened to me, but he must have forgotten I was the one who told him. He was a real weird guy. "
6,"I (63F) divorced my ex half a lifetime ago.  I mean literally.  I was 31. 

I went to therapy to figure out why I married who I married so I wouldn't do it again.  (Embarrassed to discovered I was a textbook case and so unoriginal... I married my father(!) who was controlling, manipulative and mean-spirited.)

After extracting myself from the marriage, I vowed to only marry again if I found someone who *enhanced* my life.  

In the meantime I set about building an amazing life.  Resulted in having a satisfying job (now retired) and ditching toxic relationships (left with a small group of quality friends both male and female) and hit the jackpot with a loving, drama-free family.  

In the process I developed the strongest and best relationship of my life.  With myself.  

Quote time!

*""The worst loneliness is not to be comfortable with yourself.""*  

Sure I've dated here and there, but I love my independence, find myself amusing, never get bored and embrace the wonderfulness of my life.  So I cope by wringing every moment of enjoyment out of all I do.  

I'll end this post with a phrase that I use very often when commenting on this site.     

Life is good.  I love my life.  
"
7,"Het , 10 years. Yes, yes and yes. 

We just never stopped. We make physical contact whenever possible, a hand on the back, a drive by bum grab, and always kiss each other goodbye and hello. We wrap each other up in hugs, and our daughter comes running to join in. 

We sicken me. "
8,"Walk upright.

Wear the clothes I actually like. Not the ones that kinda fit. There's no point in saving *all* the good things for later. "
9,"My husband is very attractive and super nice so he gets hit on a lot. The fact that he is also one of the most oblivious people on earth never fails to amuse me. 

One of the few times he did notice, he was in the lab at his university towards the end of his doctorate. There was a younger grad student who’d been hitting on him for a few weeks and knew he was married (according to his lab mate later on) by DH was oblivious like always. One day I came to have lunch with him and then hung around for a few hours chatting with his colleagues. 

After observing me for a couple hours, she went up to my husband and hand him her number on a card and said to call her when he was ready for a upgrade. Husband immediately turned out and went to his advisor who pulled in her advisor and had some words with her about her behavior. "
10,"My husband is very attractive, but it's rare for someone to hit on him while I'm around. This one time though, we were grocery shopping and stopped at the deli to order a salmon filet or something. While we were waiting he kissed me (a small kiss, nothing over the top or anything). This woman (~60 years old) dashes over to us and  yells ""WHERE'S MY KISS?"" at him.

It was both awkward and funny AF."
11,"My husband had a colleague who was enamored with him. He taught art, so did she, so we saw her at least once a month at gallery events. The first time he introduced her to me, she was visibly distressed. After that, every time I encountered her she pretended like she didn't know me. She'd ask him, ""And who's this? Your sister?"" and every time I'd say, ""I'm his wife. We've met. Many times."" and she'd try to shake my hand like she really hadn't ever met me before. My husband was pretty clueless about it, ""maybe she has a hard time recognizing faces?"" until he started having to ask her not to refer to him as her ""work boyfriend"" to their colleagues.

It finally came to a head when we invited a few of his colleagues over for a party and she tagged along. She knocked on the door, I answered it, and she said ""Who are you? I'm supposed to be at \[redacted\]'s house."" and I said, ""Well, if we're strangers then you'd better not come in"" and shut the door. She sent him several texts that night about his ""rude roommate"" not letting her in, and he ignored them. The next time I saw her, she had a boyfriend who looked eerily like my husband. The night we met him, he said he was growing out his beard for her (my husband has a full beard) and she still pretended like she didn't know who I was."
12,"He told me he ghosted for a few weeks because he in the hospital getting his appendix out. Which is fine, except he gave me that excuse twice. "
13,"Based on the amount of people who randomly tell me personal things, I think people assume I am friendly. "
14,"We were at the grocery store and there was a client of his there who saw him and made a beeline for him and started chatting him up with me standing right there holding our cart.  She saw me and said, “oh, let me get out of your way so you can pass” and he quickly introduced me as his girlfriend.  She looked bummed, ended the conversation and life went on.

There is also a cashier at Big Lots who completely ignores me but turns into a blushing teenaged girl whenever he is in the store.  You could sweeten your coffee with her voice when she speaks to him.  But I am practically invisible to her."
15,"Just yesterday a woman I was working with saw me talking to my boyfriend when he dropped something off at work.  I think she assumed he worked there too and had no indication we were a couple.  She said to another woman ""I would never date a guy like that.  Way too handsome.  I could never rest""

I got a kick out of it.  He is devastatingly handsome.  He's also the best boyfriend I've ever had.  "
16,"I’ve lived alone for 4 years. After having a constant flow of roommates, it has been the greatest thing ever. I don’t mind being alone, I really like it. Gives me time to decompress and do whatever I want (i.e not wear pants)."
17,"Damn, that's what a 10yo would do, wth."
18,"My husband had a coworker that I didn’t particularly like. Two actually, they would buy him expensive gifts and be overly flirty and introduced themselves to me as his groupies at one of his concerts. 

But one in particular got his Snapchat name from a friend and kept messaging him. She sent pictures of herself in a sports bra... nothing racier than that (that I know of). He kept ignoring her. It’s important to note, he’s really, really awkward. 

So one of his friends threw a party and we went. We were playing cards against humanity and she sat on the other side of him, scooted closer than necessary and said, “Hey, you never answered my snaps!” 

He gave her a deadpan look and said, “Yeah, well, that’s because I didn’t want to talk to you. I thought you would have been able to figure that out.” 

All of us laughed and she did too, but she scooted away and left him alone after that. "
19,"It doesn't have to be a big show, just a cute note left on the counter, a quick text, grab her butt, or tell her she's beautiful. If she likes flowers, send her some. Make her feel wanted. "
20,"Respect other women's relationships. Don't fuck or try to fuck someone else's boyfriend.

Weirdly enough, this seems to be controversial."
21,"He'd tell me all about the homeless people he helps around the city. I sensed he was fibbing so I made up a random street name and asked if he's been to the homeless shelter there. And of course, he starts raving all about how he was just there last week and how grateful they were for him."
22,Real queens fix each others crowns.
23,"My boyfriend is a very handsome 6”5 guy with a great smile and personality. A lot of girls flirt with him and I’m okay with that. However there is one girl who knows me and my boyfriend are together. Whenever she sees us and comes up to us she hangs around his neck and is very desperate. She always turns over to me and says: “Oh... So you guys are still together?” (Been together almost two years). My reply is always the same: “No we broke up but we love to hang out and feel awkward around each other.”

I low key hate her so much. "

A nice haircut.

Eyebrows nicely shaped.

Clothes that actually fit good."
27,"To get each other’s attention in loud, crowded places (think, mall) we make the distinct “heh” sound that tortoises make when they’re mating. We can scream each others names all day and we’ll never turn around but “heh” we can hear. 

It’s stupid, but it works. "
28,wow your mom is hilarious 
29,"Congratulations on being a couple of totally normal, well adjusted gals 😀"
30,"He doesn't really get hit on when I'm around.  But my favorite time was when he was grocery shopping and some older lady (he was early 20s, she was late 40s) told him ""you know, older women know it won't break.""

He said he was engaged and she goes ""well bring her along, she might be into it""


She had her kids with her. They were old enough to understand what was happening.  And he chewed her out for being gross in front of her kids."
31,"Rating things on myself instead of on other people &amp; matching clothes. I spent all my adolesence wearing clothes, hairstyles, make-up styles that looked good on other people but they didn't suit me *at all.* I ended up looking worse."
32,Be a friend to another woman and not an enemy. Women are tearing down each other for nothing. 
33,"Not married yet, but this is the best part to me - 

My fiance falls asleep easily, I do not. He also sleep talks occasionally. Sometimes at night I'll be shifting or tossing and turning and he'll grab me in his sleep and pull me really close and tight. He'll sometimes say things in his sleep too, like ""I love you so much"" and what not. It's the best feeling in the world. 

Although one night he lectured me about car batteries in his sleep. Lolol"
34,Lmao. The “I worked for YEARS to get my associates” killed me. 
35,This story went in a much cuter direction than I thought it would
36,"I live in the Bay Area, so I got two jobs to pay for my apartment, and now I have no free time. But I do have a cat, an extensive library, and a really nice apartment all to myself. I also bought a high end vibrator. "
37,"That I work “here”, wherever here is and no matter what I’m wearing. It’s frustrating."
38,"He slaps me on the ass sometimes, so I guess you could say we're going strong.


For real though, he is the sweetest guy. We've been together almost 7 years, engaged almost 2, and he loves romance. He buys me flowers, takes me out for dinner. He's very affectionate and loves to cuddle. He tells me he loves me more than I can count, including every morning when we wake up and every night before we go to sleep. He tells me he's proud of me all the time and although we're not hyperactive sexually at the moment (stressful life circumstances), when we do have sex it's pretty frickin' mind blowing.
"
39,I’ve been told I look arrogant and intimidating. Actually just shy and an introvert with a resting bitch face.
40,"I brought my boyfriend to a party my university held at the end of the semester last spring. Really nice party, great catering, formal dress, lots of our Italian conversation partners and friends of the faculty were invited, so there was a healthy mix of american students and Italian people. 

Were at a round table and my boyfriend has been cornered by a couple of other girls who are very obviously hitting on him. They're too drunk for this party and they're embarrassing themselves. His english still isn't great so he's not totally getting it. It's the same every time I bring him to a party, He smiles and nods his way through everything and on the way home he tells me ""I don't understand nothing that they say to me. nothing!"" Anyway, He's holding up pretty well and I'm thinking about how funny its going to be once they realize that he's not one of the conversation partners, he's my boyfriend. 

I finally step in when one of the girls tries to get my boyfriend to go and take shots of vodka in a nearby bush. I go to retrieve my boyfriend, girl says ""We were just going to go inside for a sec,"" and tries to lead him away. My boyfriend turns to me innocently and says, ""What's happening?"""
41,"I had a similar moment! We went out dancing with one of his friends bc we're trying to get the dude a date (he's not a bad catch, but has zero self-esteem and is a teensy but self-destructive atm) and kind of merged with this other group. This one lady was being super nosy and was like:

Stranger: ""So you two are a thing.""
Him: ""... Yes.""
Stranger: ""Like dating?""
Him: ""Yes.""
Stramger: ""Like boyfriend and girlfriend?""
Him: *glances at me* ""Yes.""

Made my heart melt. Nothing like nosy strangers to dtr XD"
42,"Said he couldn't help me pay rent because he was paying his grandfather's hospital bills. Lots of screaming, yelling, and fighting later I find out he eats McDonalds like 3 times a day, and spends tons of money on video games. Still maintains he pays grandpa's hospital bills. Finally one weekend we were at his mom's house. She asked how are we doing and I brought it up. Watching her face drop told me everything. She said her father would never ask his grandchildren for money and she was so sorry. 

There's tons more. He was a pathological liar. "
43,"My dude is Cambodian. A lot of people enjoy playing an awkward game of “so what ARE you” with him. 

For some reason, older white women LOVE him. 

We were at a bar and an older woman (late 40s/early 50s; we are 30) approaches him with this: 

Her: You look soooo familiar! 

Him: oh... no I don’t think so.

Her: No you do! Definitely. Did you used to roller skate a lot?

Him: Not really...

Her: no you did! You did! What are you? Are you Cambodian? 

Him: yeah. Cambodian. 

Her: do you know ::random Asian girl::? 

Him: nah I don’t think so.

She then took out her phone, opened up her Facebook page, and showed him 15 different Asian girls from our city, asking if he knew them. 

Then she tried to wrap it up with, “I know, you think I’m too old for you but baby, I’m a fun ride!” 


It was amazing

I aspire to have that level of shameless confidence "
44,"This is a little more extreme than just hitting on him, but I thought it was worth putting here.

My SO/now husband used to wait tables, and two of his fellow waitresses were talking over drinks one night, and they admitted to each other that they were both in love with my SO. Several drinks later, at 2 am, they decided to go tell him about their feelings, and they got his roommate, who also worked at the restaurant, to let them into his apartment. So there they were, banging on his bedroom door in the middle of the night when we were about to have sex. He went out and talked to them for a good 20 minutes or so, and when I came out, one of the girls said ""sweetie, we're talking, I think it'd best if your SO explains this to you later."" Angry would be an understatement, I was livid. But I kept my peace and let him handle it. "
45,"I came home from a week away and the microwave smelled like something burnt when I opened it.  When I asked him, he said I was just smelling something else, that nothing had burned (?!?) while I was gone.

Two weeks later, he admits he put a potato in there that somehow caught fire.  This was the second time he had caught our microwave on fire.  He also then admitted that the reason he washed all the dishes by hand wasn't because he was bored that week, but because when he tried washing them in the dishwasher, he put in liquid dish soap and caused it to overflow with bubbles.  When I asked him why he didn't just use our pods, he said, ""We were out and I didn't want to put on pants to get more so I just figured they were the same thing."""

47,She high key hates you so much haha
48,"A guy I dated lied about being able to rock climb. He let it get as far as us both being at a wall for our first date, and he's about to belay (secure me whilst I climb) and I realised he couldn't even tie a knot. I was shocked. He was about to let me climb 2 stories without knowing how to keep me safe if I fell. I was furious his fragile masculinity had allowed the lie to go so far and that was the last I saw of him."
49,"Always wash your face and brush your teeth before bed.  Always always always, no matter how much partying you did that night."
50,"If you see a girl’s skirt has ridden up or gotten tucked in her tights, doesn’t matter how far away she is you run after her and tell her. 

Maybe not #1 but something I will do 100% of the time. "
51,"Our jokes. Our silly voices. Our shared interests.

Also, my husband came home the other day from school, and he put his arms around me and told me he was so happy to be home with me, and then “Isn’t it so wonderful to know you have someone in your life who will love you forever?” Yeah, I cried. I am crying. He’s the best."
52,"Years ago, my mom made an offhand slutshaming remark that made me realize I could never talk to her honestly about my dating/personal life. I know she wishes we were closer, but I also know that if I was totally honest with her about my views and beliefs, she'd be extremely judgmental."
53,Help a girl out and pretend she’s your friend if you see a guy creepily bothering her. 
54,"That he didnt like brownie ice cream because I asked him if he ate mine. Mind you the previous month, I made a pan full of brownies and that piece of crap ate the entire pan. I didn't even get any. "
55,"I deleted Instagram. This is helping with my self-esteem a lot. Also, I try to workout or get outside everyday. I choose not to wear makeup, I feel better without it on probably cause I suck at doing my makeup and it only makes me break out more. "
56,He had tinder on his phone for socializing with his buddies (this was when group dates were still a thing). Excuse me?
57,"We have two big ones we always laugh about, even years later. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Concert** 

We're at a concert and he's waiting for me outside the restroom. I come out and find a woman hitting on him, as usual. I hear her saying: ""You're the hottest guy here. Let's fuck."" 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband says: ""Thanks but I'm not interested, I'm just waiting for my wife."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I walk up, join the conversation, and I get the usual look from her...women usually look me up and down with that silent snarky expression that means, *""you're not hot, what's he doing with you?""* 

&amp;#x200B;

She continues to speak to my husband: ""I'm staying at the Marriott, room 267, come on by."" Then she looks deadpan at me and says, ""You can come too.""

&amp;#x200B;

**The Neighbor** 

I went out of town for a few months to take care of a family member who was having health problems. While I was gone, this one neighbor in our apartment building who was always hitting on my husband must have noticed and made her move. My husband calls me and says he got this note left on the door from her which said: *""I noticed the house next door is up for rent, would you consider a roommate situation? I would make it worth your while.""* He told me he'd been avoiding her and didn't reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after that I was making a visit home, and neighbor lady knocked on the door. I opened it. There she was, with her tits hanging out of her top and the tiniest shorts on, with a very shocked expression on her face to see me there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gotta hand it to her, she went all in. Instead of backing down, she deployed the hard-core attack: ""You know, your husband and I were discussing moving in together, in case you didn't know."" I smiled and replied: ""yeah, he told me, I have the note you left right here"" (I show her the note). Her face twitches as she realizes she's been caught.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry to disappoint you, but we're not interested. Bye!"" And I shut the door in her face. "
58,There are a lot of apartments in the Bay Area. Kind of weird to ask which.
59,THE AUDACITY! I am both amazed and disgusted
60,"From experience, that I speak Spanish. I do not."
61,HOW MANY APPENDIX YOU HAVE BRUH?!
62,Is your boyfriend single? Jw 
63,The inside jokes. My husband and I are *hilarious* in our own minds. I feel like laughter is the cornerstone of marriage. 
64,"""You're okay with having sex with me when you're awake, why is it then suddenly not okay when you're sleeping? It's the same.""

- My ex, who of course didn't use protection on his nightly ""adventures""

I was under major gaslighting until I woke up mid act. 

My friends group at the time found it to be very normal so I ended up just thinking it was how relationships worked. "
65,"That I'm on hard drugs because of my facial scars, dark eye circles, sunken cheeks and difficulty walking. When in reality I don't do drugs, I'm just ugly and have a chronic pain disorder. "
66,"I dated a guy that was relatively attractive and one Halloween we were at a costume party at a bar. I was wearing my homemade [Yip Yip Costume](https://imgur.com/a/Ux4eaq7) (photo provided is not of my ex) and two girls were talking our ears off. They then began to heavily flirt with him. I pulled off my costume to drink a beer and they excused themselves when they saw I was a woman. 

I’m thinking they may have assumed I was a man since I am 5’11” and he was 5’7”. 🤣"
67,"I’m intimidating and very hard to please. 
Actually just resting bitch face and lost in my own thoughts 85% of the time. "
68,"I have Resting Sad Face, so people always assume I'm in a really bad mood and that something has happened to me."
69,"There's a lot of talk about respecting yourself and loving yourself, and while that is completely valid and true, it's an incredibly hard jump to make if you have no clue where to begin. From someone who went from absolutely loathing myself and picking apart every flaw I could find to being pretty damn confident and able to truthfully say I have great self-esteem, I had to go through years of re-programming my thoughts.

First of all, as cheesy as it sounds, positive self-talk does make a difference. At first, it feels so stupid and trite. Why would I want to stand in front of a mirror and say to myself ""Hey, self, your hair looks really shiny today! Way to go!"" - feels weird, right? But here's the thing - it works. After a few weeks, maybe even months, those compliments to yourself start feeling more natural and your self-image starts changing. 

Start out simple, with easily visible things. Everyone has something about themselves that they can be proud of or celebrate. Maybe you have a very unique eye color? Or your fingers are really strong? Or your style is on point for your preferred aesthetic? Or you have a super cool birthmark? Don't try to conform yourself to traditional standards of beauty or make sweeping comments about your appearance to start with. You want to begin small and ideally with things that you can keep coming back to, that stay consistent.

Keep that shit going and eventually you're ready for step 2; complimenting intrinsic and intangible qualities. Do you know you're pretty good at art? Or maybe you have a talent for helping people? Or perhaps you're extremely empathetic? Or you have a keen eye for detail? Whatever the talent/quality, focus on it and tell yourself WHY you're proud of that quality. Something like, ""I'm really proud of myself for being great at web design because I can make the user experience easier for someone visiting my website."" Again, sounds weird and kinda trite at first, but soon you'll find yourself becoming way more confident in your ABILITIES, not just your physical qualities. 

This is where it gets real; when you start to love the things you can do and what you're able to put out into the world, you start to derive your self-esteem and self-worth from your personal purpose. The physical things like weight, appearance, etc start to fall down the list for how you self-validate, and with that, they also become easier to love. 

From my personal perspective, I used to be so fed up and hateful about my weight, hair, skin, fashion sense, and how I thought since I was so unattractive, no one could love me and no one would be attracted to me. I got to a point where I loathed myself so much that I hit a turning point - I could keep going like this and it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy, or I could do something to change it. I started following the steps I listed above, beginning with something as simple as ""My eye color is unique and pretty cool."" That evolved into ""My skin looks really beautiful today"" which evolved into ""I've put together a great outfit today"" which evolved into ""If I smile at people on the street, they generally smile back and I think it makes their day a little brighter"" which evolved into ""I contribute to the world with my empathy and desire to learn more about social justice..."" and it just kept going. 

Eventually, it becomes second nature to treat yourself with love and compassion, rather than putting yourself down. And, being realistic, everyone has bad days. The thing about practicing self-love and self-compassion every day, though, is that it becomes so much easier to stop negative thoughts in their tracks. If I find myself looking at my round spots where I wish they were flat, or beginning to degrade myself because my hair looks too flat today (because, let's be real, most of my negative self-talk is about body image), I stop myself and immediately demand that I say three nice things about my appearance. And I end up feeling way better about how I look; it improves my day considerably because I broke out of that negative feedback cycle. 

So, all of that to say, healthy self-esteem is learning how to appreciate who you are, what you have to offer the world to make it better, and it requires practice to get there. It's quiet confidence in who you are and knowing that you will constantly grow and change, while seeking to make that growth and change positive. "
70,"Here’s some tips from things I’ve tried and tested over the years.

- Invest in your skin. Ensure you’re using the correct cleansers, toners, and moisturisers for your skin type. It’s NEVER too early to use anti-ageing products or collagen masks. I highly recommend Clinique’s Moisture Surge as a go-to for all skin types. 

- get the right haircut for your facial shape. A bad one can either stump or widen your face. Also have the right colour hair to compliment your skin tone.

- STOP PICKING YOUR PIMPLES. You will scar for life. Let them heal or see a professional to have them cleared.

- invest in a top tier foundation that covers well. You can go budget on almost everything else makeup-wise but spend good money on your base. 

- drink at least 1.5L of water a day.

- eat plenty of dark green veggies and cut down simple carbs. 

- wearing a proper fitting bra will save your back and your wardrobe. No matter your size, get fitted by a professional. 

- always think about your posture - straighten your back, relax your shoulders, raise your chin, and think about how gorgeous you are. 

- find the right coloured red lipstick that works for you. Too pink, orange, or purple can really stand out in a bad way. The right shade will make everyone’s jaws drop. 

- before bed, lather your skin in moisturiser. My favourite is the lavender Sleep range from Lush.

- get enough sleep. You’ll wake up looking and feeling refreshed. Having little sleep will show on you in many ways - drab skin, droopy eyes, bad posture, etc. 

- wear a full set of matching lingerie one day per week. Bra, knickers, garter, stockings. It’s sensual and exciting and a real confidence booster. 

- exercise is good, but make sure you’re doing the right exercises for your desired result. Speak to a pro and have some personal training sessions.

71,"Buy things for real you, not fantasy you.

Meaning you should buy clothes/makeup that you are going to wear. Don't think ""I will wear eyeliner everyday once I buy this one true eyeliner!"" you know you aren't going to do so. ""This dress looks good on me but is uncomfortable, but I will wear this often!"" real you won't. Buy things for real you."
72,"Multi-level marketing schemes, mostly nutritional supplements and vitamins. I tried to shine a light on how they were practically BS, no better than typical vitamins you could get in any store. All I got back was ""no, that's not right, you must not have heard about \_\_\_\_&lt;insert marketing-driven pseudo-science bullshit pitch here&gt;\_\_\_\_"". It hasn't alienated me, per se, but it's put a small rift between me and a few others who believe in these voodoo magic pills."
73,I got a dog
74,"I will defend your right to wear whatever you want, no matter how modest or how revealing, as long as you extend the same courtesy to other women. "
75,"That my husband will often pick up the slack if I forget something. Many times I’ve gone to bed and wake up in the morning thinking “Crap! I forgot to put the clothes in the dryer!” I rush down to the basement to see that, not only has he done it, but he even hung up my delicates. 

He stays up later than me so this probably happens in some form 2-3 times per week. Sometimes I forgot to take out meat for dinner, or I didn’t plug my phone in, or I didn’t make a lunch for myself for work. I’ll find these things done a lot. I do all the laundry and cooking. He does all the cleaning and dishes. 

He also has morning duty for our three kids because I leave earlier. So if I have time I like to pack the bag for the kids so he doesn’t have to worry about that, or set out breakfast stuff for them. I love the working as a team feeling. "
76,Wait for sex until you're in a relationship. I'm not saying it's the better thing to do; it's just what I'm more comfortable with. It's what I prefer.
77,"My boyfriend is in a band and girls find that attractive. One night he played in a college town and I tagged along. After the show all the girls there were talking to the band (pretty normal for a college town) and then I notice one girl making eyes at my boyfriend. I’m not jealous in any way, but she finally worked up the courage to hit on him in front of everyone. His eyes go wide and he looks at me and he goes, “aaaand this is my girlfriend!”. She sincerely apologized to me because she really didn’t know but I thought it was sweet of her to immediately apologize. "
78,Wtf is wrong with some people. She is so rude!
79,"Get really into fallout. Like i mean, really *connect* with the wasteland.

Put extra time into your work, get those extra hours in while there's nobody at home waiting for you i guess. Might as well earn some dough. 

Watch funny movies. Or sometimes sad ones. 

Play horror games. Because loneliness sucks, but at least nobody is trying to cook you. 

Get a hobby, mine is drawing creatures and writing. But you could also do something like, sewing, crotcheing, kayaking. And other stuff. 

Do something physical if you aren't already. Take time out of your day to go for a walk, go for a hike on the weekend, or i dunno, tennis maybe. 

You can't make loneliness just go away, you just have to find solace in your own company. "
80,That sounds hilarious tbh. That old lady is good fun (if she was not actually creepy-serious). 
81,"Fuck. My biggest problem is spending 25-50bucks on a palette and feeling like it's gold and I can't just use it daily. So I wait until FOREVER to use the palette and then its been YEARS since and I haven't used it much. 
Ugh. And that's me with all things. "
82,Probably the discussion about how I don’t want kids and would love to get sterilized. People can almost never just let it be. Therefore I’ve lost or at least distanced myself from quite a few people.
83,"It's not best in a happy way, but still makes me laugh in ""man I'm not even mad"" way. I ended up accidentally being my ex's wing-woman.

He is fairly attractive, but since we were usually together no one hit on him in front of me. But this girl's thirst was real. She was our friend's roommate, and we went over to friend's and there she is - calling him into her room ""to see something"". So I started laughing at this, and he is visibly uncomfortable.

Next time we see her, there is 15 people in the house and she only spoke to him. This was kinda bothering me, but it was still more cute (than bothering) that someone has a crush on my SO so I ended up teasing him for this.

He dumped me for her. Oof. "
84,"I believe porn has made relationships and the world a worse off place. No, I don't think you are terrible if you've watched it, but I don't believe it should be watched regularly, especially if you are in a relationship. This is just how I view my personal relationships though and I'm lucky to have someone who feels the same. "
85,"""depression is a choice""

No.

Edit: this person was not a friend or family thankfully. "
86,"Yeah we really don’t require much. Little things mean the world to us. Just like we remember little things for you. My SO never remembers to plug his cell in when he gets home. Even if I’m sound asleep when he gets in, if I wake up, I’ll plug his phone in for him. 

If he needs to leave early, I’ll make sure everything is on the kitchen counter. His work ID, travel charger, small bottle of ibuprofen (cuz he gets headaches when he’s tired) wallet, all of it together so he doesn’t have to look for anything. Takes me only a moment or two to get it all together but he appreciates it and I know that. 

Now, I said that to illustrate that if you remember little things, we’ll just go ga-ga. Those simple little things will mean so much. Leave a note for her. Send her an “I love you” text. Tell her you can’t wait to spend time with her on your day off... like that."
87,"No, I actually loved being alone and revelled in it. I’m the youngest of 5, so finally getting a place of my own was bliss. I had a pet cat for company, but she was rather aloof and left me to my own devices a lot of the time. "
88,"He travels for 4 days every week, and works loooong stressful days during that time. We always talk on the phone at night while he's away, and it makes me feel special when he makes a point to ask me how MY day was. I know that he always had a way busier and stressful day than me and would love to spend the whole time venting about it, so it's sweet when he makes it clear that he is interested in hearing about my boring day :)"
89,"Easier to learn online. For my garden I have a few books I always reference, but it's just easier to google the needs of individual houseplants.

For me the biggest thing was don't overwater! Lots of plants die from neglect but it's just as easy to overdo it. Practice makes perfect and you get a feel for it along the way. I ❤️plants"
90,"In addition to giving period supplies, I also have a ""Mom Code"" - when I see a woman struggling with multiple kids, I'll offer a hand. I've carried bags, held a baby, distracted a few toddlers with conversation, held so many doors, carried the end of a stroller up some stairs, and mostly gave the mom a ""you rock"" comment and smile because yeah, I'm still a stranger."
91,"Don’t speak poorly of any other woman. If she is more attractive, thinner, sweeter *praise her.* Life is hard enough, be the sunshine in
Someone else’s day "
92,"My exhusband would turn his phone off and go gamble away what little money he had. He always had some ridiculous excuse for what happened. Once he said he was at the mall shopping for shoes (for 4 hrs) lost his phone so searched all over the mall looking for it before finding it under his car- smashed. He even held out his hand to show me the “smashed” phone - which was just his phone case barely holding on. The phone miraculously started working again the next day. Another time, he told me he was late getting home- and with no money after working all day- because he was gettting gas and his money “must have fallen out of his shirt pocket” and gotten picked up “by a bum”. So, he decided to go back to that gas station and fight that bum - but he never did get his money back. (The truth was he gambled it all away, had no money for bills, and left me worried for hours) 

I divorced him after learning he was taking money out of our small joint savings acct to give me to for bills- thinking I would not notice. I did all the bill paying AND taking care of our child while he played video games and disappeared for hours at a time to go to the gambling boat"
93,"Omg this happened to me! I was really stuck, had no change for one of those stupid bathroom machines, Mother Nature showed up unexpectedly. A random woman I guess overheard me tell my SO in a panic and just ran over to me and gave me some tampons. I was so incredibly thankful ! "
94,"&gt;I said, ""Well, if we're strangers then you'd better not come in"" and shut the door. 

Ha! Awesome! 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, she sounds like a creepy stalker. Must make your husband really uncomfortable at work."
95,"For what’s it worth, it can be broken..."
96,"That I’m a teenager :/ Most recent example just yesterday, a cashier at the liquour store who checked my ID thought I was 19. I’m almost 31. "
97,"Quit my job, and moved to the beach. Decided to live on a way smaller budget and have a simple life. It's been 3 years and it's been the beat decision of my life! "
98,"Lift with your knees, not your back. If necessary, ask a friend to help."
99,"I don't get this. I may see really attractive men, but I would never be so inconsiderate to behave that way and pretend the girlfriend doesn't exist. Well I guess I would never flirt at all cause I'm married, but even if I wasn't i can't imagine being so bluntly rude."
100,"It's giving yourself respect and love. When there's too much, it falls more into narcissism/self-centrism and leads to selfish relationships. When there's not enough, it leads to tolerating shitty behavior and other problems.

I think it starts with accepting everyone has flaws, everyone makes mistakes, everyone improves themselves *after* making mistakes sometimes, different people might reach different points through different ways and times. "

104,"I don't think weed is that great.  While it may not be as addictive as other drugs, I know people who have fucked up their lives after developing a psychological dependence on it.  That being said, I still think it should be legal.

I'm often disturbed by the things people brush off as ""kink,"" and I have a problem with the way BDSM has become mainstream.  I don't think pornography is good for women.  That gets me in really hot water in feminist-leaning places sometimes..."
105,Does anyone else really wanna see pics of everyone else's hot SO? Or is that just me...
106,"Yes! I love my boyfriend dearly, and we do plan to move in eventually, but...he has two teenagers. Moving in = no more lounging about in my underwear, going to the kitchen in the middle of the night buck naked, or peeing with the bathroom door open."
107,"My wife gets this...and she *loves* it. At Costco, she actually walked a woman to where a product was, explained all the features and benefits, how to use it, etc. She was gone for a good 20 minutes. "
108,Oh my god that is so cringey and beyond stupid. 
109,"There's something about me that makes people feel like they can share all of their deepest secrets with me, sometimes within hours of meeting me. To be fair, I honestly don't care about what you did or didn't do. I'm not going to judge you. At the same time I'm not going to be much help because I can't even take care of myself let alone you. "

""So when you coming back? ""

Girlfriend: umm what are talking about?

Me: im at your job buy your bot hear.

Girlfriend: *silence*

Me: are u cheating on me?

Girlfriend: *hangs up* 

She was cheating for weeks and pretending to go to work. I only found out one day because I was bringing her lunch and her coworker said she was off that day. 
She never used to lie to me until then. "
114,lmaoo. He tried this excuse twice but it was months in between so he must have forgotten that he used it the first time
115,"Aww, that’s good she stopped, though! I would 100% not be mad anymore if a girl genuinely didn’t know and apologized. You seem really chill, too, a lot of girls would get territorial/jealous, even if it was a simple mistake. "
116,"Woah. Not only was your boyfriend sexually assaulting/raping you, but your friend found it normal!? I hope you found better friends "
117,"I understand some people think doing that is playful or cute, but even if you're one of those idiots, keeping it hidden for half a fucking hour and DEMANDING HE BUY YOU DRINKS is absolutely insane. How socially challenged do you have to be?

I'm pissed just reading this story."
118,"Absolutely.

I have my “phone voice.” I also use it at work and when I think I don’t want to deal with people who I think might judge me. My son finds my “phone voice” funny and will be in hysterics if I’m calling the doctor or on a work call. It’s the most so-called “standard English.”

I also code switch a bit depending on audience in casual settings. I’m mixed Black and find depending on the people I am with, the side of the family I am with, etc. that I use different words and terms, different “nonstandard” grammatical constructions. This is “casual” spoken English. I’m sure I mix the two a lot, but no ones mentioned it other than maybe ask clarification.


When I am tired or tipsy or emotional or whatever, I have less control over my spoken English and feel as if I probably sometimes “slip.”"
119,"My husband and I often went to this remote but delicious bakery. He was always polite, but he's quite shy and will always happily let me take the lead in public situations. Our third or fourth time in, the owner came up to our table and offered him a job, any time, because the customers were staring at him more than their croissants. He's now been working there over a year and their business has never been better!"
120,"My dad was *super* good looking as a young man. He was extremely popular with the women-6’4”, athlete, thick dark hair, clear blue eyes, and a true southern gentleman, too.

My mom tells the story of a time when they went to an upscale restaurant for an anniversary dinner early in their marriage, and this woman nearby was staring and ogling. It continued until my dad looked deadpan right back into her eyes and picked a booger right out of his nose. 

So out of character for him and to my knowledge he has never done anything like that before or since. "
121,"I had a guy who I broke up with call me crying telling me he got hit by a car and was at the hospital. A few hours later he called me back telling me he was at the gym. I guess he forgot, lol."
122,that's not rude it's psychotic
123,"My bf heats water for my tea when he gets up before me, always comes in to wake me up/say goodbye (depending on my plans for the day) and lastly ALWAYS cuddles me for a couple of minutes when he gets home so we can talk about the day and such "
124,I fucking love living by myself oh my god it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. If I feel lonely I go hang out with friends or get something done but my home by myself is my safe haven and if anyone intrudes it and messes up the energy I have going on here I’d be very unhappy 
125,Marriot room 267. Got it. 
126,"My ex-husband tried to tell me he was very allergic to cinnamon. But he'd eat things that had cinnamon in them like cakes, pastries, etc.  Found out that he just was saying that because he threw up on cinnamon Schnapps one time.  He was an idiot."

131,"Some mutual friends told me that he had cheated on me during a weekend trip. I straight-up asked him about it when he got home, and he said ""No."" Then later, ""It was with another guy, so it doesn't count as cheating."" "
132,"I am not yet half your age, but your post resonates with me. I was never as lonely as I was living together with me ex. I am now living alone, and I have never been happier. My life is filled with love, from my friends, and I take myself on amazing dates. You can be alone without being lonely and you can be lonely without being alone. "
133,"Mine gets hit on allllllll the time but is completely oblivious to it. He used to get free extra food at a few fast food places and thought it was because the ladies were “just being nice.” 

Most notable time that it happened when I was around was when he went into this fancy clothes store. It wasn’t really interesting to me so I went to another store for a few minutes but something told me to go back and check on him. I find him in the dressing room being “assisted” by this young girl who is all over him, helping him change shirts. My presence does not dissuade her though, she doubles down on the “helpfulness” and only stops because he has no clue what she’s trying to do. Bad part is that he still didn’t believe she was hitting on him after I explained it. "
134,Bulltrue!
135,"They eventually left, extremely embarrassed, after about an hour, without giving us any more trouble. He let them get out all their feelings about him, and they went on about how he was ""too nice"" around them, and how they felt like he was flirting with them, and he needed to stop being nice to them if he wasn't interested. He's really not the type to flirt with people, he's just polite and chivalrous in a very southern kind of way. ""Darlin"" and ""ladies first"" and all that. He still acts like that, and still gets a lot of female attention, but I'm good with it. 

This happened in the summer. We'd been dating for a year and a half at this point, and we got engaged the following fall. 

His roommate's mom actually moved in to that apartment soon after this incident, and she yelled at me and was very upset when I told her that we were engaged and moving away. She wanted to keep my SO there, thought he was so handsome and nice, was angry that I was ""taking him away"" from her, etc. "
136,"That he bowled a 300 in a league game.  He even bought a watch that was being sold on Ebay since apparently they give watches to  people who manage that.  When I asked about the name on the back being wrong he said that it was a guy who bowled a 300 the same night and they just got mixed up.  I knew it was a lie but didn't push any farther.  Though when we did visit his home town and the bowling alley he supposedly bowled the 300 in had pictures of 300 bowlers on the wall (without his of course0 he said they had made a mistake lol.  

It was so stupid because I didn't care about bowling and really only attended his league nights because it was a chance to socialize with some mutual friends.  However he hung his hat on that feat both in front of me and his team members.  He was a decent bowler but never THAT good. "
137,"I lived alone for the first time at age 38 (had my son at 20). After two-ish years of living alone I moved in with a boyfriend and that lasted about 18 months before I ended it.

I realized I LOVE living alone. I eat what and when I want, I watch what I want, I decorate how I want, everything is exactly where I left it (I am extremely organized). I can masturbate when I need/want to, which is pretty often (good stress reliever for me). I socialize when I want and can spend a whole weekend not uttering a word if I don't want to.

The biggest thing to understand is that alone and lonely aren't the same thing. You find tv shows, concerts, and activities that YOU like regardless if anyone else enjoys it, too. You get to know yourself and what you want from life and relationships. Living alone is the tits."

139,"My guy and I make bird calls if we lose each other in a store or crowded place.

140,"Work out at least 4-5 times per week
Gave up dairy (looked less bloated, face slimmer, less pimples)
Gave up junk food
Moisturizing every morning and night (glowing skin)"
141,"4 years here. Yeah we do romantic things every now and again, we aren't the most romantic couple though. He bought me flowers last month because I was sad and he wanted to cheer me up; he's just sweet. We try and have a 'date night' once a month, not just going out for dinner but going to the beach, to a nature reserve. My favourite dates have always been the days out together where we find a little cafe/ restaurant wherever we are and eat there.

We still cuddle and have regular sex. We kiss every day, and I insist on good morning and goodbye kisses. We do passionately kiss, and that tends to be when we are starting to fool around. Sometimes it's just nice to have a cheeky snog though isnt it really. We sleep naked and spoon every night, I just feel very intimate when we are doing this.

Basically we fancy each other, so that keeps the spark and we are like best friends too, so that is a strong foundation there.

Oh and I'm a pretty good cook so my SO declares his love for me when I've made dinner; my nan insisted the way to a mans heart is through his stomach after all. I like the compliments and he likes the food, it works."

143,"Ha I did this to a friend once...she was aggressively hyper-competitive about everything which drove me nuts because I hate competing with people, friends especially. So one day we were kayaking and ended up going opposite directions because she couldn’t go faster than me and it upset her (I wasn’t even trying to race but god forbid we just have a fun time). Anyway when I got back to shore she asked me how far I went and I made up a place: “I turned around at that house with the turquoise siding and hot pink shutters” or some such obvious bullshit and her response was “oh yeah that one, I always go a mile or two past that.”"
144,"^ this. I’m a cashier at a pretty popular retail store and whenever an attractive dude comes in with his girlfriend, I all but ignore the guy and just talk to the girl. I try to include him sometimes, but I know I’m a mess around people I find attractive, so I’d rather just talk to the gf."
145,"He lied about being vegan.  He forced me to live a vegan lifestyle for the week he was staying at my house, which I didn't really mind until....I caught him cooking/sneak eating half a dozen eggs.  He literally spread his arms out in front of the stove where he was cooking in the hopes I wouldn't catch him with eggs.  "
146,no it was the classifieds
147,"Don’t come to “askwomen” much but tonight I did and this question has hit me solid. I am 43. I knew at 12 I did not want children. Did not know why, but just knew I didn’t have that THING that a lot of girls and women have that say I WANT TO BE A MOTHER! Magically married a man that agrees. Endured YEARS of my 20s with people saying I would regret it. But ultimately I think it is a common thought and the rest of our “life” (ie family, friends etc) guilt you into questioning yourself. My entire life revolves around kids, just not my own. ALSO, I am always terrified to post anything on here because I am not edgy and clever. "
148,Nice he handled that well. I bet you were glad to hear him say that
149,"My fiance is a hot latino with muscular build. 

He often gets hit on by the Costco receipt checker dude and tells him each time that hes muy guapo. 😂
My mom and I laugh.

My fiance is also back in school and often young women stare him down when he's trying to get snacks from the vending machine or block his way walking playfully.

He's had to make it clear that he should only be bothered for school related things.

Some older woman recently tried to touch his leg while talking to him and he embarrassed the shit outta her by telling her to STOP really loudly.

Most of this happens when I'm not there.
I'm surprised how aggressive women can be to show they are into someone.

For the record, if he were single, he's often said that he loses interest if a girl makes it too easy for him. And I trust him to make boundaries clear.

156,I’m 19 years old and I work at a gas dock on a large lake by my home. I fill up yachts/house boats all day long while sitting in the sunshine. I also collect large tips from drunk boaters and semi creepy old men. It’s easy money. I like to say I have the best job ever! :) 
157,"Lifting weights. I used to be awkwardly skinny as a teen, then when I went to college I noticed my super-skinny-without-excercise days were probably over so I learned how to weight lift from my mom and never went back. Not only is it a great workout but my butt and legs are incredible and I just absolutely love my body and how beautiful and strong it is. It also makes me feel more confident and less stressed. 10/10 would recommend weight lifting (even just light weights) for everyone!"
158,"I ride my bike to work and get around most places. There's not a whole lot of dedicated infrastructure where I live, but it's getting better. A few years ago a separated cycletrack was installed that goes all the way from my neighborhood to downtown. It went along the route I was already biking to work and has made me so much more comfortable and less likely to get killed. It being installed is what made me feel comfortable getting rid of my car, because I'm not scared of riding in inclement weather when I'm separated from traffic.

Anyway, when it was being geared up towards, I said something to a friend about how excited I was. Her response was to ask if there were still any community meetings that she could express her opposition to it. Because she was worried it would make it harder to park during the construction of it (which was mostly just painting lines). And that the street they were installing it on was ""the last north-south street you can still really fly down"" (speed limit is 25mph, most people drove 40+ on it despite it being a residential city street). She was mad that taking away a lane of vehicle traffic would make it harder to speed.

That was pretty much the last time I talked to her on Gchat, and we never hung out after that. The fact that she pretty much said she cared more about parking easily than she did about me not ending up splattered across the road was really terrible to hear.

What's funny is pretty shortly after the lane was installed, the whole road (bike and vehicle traffic) had to be fully closed about a block from her house. Our neglected sewer system combined with years of over use from heavy cars had caused a sinkhole. I'm sure parking was awesome during that ordeal."
159,"I used to be a bully in school and I hate it. I could try and justify my actions, but it was wrong and I shouldn’t have done it. I managed to apologise to the girl I bullied later in life and she accepted my apology. "

161,Bullshit!
162," I do like many others here: have my hobbies, work a lot, see my friends and family. Generally I'm fairly happy. But I want to add that there's no shame in being unhappy every once in a while. Drink some wine, put on sad music or a sad movie and just have a good cry. Afterwards pick yourself back up and go on with life. But evacuating it is very healthy in my opinion."
163,"True love to me is wanting your SO to be happy and putting their needs above yours. (With reciprocation, of course)

It’s blind trust. Knowing they could leave but believing they don’t want to and just enjoying the time you have together. And the time apart.

It’s wanting to be the best version of yourself and being independent. It’s being whole, not a half... if that makes sense.

It’s seeing their flaws but accepting them for who they are and not wanting to change them because nobody is perfect.

It’s enjoying even the mundane things with them. Somehow, cleaning the dishes is fun when they’re in the room.

It’s when they’re the first person you think about when you wake up and the last person you think about before you sleep. And it’s thinking about them all the time in between. Not obsessively, mind you, but things remind you of them.

It’s feeling understood and seen. You don’t have to wear a mask around this person. They love you for who you are and vice versa.

Sometimes I come home and he’s picked up my favorite meal from a Thai food place I love or a bottle of wine. Little things like random kisses and compliments are always welcome. He comes home tired and miserable pretty often but I’ve never questioned if he loved me. 
168,"After telling him I wanted to break up, he told me he got my name tattooed on his ankle because he thought it would make me wanna stay or something. I told him to prove it and he sent me a picture of his ankle with my name written IN RED PEN in his horrible handwriting. Then a few months later we decided to hang out again and when I ask about the tattoo he told me he burnt it off with a lighter. I died laughing and he swore up and down that it was the truth"

He said he was reaching for his glass but my glass ""was in the way and it fell over and broke"". Not really a lie, per se, but a very manipulative way of saying ""I accidentally knocked your glass off the counter while reaching for my own"" where it seems like it's my fault for leaving my glass there not his fault for not paying attention and knocking it over. Glad that marriage is over because that wasn't the smallest example of him doing that - just the funniest. Edit to add: there was also that time he said he was visiting his grandma but I could hear slot machines in the background. LOL"

But now I've got shiny, defined curls that I no longer feel embarrassed of! Just yesterday a random woman in a store said to me, ""Ooh, look at you! You're lookin' so good and curly!!"" and it made me so happy."

We've never been ""romantically inclined"" in the traditional sense. My idea of a romantic surprise is him buying crisps or other stuff I like to put in my mouth on his way home without me asking for it. Passionate kisses? Only during foreplay, much to my detriment. I love kissing, I'd love to make out more and just leave it at that. He's not really interested in that because he associates it with sex. Sweet cuddles, them I get in abundance. We tell each other that we love one another often. And kiss when he gets home, and when one of us goes to bed (we rarely go to bed at the same time.)  


I don't know how we managed to keep it this way. We just kept doing what we've always done? (Except for sex. That frequency has gone down substantially.)"

There is nothing I hate more than an intoxicated driver, or even a driver that's looking down at their phone while going 70mph. I worked with this particular type of research back in college, and even mainly focused, minor distractions affect how a person drives.

182,I came out as an atheist to my parents as a teen. I was raised in a Hispanic catholic home so religion is a huge part of our culture. When I told my mom that I no longer wanted to go to church she told me that she wished I would have a child with disabilities so that I can understand that God is real. Every word in that sentence made my blood boil. The fact that she would wish something so ill would happen to her daughter and her (hypothetical) grandchild pissed me off beyond belief and it made me realize that I did not love my parents and further cemented my atheism. I love and talk to my parents out of obligation but there is no true love there.

184,"Incoming wall, user beware 

Ooooh, man. I got a story for you guys. So, I’m in the Navy, just got to a new base, and I was looking around on Tinder. I found this girl. Ended up matching with her, and went to meet her the next day. She says she’s a Marine, which is weird, cause I can count on one hand the amount of Marines I’ve seen here. Anyways, we go back to my barracks, whatever, adult stuff. End up hanging out everyday, I tell her I like her, she says she feels the same, so we start dating. Fast forward a month or so, I talk to some people about some issues I’m having, and mention the girls name, I got a call about two hours later saying that she isn’t military. We called her recruiter and he tells us that she got separated a month into boot camp. So she’d kept the uniforms she’d been issued and was passing herself off to anyone who’d believe her, as a Marine. I confront her about this, and she said she needed a week to herself to think about this. I was like “You can have all the weeks you want, buttface.” I got a call from a weird number about a week or so later, and it’s some guy claiming to be her husband, he IS a Marine, stationed out in Okinawa. He says this has happened multiple times and apologizes for her. She’s texted me once since then and told me not to talk to her husband. So, in conclusion, not only is she not military, but she’s also married, and I’m not the first guy to fall for this shit. 

Sorry for the wall of text! Hope you enjoy as much as I did! "
185,"Good black or dark colored jeans, because they can be dressed up or down, things that can be layered in order to make more outfits out of the same pieces (so like, cardigans, blazers, button ups, scarves), a loose maxi dress so you can look like you put effort into looking nice while feeling like you're wearing pajamas, stockings (a thin pair and a more opaque pair for winter), I personally hate skirts but ones that are a little flared will make you look curvier if you're not very already. "
186,"183 —&gt; 125-130ish. I’m 5’7” and in my mid-twenties. Took about nine months, have kept it off for a year and a half now. I did old-fashioned CICO, but here’s how I made it work: 

* Most importantly, dieting and exercising weren’t things I viewed as punishments for being overweight. I viewed them as self-care and as rewards. I had been treating my body poorly and decided I deserved better than that. 

* So I started adding short walks into my routine, then periodically increased the frequency and length. I tried to include walking and movement in my daily activities as much as possible. For example, instead of sitting on my laptop looking at memes between classes, I’d go for a walk. Instead of taking the bus a mile to the transfer point that would get me to work, I’d just leave fifteen minutes earlier and walk there. I live in a cold climate, but instead of using that as an excuse, I invested in high-quality winter weather clothes and shoes and learned to love the refreshing feeling of exploring my city with the brisk wind in my face. Using a fitness tracker was extremely useful to keep track of my progress.

* Added strength training after I lost like the first 30 (strength-focused yoga, but I’m trying to get into weight lifting at the moment).

* Cheap, healthy, and fast: pick two. This might be a bit of a hot take among American Redditors but unless you’ve got tons of spare cash to drop at fancy organic restaurants, you pretty much have to make home-cooked meals a regular part of your diet if you want to lose weight and keep it off. Dieting is extremely difficult at best if you can’t or don’t cook. I am a huge foodie and honestly, that never changed. I love to eat food that tastes good. But when I was bigger, I could barely boil a pot of water and was eating tons of calorie-laden fast food. So I taught myself to cook with YouTube videos, starting with easy stuff and gradually moving on to more challenging dishes. Now I am a relatively skilled cook and can affordably prepare my own food that tastes good and is nutritious. It helps to make a large batch of a dish that tends to keep well (like a roast or a curry) and eat it for the rest of the week so you’re not spending a ton of time cooking. Aside from an occasional Chipotle bowl, I’ve pretty much stopped eating fast food.

* Hunger will always be your worst enemy when dieting, so I began viewing my calorie allowance as a budget. Let’s say you are paid $1500 a month. If you spend $1400 of it on scented candles, you’re going to have a hard time paying for necessities with the other $100. Alcohol, added sugar, and refined carbs are the scented candles of calories. So to keep hunger at bay, I generally avoided (and continue to avoid) these things and instead filled up on satiating foods: fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and lots of protein and fat. 

* I learned how to read nutrition labels. Soooo many products will market themselves as “healthy” when they’re actually about as diet-friendly as a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. Calories are not the only number that matters here. When I’m buying a product, I look for, in order of importance: low sugar content (especially added sugar), number of calories that fits my budget (not too high or too low for what I need for that particular meal), low carb content, high fat content, and high protein content. It is better for me to eat a 300kcal snack that is filling than 100kcal of cookies or candy, because with the former I’ll be satisfied and will eat less later, while with the latter it’ll be almost as if I hadn’t eaten at all. So instead of snacking on a yogurt that has 20g of sugar, I’ll go for the beef jerky, sausage and cheese packages, or a granola bar that has great macros (Quest bars are expensive but really can’t be beat in this department).

* I monitored and continue to monitor my weight regularly (bi-weekly weigh-ins, naked, in the morning before I’ve eaten or drank anything and after I’ve used the toilet). I make adjustments when I find it going in the wrong direction. 

* It’s cliche as hell, but it’s cliche for a reason: moderation is good advice. I’m thin and I still drink beer sometimes. I still eat burgers and fries and fried chicken and ice cream. I just don’t consume these things every day. They’re special treats, not staples in my diet. And a lot of times, I do have dessert with dinner — but dessert will be a serving of Halo Top (not the whole pint like they suggest, lol), a square or two of chocolate, fresh fruit, or one mini peanut butter cup instead of a whole piece of cake. I’ve found that telling myself I will never eat anything “bad” again is more self-punishing than productive. Truth is, you don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be consistent. 

I wish anyone reading this the best of luck on your journey! :)"
187,"Erm. Well. If you recall a while back, it came out that Mike Pence refused to meet with senior level government employees who were women because he didn’t want to ever be alone with a woman other than his wife. The result of this is that women in charge, who have worked hard at their careers, have to allow their male employees to report directly to the Vice President when a 1 on 1 security briefing or other top secret meeting needs to take place. Literally, because of Pence’s fear of being accused of adultery or sexism or assault or whatever, these women are no longer allowed to do the jobs they were hired to do. Furthermore, Pence said that he wouldn’t have meals with female colleagues, even in public, because it would feel like he was betraying his wife. Which, of course, means that men who work with Pence have an advantage over women in terms of networking lunches and the like. 

I find this morally reprehensible. I think that it is incredibly wrong to refuse to interact with women in a professional environment simply because you fear a sexually-motivated accusation. Anyways, my dad and brothers are massive sexists. They claim that they should not have to take the risk of a woman making a false rape claim, and that it’s not worth the risk to them to even hire women in the first place, because women will inevitably lie about being sexually assaulted in order to promote their careers. Because it’s just in our natures, of course. 

This whole discussion led to a massive blowout, and my dad told me that he considers me to be sexist against men because I want them to put their reputations on the line by giving women an even playing field. We don’t really talk anymore. "

189,"I think that, under a certain age, kids have a hard time differentiating between being trans and not following sociatal gender norms. And I think some parents are too quick to immediately pull the trigger and change their child’s entire life before it has the chance to get started. To be clear, a kid in middle school has a pretty firm grip on these things and by high school they are definitely old enough to make that life changing distinction, but there’s a celebrity I won’t name who openly talks about their trans two year old and it makes me roll my eyes."

And snuggle sleeping. That's top notch."
192,"My SO is a man, but we go to gay bars sometimes because we’re both bisexual and generally enjoy that scene. It’s always a shitshow. Men can be really awful. One time, he got groped (by another man grabbing his dick) when he was walking out of a bathroom. 

Other than that, I guess the most glaring thing is the fact that we met in the first place because my friend was interested in him and invited him out with us. We didn’t get together until a few months after that had blown over, but she wasn’t too happy.  "

194,"So I saw this super cute guy on a dating website years ago. I looked at his profile and everything was almost perfect, we matched like 92% or something like that. I went through his question/answers first before messaging him and that was when I came across one that asked “ do you consider drugs a romantic activity?” And he put yes. Well my last relationship the guy got high ALL the time and it turned out to be a big deal breaker for me. My parents were into drugs really bad so personally I just try to avoid it all together ( it’s cool if you do it, I just personally prefer to stay away from it). I decided not to message him and went on about my day.  He actually sent me the best opening message I ever received on a dating app a few days later so I opened up the dialogue. I asked him about it after talking for a few days and he said he had never done drugs before and never planned on it, but doing drugs “could be” considered a romantic activity to some people so he put yes. 

Long story short, he still hasn’t done drugs, he still argues technicalities in every argument and it’s the best relationship I’ve ever had. We’re getting married in 5 days.  "

I always take that with a grain of salt, until I learned... they ACTUALLY all did cheat on him, and/or stalk him for a while. He dug up the proof via old texts and screenshots after I voiced my concerns. Having been with him for a year now, I know he's just a sweet guy who wants to give all his love to those he cares about, and was totally walked all over by a few mean girls."
199,"I used to join in when my “friends” were being mean to this nerdy girl, calling her ugly and stuff. Now I hate myself for doing that. All I think is, if someone was saying those things to my daughter, I’d be extremely angry and upset. "

When you see an opening in your schedule, make it a date: nice place, nice restaurant, nice concert tickets, etc. Plan a weekend trip away. Ask if she needs help at home. Since you're working so much and can't be there, to say mow the lawn, see if you can hire someone to support her. Tell her how important she is for her support and how she's the goal you have in sight; she's the light at the end of your tunnel. Stuff like that lol."

My hacks? Learn the scientific name of the plant I just bought before I even leave the parking lot. Get a 3x5 index card &amp; write the scientific name, common names, light requirements, water requirements, and preferred soil conditions. Keep the card near the plant until I can recite that info from memory.

206,"I think choosing not to have children would be more common if people thought more critically about what parenthood really is. I see a lot of emotive reasons people want kids, like having a mini version of them &amp; their loved one to teach their own interests to, having a cute baby, the positive attention that comes with pregnancy, etc. And while none of that is wrong, people I've spoken to tend to come up short when I ask questions like ""what if your child is severely disabled? Autistic? Disobedient and mean?"" 

I see a lot of ""this isn't what I signed up for!"" from parents experiencing those things and the fact of the matter is, yeah, that's exactly what you signed up for: to create a human being separate from yourself with their own quirks, needs, and flaws. My older sister had her first very young so I got to see what motherhood really was on a daily basis.

And I noped outta there fast. I don't want a codependent child sucking up my time and energy when I'm sick, exhausted, or touched out. Other people can and do and I applaud them for it, especially my mother, but more people need to sit down and really do some soul-searching like I did to find out if they have the grace and resolve to raise a child and do it well.

Anyway I kind of forgot about that and then after we were a couple, I remembered and brought it up with him. I explained why it was problematic and I wanted him to really explain himself better. Did he have an Asian fetish? Was he aware of how horrible that is? The dolt then admitted that he didn't have an Asian type at all, that was his way of hitting on me back before we were a couple. He thought I would get the hint and realise he was into me.

243,"Saaaame.

For me personally, I don't take issue with the concept of porn, but the way it operates at the moment, especially with so many viewers lacking proper sex ed, it's a disaster. Years ago, I tried finding porn that I like, but after sifting through so many videos of women getting beat up and degraded, it was just so sad; I had to stop."
244,"My husand and I hooked up at a lake party/BBQ. When he asked for my number I pretended not to hear him because he was so hot that I ""knew"" he was just asking to make me feel good but would never really call. He said because I so soundly rejected him he didn't stop thinking about me. He was attracted to me being ""cool"" which was acfually an act of self protection.


When he saw me on campus 3 months or so later he thought the Stars alligned and approached me at which point I fell instantly, madly, forever in love with him and we got married in a parking lot 6 months later. "

256,"I dated a guy who claimed to be a professional soccer player in Dubai, called bullshit in my head because y'know Tinder makes your bullshit meter pretty sensitive. I go over to his place and he legit has pictures of it on the wall. For once it actually wasnt a lie. "
257,"Similar - I got a cat. I love dogs too but acknowledge they require more training and attention than I know I cannot provide. My cat is super chill and I can leave her at home all day without worrying (not a kitten). Then when I’m home she’ll cuddle with me on the couch or in bed. 

She can also be a little shit at times and annoying af so it’s kinda like a human-human relationship. "
258,"Vaccines. I wouldn't really be in touch with my family nowadays regardless because they are not good, kind people. But back when I was still in touch, we argued about vaccines on... drumrolll: Facebook. (Isn't that where it always happens?)

To be clear, I support vaccination. But this one person in my family is a big anti-vaxxer who makes money from anti-vax blogging, anti-vax ebooks, etc.

I made the grave error of thinking maybe my family members were just mistaken/misled, and they'd understand that vaccination is important if they knew more.

Well, it was not to be. They jumped on me and said how sad they were for me that I was so naive that I was letting my child get poisoned, and then progressed to saying I want their kids dead. Unfortunately, I did not respond with grace. I gave back what I got. I ragequit the thread by saying something along the lines of, ""You idiotic monsters! Have fun at the shitty family parties where you pretend to like each other, and thanks for giving me an excuse to never attend one ever again -- I don't want my child around your potentially disease-ridden offspring."" Then I blocked 'em all.

I do regret how I behaved in the discussion. I can't even imagine reacting quite like that anymore -- I might block people if I got so angry, but I no longer feel a need for parting shots like that. But on the other hand it was probably for the best. I never had to hear from them again."
259,"BDSM culture is about safety and trust more than actual dominance. None of that 50 shades bullshit. Porn is not a good representation either.

My imagination isn't very good at determining what styles would look good on me so I turn to celebrities and bloggers. I googled the celebrities' heights, found the ones who are very similar in height &amp; weight &amp; body type as me. I google their pictures (including from their daily life) for fashion and hairstyles. Even if I don't like what I see, I know what to avoid this way. I follow some make-up bloggers on YouTube who have the same skin shade and undertones. I save some pictures on Instagram or Pinterest for inspiration. They are all super helpful."

When you stop seeing other people’s actions and words as reflections of their feelings towards you and instead see them as reflections of their own desires and feelings, then you can both better understand them and also not take any of their actions or words personally. You’ll stop thinking people are out to get you, and instead you’ll realize how little they think about you when pursuing their own interests.

This isn’t to say that people are inherently selfish or hurtful—I actually believe the opposite. People who love you really will take you into consideration, but the average person doesn’t and you need to move beyond that line of thinking if you want to understand others and be happier with yourself."

Also, just remembering and asking about things I have going on is wonderful.  Just a ""How did that meeting go?"" or a ""Did that new soap live up to the hype?"" can let her know that you're aware of and care about what is happening in her life.

My coworker that was a couple years older than me was fresh from his divorce and asking me about tinder and dating apps. 

I had never deleted my dating apps after I started dating my boyfriend but wasn't using them either. I pulled up tinder to show my friend how it worked and... there was my boyfriends profile in my matched list... with new photos... and his bio only written in his native language.

I was going to go see him in a few weeks and he lied to me about it, 'Oh my friends put it up there, I would never do that to you!' (his friends used to be 'in charge' of his dating profile when he was single). He neither took it down nor said that he was mad at his friends for doing this, like it wasn't the most disrespectful shit ever.

I just sort of bought it for the time being, visited him, and then we broke up almost immediately afterwards.

Turns out he had been cheating on me almost since the moment he got back to his home country. Going through his phone when I visited confirmed that.

The thing that really chapped my ass was that he used photos I TOOK OF HIM and other ones that I was actually in for his profile.

Good riddance to that bag of dicks."
284,How did it end? Did they leave peacefully ? Did they get rowdy? What happened ?!

296,"One of the more entertaining times happened when my husband (then boyfriend) were at a gay bar to support a friend of mine in a band who got to play there.

A (presumably gay) guy started talking to me at one point and then indicated towards my husband and asked “*Hey*, who’s your friend?” I chuckled and told him that was my boyfriend and then the dude was like “Aww, he’s with you? *Damn!*........he’s hot.”"
297,"I agree it should be the same, but as a guy I'm way more confident shutting down a girl who's harrassing me than I would be if a guy bigger than me harrassed me.

But the biggest thing that shows me how much he is attracted to me is that I'll glance up and he'll have this awestruck expression on his face. His eyes will be all lit up and he'll have a really sweet smile on his face as he looks at me.

I wish I could see myself through his eyes, just once. He makes me feel beautiful."
299,"With my then boyfriend, we were trying out an open relationship for the first time. At one point he claimed he had slept with a friend of ours. I quietly dealt with the jealous feelings, rationalized them out and decided I felt fine about it.

I texted the mutual friend and said something along the lines of ""hey it's cool, don't worry about me being all weird or anything"". She informed me that nothing had happened. We have a small heated conversation about it because it didn't make sense to me that he would lie about sleeping with someone if it didn't actually happen. That's the opposite of what people normally do, right?

I confronted him and after much argument and denial he admitted he was testing me to see how I would react. In the end he decided he was correct because clearly I was jealous (I wasn't) and on top of that, that I didn't trust him. We broke up not long after this incident, there was a whole lot of gas lighting and manipulation I didn't see until years later."
300,I make strange noises that make him laugh 
301,"Seriously low on many levels. Hands off! You’re a better woman than I am, cuz I would not low-key hate her &amp; definitely would tell her to step off. 

I say that, but honestly I feel it’s your partner’s job to nip it on the bud. I’ve been with guys who got hit on a lot and asked that they do it themselves to remove me from the drama. Sometimes guys can’t tell when a woman is flirting, so I’ll tell them, but it’s up to them from that point."

It feels like a productive or useful thing to do, but the truth is we don’t have any control whatsoever. And 99% of the time our worries are just worries, not reality.

Everything on the show is way more sexualized and almost all the main female characters have been raped or assaulted. I'd understand if the rape scene was an important part of the plot, but often times it's a casual thing that's never mentioned again. I hate how the writers casually throw in violence just to make the show more ""exciting."""
331,"My fiancé (A) had a female friend who would text and call him at ungodly hours because he was apparently ""the only person she can talk to"" and occasionally she would just show up at his house unannounced. Every time we ran into her, She would start off with saying ""HI A!!!!"" and hugging him, giving me the cool once over like ""oh, it's you."" and then she would talk about her new guy and how he was a douche and say she wished she could find a good guy like A. She'd also find a way to be too close and have at least something touching him during the conversation, which made him uncomfortable but he couldn't say because she was the type of person to blame it on a ""clingy girlfriend."" Last time she did this, I had to leave suddenly so I wrapped my arm around his waist and kissed him before leaving and she looked like I had slapped her. He says she walked off soon after I left. "

340,"I dated a woman for a long time who had something of a “watch me get hit on” fetish. She loved us to go into bars and clubs separately, as if we weren’t together. She would get approached by guys non-stop...and would steal glances at me to make sure I was watching. After we left together, she wanted me to tell her all about it. Sometimes, even if we WERE at a place together, she’d ask a guy who was obviously interested (and more than once, a woman) to sit with us. 

But my favorite time was the time a guy didn’t even really try to hit on her. We were walking into a convenience store together, and I held the door. She went in, and I continued holding the door for a guy coming out of the store. 

Instead, he brazenly stopped, turned, watched her walk across the store. After several seconds, he finally turned back to me. “That your girlfriend?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said, thinking I might be in for a confrontation.

“Holy shit,” he replied. “I’d love to get into that.” Then he walked out the door and left."

344,"My bf has some lingering frat boy traits and grew up in a boys only household. What everyone here would call emotional/verbal abuse he would call ""just busting my balls"". I passively tried to correct it and he'd tone it down for a couple days until one night we had a huuuuuge fight over something he called me. I slept in the guest room. He called his dad the next day and got some advice. We had our first ""real"" relationship conversation after work that night, boiled down to I'm not his brother or his frat brother or one of his bro friends and I'm not going to tolerate being talked to like I am. He flipped whatever switch in his head needed to be switched. It's been months and he still slips up sometimes but almost always catches himself and apologizes. He expresses thanks for what I do around the house more often. I'm really glad we had the convo and he had a chance to prove he could be better instead of me ranting to r/relationships and being told to ditch him which probably would have fed into my anger and I would have done it. Long lasting relationships take more effort than that."

347,"A guy I dated back in the late 90s/early 00s did this too, only it took me much longer to figure out it wasn't him singing since it was before stuff like Shazam and Google. He gave me an mp3 of a song that he and his friend supposedly made on their computers. It was a good song, I was really impressed for 2 amateurs. A decade later I was listening to random stuff on my phone and that mp3 came up next, and out of curiosity I googled the lyrics. I was suspicious cause I ended up leaving that guy over him telling me numerous lies. Sure enough, not him. Dirty Epic by Underworld.

And, despite having a child, I was as thin as I was in high school, had a great job and husband...my life was perfect. My HS bff called to let me know there was an informal reunion on the weekend I was back in town for a different event for the graduating class of my year. I hadn’t been to any before because I didn’t graduate front that school. But I was willing and eager to go. All the mean girls were VERY nice to me, and asked how the last 20 years had been, and really seemed to admire what I had become. It was a great feeling. Of course, I also felt REALLY bad about when I first walked in, I saw several of the meanest mean girls and immediately judge, and was very satisfied with, their looks: fat, wrinkled and matronly. I think I temporarily became a mean girl out of some resentment I didn’t know I held. "
349,"We were at a water park together and he had to go to the bathroom. I was waiting outside for him, kinda off to the side. This groups of 3 maybe 17 year old girls were there, and when he walked out he walked past them and one of them said “oh my god he is so fucking hot”. He walked right up to me and i, being petty, kissed him and looked back at the girls and winked. 

Girls flirt with him all the time. He denies it but i think he’s just trying to make me feel better haha. "
350,So the husband called the guy his wife cheated with and apologized to *him*? She must *really* be a piece of work. 
351,"This !! Recently I watched a ted talk about women needing to empower each other (forgot the name of the speaker) and she said something that really stuck with me. She's like ""looking at other women is like looking at a mirror"". Overall was an awesome talk "
352,"Maybe this is a weird thing to say and maybe it's just me, but the Real Housewives franchise on Bravo. And for full disclosure I still do watch the NY episodes because I can't help myself and I'm a dirty hypocrite, but most of it just seems like a bunch of women tearing each down and degrading themselves on national tv while a man (Andy Cohen) looks on with glee and profits handsomely. It's epic snark material, but garbage like ""naked wasted"" is just ugly imo."
353,I dont even have a dick and I just cringed
354,"I made a comment against sex tourism especially to developing countries and I got downvoted so hard by a bunch of guys who think “it’s great for the local economy!” and “they must enjoy the work if they’re doing it, they could work in a factory or something.”"
355,"If a lady comes and asks you for help? try to help them.   
It could be an emergency or some creep is bothering her, etc.,          "
356,"Hahah this is amazing, your wife sounds lovely! "
357,"So, this is really petty. I had some Zwetschgen (a sort of plum) trees flown in from my great-grandfather's stock (he was an impassioned fruit tree breeder) in Germany and planted them in our garden, much to the amusement of the women in the village who didn't think they'd take to the conditions here and anyway, bloody *notions*. 

The trees have really thrived and this year I have more Zwetschgen than I know what to do with so I made huge quantities of Zwetschgenkuchen (Zwetschgen cake) and took it round the village yesterday. Today everyone's been ringing the house about how good the Kuchen was and when I'm next baking. 

I'm just quietly having a party for myself right now, though externally I've been totally magnanimous."
358,"Had been dating a guy for a while in high school, we really hit it off. Definitely a great connection that I felt like was really special and we loved spending time together. He had met a lot of my family and I had met some of his, as well as a lot of his closest friends (we went to different schools). 
A family party was coming up that I invited him to and he had confirmed a few days before that he’d definitely be there.
Then all of a sudden, day of the party, I don’t hear from him. So I text him a couple times wondering what’s up and when he finally replies he says that he‘s in Venezuela and, also, he wants to break up. 
Wouldn’t give me any details, eventually just stopped replying. Never talked to him again. Still have no idea what happened or why he came up with the world’s most ridiculous excuse to not see me. I refer to him as “Venezuela guy” when I tell stories from that period of my life. "
359,"Yeah, I was a mean girl. My best friend and I were total plastics/cheerleaders in middle school/high school. I don’t think I outright bullied anyone but I definitely thought I was better than others and was probably rude. 

Long story short, I ended up transferring to an all girls school halfway through high school and had to make all new friends which really put me in my place so to speak and I didn’t care anymore about being hot or popular I was just happy to have good friends. And my best friend ended up getting hit by a car and killed. I’d do anything to have her back. 

I’m sorry to anyone I was mean to. I was young and stupid but that’s no excuse. "
360,"**""If it matters you'll find a way, if it doesn't you'll make an excuse.""** Ever since seeing this on a motivational poster in the women's gym when I was 14, I've applied it to so many situations in my life. While it was originally what I told myself to force my ass to the gym, it's now something I also apply to all of interpersonal relationships (especially boy drama.) If someone actually cares about you, they'll show it. If they don't, they'll make excuses."
361,"He said he thought I was really caring. 

He got a cold not long after we started dating and I made and brought him soup. He was amazed. He said his ex would have never brought him soup or come to take care of him. He told all his friends about it like it was the greatest thing ever.

...yeah, the bar was set pretty low. Glad I could make him happy though!"
362,"Same!! I was grocery shopping the other day, and while I was trying to decide which cheese to buy, a stranger asked me if I was okay because I looked so sad. Nope- not sad, just trying to decide between muenster and cheddar."
363,The cuddling. 
364,"I introduced myself to my nosy elderly neighbors. They know everyone, everything, and spend most of their day staring out the window watching people. If something seemed off, they’d know. I also have yappy dogs that bark if there’s even a strong gust of wind so no one is getting in to this house unnoticed. "
365,Any time I talk about sexual harassment or sexual assault 
366,"A tad expensive, maybe, but hair extensions changed my life! 

I had them put in in March, I was growing out really short hair, looked nothing like what I wanted and had let myself go.

As soon as I got the hair extensions, I was eating properly, drinking correct amounts of water, walking with better posture, looking after my skin. 

People who haven’t seen me in a while don’t recognise me (and the extensions are out!)"
367,Having someone to go with me on bookstore runs. Then sitting together in bed reading the books we bought.
368,"Nothing crazy but me, my SO and friends were at a bar in London, walking back inside from the smoking area and we passed his guy with his friends, when my SO walked past him he gasped, covered his mouth before saying “he is the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen”. I laughed so much especially because my boyfriend hates attention and he’s straight so didn’t know how to react to male attention haha. 

His piercing, baby blue eyes and his straight, white cheeky smile really gets him the attention, bless him hahah. "
369,Recent politics....need I say more???
370,"The one that surprised me was “friends”. I loved that show when I was younger, but watching it today the sexism and homophobia is uncomfortable.

I’m a big fan of Star Trek as well, and the original series is definitely sexist as hell, but I try to view it through the 60s lens. I can filter out some of the stupid stuff because of the good they were attempting to do. But it can’t be ignored."
371,"Find the source of your need to get validation.

As for myself going to therapy made me realize I was in a desperate state of lack of validation throughout my life. I grew up in a dismissal dynamics where all members of my family prefered to ignore any emotions, they'd only react to my anger.

"
372,"I mean, I’m a wheelchair user, so lots of crappy stereotypes around that..."
373,I got second-hand annoyed just reading that story. I wonder what (if any) sort of spin the girl put on the story later to make herself look like the victim. 
374,I work for a handbag designer as assistant designer! I love my boss who has been like a mentor to me after graduation. Its a small company so I get to help out with everything from design to social media to inventory. Its a lot of low risk problem solving that I love!
375,"OMG that is horrible. I'm glad he stopped it at that point, and I hope she got booted from the lab."
376,"Yes, although I think most people do. If not, all. "
377,"This is my parents' marriage.  Everything my father does, he finds some roundabout way to say is my mother's fault.  If he knocks her glass over, he'll yell that she ""left it on the edge"" on purpose to trick him into knocking it over."
378,"Sorry.... What about having a child with disabilities proves there's a God? Because you stopped going to church and are being punished? Sweet, definitely the God I want to put my faith in.... "
379,"Every year since I started working, I always made sure I was off on my birthday. Then my birthday usually consists of sleeping in, my partner likes to give me the sexy spa treatment, and then I smoke a shit ton of weed and eat a pint of icecream. "
380,Because for some people it can be hard to tell what’s “being friendly” and what’s “being hit on” and even if you’re 99% sure you’re being hit on that 1% can make you not want to presume and can make you feel like it would be arrogant to say “I have a girlfriend/boyfriend” out of the blue. 
381,"All of these stories just remind me how awful women can be to other women. I’m so grateful none of my girlfriends have ever been so competitive, territorial or caddy. How brutal! "
382,those rlly big muffins
