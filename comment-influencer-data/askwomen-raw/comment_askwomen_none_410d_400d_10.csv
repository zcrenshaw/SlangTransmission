0,"When my grandma died we found out that she had bought rings when each of her children and grandchildren were born. The rings had their birthstones and she would wear the rings at every special event for that person. 

She did this so when she passed we would have something that reminded us of all the great memories we had with her instead of all the memories we would never make. We would be able to wear these rings and know she was with us. 

There are many pictures of her at my birth wearing my ring, at my heart surgery, my birthdays, my graduation, and no one thought anything of it because grandma looooved her jewelry."
1,"Men have many struggles, but a very small thing that I noticed is that they rarely get complimented, especially on their looks or the way they dress/present themselves. Usually when I compliment a man, they just look so flattered that I can tell they don't get enough positive reinforcement like that in their lives."
2,"I went through a horrible breakup (first relationship, lasted five years and wrecked us both). My ""friend"" was there for me when I was recovering. He'd drop by when I was at work to make sure I was okay and would message me constantly. 

After a few months, he encouraged me to pursue a mutual acquaintance (who he said was into me). It turned out the mutual friend had no interest in me and rejected me on a night out. 

My ""friend"" was sleeping on the couch at my place that night. I was drunk. He cornered me in my apartment, told me that he loved me and forced himself on me. My dog, God rest her soul, saw I was in distress and bit him. I got away from him, locked myself in my room and just waited until he left the next morning. 

After that, he tried to pretend nothing had happened. I completely avoided him. Years later, after I was married, we were both celebrating a mutual friend's birthday and he followed me home. I didn't know what to do so I asked my husband to come and meet us. My ""friend"" got the message and left.

Later on, I got an abusive message on social media saying that I was just with my husband for his money and that I'd regret choosing him over my ""friend"". 

A few years later, he got married and he sent me photos of him on his wedding day with the message ""look what you are missing out on, bitch"" (I paraphrase). Recently, he tracked me down on Twitter and sent me a link to him masturbating.  I contacted his wife but they've split up, hence the renewed interest in me."
3,The limit does not exist.
4,He had been abusive and was an alcoholic. He cheated on me and blamed it on my family and tackled me when I tried to leave. So I played along and agreed we'd get married in and move to another state away from my family. I was supposed to meet him there and get married the day I arrived. I never got on the plane and changed my phone number and quit my job. 
5,"What are you doing this weekend?

Ohhhh, gurl.  Imma get my hickey redone."
6,"KIND OF overheard in the women's bathroom but...One time my friend and I were in the women's bathroom and she was talking about how she only dates tall guys.  I was telling her that some short guys can be pretty hot and she'd do better to expand her horizons and then we heard a guy's voice from the AC vent that went between the womens and mens bathrooms: ""I'm 5'6"" and I would rock your world!"""
7,"Not me, a friend.

The day of the wedding we were with her at a beauty centre. She had her wedding ring on. But when we were out she didn't have it. Don't know if it was lost or stolen She was definitely sad but not breaking the wedding sad.

When her fiancé found out he went on full beast mode that made her cry. And accused her mother of stealing the ring. He and her mother had troubles before. But no way her mother stole it.

He apologized and the wedding went on. But at the alter he joked about it or something and she couldn't take it anymore and just walked away. She knew he'd never let it go."
8,I lost over 30 pounds. The only person to say anything was a very nice trans woman at work. Not even my wife.   
9,"Well, I spent the past decade looking for a woman and then fell in love with a man, so... not very much. Though he's 5'3"" with long hair and gets catcalled by confused drunk guys all the time, so that's not actually that different."
10,"If it doesnt have sweat, 4-5 weeks hA HAHAHA IM SO FUCKING SORRY"
11,"I think the most succinct way I’ve heard someone describe it was: “men are disposable, women are exploitable” "
12,"I overheard a little girl in the bathroom with her mom gasp and cry ""mommy, you're bleeding!!"""
13,"Sensitive badasses, such as Leela (Futurama) and Katara (ATLA). They're some of the toughest ladies around but that doesn't mean they aren't in touch with their sentimental side. Better still, they aren't even ashamed of it. It's an asset. Hell yeah."
14,"I was helping to pack up the estate of my sister-in-law’s mother who had recently passed away (colon cancer at 55, a fucking tragedy). She was super nice and proper, worked in accounting her whole life.

Anyway, she has an absolute arsenal of sex toys. Just about every kind you can think of. Makes me smile to this day. RIP, you freaky badass woman."
15,"It was something super small. My friend was getting dressed for an interview- he was putting on a tie and for some reason he was having a really hard time straightening it. So I volunteered to help him out. He stood there, constantly ruffling his hair, and grumbling about how I was ""the mum"" while I asked him to shut up and stand still. Something changed for me at that moment in the friendship, maybe it was the combination of the easy camaraderie and a sudden rush of intimacy. I was never able to simply think of him as a friend since. "
16,"My mom loves to tell the story about this one time she took me in the stall of a crowded department store bathroom with her when I was of potty training age. Apparently, she had to drop a deuce and when I detected what was going on I started gushing, ""Good job, Mommy! You did a good poop!!"" Since that's what would happen when I was seated on the throne, I thought it was only natural that my mother get the same treatment. The whole ladies' room had a chuckle at that one."
17,"Keep doing the things you did before you met them. Don’t neglect your other friends, make it a point to meet up with them a few times a month without the new SO. Keep doing hobbies and activities you enjoy. Some of those you can invite the new SO to join you in, if you’d like, some you should do on your own. Encourage your SO to do the same, both with friends and hobbies. It’s HEALTHY to have separate lives. 

If you need to, limit the amount of time you spend together. You don’t have to be with your new person every day; too much time together too quickly can backfire and become grating rather than enjoyable. "
18,days???? I am way past measuring it in days 
19,"Based on these comments I need some self reflection on my bra washing habits, or lack there of."
20,Communication. Paying attention to their partner and how they respond. 
21,The willingness to show concern over the big things and laugh off the small ones. I don’t want to have sex if it’s not both an intimate bonding experience and just a whole lot of fun at the same time. 
22,Because he was an orthodontist named Barry
23,"Apparently, my paternal grandfather showered a lot more attention on my dad's sisters and random people from my grandfather's church than he ever did to my father. He would regularly write letters, call them up on the phone, and have lunch or dinner with them, even when my grandfather was in the hospital for months at a time.

My grandfather *never* called my dad, even on his birthday. Any communication with my dad's parents started with my dad. We didn't think too much of it because we assumed this was how my grandfather was, since my dad said often that his parents weren't very emotionally connected to him and his sisters even when they were young.

Let's just say that my dad was *livid* when he found out about this at the funeral, having to hear many, many people get up and talk about how my grandfather mentored them and kept frequent contact with them."
24,Testicles. 
25,You can't be emotional without being criticized. Rarely being capable of talking to your friends openly about your feelings. 
26,"My “ideal” was always the on-the-go powerful businessperson with many degrees, the “life of the party” person who owns a room the moment they walk in. I dated a lot of them probably because I grew up around a lot of them.

My SO never went to college, is happy with his life, and would rather cook with me and have people over for dinner than be out at the fanciest restaurants. He’s amazing. 

It turns out I needed a sweet nurturer more than a powerful leader."
27,My grandfather never talked about his WW2 service. I found out after he died that's because he survived the Bataan Death March. 
28,"not so much a conversation but this poor girl was wayyyyyy too fucking drunk to get her body suit done back up. her more sober friend had to go into the stall and was like talking to her the whole time, saying things like “okay i have to put my hands *down there* to do up the snaps okay?” she pulled up her friends shorts. she was just full mom at this point. like it was so PURE honestly. and i was drunk too so i was just like dang... i wish this girl was my friend too. "
29,"I was 22, he was 23. We’ll celebrate 30 years of mostly wedded bliss in March. It’s been amazing and I can’t imagine any other life. "
30,"I love when female characters are smart and perceiving - like Skylar in Good Will Hunting. She is caring, but not overly sensitive. And she is smart, but not judgemental.

I often think female characters are either completely controlled by emotions, or completely emotionless. "
31,"My mom left my dad at the altar. I guess she got to the parking lot and just realized what a mistake the whole thing was. I guess he was a super controlling alcoholic, and despite having a good paying job was super cheap. So she'd paid for her own wedding ring and the entire wedding herself without him contributing anything. She realized it was one thing to put up with that shit herself, but she didn't want a kid to grow up around that. 

She told her best friend to tell everyone to enjoy the catering and the party she'd paid for but she wasn't going to be there and drove off. "
32,"In eighth grade, depression hit me really hard. I cried myself to sleep most nights, and when I wasn't crying myself to sleep, I was passively hoping I just wouldn't wake up.

Every once in a while during that time, I would dream about being in a relationship with one person or another. Those dreams were characterized by this warm, safe, calm feeling of being loved and protected. The man I'm about to marry makes me feel exactly the same way. I guess you could say he's my ~dream guy. "
33,"I had a big realization in my life about this. It all boils down to the person you date will never meet all of your needs, so don't rely on them to do so.

Lots of posts saying the symptoms (keep contact with friends, stay busy) but the problem for me was relying entirely on my SO for my entire happiness.

For example, my current SO is not into sports and I love them, so I made sure that I didn't rely on her to play soccer with me and instead joined as an individual onto a league so that I wasn't reliant on her to meet that need. "
34,"What. The. Actual. Fuck?

I am so sorry you had to go through something like this.. damn.. 

Does he still try contacting you? You should get a restraining order and file a case against him for harassment, if you haven’t done it already."
35,"If you're suffering from acne, blackheads, or any other skin issues, then wearing foundation to cover it can be a bit of a minefield. If someone notices you're wearing foundation as a man you could end up getting made fun of/criticised even more than you would have had you just gone without.

Additionally, I wouldn't say this is unique to being a man (because in my experience most women who are considered ugly or even just plain go through this too) but since reading Reddit I've come to feel that a lot of men feel like they're inherently unwanted and undesireable to women. Women, particularly attractive women, are objectified and bombarded with sexual harassment, told daily that their only worth is how attractive they are to men, that they'll ""expire"" and be useless after a certain age (25, 30, 35... even 18 in some particularly psychotic circles). Men, on the other hand, seem to get the message that they are purely functional beings with no attractiveness or desirability whatsoever. That seems to lead to a lot of men desperately seeking some confirmation that it's possible for women to actually desire men physically. It can't be a nice feeling to have."
36,"Baldness. It's just the luck of the genetic draw. Guys I know, who in school had gorgeous, thick manes of hair, are now receding and having to either shave it all off or cover with hats. It sucks that something which was once part of your identity can be snatched away like that. Products aimed at artificially creating hair (toupees, sprays) seem to have tragic results."
37,"My friend did this.

We were all in undergrad together. She had a colossal crush on a classmate. He was meh about it, but they were really good friends. She seemed to move on and dated someone else junior and senior year. 

Then everyone moved on to grad school, some in different countries, including her crush. She met someone else there and fell in love, they shared hobbies, even had a photography page on Facebook together... The works. They dated for four years and finally decided to get married. 

Two months before the wedding, she decides to take a trip all by herself to the US, where her crush was. We find it weird, but her fiance is cool with that, what's our problem. I meet up with her, she's tense about the wedding. Having never been anywhere close to an altar, I thought that was what people felt pre-wedding. She leaves on a camping trip with the ex and her college roommate for a week. The next day I'm walking around town and run into the college roommate and I'm like wtf. She was apparently never part of the plan. But the fiance's cool with it, who am I to judge.

She comes back from the trip and is a little weird and tense. We go shopping for some stuff, and I notice she's paying with the crush's credit card. I remember thinking 'what a nice guy he is, but she's an investment banker, doesn't she have her own money?'. 

Anyway. She goes back home, posts all the pictures on Facebook, then is posting wedding countdown pictures.... 

Then one day I want to clip one of the pictures for my tinder profile and look for it on Facebook. It isn't there. Heck, I can't even find her on Facebook. 

Then I hear from someone else that she walked out on the groom because she was still in love with the crush guy, and he finally reciprocated two days before the wedding. 

Now she and crush guy are married and have kids. I really can't get over the shittiness of stringing the fiance along and publicly embarrassing him by walking out on the wedding day. But well, it's better than being married to someone and being in love with someone else, I guess. "
38,I got divorced young. 
39,"We were laying on a dock at night, stargazing. I realized “wow, this is romantic as hell” and started to think about who I could bring to the dock with me next time. Only person I could think of was him. "
40,"I collapsed, fell unconscious, and stopped breathing, and she was able to call 911 and get an adult to start CPR. At age 9, she saved my life. "
41,"how much more difficult it seems for many of them to find women to date. i think my partner is a total catch, but i'm also his only-ever girlfriend where i've had several.

also boners seem really damn inconvienent and embarrassing. at least if i get turned on randomly, no one has to see it."
42,"I went to the restroom during my little cousins B'nai Mitzvah. (I hope i used the correct term, my boy and girl cousin were both celebrating) .. So the party was pretty ""lit"" the kids were going nuts and I was around 22 years old at the time. I had done my little cousins make up before the party, she wanted eye liner and smokey eyes so I went in hard and made her look like a rock star!  I was finishing up in the restroom and a group of about 6 girls were all fighting about who knew my little cousin longer. 13 year old girls were going at it hard. ""Well I've been going to camp with her since we were 5"", ""well she's my neighbor"" ""I slept in her hotel room with her last night"" ""We've known each other since we were in diapers so I obviously win"" .. I was cracking up. I washed my hands and turned to them and said, ""I was there when she was born and I got to do her make up for her today"" .. got em! Their eyes lit up, the leader of the pack immediately wanted eye liner and one girl asked how old I was, when I told her I was 22 she was shocked and wanted to know more and if I was drinking alcohol. They all agreed that I knew her the longest and the most. Kids are so cute. "
43,"I had a casual friend, someone who was just part of the group I hung with, started flirting with me. I told him I was flattered but as he knew, I had a boyfriend (we were long distance at the time). He cooled it and I thought it was done. My Bf and I lived in cities about an hour by plane apart so it was pretty common for us to hop a flight one way or the other to visit each other overnight or for the weekend and we are both soccer fans. So anyway one weekend my Bf flew in and we were going to the local soccer bar to watch his team and then my team play because they were back to back and then figured we'd take a walk or hit a museum in town before I had to drop him back at the airport. 

So casual friend asks if he can also meet us for soccer. It's in a public place so I was like ""it's a free country, I guess."" He shows up 20 minutes into the game and throws a fit because bf and I are sitting on a booth seat and there's ""no room for him"" although we had saved him a chair. He then proceeded to grill my Bf. ""You came here just to watch soccer with her?"" ""Yep"" ""You must loooooooove soccer"" ""something like that"" ""don't you have places in your city to watch soccer?"" ""Somehow the experience is just better here"" etc

After the games I was like ""ok well we're off"" and he threw a fit saying he thought I was spending the day with him and told my boyfriend I'd promised him on the phone a whole day to which he responded ""I was there and she literally didn't.""

I didn't see him again for a few months until I ran into him at a group dinner and he said he'd parked near me and could he walk me back to my car. He then proceeded to look around at lights on in office buildings and wondered if anyone was having sex in any of them, then asked me if I would want to have sex in an office because he'd be more than happy to.

I got to my car, blocked him on all social media and told my friends not to include me in any event he was invited to.

To this day he tells people he let his guard down with me and I trampled his heart like so many women had before me. 

Although I now live in the bf's city and we're getting married in November so there's that."
44,"on dating sites the first thing is using pet names like sweetheart, honey ect straight away. "
45,"Men don't seem to be allowed to like children and babies how women do. My husband loves kids, but sometimes he gets these looks when he smiles back at one like at the grocery store. Some people just have to think there's something creepy going on when a guy is kind to children."
46,I think it’s fine. Better than some poor girl irl experiencing whatever it is they’re asking about if it’s something cringey or rude 
47,"My great aunt had a back street abortion in WW2. Her husband was at war, reported missing, and she didn’t hear any more news. She feared the worst. She then hooked up with a passing Canadian soldier and got pregnant. She already had two small kids so it wasn’t really ideal. Then she got word that her husband was coming back, so she got an abortion. My grandmother pretty much shunned her for life after this. My great aunt’s husband never found out. "
48,"I love female characters that are not traditionally feminine but still have traits like compassion and emotional intelligence rather than just acting like a male action hero. Imperator Fusiosa, Ripley from Alien, Yara Greyjoy, etc.

I also like small, irreverent girls who act a bit basic sometimes but are actually strong and dangerous as hell, like Buffy Summers."
49,"The pressure a lot of them seem to feel not to show any ""weakness"". 

Anecdotally, it seems to just end up manifesting as resentment or anger instead which isn't any better than just showing that ""weakness"" in the first place.

Sure some people might think I'm a ""hysterical woman"" if I cry but at least there's no stigma about me leaning other people for emotional support. "
50,"75% communication/willingness to please and 25% technique. A lot of guys are ""good"" in that they know how to thrust properly and have decent stamina but could care less about how it feels for me and are just trying to get off themselves. I've even been in relationships where the dude would just hop off me as soon as he came, then would roll over and fall asleep without even considering my orgasm. Not being able to make a girl cum in 2 minutes is fine, but not caring about her pleasure at all is not. Poor technique can be made up for with good communication and enthusiasm, and will hopefully evolve into improved form. Lack of respect for one's partner is a whole nother story.

Honestly as long as a guy displays a desire to fuck me and make it good for me rather than only thinking about himself, I'd consider him ""good in bed."""
51,"Not the greatest I guess but. In Junior High my daughter was being harassed by a guy. School never did anything about it. The last straw was when he started to call her a whore in the lunch room. She freaked on him, punched him and knocked him down. He got back up and went after her, she stood her ground and when he went to hit her a teacher broke it up. They ended up in court and the Judge freaked on the guy and her charges were dismissed. They both received a 10 day suspension. I know fighting is wrong, but no one else would do anything about the sexual bullying etc. She was much smaller than this guy and she put him in his place. It wasn't right but it ended it."
52,"This is how I feel about Hermione Granger -- she's the brilliant bookworm, but she's also the most emotionally intelligent of the HP trio, by a *mile*. "
53,"Almost all variations of Scottish, Welsh and Irish accents.

ps Midwest accents are very cute!"
54,"Fashion is my main hobby, and I love the options that are available to me. Men have fewer options, and the options aren't as diverse or interesting. I think it would be much harder to have fun with fashion as a man while still adhering to gender norms.  "

56,"We we're 22 and it was hard. We have very little support of our marriage and we had to endure growing and changing a lot! 
After 5 years of marriage and a toddler in tow we separated for a year and a half. I had PPD and PPA really bad, we lived far from family and had no support system. I needed more than he could give at the time.
As a result we co-parented and went to family therapy so we could do better. Ended up building a friendship that we didn't have before and moved forward with living together again. We are celebrating 10 years of marriage and I can honestly say I am married to my best friend. "
57,"Everything related to aging. Wrinkles, grey hair, etc all make a man look ""wise"" and ""dignified"" and they get to be ""silver foxes"" while women are just called old hags if they dare to have a wrinkle or a strand of grey. "
58,"I know this is the “AskWomen” subreddit, but I love this story so much. One time at the movie theaters I was washing my hands and these two guys doing their business on the toilet we’re having a small conversation. Nothing weird or hilarious until the end, one of the guys goes “Ope, there’s no toilet paper in here. Have any you can spare in there” and the other guy follows up with “Of course I have.. oh dear god.” Neither had toilet paper, to this day I still crack up hearing the terrifying realization of “Oh dear god” "
59,"Girl 1: so I’m allergic to nuts but not peanuts. 

Girl 2: how is that possible?

Girl 1: so like, they said peanuts aren’t real nuts.

Girl 2: that’s insane.

I wanted to pop out of the stall and say “it’s a legume!!!” But decides against it. They should stay amazed. "

61,"My aunt became a huge feminist when her children were toddlers. She had apparently been raped at a bus stop in front of them and that moment completely changed her life. Unfortunately for her, she was killed by her husband, my uncle, in a murder-suicide. She was gone way too soon and I wish I knew her as an adult since she died when I was in middle school. I feel that I could have learned a lot from her. "
62,"Oh man, I have some great stories. The most generic Nice Guy one started with a guy I met on tinder. Before we even met he sent me a long message detailing how he ""really wanted a friend"" and if things didn't work out romantically he still wanted to talk to me, etc, which was nice. For the first few days or so he was really mellow and liked talking about class and college. We got along fine, I wasn't feeling sparks but he was nice and I wanted to be friends. Then he started constantly talking about sex and his ex-gf and how she was a ""nympho"" and he had a super high sex drive and wow I was so hot. I told him I wasn't that into talking about sex with someone I hadn't met and he cooled off. But the next day he was super pissy. When I finally asked about it, he told me he was upset because last night (when he was talking about fucking his ex) he was clearly depressed and I didn't pick up on it. He then told me I was an idiot because guys only talk about their ex when they're depressed so it was really obvious, I was just a complete moron. He ended it by saying he didn't want to talk to me anymore. I apologized and said if he was really depressed I'd still be willing to help if he changed his mind. 5 seconds later he messages back, ""hey. I've changed my mind, I am really depressed and you're the only one I want to talk to rn."" Thinking he needed a friend I messaged back ""Okay, what do you wanna talk about? How can I help?"" and he FLIPPED OUT. I got page after page of text screeching about how I should be flattered he still wanted to talk to me and all I could do was ask him how HE felt? Was I too dumb to come up with a subject by myself? He was depressed! How dare I ask him if he wanted help! When I didn't respond for a full day, he blocked me and I actually was relieved. The end. "
63,"Not much. But only because I think I had very low expectations. I didn't really have any models of healthy relationships in my life. My SO has exceeded what I thought I was looking for in a partner. I think before I met him, if I listed all the things that make him amazing, I would have said I was being unrealistic."
64,"Can I just say, I love you all and thank you for making me feel so normal!! "
65,"A massive personal reg flag for me is pushiness. I have had some encounters where the men took a ""no"" to mean a soft yes, and they kept badgering me to change my mind.  More often than not it is about really inane things- and they always make me think- ""If you can't respect my boundaries with something this small, how likely is it you wouldn't listen to me about bigger things?"""
66,"He was supposed to be my friend, then out of the blue he was convinced that I wasn't biologically woman. He said I look and sound feminine on all accounts but since I had pic of my male friend holding a 'fansign' (paper with my name written on it), it must be me pre-HRT. 

His brilliant mind then insisted that he had to see my genital to know if I was tricking him or not. Of course I said no, to both his request and the possibility of this friendship ever continuing. 

Dude proceeded to try guilt tripping me with ""I'm so depressed"" ""why is that my friends always left"" and ""Guess we ended with me crying"".  "
67,"I've blocked him on all social media and he doesn't have my number. Our friends are aware of the situation so he doesn't get any information about me. He doesn't know where I live or work. 

For a while, he was telling everyone that we were having an affair and I had had an abortion because he'd gotten me pregnant.  That turned a lot of our mutual friends against him since it was so easily proven false. 

There are a few guys I know who still hang out with him occasionally (he's moved a few hundred miles away and only comes home to visit a couple of times a year) and they always say ""oh, that's just the way he is, you shouldn't let it bother you"". 

One of his ex girlfriends once confided that she'd had a similar experience when they'd first met, although in her case, he did manage to wear her down and she started going out with him. That was an interesting conversation as she felt guilty about dating him and therefore reinforcing his behaviour. It's amazing how women blame themselves for this shit!

"
68,"Commenting on Weight loss at work is a tricky one, you compliment their weight loss and get a reply like ""yeah my wife left and I haven't been eating"" or ""I have cancer"". 

I mean if they see you biking to work and eating healthy then you are safe."
69,"Body hair on a woman is seen as unhygienic for some dumb reason while on a man it's perfectly acceptable. I've been called unclean and disgusting by people who are married to hairy men. Whenever I've asked why it makes ME dirty but not men, I just get, ""Because men are supposed to have hair."" Like, ok cool, my body grows it but I'm not supposed to have it, makes sense."
70,"A couple words that have been thrown at me in praise are ""autonomous"" and ""independent."" I'm a very self-motivated person and it is probably my boss's wet dream that I enjoy seeking out more responsibilities and can generally problem solve by myself. 

You can have lots of great traits and get nowhere if you never take initiative. "
71,"i think both the same amount in different ways. women are expected to be accommodating to the point of having no self identity and men are expected to ""step up to the plate"""
72,"The threshold for acceptable male overweightness is much higher. Anything related to aging. Body hair, especially armpit hair. Amount of skin they can reveal (can be literally topless and no one will comment on their sexuality). "
73,"I'm an operations analyst at an energy trading firm, and I don't have patience for processes I've inherited working poorly/inefficiently. Just because it's always been done [x] way doesn't mean it's the best one, and I frequently take it upon myself to proactively optimize/streamline/rework processes that are slowing people down or making their jobs harder for no discernible reason.  

I've only been in my position for like 4 months now and I've already received a lot of praise/recognition for the improvements I've made, including having my boss tell me he wants to make me a senior analyst as soon as I have my first winter (busy season) under my belt. "

76,"* They're savagely critical of women that aren't me. 
* They can't make it through a conversation without making awkward, ungraceful sexual innuendos. I mean, if it's well done then game on, but usually it isn't. It's usually a desperation move where they're obviously trying to see if I'm open to casual sex in the near future. 
* Hounding me for pictures, especially pictures in states of undress, but even just regular pictures. Not judging anyone who enjoys taking selfies, but that's really just not me. I feel like frequently taking pictures of myself to send and post on social media would be weird. 
* A generally negative disposition. Like sure, we all have bad days and need to vent occasionally, but if you can't find any way to shift your mood to something positive for the length of a date you probably need to get your head right before you start dating. 
* Domineering on objective information. If I tell you I like Panic at the Disco and you spend the next 20 minutes telling me why Panic at the Disco are the worst thing ever to happen to music and Led Zeppelin is where it's at, that's pretty bad. "
77,"I really love the fashionista, shopping girly-girl trope simply because I really enjoy seeing different outfit styles and hair and makeup. I love it even more when it's mixed with a strong, smart and caring female lead such as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde."
78,I'm not into religious people romantically. 
79,"Could not be more opposite, at least in terms of looks. I spent much of my youth hoping for Mr. Perfect; a tall, well-muscled man with long black hair, piercing green eyes, and a strong but tender heart. I ended up with a short, fat, dykie-haired woman who is exactly as batshit crazy as I am. Yet somehow it works. I love her, she loves me, and we're working on happily ever after together."
80,"When he suddenly started prank calling me and then it would end up to hour long conversations, up until it led to 10 pm to 3 am phone calls even when we had classes at 8 am. Then we hang out in Mcdonalds one July afternoon and everything just clicked.. I never got bored, never got tired. 3 years down and a baby arriving soon and Im still never bored of him. Annoyed at times, but we never ran out of things to talk about. And even if we did, we still enjoyed the silence as long as we were together. "
81,More snug clothing tbh. They tend to wear clothes too big for their bodies.
82,"Yes, and I regret every single second of it. I stayed because of sunk cost fallacy. My exhusband just cheated over and over, and eventually I grew a spine and threw his ass out. "
83,"After my parents passed, we found out my mother got pregnant in high school and gave the child up for adoption.  Also found out she was my dad’s secretary!"
84,Embarrassingly long. 
85,Women's locker room: I overheard two girls (high school aged) who were changing out of their swimsuits (this was the locker room for an olympic sized swimming pool that hosted high school swim practices). One girl opened a zipper pocket on her gym bag and screamed. Apparently she's stuffed a wet swimsuit in the pocket who knows how long ago and it was covered in mold. 
86,"Not a single trope per se, but I tend to really enjoy any of Frances McDormand's lead roles. She breaks a lot of average molds and takes part in creative, often gritty films.

Also, kid-me really loved the Eowyn/Mulan unexpected hero type, as well as the girl who explores a new land, like Lucy Pevensie or Dorothy Gale. (Speaking of Dorothy, L. Frank Baum supported the feminist movement in his time and wrote a whole series of books under the pen name Edith Van Dyne about girls doing things that were usually reserved for boys at the time like flying planes.)

Edit: Oh, and characters like Toph from Last Airbender. Because she's a fuckin' unapologetic badass."
87,"My good friend left her fiancé the night before their wedding.  It was Texas in the early 90s, and she was engaged to a (nice enough) man.  He'd always told her she was more than welcome to fool around with women as she liked.  They were sitting there the night before they got married and she told him she couldn't do it because she was a lesbian, she'd always been a lesbian, and she just hadn't ever been able to accept it.  

It was hard on both of them, but in the end better that she finally was able to say it before they actually tied the knot."
88,"Way too long tbh... Like some weeks easily? To be fair though I wear light bralettes, have small boobs and live in a colder climate - which equals no boob sweat. Sports bras, on the other hand, I wear exactly once."
89,"A great example of this are some of the clothing shops I've been to in London. If I remember correctly there is a H&amp;M near me which is arranged into the following floors:

* 2: Women's Clothes

* 1: Women's Clothes

* G: Women's Clothes

* Basement: Women's Accessories, Children's Clothes, Men's Clothes.

Yeah. Thanks for the variety."
90,"Military, fireman or police. Any high risk job. I'm a worrier and I couldn't handle worrying about my SO literally every hour they're at work. "
91,"Woman had her toddler aged son in the stall next to me at a campground shower. She was explaining, very patiently, and probably for at least the 50th time that yes, he needed to wash his penis. Yes, every day. Yes, with soap. Because it got dirty just like the rest of him. Yes, even in his underwear. Yes, his butt, too. Yes, with soap there, too. "
92,"I was left two weeks before my wedding, last year. He claimed he was scared and just needed more time. We had been together over four years and engaged for a year and two months. What really happened still blows my mind. He had been having an affair and even before I found out, which took months, people were coming to me about how he had done this or that during the time we were together. Like, why tf didn’t you tell me before? I was oblivious and blinded by love and the future we had planned. Everything caught me off guard and I’m just now starting to recover, 10 months later. "
93,"Once in the target bathroom I heard a mom tell her toddler to wash her hands, and the toddler goes “and brush my teeth?” In the CUTEST little baby voice"
94,"I was in Budapest with my best friend and decided to use tinder to meet new people. I was single, she was not.

The texts were okay, sometimes a little bit off (he was with two friends and they said they could meet us at the bar we were at, later on said he was waiting for us to come to them).

Eventually we met up in a club and he started chatting with me, his face was the same as in the pictures, his body was quite larger than expected but whatever, maybe he's chill.
He immediately told me I was boring when I was looking for things to tell me about myself.

He thought he was incredibly smart and also started raging when I forgot about one province of our shared home country (dude, I never mastered geography). Then my friend stepped up and told him we were done.

He then went on about how he was expecting a ""nice date with two women"" and he started insulting my friends intelligence (she is smart af, does university and shit but is really insecure about her ability to do so).

He stormed off and went to get his friends, when they returned, we were accompanied by two amazing guys who were telling us about their travel stories. The look on his face when he saw us having fun without him was priceless.


I later got a text from him that he was sorry the night had to be like that, implying that it was my friends fault. I blocked him.

Also: his friends ganged up on my friend telling her she had to break up with her partner to be with them.


Never used tinder afterwards and met the guy of my dreams about a month later. We're engaged now. "
95,"If they have a kid. Right now, I’m not ready for that stage in my life for kids and I feel bad because the people (parent) are totally cool. It just freaks me out "
96,Listening. Communicating. Not just trying to emulate what they see in porn. Caring about their partner’s pleasure. Sexual compatibility. 
97,"Started dating at 19, married at 23.  Celebrated 11 years of marriage yesterday.  :)  "
98,"Went to go change clothes after working a shift at college’s eatery one night... heard some shuffling and noises as I came in and “oh shit” whispered. Then silence.

While using the stall, saw two very different shoes— Sandle on one and a large tennis shoe on the other. Bent down a little futher. Four feet.

Interrupted a booty call."
99,Any female character who finishes the story without a love interest has my vote.
100,"I was at the airport and a mom was taking her daughter to the bathroom. Daughter said, ""mommy can I pee in my pants?"" Mom, no hint of a smile in her voice said, ""no"". I admire her resolve - I was cracking up in my own stall!"
101,Make yourself more busy so you don’t have time to cling to them 
102,"When I was about 14 me and some friends went  to see a Lostprophets gig. We met 3 guys in the queue and one of my pals ended up seeing one of the guys. Anyway fast forward maybe a a week and one of the guys (around 18ish) won't stop messaging me. Tells me he loves me and nobody understands. Constant messages and phone calls. 

He knew the town I lived in and one day I get a message something like 'I'm in XXXX where are you'. He just wandered around town hoping to find me. Calling me while I was at school, telling me to bunk off and join him cause he had come all that way and spent all that money...

It went on for weeks. I avoided him as best I could but I was young and I felt really guilty so I tried to be nice to him. Then eventually he called me on Skype, crying his eyes out with a wire around his neck and told me if I didn't say I loved him he would kill himself.

Turned off the computer and cried myself to sleep that night. He didn't kill himself but I never heard from him again. "
103,-talking mad trash about every other girl they've been involved with (somehow all his exes were crazy psycho bitches) 
104,"We had been friends for over 10 years, since the 7th grade. We started spending more time together in group settings in our early 20s. I had never thought of him as more than a friend before this one particular night. We were out at the bars and I can’t describe it as anything other than an energy shift. At one moment he was standing closer to me than usual and a rush of feelings came over me. I thought to myself, “oh, that’s different.” We danced together for the rest of the night and when we had to part ways, we locked eyes with each other in a way we never had before. The connection was unspoken yet undeniable. I took the risk of sharing my new found feelings with him, and now 2 and a half years later we are planning our wedding. "
105,"We were both 21. We had our daughter at age 24 and our son at age 27. He got a vasectomy at age 28. We've been married 17 years and he is the most perfectly magnificent man for me. I am more in love than the day we married...and I'm sure he feels the same way. It hasn't always been easy, but it's been the biggest gift of my life. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine marriage could be this damn good."
106,"No career. Not being able to hold a job is a major red flag.   

Stripper. I’m not against the job in and of itself, but I dated and even nearly married a stripper in my younger and dumber days and that lifestyle/mindset is something I’d never want to experience again. "
107,I'm glad she didn't marry him!
108,"Fitted clothed, like a lot have mentioned, would be AMAZING.  I never realized how baggy American men's clothes are (and how unfitted) until I went to Italy and saw a man that was wearing tailored, fitted clothes.  I remember just thinking that he was dressed so well that I felt like my own clothes were subpar.

Don't get me wrong.  I appreciate comfy clothes (I do enjoy wearing jeans and a t shirt regularly), but I like how fitted clothes flatter every man's body, no matter what.  When the clothes are made to fit YOU, YOU wear the clothes instead of the clothes wearing you."
109,"I thought I was gonna have to settle, until he literally fell into my lap.  1st date was 10 months ago and I still can't get enough of him.  We talk, communicate, have fantastic times together, and love each other's kids.  He is the first man since I got divorced 13 years ago that I haven't had to ""hide"" anything from.  We don't judge each other, even in eff'd up situations.  Only problem I have with him is that his 19 year old cat cock blocks me sometimes."
110,"Poland to U.K. here. It was a weird shock for me to hear women ask questions and be vocal in class in a way that wasn’t common where I was from. Men tended to dominate in class, and women tended to be quieter. 

I was also super shocked by how carefree women were about their safety in the U.K. Where I studied they’d go out dressed very scantily, drink and flirt and dance late into the night and often walk alone at night. 

Cool things: meeting many female lecturers, professors, women who were respected and admired because of things other than their beauty. I had one professor who had met the last emperor of China. Another who spoke several Asian languages fluently. 

In a relationship with a western man, I was surprised by how he expected independence in areas where Polish men often don’t. My husband (then boyfriend) implied with every action and decision and word that of course I will have a job and a driving licence and pursue my own goals. It was implicit. 

To be honest, I had no idea how conservative the environment I grew up in had been until I left.

My parents have a funny anecdote about that. They were once invited to a wedding in Denmark. On the day of the event, my mum was ironing my dad’s shirt in the house of a Danish friend, with whom they were staying, while my dad was reading a book. The friend came in, saw my parents and, concerned, asked my father: “have you hurt your hands?” "
111,What a thoughtful thing to do.
112,"Definitely military. I respect people within that field but I couldn’t date/marry someone while constantly worrying if I would be widowed within the next couple years. Not only that, but I’ve met a lot of men who get this weird superiority complex while in the military (similarly as police officers as well) that I just don’t want to deal with. Not saying that’s always the case, but at this point in my life I don’t want those chances. "
113,"That the reason my maternal grandmother ended up adopting both her children (mom and aunt) in the 1960's was because she had an abortion beforehand that mangled her chances of concieving her own.  On one hand, super grateful she adopted because my family is pretty cool, loyal, and they never made us ever feel like we weren't less than blood.

On the other hand, fuck the fact that my grandma had to get a back alley abortion that wrecked her body because abortion was illegal.  It made the whole abortion debate a lot more personal for me finding out what happened to her.

"
114,"I’m fine going topless, but I prefer to have undies on as I’m afraid of discharge ruining my sheets "
115,Military duty is still mandatory for all healthy men in some countries and I live in one of them. That.
116,"You, me, her friends, her mother and her family."
117,"&gt; It’s HEALTHY to have separate lives.

This seems like such a simple concept, but I know few people who actually embrace it."
118,"He was super sweet took me out to dinner multiple times, chilled with me in my dorm, took me on romantic dates, I met his mother. He made little comments here and there. For example, I have bad anxiety and when my face breaks out I pick it so lots of scars on my face back then. I didn’t wear make up one time and he started hounding me about what happened to my face and why I was so anxious. I let it go because some people just don’t understand.

Well, then came the week of the anniversary of my friends passing due to cancer she was literally the sister I never had so I gave the “nice guy” a heads up as to why I might seem off or sad(she was with me when I transitioned to high school so it hit me very hard that she wasn’t there for my transition to college) and his response ? 

“It doesn’t change the fact that she’s dead”

Yea zero empathy didn’t get a sorry to hear about your friend. And no matter how much I tried to explain that yea it doesn’t change the fact she’s gone it doesn’t change the fact that I miss her terribly, and could’ve used her with my struggle with mental illness. His next response ? “Mental illness isn’t real”

Basically the night and relationship ended that day with me being so upset I just had him drop me off right where we were and had my roommate get me. 

"
119,"I recently did research examining the typical patterns of male partner violence (for anyone experiencing male stalking or intensely possessive behavior by a partner—please know it is the greatest predictor of murder of a girlfriend/wife) and one of the biggest “tells” was early and intense attachment. I.e. pushing to move in together within the first three weeks, talking marriage very early on, telling someone they love and need them more than anyone else. The movies make that look so romantic but it’s actually a very systematic process of eventual abuse wherein the other person becomes so extricated that it’s very difficult to casually walk away. In a normal dynamic, for instance, if one person begins to exhibit signs of mental instability or abuse in the early stages of a relationship the solution is pretty simple. Abusive men realize this and counter it by intense, early and PUBLIC attachment where the victim has to embarrass themselves or work very hard to get out of the relationship. The next step in the cycle of abuse is isolation, if anyone is curious."
120,"Wait, so no one told you life was gonna be this way?"
121,"So I was part of this conversation but since it involved a stranger, I’ll include it. I still can’t tell it without crying laughing. 
I was at target with my mom and sister. My sister and I were preteens maybe. My mom had to use the bathroom so we all went in and it was just us in there. As My sister and I sat outside the stalls waiting, a lady comes in and enters a stall. A few moments later, the stranger  lets out a pretty loud fart, and my mom, not realizing someone else was in with us, responds with a loud “HELLLLLOOOOO!” She wrongly assumed that it was one of her daughters who ripped one. My sister and I were so incredibly shocked/mortified that We stayed totally silent.  and that was when my mom realized she’d fucked up. We all hurried out of the bathroom and proceeded to die laughing. 
Even fifteen+ years later every time I go to that target I think of the time that some poor woman tried to do her business in peace and got called out for her loud fart. 
😂 My sides hurt from laughing about this again. "
122,Doctor. I'm finishing up medical school. I want to come home and not think about patients or procedures. I don't want to try and maintain a relationship around two 80-hour work schedules. 
123,"Men are required to sacrifice their literal lives, women are required to sacrifice their figurative lives.  As in, once you become a mother, you sacrifice who you were before. Once you get married, you sacrifice your identity.  Or expected to, very pressured by society. 


One of my cousins had a kid a few months ago.  *On her birthday* her birthday card inside said ""Happy Birthday mother of [child]!""   She literally no longer has a name, and even on the day of her birth is just called a mother.  


Her husband? Still gets his name.  He's not dad.  He's allowed to be a human.  


But break in to their home? He has to go investigate and potentially die."
124,"My eight year old daughter was being called fat at school on a regular basis (she's a lil chunky. we're working on it). I had no idea it was happening, she hadn't told me or come home upset or anything, until one day my son told me he was being called a midget by a group of peers. She overheard the conversation and hugged my son and said, ""It's okay. Girl1 and Girl2 call me names everyday, but I don't pay them any mind. They are just being sassy and they aren't good people! As long as you try hard to be a good person, it doesnt matter what others call you."" 

My heart melted. It was a piece of amazing wisdom from my young daughter....I bragged so much. "
125,"When my grandmother died, we learned that she and my late grandfather were never married, because he never divorced his first wife. "
126,"Being uninhibited and in the moment, and just doing what they think will make the other person feel good without being pensive or hesitating.  Asking for what they need, and being receptive when asked for something in return.  Noticing nonverbal feedback.  And finally, putting a little motion in the ocean.  No one wants to be stabbed with a penis for 15 mins straight.  Mix it up, move your hips, find some different angles, and make it interesting.  "
127,Anything that requires significantly more than 40 hours per week. I grew up with a dad obsessed with work and while I love him to death we missed him so much as kids and so did my mom. We wanted time with him more than anything. It's important to me not to replicate that in my own marriage.
128,"Ruthless, scheming women (both villains and heroes). Bonus points if their ruthlessness isn't necessarily portrayed as a bad or repulsive thing. I'm playing Witcher 3 right now and I feel like Yennefer (and to a lesser extent Triss) is a great example of this.

Women who appear to be sweet, caring, saintly ""ideal wife"" type figures... but are actually secretly still ruthless and scheming. Amy from Gone Girl, for example. The pettier they are the better.

Basically I just like female characters who would stab you for a dollar."
129,"I freaking love Legally Blond. It shows that women can be very feminine and extremely smart. I mean, she last minute got into Harvard, defended herself against sexual harassment, solved a legal case by herself, was supportive to other women even if they didn't like her. So many awesome things about Elle, and she was into makeup, staying fit, and looking pretty. I'm always happy to see women as multidimensional."
130,"Wait wait wait.. we need this on blast: 

**&gt;Not just trying to emulate what they see in porn.**"
131,"What temperature you like to keep the ac at! I had arguments with a roommate over this.

Willingness to share items and food.

How often they clean and how you will split chores. If they never sweep their current place they won’t help you sweep when you move in.

You should also have a discussion about sexual partners coming over and boundaries.
"
132,"I refuse to date anyone who is in the military or who works in law enforcement. I feel bad about it because I'm sure there's loads of nice men out there who work in those fields. I'm grateful for what they do for our country and I commend their bravery but I just don't want to deal with the possible baggage that comes with their work.

Also, I have heard some not so nice rumors about men who work in those fields and how they are more often than not unfaithful in relationships. I'm not sure if that's true or not but I'd rather not take my chances. "
133,"This may come as odd, but boners are a completely separate thing to being turned on. They'd overlap pretty heavily on a Venn diagram, but there's always that area where you just get a boner for whatever reason, and that area where you *are* excited, but it just won't pump up on its own.
"
134,"""Hey, nice weather we're seeing. Speaking of seeing, are you seeing anyone?"""
135,"I am Indian, and for the longest time the guys I had dated fell into the same pattern-  smart, well-read guys who sang well, wrote poetry and were artistic overall. Also, I have always found eloquent guys attractive- nothing impresses me more than a guy who can hold his own while debating with me. I always thought I would end up with an Indian guy who had these qualities.

Instead, my current SO is European. He is uproariously funny, he played the piano as a kid but hates it. As per my childhood ideals, he is smart and well-read but certainly not an artist. We argue in jest about everything quite passionately, and that is a major aphrodisiac.

Edit: 10/10 would recommend dating a funny guy. A fun, light-hearted relationship where both people can laugh at each other is all kinds of awesome."
136,"I wish they'd drop the act and post their own situation to askwomenadvice.

""I'm balding. Should I attempt a hair transplant at my age for (reasons), or shave it
for (reasons)?"" will get my non-snarky answer so much fucking faster than ""Beauteous glamazons of AskWomen, do you find bald guys hot?"""
137,"May I ask, how is your friendship today?

My wife and I were friends for quite some time, then something just changed one day. 12 years, a wedding, and a baby later, things are still pretty great. I can't imagine that would have been the case if we hadn't forged a friendship first."
138,"Wow, that must have been a very tough and difficult situation. Good on you for getting out of it though!"
139,"We don't argue very often, but when we do, I feel like I'm the one who makes sure we get everything out on the table and work things out so we can make things better. His family never really talked about anything important (ignored problems, suffered in silence) so after 3 years together, he's still learning that arguing is okay and I'm totally fine with him calling me out on my bullshit."
140,"I’m part way through my residency in emergency medicine. I love what I do and couldn’t see myself doing anything else, but I’m not sure I would make the same decision if I had to go back and choose my career path again. 

At this point, I think I’m just really tired. Medical school and residency is such a long path. All of my friends are married, have children, and have started their lives. I have an outrageous amount of student loan debt and I feel like I missed the early part of my life as I’ll be 30 when I finish residency. I was engaged at the start of medical school, but that fell apart after I started my clinical rotations in third year and was at the hospital more than home. I’ve found it difficult to find time to date in residency, and have been single for almost 4 years now. On a more positive note, I get tremendous satisfaction from my job and it’s helped with my social anxiety. "
141,"I have guesses. Part of it is that my dad hasn't lived in the same city as them since he graduated high school, whereas both his sisters lived in the same city for most their adult lives. Part of it is because they didn't really approve of my mother.

It's funny, when my dad casually mentioned to his mother that he would have liked to get a letter or a phone call from his father sometime, my grandmother looked astonished and said something to the effect of, 'We didn't know you wanted one.'

That was the straw that broke the camel's back with my dad and his family. My grandmother has not called my dad nor emailed him since the funeral. I don't think they've communicated at all since the night of the funeral, I think.

My dad's sisters obviously blame my mother and are shaming my father for treating his mother like that when she had just lost her husband.

Personally, I have not had one iota of desire to have any sort of relationship with my dad's family since I was eighteen years old, and I'm happier for it. The only thing they left me with was a fear of dogs that I'm still getting over."
142,Please don't laugh off my penis
143,"He usually just winks and lets them figure out their mistake

I think my favorite was someone else's reaction: my boyfriend just raised his eyebrows at these guys and one dude went, ""Aw shit, that's just a little n*gga in a peacoat"" and the other dude just nodded and said, ""Yeah, I saw him and was like, 'I'd smash'""

Edit: typo"
144,"I don't know if 24 is really all that young, but it seems younger than average for my generation. It's great, we are almost to our 8 year anniversary. I think it's worked so well because we both went in 100% dedicated to making it work, and we were both ready. We also have a lot in common, and have good communication skills and similar communication styles. Well matched libidos don't hurt either. We share similar goals. The ways that we differ tend to compliment each other, not grate on each other.  Lots and lots of reasons why it works well to be honest."
145,"I'd been friends with this guy ""A"" for like 6 years. He was one of a group of dudes I hung out with at the time - all nerdy game devs that I'd met in college. I'd been to a ton of parties and conventions with these guys and trusted them all implicitly.

I went to yet another party one night at someone's house, and everyone was there, as usual. Had a couple beers, talked to some of the guys including A, then had to pee. Went down the hall to the bathroom and did my thing.

When I opened the door, A was standing right outside, and as I tried to leave he suddenly kissed me. I was shocked. Most of the 6 years I'd known A, he had been dating other girls, and we never so much as flirted.

He tried to shove me back into the bathroom as I told him, ""No, no!"" but he wasn't listening. I finally managed to get around him and get out.

I was shaken, but I assumed it was a simple misunderstanding. But I felt unsafe, so I sat down with another one of the guys I knew and asked him to keep an eye on me because A had just thrown himself at me and I was in a weird place. This guy agreed, put his arm around me, and then decided it was a good time to let me know that he and his girlfriend were looking for a third.

Well, that was a sign it was time for me to leave. I got up and told the host - another of my friends! - what was happening. He responded that I must have just misunderstood what A was doing. I decided to just go.

When I walked out the door, A followed me. He got in front of me and blocked me from my car, refusing to move away from my car door unless I agreed to go on a date with him. To get away, I said yes, he could ask me out *tomorrow* when he was sober.

He apparently took this as enthusiastic consent because he grabbed me and pushed me up against the car to kiss me again. 

I honestly don't remember what I said to get him to back off - probably something about needing to let my dog out - but I got away and got into my car at last.

""A"" never called me again. The other guys couldn't understand why I no longer wanted to hang out with A, even when I told them why. I stopped going to their parties, and then finally I just stopped talking to them at all.

Even now that I'm married I would say I no longer have any straight male friends."
146,"Was minding my own business at work when a woman went into the stall beside me and said ""Hey! How are you doing?"". I didn't know who it was or how she knew it was me. Did she recognize my shoes? Anyway, I go ""Uh... Not too bad, you?"" She goes ""I'm great! Really good. So do you have plans for the weekend?"" I go ""Uh... nothing special I guess"". Then she goes ""Hang on, the chick in the next stall thinks I'm talking to her..."" "
147,"Yes, and here we are 8 years later."
148,"High level, strategic sales positions, especially in finance. Men I’ve met who do this work have impossible huge and concrete egos, incredible manipulation skills, and are not afraid to count someone they love as collateral damage to get something else they want. "
149,"Thank you. I still remember the day I fully realized I was free. The feeling was indescribable. Violent Femmes song ""I'm Free"" became my anthem. "
150,Why in the world would you date if you don't want to? Just live your life.
151,"I love to learn. I try to fill the niches at work that others haven't and be the 'expert' in a given area. For example in my current role, I have become a de facto graphic designer. I have no experience with graphic design, but I'm willing to tinker around in Adobe Illustrator and come up with stuff that is passable for our purposes, saving us tons of money from not having to hire an outside designer.

153,"It is really hard to explain to my female friends that I'm desperate for validation on my looks. I always thought putting a lot of effort into working out, running, wearing best clothes for my figure and practicing good hygiene and skincare would result in some validation. I know you'll say that I should be doing all that stuff for myself and I do, otherwise I'd have stopped a while ago. But I want to feel beautiful and when even your girlfriend isn't forthcoming with positive reinforcement you start questioning yourself."

Like. Foundation, concealer , countour/highlight , eyeshadow, a big ol cat eye and falsies are just...... common. Like it’s really crazy how much makeup can go into a no makeup look , and can just be expected.  If you don’t wear any makeup dating/ in the working world you can be penalized. "
159,"- They way people immediately don't trust men around kids, especially for something as little as having long hair

160,"My 5 year old asked “who the hell is it?” when someone knocked on our screen door. 

He was big into Home Alone at the time and had just watched the part where Kevin used “Angels with Filthy Souls” to scare away Harry.  The character in the movie asks the same question when someone knocks on his door.

163,"It's such a catch-22. I definitely think men need more reinforcement in their lives, and would love to compliment more men when they're looking good--but because compliments are so rare from women towards men, they're usually taken as a sign of interest, instead of as just a compliment (see also: how men usually only compliment women they find attractive). The only way to get rid of that association is to compliment more, but I don't want to invite unwanted interest just to try to compliment strangers."

I was so proud of him for being brave enough to stand up for me when he was so small. "
166,I always felt bad for male teachers especially in primary or elementary. Being a teacher AND combating assumptions about your personal life and negative stereotypes just seems like way too much bullshit for me to handle. 
167,"My youngest daughter is innately a badass.

The first time I realized it: I was disciplining her older sister and her older sister started to cry. She stepped in front of her weeping older sister and me and admonished me for making her sister cry. She was 3.

She routinely sticks up for herself and other kids.

Another example: There was a boy in her preschool —- she was 4 at the time —- who routinely bullied and hit kids. One day he turned his attention to her but the teacher broke it up before it could escalate. The kids were separated and the teacher returned to the lesson. According to the teacher, when she turned her back to write on the board, my daughter stood up, walked over to the boy and punched him right in the stomach. The teacher said “I guess she felt that we didn’t do enough to deal with the situation and she needed to make sure he knew that she wasn’t a target.” Not only did that boy leave her alone from then on but they were able to convince the school to get another aid in the class to help the boy with his bullying.

She’s 10 now and still sticks up for kids. She has no fear of or tolerance for bullying. "
168,"Dude was actually one of my best friends.  We had been hanging out regularly for a good 3 years before he revealed that he was in love with me.  I made it very clear that I wasn't interested in him, as nicely as possible.  He accepted it, we talked later and he said the feelings are fading/gone because he knew he couldn't pursue it. 

Every time I dated someone and we broke up, he would profess his love again.  His sister disliked me for leading him on, she told me so, I told her that I explicitly told him on multiple occasions that I would never have any interest in dating him.  Every time, I told him that I was still not interested in him.  Same thing, he would come back, he's sorry, there are no feelings, he wants to stay my friend.  This happened multiple times and since he was one of my best friends I kept him in my life.  

The last break up I had while we were friends, this happened again.  We were very drunk.  I remember asking him at one point if he understood that I just wanted to be friends.  I told him (hypothetically) would you rather have me knowing that I'd never love him or have any sort of feelings for him and he said he would rather have me.  Which hurt, a lot.  The same night I came to with him in me, I started begging him to stop which he did.  I can't really remember what happened, so I can't say that I didn't reciprocate with whatever he was doing.  So I blame myself a lot.  When I woke up I had a lot of hickeys all over my neck, I felt disgusting.  I had to drive him home that morning (he crashed on the couch) and he said that it wasn't what he imagined.  

I drove to the next town over where no one knew me to guy buy cover up for my neck and cried in my car.  The following weeks I tried to forgive him and still be friends with him even though I was really fucked up about the whole thing.   A few months later, I had started seeing another guy and I became pregnant.   We all went out on new years, and my friend drunkenly joked that his sister was asking if it was his.  It really fucked me up that he told his sister when I couldn't talk to anyone about it, and that he would laugh about my situation.  That he found anything about the situation at all positive.  We left. 

I moved in with my boyfriend so that we could raise our son together, and since I moved so far away, and he couldn't drive, it just worked out that we drifted apart.  For the better.  Once I was out of his life, he finally got a girlfriend.  We had been friends for 6 years and while he kinda screwed around with 1 or 2 girls, he never dated anyone, even though I constantly urged him to. I saw him and her once at a comic book store a year or so later, and he said hi to me, went in for a hug and I just kinda turned around.  My boyfriend said it was the most awkward exchange for two people who used to be best friends. 

This whole thing gave me nightmares for years.  I couldn't talk about it with anyone and I feel like I still can't.  I still don't.   My boyfriend knows, but I don't think he realized the effect it fucked with me.   I still remember how it felt, how horrible it felt, and there's nothing that will remove that thought from my head even though I want it gone.  I honestly think I just put myself in a bad position.  This whole thing was my fault so there is nothing to talk about, and I don't think I could confidently have a support network if I tried without feeling like I'm getting everyone to feel bad for me about something that is my fault.  

I'm still with my boyfriend, our son is turning 6 this year.  My Former friend just had a baby with the girl he started dating after we stopped hanging out.  I don't know the sex or it's name.  Years ago I would have been ecstatic to be a part of that child's life as an aunt.  I don't even know if they're married or engaged to be honest.  I don't really care.  There's not really a part of me that misses him at all.  I hate him.  The whole friendship was a ruse.  He just wanted to get with me for 6 years.  He never cared about me.  "

172,"My grandfather was almost 7ft, very strong and so quiet and gentle. He spent his retirement keeping his garden and would always cook my favourite foods when I visited. My grandmother - his wife - was barely 5ft and an extremely strict Catholic (some of their siblings were nuns &amp; priests).
My grandfather shocked me the most. He used to be a Financial Advisor and made a lot of his cases personal, or personally helped family friends in secret (he was able to as he was very wealthy). Funerals are 3 days, and his public one went on for hours because hundreds of people kept filtering in, each wanting to tell their story about how he had stepped in and helped them, everyone from his clients, to my Dad's friends and the homeless, all in secret. The one story I remember is one of my Dad's college friends saying that she was a homeless single mother at 19, and my Grandfather bought her a flat near college, a computer (I think) to be able to do college work and helped provide for her until she was able to get a job once her baby was old enough. I found out a few months ago (3 years after his death) that he actually died of cancer and had refused all treatment. Needless to say, he is the person I now respect the most because of his unwavering kindness and humbleness.

I always found the marriage between him and my grandmother strange, since she was so strict and just completely the opposire, and I know I still don't know the full story. However, after she died a year later, I learnt that she actually dropped out of school at 15 to look after the home and ensure all her siblings (my grandparents had 4-7 each) had a proper education and were well-fed. I think this is my grandparents' common ground. She went through her 'rebellious stage' 4 years later, getting all her teeth removed in the fad of dentures ""never worry about yellow teeth again!"" and heavily smoking for decades. However I still don't know how she went from that to such another extreme, but I look forward to finding more out"
173,"well my idea was of him existing, so I'd say it's a pretty drastic difference."
174,So much this.  Pet names are earned over time.  To use them immediately comes off as super possessive and objectifying.
175,"He moved into my house. In fact, a lot of stuff hasn’t been unpacked, so hopefully he’ll be able to move out quickly. I’m totally in shock right now, and of course struggling with a little bit of denial, but I know deep down it won’t be worth it to stay with a cheater. Someone who could cheat and lie for months all while deciding to make the commitment of moving in together. "
176,"I didn’t leave a guy at the altar but I did break off an engagement. Feel free to discount this story, since it doesn’t qualify. It’s also long.

We had been together for over four years and the wedding was being planned. I felt a very strong connection to him, but he had peter pan syndrome really bad and it was looking like my future was going to be very bleak. He dropped out of school (but so did I, so I couldn’t judge) and had trouble keeping a job. He managed to always afford his WoW subscription (before it was free) and played for hours every day. I played, too, but it was just a game and low on my priorities. More and more things began to be like that - a high priority for me was low for him, and vice versa. I was cleaning, cooking, paying the bills, doing all of our laundry, caring for our cat and dog, doing all of the dog training only to have him undo a lot of it...I started taking my engagement ring off before I even realized I was *really* jaded. I was burnt out. I stopped trying to have a sex life and he stopped initiating and we didn’t have sex for over two months, despite being healthy people in our early 20s. I was also dealing with our alcoholic roommate, whom we wouldn’t have needed to help pay the rent if my fiancee had been able to keep a job.

I won’t lie, another guy came into the picture and that had a great influence on my circumstances. I had very low self-esteem and didn’t think I could do much better than my fiancee until a new guy got hired at work and took an interest in me. We began a friendship and nothing happened that was more than just friends hanging out, but it was clear that this guy who was kind and interesting (and had a job, a car, and a college degree) actually liked me. It helped me realize that I could do better than my fiancee, so I had several long conversations with my fiancee about our status. I gave him some ultimatums for an upcoming trip, and I think I already knew he would fail at that point but hadn’t accepted it. During the trip to go to my mom’s wedding, at which my fiancee told anyone who would listen about our upcoming nuptials, I continued to have heartfelt conversations with my new friend via text while my fiancee basically mooched off of my mom for a week (she had to buy him clothes to wear to the wedding because he didn’t have the money). After returning home, my fiancee and I discussed how he did not do a single thing I requested (things like pack his own clothes for the trip) so I put my ring (which had been my mom’s, since my fiancee actually couldn’t afford one, and had gotten help from my mom on that, too) in my lockbox and told my fiancee we were on a break until further notice. I then drove to my new friend’s house and we fucked our brains out. It was the best sex I’d ever had to date, and I spent every night after that with that guy while I worked out the break-up. My (ex)fiancee found out about my new beau and went out and revenge-fucked some girl from the club, and that was that. We disentangled our lives over the next three months, and now I am married to the other guy. We just celebrated our four-year anniversary and we have one child together and I am really, really happy, despite many struggles we have had. The sex is still mind-blowing, but more importantly, we are growing and becoming better people together. My ex moved on but apparently never changed his lifestyle, so I feel good about my decision."
177,"The abortion. I think the cheating wasn’t as much of a big deal somehow because often those listed as missing were dead, so that was often the assumption when you got a telegram that your husband was missing. My colleague’s grandfather was listed as missing, and came home after the war (he’d been a POW it turned out) to find that his wife had remarried and had another kid!"

179,"As a guy I can say that when it comes to talking about feelings it is way less looked down on once you get past your early 20s.

When my dad's mom died, we found a bunch of birth certificates listing great grandparents AND grandparents as negro. We're white but we always suspected at least my great-gma was black. Turns out everyone was black."
186,"Short answer - yes.

Long answer - if there is anything else you could imagine doing and being happy, do that. I'm a 4th year med student applying for residency right now and I've honestly never once regretted choosing this path. Part of that may be due to the fact that I've wanted to be a doctor since I was a little kid and I mentally prepared myself for a long, difficult education. I had such terrible expectations (4 years confined to the library/hospital, never getting to see friends or go to family events) that the reality of medical school wasn't so bad. I work very hard, use my time well and don't get much sleep but I rarely miss out on things that are truly important to me. Don't get me wrong, there are many times in the past three years that I've felt isolated and stretched unbelievably thin but I've always known that I'd make it through. My support system has been the difference maker in that. I'm close with my parents who live nearby and I have a (non-medical student) SO who I live with. They are extremely supportive and all have their own way of helping me handle the stress and pressure of med school. 

My advice to anyone considering a career in medicine is to get as much exposure to different careers in the medical field as possible. Know exactly why you want to be a doctor vs. nurse/NP vs. PA. They are all vital parts of healthcare but with very different roles and responsibilities. Ultimately, I feel very excited about my future as a doctor and the opportunity to save lives and create positive change in the world. 

I'd be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything I wrote. "

Turns out, she did laundry service for the hospital. Not overly exciting in and of itself, but apparently it was one of the best paid positions at the time - and government, too! Dollar for dollar she made a touch more than what that position currently pays! I couldn't imagine what $21/h in the 50's would equal out today.

She also has a son no one knew about back home."
190,Not too bad. I had made sure he was good and moved in to the state I was supposed to meet him in to get married so it took him 6 months to be able to move again. He did call all my friends and family non stop until I finally got on the phone and told him I never wanted to be with him again. Then he tried sending me a bunch of letters (this was before email and text messages) to my parents house. I gave them permission to read them and then throw them away in case any contained important information I needed. They said it was just a bunch of manipulative BS. 
191,"I used to work for an estate sale company where we would go in and do all the digging &amp; dirty work for the family then sell valuable items for them. One of our crews was assigned to a house that had clear directions: Do Not Go In The Basement

I think it’s because that’s how I felt at that age—kind of magical. I think I lived in my own inner universe where I did feel wild and powerful, far away from the rest of the world, like I might be capable of anything. Also adults started to treat me with more respect, but I also still had moments of not being great at distinguishing fantasy from reality. I’ve never really felt that way since—dropping off into puberty was such a bummer—so I love a book that hypes the expansiveness of girlhood. I also enjoyed reading Swamplandia, even though the book turns that trope right on its head."

I know that it's generally more of a woman issue that you have to look a certain way to be beautiful (up until a few years ago it was the stick thin look of models) but I think that lately there's a lot of talk about this and a wider range of body types became acceptable. Magazines and advertising are frequently criticised for using models with unrealistic bodies.

Meanwhile men's magazines and ads keep telling men that they're not real men without six pack abs, biceps larger than women's thighs and a body fat percentage over 5. And for some reason nobody is talking about that. Seems a bit unfair. "

229,"I recently went to my first professional conference, and as an introvert with mild social anxiety, I was a deer in the headlights. I realized that being a young female in this instance worked to my advantage. The older men treated me like their daughter and would be helpful and welcoming and the women were being supportive. I couldn't help but feel that if I were male that the help and support I got just wouldn't have been there. I would have been on my own, as I feel like an overwhelmed 28 yo male with social anxiety is looked upon very differently than a 28 yo female.

232,"No parents, **even if the child is older or an adult**.

I feel that it's less justifiable than saying I don't want someone who wants kids. It also seems unfair to exclude an entire demographic based on a decision they made far before meeting me.

But I really don't want kids in my life, even if they're older. I don't want to have to deal with my partner being a parent. I don't want to have to deal with being seen as a step-parent.

And adult children go on to have their own children, and grandparents hang out with grandbabies a lot."

“Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man.” - Hayao Miyazaki"

240,"The way I stopped being ""clingy"" was to stop thinking about it in those terms. Someone who likes/loves me isn't going to be upset I want to spend time with them. If one of us needs more time apart, that's just what we need and isn't a flaw in the other person. Just as if one of us needs more time together, that's what we need and it's not a flaw in the other person either. It's a thing to be communicated about and negotiated so that we both get what we need from our relationship, and if we are unable to find a way to meet both our needs, then we should break up. It still doesn't reflect a flaw in either person, just an incompatibility. 

I very very strongly believe that if you're having to keep busy to avoid scaring away a person you're dating, that person doesn't like you as much as you like them. If it continues more than a few weeks it's probably time to move on. People love to be appreciated, especially by those they admire and value the opinion of. 

On the other hand, if you find that EVERYONE you date finds you too clingy, then maybe you might need some therapy to find out why it keeps happening. Because if everyone thinks you're too clingy, then you either keep dating people who don't want to be around you, or you are unable to negotiate and respect boundaries. Either one is an issue. "

I tried to ignore my gut feeling and the evidence that I *did* have, and then I caught him out with his friends when he said he was sleeping. I blew a gasket and lost my shit, not because of the friends, but because of the nonstop lying and manipulation. This just happened to be the straw that broke this camel's back, lol. 

We broke up and it was revealed a day or two afterwards that he'd been sleeping with his ex (and probably others) for awhile. 

He married the ex he'd cheated on me with a few months later, and a year after they got married, they divorced because she slept with his best friend (hi karma). "

247,"I don't think it's specific to men, but everyone should wear clothing that fits. No matter your size, you will ALWAYS look better in clothing that is your size.

251,"I think both sexes are being pressured to self-sacrifice.

Men sacrifice their humanity, their ability to open up about and connect with their emotions. Men sacrifice anything related to a weaker masculinity.

Women sacrifice their individuality, to juggle the multiplicity of roles that are sold to us. Woman, mother, caretaker, planner/organizer, career girl, sexy babe.

And for gods’ sake, if they say “don’t stop!” then keep doing exactly what you’re doing. Don’t change the pace, the rhythm, don’t change whatever it is. Then if they stop having the same level of excitement over it, only then do you change it up.

I feel awful about it because it's not just the normal ""no bad hygiene"" and I know dental care, especially cosmetic dental care, can be cost-prohibitive to a lot of people and they may not be able to help it. It's not their fault. I just can't deal with severely crooked teeth, it really bothers me. I'm an asshole. :/"

258,"I'm a guy but I have a story I'd like to share. When I was a kid a had that one great aunt. You know the kind. She would hug you and coddle all the kids in the extended family. Always giving small gifts that you accepted and thanked her for but they weren't really what you liked to play with so it was a little weird. She just really loved me and all my cousins.

At her funeral it all became clear why she was so over the top with all of us. When she was younger she and her husband really wanted children but life dealt them a bad hand. She had been through 15+ pregnancies, none of which she was able to carry successfully to term. This was in the fifties before science had advanced to help them. Me, my sister, and all our cousins were floored, not having known this all our childhood. It explained everything, and it was heartbreaking. The strength and sheer willpower with which she must have desired a child ... incredible.

Yall women amaze me."

I was the little boy.  I had to go so bad I didn’t look at the door sign, jammed into a stall and got to business.  Didn’t note the conspicuous lack of urinals.  I wanted to disappear down the toilet like my pooz."
261,"The fear is the worst part.  I was out with my daughter (she was four) eating lunch while we were out running around one day.  She said she had to pee so, not thinking anything of it, I took her to the bathroom.  

Barely had her on the toilet when a security guard busted in yelling for me to get away from her.  Someone called security because they same me take her into the bathroom and her screaming and crying ""daddy"" wasn't enough for the guy and he called the cops while trying to get between her and me.  

Dude kept trying to get in between us and pushing me away from her until I lost my shit.  I'm a big dude too (6'3 and 230) and as soon as I realized what he was doing I started yelling for help because I honestly thought he was trying to take her.  Cops were no help either.  I got cuffed and held until they could verify with my Ex wife (who isn't even allowed to see my daughter) that the papers I had weren't forged. 

So thanks to random person I was almost arrested for having my daughter not piss her pants.  I got an apology letter from the mall we were in and was told I was lucky no one pressed charges.  I have panic attacks now when I have to take her out in public.  "

She had never remarried or even considered it - he was the only one for her. "
271,You can't stop me from laughing at something that's legitimately funny 
272,"My thoughts exactly. Men are pressured to sacrifice in the form of feeling pressured to provide for their family to their point their mental health often suffers, because they are overworked or truly hate the job, or what have you. And they are expected to do all of this without having any negative feelings about it at all. If they struggle with anxiety or depression, they are expected to just pretend it doesn't exist, because any mental health issues are seen as a flaw or weak in men. 

Women are made to sacrifice in that (for the most part) they are often the default child minder, so their careers don't progress as quickly, or they stall, or it even backtracks because it makes more sense for them to be a stay at home parent for the time being, and now while dad's career is blossoming and growing, mom's is set back because her first priority is her kids. Women are pressured to make their entire identity their children, and if they try to have a life or hobbies outside of their kids, they're made to feel selfish. 

There are lots of other ways that both sexes make sacrifices, with varying levels of intensity, but I think both have their problems. Thankfully I think the stigma around mental health (even for men) is starting to go away, and women are being encouraged more not to halt their whole lives and to take care of themselves too, but it's probably going to be an issue for a long long time still."

276,"I was having a rough night because I had an important phone interview the next morning. I was afraid to fall asleep because I know that when I'm stressed I have horrible nightmares and flashbacks. So I asked him to sit on the floor of our living room with me and started to fall asleep on his shoulder. He asked me what was going on and after explaining my situation he invited me to sleep in his bed that night so I wouldn't have to be alone. He respectfully slept as close to the wall as possible so as to not touch me (hard to do on a double bed, haha). Next morning, the interviewer never calls and I'm in a full panic because I fear that I'll never get a job. He came and gave me the closest and warmest hug as I sobbed in the kitchen. This was our first time touching (intentionally) and I just felt so safe and so loved. A few weeks later we started dating. Two years later we are still together after having spent the first year of dating apart and this last year together. His hugs still calm me when I'm not feeling well. Like a little battery boost :)"

One tells him she has migraines, the other tells her’s that the bill is from the dermatologist for “the rashes I get” and “he’s too stupid to ever actually look at the bill” and the last one is all about “if he wants a trophy wife he’s going to pay the bills and shut up”.  I walked out of the stall and my face must have given me away and one said “you’ll see someday honey, how old are you?” Ummm, 45? Silence. I usually get assumed 37ish, but mostly because I have a 17 year old. I just left because it was so fucking weird. "

That, or the time I was trying to take care of business in the ladies room at work &amp; a couple came in &amp; started to get busy in the handicap stall.  They had no idea I was there. When I finished,  I loudly cleared my throat,  flushed &amp; exited after washing up.  They got reeeeaaalll quiet when they realized someone else was in there! 

Sex in public bathrooms: just no,  guys.  Everyone else just wants to poo in peace! "

337,"My angelic daughter was in prep (five  years old). She hardly spoke at all at that age. There were some grade two boys who weren't supposed to be playing in the prep area. Her older sister told us that something happened at school that day. After some prompting, I got the story. 

""One of them tried to kick my friend.""
""So what did you do?""
""I punched him in the nose... and he cried""

The teacher wouldn't believe the boy."
338,"He tried. But she was done and had enough.

They fought a lot before to the point she'd say she's done. But he'd always make this grand romantic, apologetic gesture. Coming back like a child, literally act like a child with the voice and everything. Apologise and act like they aren't fighting. She forgives him and so on till the next fight.

Edit: probably should add that his attempt to get her back was just few minutes after she left the alter. Before the wedding was officially over. "

341,"I'm riding the gravy train, but I agree, whenever a guy goes on about how I'm ""different"" from other girls or talks trash about all of his exes. It's okay to share a story about a crazy ex, and its okay to say that you think I'm special. However, if you are hyperbolic about how crappy every other woman in your life was, something tells me that they were not the problem. "
342,"And why is it on US to compliment, why do men seem to focus on ‘women don’t compliment us’? Why don’t they compliment each other the way women do. It really is not a catch-22 because if men really wanted more compliments in general, this is easy enough to solve by complimenting each other. That so many put it on women and act like it’s our problem to solve tells me that on some level it really is about wanting more sexual attention and/or romantic interest from women than it is about just wanting compliments.

Women don’t control men’s behavior so if they want more compliments, they should have at it and compliment each other. Women do this all the time with each other."
343,I really prefer the feel of a soft t-shirt or sweatshirt and pajama pants over sleeping nude. I’ve tried it and I just feel so cozy wearing something while I sleep. 
344,"The last guy I dated was a colossal piece of shit, so I was always the one who put in more. I cooked, I cleaned, I went out with him and his friends, I adapted to his lifestyle, I jumped through hoops to keep him happy. His contributions were limited to the occasional box of chocolates. I now plan on living rest of my life SO free. I shall adopt a bunch of dogs instead."

347,"When my uncle died a few years ago we found out that his son wasn’t actually his son, it was his brothers son. My other uncles wife had an affair with his brother and got pregnant. She didn’t tell anyone and not even my 25 year old cousin knew until after his “father” died. 
So in short, my adult cousin found out his deceased father wasn’t actually his father, his uncle was his dad because his mom has an affair with him. That’s complicated."
348,"I can totally relate. It is a huge red flag when a guy insists that you drink.

354,"For me - it's not so much about the 'in bed' part. It's about the anticipation to the bed. 

I have found that what makes someone good in bed is that that they are a good kisser and are happy to just roll around and kiss/make out/grope/tease for hours. I really like just kissing and touching for ages, and it's my favourite part of a new relationship. I almost hate it when I end up sleeping with someone because the sexy anticipation is gone and now sex is 'on the table', so the build up is less exciting. The thing I love about my current guy is that even though we've been seeing each other for 3-4 months and we're in our 30s we'll still make out on the sofa (or whereever we ended up, the garden, the kitchen, the loft, the hall etc) like teenagers and it doesn't go straight to sex until we're both essentially gasping for it, and even then sometimes we don't. 

I've also found that it's all about having a laugh and making each other smile. Being versatile. Sometimes stuff doesn't work out or sometimes you're tired or sweaty or whatever. Sometimes you just want to hug. Sometimes you can't come. Sometimes you just wanna stop and cuddle. Being good in bed is a mutual thing.

I told my guy he was amazing and he was like 'eh I'm ok, you're amazing' and we just agreed it was probably us both combined that was great. It's a chemistry thing. He has a long way to go emotionally (he's come out of a longterm thing and needs a lot of me-time), but I've come out of a very trust-breaking fuckery thing (see recent whinges about alcoholic ex). He's amazing and lovely, we have great chemistry, he smells fantastic (not in a creepy way) and I think he's worth being a bit patient for. "

If any of the birds try to stick their beak in her bowl, she taps them on the nose and goes “No!” In her most serious voice. And they listen and back off. I don’t know how she learned to command birds but I think she might be Snow White incarnate."
365,"When you say first looking for, I have a few different answers. 

When I was first looking to date, I wanted a cute guy with long hair. 

When I first got married I was looking for a way out of my parents house (alcoholic mother, right when things started getting bad. I was barely 18). 

The second time I got married (19) I was looking for a way out of my aunts house, who I moved in with after 6 months of marriage to my abusive hs boyfriend. 

I divorced him after 10 years and learned a lot. He was a cheater and a liar, a narcissist, and an alcoholic. 

So when I started dating again around 30, I was looking for a healthy partner. A good person who was also good for my son. Someone who could appreciate my sense of humor, and find joy in life. Someone who was faithful, caring, and shared some of my interests. I was looking for real love, and knew I didn’t want to keep getting married to crappy people. That I wanted one last, real marriage where we could put each other first, and know we came first (which each other, not over my kiddo. He’s always first, and I’d be single for the rest of my life if that was best for him). 

So, when I got married this time, I found that. I had much different priorities, and learned a lot about what was important. But I’m happy to also report that my husband is a cute guy with long hair. 😊"
366,"My brother-in-law bought me some silk pajamas for when he came to visit our first born in the hospital. He actually asked a random woman at the store what a nice gift would be for a new mom. It was incredibly sweet and thoughtful.

To be honest, it really did make a huge difference. I remember finally starting to feel like an actual person again, not just a nine-month incubator that went through 24 hours of traumatic labor.

"
367,"Dad here. While not exactly the same thing, the root issue is the same. We are told we need to be more engaged and that it's nice or ""so sweet"" when we embrace what were traditionally moms' roles / responsibilities. I am totally cool with this!   

Reality - My daughter is a competition dancer. She's often in dressing rooms and running around like mad during competition season. Totally no way for me to help her with her hair / make up / costume changes. There are absolutely no concessions or accommodations which would allow me to do so. Even talking about it gets me funny looks like I am trying to peep or some BS. Infuriating.    

When she was younger, the same moms that say how awesome it is that I am taking my daughter to the park, act like I am a creep when I try and set up a future play-date between her and their kids.    "

After a really bad relationship, I decided to sit down and write out what I wanted my SO to be.

 I didn’t even put down half the stuff that makes my SO so amazing - think I wrote down “is affectionate/loving/vocal about feelings” but didn’t even think of “is patient, caring &amp; understanding of my illness”, “takes in interest in my interests” or even “makes me feel like I’m genuinely loved”

Sounds corny, but I didn’t believe that my “perfect man” could exist. I thought I’d have to settle &amp; make do &amp; compromise. "

373,"Not at all. I didn't know what my priorities were, until in the middle of dealing with life going wrong with my partner. 

I thought a stable job and a career track was important. Instead I got someone who will take whatever job they can when life throws things at us. When our careers were derailed, he picked up up another without missing a beat. 


I thought I needed someone who was blunt and to the point like me. Instead I've learned to be patient with his need for time to process things. 


I thought I wanted marriage and kids. Life changed the possibility of having kids. Now I'm glad to have a partner who accepts that, and is willing to do the no kids things with me.

380,"We were at an after party at a friends wedding. It was pouring and I was out in the rain, running around like an idiot. He was standing in the doorway of the bar smiling and laughing at me. I remember looking at him and thinking about how cute he looked propped up in the door way. We had been best friends for 6 years. After that, I started noticing more and more things I loved about him. It was like I was on fire all of the sudden and I couldn’t put myself out. It took me another two years to tell him how I felt. He rejected me. He was afraid to lose what we had, and I don’t think he ever much thought of me in a romantic sense. He’s a really upstanding guy, and I loved that about him. So I kept burning, hoping that one day he would catch fire too (which is a fantastical way to live and I do not recommend it as it was emotionally painful) 

It took him about 6 months to tell me he wanted to take me on a date. I almost lost my mind with excitement.

I worked for a small, locally owned grocery store and every Friday at 4 pm myself, a coworker, and 2 of our bosses would crack a couple cold ones in the back room and shoot the shit for an hour or 2. My coworker and I had had a couple beers and had to go pee. 

So we're up in the women's washroom which was right across the hall from the manager's office. My coworker and I, being a little tipsy, decided we were going to have a PEE COMPETITION... and were seeing who could finish peeing the fastest. Obviously hooting and hollering and generally being goofy. Unbeknownst to us, one of the bosses that we had a couple drinks with was up in the office doing something.

The girl he was cheating with was a guest at the wedding, and she saw the preparations and how much the bride loved him, broke down in tears and told the bride. 

The girl he was cheating with was 19, his friend's younger sister I think. I have her added on social media, she grew up into a good person. 

The bride has moved to a different city and is happy in a relationship with a woman now. I remember the groom being depressed about the whole thing but don't know what happened to him after that. "
392,"Haha I dunno if this counts but I was peeing and I heard a woman come into the bathroom and get in the stall next to mine. She said “hello?” And I thought to myself ok...she’s on the phone.

Instead of reporting the error myself, I sent her a message pointing it out and suggested that she contact our manager because I knew they would like that. 

She refused to contact them, seeing it as me ""giving her more work"" even though the work was already done and all she had to do was tell the manager about the error.

So, I told them instead. I got praised for it and was given a $200 gift card. She got criticized for not noticing the error too. "

This guy and I start chatting and he seems like good friend material. We messaged for a while and it was all great until he told me he had feelings for me a few months into our friendship. 

He wanted me to leave my current boyfriend to be with him because he could treat me so much better than my SO ever could. He said he was in love with me, told me he couldn't cope with being just friends, so he ended our friendship. I thought that was it, until one night he called me, completely drunk and yelling at me over the phone. He screamed at me, telling me to go fuck myself, how dare I do this to him, etc. Then he apologised, asked to talk in person so he could explain himself. 

We met in a public place, my girlfriend was waiting a block away just in case I needed her to pull me out. He showed up completely drunk, told me he wanted to be with me, that he was in love with me, that I was the one who got away, how he told everyone about the girl that got away, the girl who wore black shoes with flowers on them. He then hugged me really tight, wouldn't let go. This guy was physically bigger than me and very intoxicated and I just froze. He held me incredibly close to him, walked back to sit down and have me on his lap - not letting go of me the entire time. 

I kept telling him I wanted to leave and that I wanted to go, but he drunkenly told me he wanted to hold on just for a little longer and he wouldn't let go. 

He stopped contacting me for a while after that, but messaged me out of the blue again to tell me he couldn't get over me. 

I don't think he ever loved me. He loved who he thought I was. He idealised me, put me on this insanely high pedestal and kept romanticising ""our story"" to all his friends. "

Next thing I know he tries to sleep with me and I make it clear I’m not interested, just wanting to train and keep it professional. He completely stops talking to me and no longer wants to train. I don’t understand how he’s so successful if he does this with me surely he does it to others. "
420,"My great aunt was born in 1912. She had been married twice, but for very brief periods of time and never spoke of her husbands. She lived alone her entire life and was very mysterious. 

When my great aunt died, she passed down all her things to my mother through her will. We had boxes of her things in our living room. When I was 15 I looked through a box and found her diary. I unabashedly began to read through it every night. 

Through this, I found that she was attracted to women. She’d married because of social pressures, but refused to neglect her sexuality and ended the marriages quickly. She loved many of the women she’d work with at the local cafeteria, and wrote of a few crushes (and possibly affairs) she had. I never told any of my family members because they’re very traditional, but I find it very empowering to know that she was so certain of her sexuality in such a conservative time period. "

It's awkward because I don't want to shatter their dreams but I also hate lying and pretending it's great, when I really don't think it is. It makes me feel torn and guilty because I want to be kind and supportive, but I also feel a bit guilty being dishonest when they ask for my opinion."
425,"Sex is not about the penis. Sex is not over when the penis is tired. Sex is not limited to only the things that makes the penis happy. Foreplay is not just preparation for penetration. For more on this topic, see my rant entitled ""why girls do it better.""

Actually though, good sex IMO is basically two (or more!) people, who are mentally present and ""in the moment"", putting in work to make each other feel good. 

A certain percent of ""good"" is going to be reliant on individual chemistry, compatibility, and attraction. Some other percent is technique and equipment. The rest is basically ""pay attention and communicate.""

Half that shit can't be changed, so being good is about maximizing the rest. People who are good at it have a good sexual work ethic, pay attention, and communicate, + they've had some practice. "
426,"I got married at 19 almost 20. Turning 29 in a week and been with him for 9 years. 

It matured me faster because I couldn’t be “bratty”- we were/are a team and my choices directly effect him and how our life is. Its humbling and honestly, on our worst day I wouldn’t trade a single day. I’m proud we’ve outlasted most of other people’s relationships. We work our asses off for it. "
427,"In a lot of ways. Because I'm freelance and work from home, I have the time and opportunity to do chores more than he does, I also do the majority of the cooking. He's usually super tired when he comes home, so he's often too tired to take out the dog, and I pick up that slack. I also tend to buy him little things I know he'll like, fairly regularly, whereas he doesn't really do that that much (but he also doesn't grocery shop as much as I do). I initiate all the sex. I'm more physical in my affections, and I'll often stop what I'm doing just to sit down next to him, see what he's doing, ask some stuff about it, etc. I'll often to go bed later than him, even though I'm tired, just because he sometimes has trouble falling asleep, and that's easier to do without a person next to you. If I'm going out for drinks, I'll always swing by a burger joint/kiosk on the way home and get him a burger/snacks."
