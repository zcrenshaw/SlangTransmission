Assuming they were the designers they were also undoubtedly interested in seeing where the device failed. It is by studying such failures that future versions can be made more reliable.
"You, Sir, have a very logical thinking process right there. You are quite right to question that, because how WOULD the Police know that YOU were looking FOR the active shooter, when they don't know the description of the shooter and just see someone with a gun out? The truth is they probably wouldn't be able to differentiate until after they had shot you.

Also WHY would a meeting starting at 4/5pm last for **8 HOURS**! That's just crazy for a meeting at that hour to last that long, why could they not do these meetings earlier in the day? Or are there different time zones involved here?"
Jesus. Such wonderful timing for you to draw the idiot straw. And I should not have read this while sitting here waiting on ATT to decide whether or not one of its international circuits is going to finish throwing a shitfit.
"""If you don't know how to break it, you don't know how to fix it."""
"Ticket:
""The laptop beeps very loudly and produces large amounts of fire and smoke"""
Add this to the long list of basic misunderstandings some people have with technology along with thinking wireless means the modem/router don't need to be plugged in and that the power button on the monitor turns the whole computer on/off.
That sounds like a customer you need to fire
"Got this ticket via our helldesk today:

Title: ""Please change the A DNS record""


Summary: ""customer XYZ wants to have A record changed A.S.A.P""

Priority: High


No IP, no domain, only info was the ticket was filed under the customer name, but no further details and customer called multiple times to ask for a status update.


So I ask the helldesk employee what I am supposed to do with this ticket?! ""I don't know"" was the awnser..... 

I'm not in the mood to change random DNS  records with random information today, kicked ticket back: info needed.

After about an hour it turned out all the details were in the customers original e-mail ""please change A record xxx.domain.xyz to 123.456.789"", but apparently it was to much work to copy and paste that information into the ticket."
"I now work at one of the police departments that responded to that shooting. I've talked with several officers about that night. Everybody agrees that the right decision was to stay out. 

As for the long meetings... the meetings start at 5pm because they are open to the public for public discussion. The meetings can go on for 8+ hours when they are discussing contentious issues and everybody wants their say. GENERALLY, meetings lasted 2-3 hours, but there were no guarantees. "
"I love everything about this.  Japanese politeness (at least to your face) can never be overstated.  I do wonder if maybe the hotel concierge knew exactly what he was doing, and that it would work out for your dad. "
"So in this case ""destroyed"" is used loosely.  :)"
I would hate to see what happens in a real fire.
they won't report toner-taking to IT but they will fill out a clipboard form? and why punish the people who are helping you with the inventory?
"&gt;  $Teatime: Well this is outrageous! Honestly, I call because I'm having issues with Office and you end up removing my perfectly functional machine from the network. You're overreacting! I want to speak to your manager!

Typical (l)user."
"Honestly, as shitty as this sounds to fucking say it, but I should have known something was going to go wrong the moment I was connected to an Indian call center instead of a state-side technician.

But seriously, who the FUCK puts an IP Passthrough in place for a simple problem regarding port forwarding. All I needed to know is if the port was being blocked on the ISP Side, because the same port forwarding has worked at all other client sites that have AT&amp;T internet (Hell, I was at one today and it was easy peasy)

Second worst to this though was setting up a VOIP phone service for a client, and spending 2 hours waiting on Spectrum to set up their equipment, port forwarding on their router only to be told 'Oh, port forwarding won't work on that router. You need to put ANOTHER router behind it and assign it to the static IP address your client has purchased for their VOIP system""

I could have spent all that time configuring the router I brought with me instead of acting on the word of the Spectrum Technician that led me to believe the public IP address of the client would be changed to the static they were paying for."
"We actually have ended support for this. We're basically forcing people to upgrade in September. Anyone who responded to our many emails about it gets to schedule it, but anyone who didn't respond gets forcibly upgraded during a maintenance window. So she'd be upgrading this year whether she likes it or not.

The other good thing is that they've decided not to renew this group's contract for next year. They're also getting turned off earlier than other people usually do because of the ranty aggressive ""good riddance"" speech she gave my manager. "
I know how to fix quite a lot of computer issues that I don't have the slightest idea how people manage to cause.
"“Dear sir stroke madam, I’m writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out at the premises of—“ no that’s too formal."
"That or it sounds like it is time to end support for
&gt; our lowest, trashiest, break-iest version of the software because she refuses to upgrade"
"&gt;C: RIGHT WELL MAYBE YOUS SHOULD PHONE NEW CUSTOMERS AND TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO TURN IT ON FIRST!

Should've told him you wouldn't want to be patronising."
"The clipboard only fixed one of two problems, the toner stock (and that's if they bothered to fill it out so it probably wasn't accurate anyway), it didn't fix them breaking the printers which was the bigger issue at hand (yes replacing toner is easy but they somehow still manage to fuck it up). Platforms run 24/7 with permits constantly being printed, a broken printer is a major issue out at sea."
"Sounds like he got some design engineers who were more than happy to fix it for the ability to see where the thing broke. One of their babies came home from the wild. :D

Would have been a fun diversion and a good way for them to make improvements on the next model.

Living in Japan, I've found much like anywhere else, you can go a long way with politeness and a little luck in finding the right person at the right time."
"Ouch. Been there, suffered thus. Significant projects randomly triaged, minor projects routinely shelved. 

Sometimes, the only way to make progress was to 'acquire' the necessaries piecemeal via the 'general consumables' budget.

&amp;#x200B;

OT: We used to joke the half-life of a Corporate Five-Year Plan (TM) was eighteen months..."
"That was Sony in the 1980s. Their. stuff. didn't. break. If it did, they fixed it before any rumors got started."
"I love using security as a blunt object.  The very few times as an L1 analyst that I've gone from passive and docile to just straight up angry-voiced ""NO"" is when I've witnessed password sharing.

Had one just recently that I noticed at the tail end of the call.  Gave the guy several different opportunities to tell me ""The computer you're remoting into isn't mine but is &lt;whoever&gt;. They'll be the one to try and log in etc.""

He got shouty back at me and I said, ""I don't care, I asked you several times if YOU put in YOUR credentials and you told me yes.  This is a MAJOR security concern and violation"".  

Best thing about it, the few times I've done that, no one ever said ""You could have been nice about it"".  I've rarely seen ""nice"" working when talking about security.  "
"6'9""?   Probably figured they'd like to see that in person.. the walkman was incidental."
"Honestly 


I almost feel bad for him...almost


He was given vague instructions and then got raked over the coals for it

I suspect the main reason he got fired (the ALMOST part) was bc he was being an entitled snowflake about the whole thing "
"Honestly, I really wanted my boss to say, ""Look. If you're unhappy with the service we provide, you are free to find another company. But you have to pay us for the time and materials we used at your location, and correcting the screw up by AT&amp;T. ""

They didn't even pay for the damn power supply that we put in to replace the one they threw away. TBH we should go back and take it back since they didn't want to pay for it....

When I was hearing the story of the encounter, all I could think of was ""This person must use this tactic alot to get their way"" and when I heard the 'You're just trying to intimidate me because you're a man and I'm a woman"", I just felt embarrassed that they'd try to use such low-ball tactic like that to guilt-trip my boss.

He's a really good guy tbh, but she really pushed him around and got her way."
"Dear Sir/Madam

Fire! Fire! Fire!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

"What do we want?

&amp;#x200B;

QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT!

&amp;#x200B;

When do we want it?

&amp;#x200B;

SIMULTANEOUSLY!

&amp;#x200B;"
"100% yes, because it was the most entertaining title I could come up with."
"I get what you mean. I will say though, this wasn't the first time Teatime had been an entitled snowflake about ~~anything~~ everything. He knew that his exception was only for a day... this was several months down the line and he had specific instructions about the machine to be connected being basically a clean install of 8.1. So he'd violated a bunch of things. It's hard to put across without the exact emails in front of me, but it wasn't undeserved."
or the laptop does not need to be plugged into the wall ever... and the list goes on and on and on!
"Well, they were probably just appeasing him to avoid another Kaiju destroying the city. They have enough problems with Godzilla already. "
"&gt; I have no doubt you'll be speaking to a number of managers very soon

That is a classic line right there."
"The user could have been thinking about BitLocker, which does recognize the F keys as regular numbers (in fact, if you go to put in a recovery key, you'll find it gives instructions to use the F keys to put in numbers (even though regular numbers work just fine)."
"It was store policy where I worked.  You swear, I say 'Sorry. No swearing allowed"" and hang up if they continue.

&amp;#x200B;

If they call back, the moment they use a swear word I was allowed to hang up.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely had to hang up more than twice, but I did have few customers that needed a lot more hanging up to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
"I don't understand this mentality. ""This is business critical to me. Fix it!"" ""Please may I have this information to fix it?"" ""Why are you so lazy? This should be fixed already!"" ""Closing ticket to fulfill customer's expectation of laziness."""
"I had to help. We were after all, literally in the same boat."
Yeah I would’ve hung up within 5 seconds of hearing that crap.
"You can actually get ""portable monitors"" now that only need a USB-C connection to the host PC, for both power and video signal. One cable.

You also get mains-powered monitors with a USB-C port that support USB-C power delivery, allowing you to connect a USB-C laptop to them and have it both charge and display the picture over a single cable. Some of them also have an integrated USB hub, allowing you to keep e.g. a mouse plugged in to the monitor, and basically do away with the need for a laptop dock.

USB-C is pretty damn cool."
"We're running 25 printers at the moment across the 3 topsides and the flotel (it's a triple stack platform in the middle of commissioning, it's a new build currently under construction). One area has 4 printers all heavily used, I find out we have broken printers in that area when I come down to an email titled ""Down to our last working printer"" :("
"Had a similar experience myself. Not IT related but still.

Was on vacation in another country with my now ex-wife. She is a bit on the plus size. We where waiting in line for a tourist thingy and the people behind us where shaming her for her size in their own language, their own dialect even. Only problem for them was that we lived in the town next to it and could understand and speak the dialect. At some point she turned to me so we both could see each other and them and gave an entire rant, not yelling but speaking a just bit louder, about how awful it is that people, when on vacation, think they can shame others in their mother-tongue assuming the others can't understand you since they're in another country. This all in our dialect. Never saw people turning red of shame that fast. "
