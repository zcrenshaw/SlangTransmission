"Anyone interested in remaking Saw? But instead of torture devices its just a computer or other device with a single easily identifiable problem and if the user doesn't fix the problem, they don't leave the room. "
"It would be even better if they could see their retirement account on the screen hemmorhaging money into their subordinates' bank accounts and all they have to do is follow simple onscreen instructions to stop it. But as they're panicking they can't fathom what ""right-click"" means and want to blame someone else. They call IT and are stuck in a perpetual phone menu with no helpful options eventually getting put on hold. Their despair grows and their millions transition into hundreds of thousands of dollars, enriching the lives of those they've lorded over for decades and they go ballistic not knowing what to do. Cutaway to the IT guy eating a sandwich, looking at the executive's screen through some remote desktop application, fully able to stop it but choosing not to."
A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.
"Tell the to get an extension called 'the great suspender' it ""freezes"" inactive tabs to free up some ram."
"&gt;fully able to stop it but choosing not to.

Because a ticket wasn't submitted "
"Sometimes tech support throws you for a loop. Like, way more than you're expecting. 

It's just nice when said loop has a happy ending. :)"
Obviously after they topped off their router with internets they simply forgot to seal the ports.  All the internets drained out over the course of the trip so naturally they'll need to syphon some off of your network.
At least she was saving them.I was bracing myself for the worst. 
"Buying *real* copies is fine, especially for something that isn't in print anymore, but buying one that seems to be some burned copy from the seller is a time to never put the disk into a computer, and just file a report with Ebay."
"I need to find a way to force extensions over a network, this and an Ad-Blocker would solve a lot of the annoying little problems i have to deal with"
"Google and Firefox both have GPOs now, I have Ublock Origin rolled out on both to everyone.

Boy howdy where's that back child support
"Yeah, she still goes there once per week to open it and pick up her earnings."
"That's the essence of a scream test.

Even if someone says a thing is not needed, do not decommission it immediately. Just disable it and wait a while to see if anyone complains."
"She took the coins as payment, yes?"
"By the way, OP. I'm your real Dad."
"""These roads are terrible, it's so hard to get anywhere!""

""...Your car has no gas."""
"&gt; what a con, so I have to pay them to access their wifi?

well, i mean... it certainly *is* a con"
Indeed. Policy must always be followed.
"Sorry, all spent on Steam games."
"&gt;	I type down what I want it to say. Then I put in my images, and I arrange them on the page where I want them.

Grandma can get her images and text where she wants them in Word?

I‚Äôm impressed!

I probably would have done the same thing so I guess I can't fault you
You owe your manager vodka.. High quality vodka.
"Hm, and here I am creating packages like a chump"
For old stuff GOG tends to be better than Steam.
So true in all fields! I'm a mechanic sort of and I recognise so many of the store from here. Just different lingo and heavier equipment to throw at annoying people.
I hate this comment so much
"Best manager ever really. The team as a whole will follow him to the ends of the earth and back. 

The 2 oldest guys on the team has followed him from company to company over the last 10 years or so. "
"Amazing story and well told. That sounds like the biggest ""I told you so."" moment ever. 

Sorry you had to put in so many overtime hours looking at all the wrong things when you knew the problem almost immediately.

&gt;a five or six figure bill.

Hopefully it will be a good reminder to listen to the tech support who you hired to take care of you in the first place. After all, you hired them to keep the equipment that they installed running."
I wish my neighbour would let me cream her for 25¬¢
"I like scream tests, but sometimes you get very unlucky and the scream only echoes back after half a year, because no one noticed."
"Welp, i guess she thought she could just deny it and blame it on you fucking up. Certainly didn't expect that recording lol."
"It really does. I ran my company‚Äôs help desk for ten years. Those days when someone hands you their personal laptop that their youngest child spilled something on, and they are in tears because they have all the pictures of their older daughter‚Äôs wedding on it. They can give a shit that that a $2,000 laptop is fried...

All you do is pull the drive, hook an IDE to USB in, and save the photos off of it, and they think you‚Äôre a miracle worker. When you take the time to look at something they know you shouldn‚Äôt be working on, and you do it anyway. Sure it‚Äôs what, 5 minutes out of your life? But you could make a person‚Äôs week... That‚Äôs the stuff that makes it worth it. 

"
"This ended differently than I'd imagined. I thought she'd end up being upset that her daughter was able to find and contact her, and would freak out about privacy and whatnot. I could understand either way, but it's nice to see that she's happy about it and she gets to reconnect."
""" We need to switch to macs ""

Haha I'm sure the printer will work better after switching workstaions xD"
So have you looked at whatever he was writing the contact name on since that conversation? Because there's a good chance your name is on it...
"Tech: ""Well Boss, if Mac is the name of your replacement, I agree."""
That's where my mind went to.
"Time to teach the proper use of bookmarks.  Abusing tabs uses up the computer's memory slowing everything down, mmmkay?"
"You know now your ceo has your back - even better that you found out naturally and not that they made a big deal of it. 

Best of luck with the studies! "

"We had an accountant win this big fight to get a $2000 Macbook. You should have seen his face sink when we said the only way for him to be compatible with our all Windows network and our Windows programs was for him to use the terminal server. Yup, $2000 Macbook into a 2008r2 terminal server all day. We don't have any licenses for Office for Mac so *ALL* his work is done there. Feels good."
"Before people had videogames in their own homes, you had to go to a specialized area called an ""Arcade"" 

These buildings housed arcade machines, which would allow you to cream your neighbor at Street Fighter for 25 cents per round. 

The arcade machine owners would empty the coin trays weekly"
That's some IT Crowd/Dilbert shit right there... 
"Not too long before I left my previous job, we took on a new Ops Manager and he introduced me to the word specificity in no small part due to a coworker who liked to talk as vaguely as humanly possible. That word is pretty much always in the back of my mind now.

So yeah, I definitely have no problem kicking something back. Request unclear, please be more specific."
