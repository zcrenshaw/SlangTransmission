"The problem with this is that it just means that now the seat is at the wrong height. Correct desk-seat height has the seat at a level where your thighs are level with the floor and your shins face straight down, with your hands at the level of the desk when perpendicular to the torso, and the monitors at eye level. HR guy solved one ergonomic problem by creating a different ergonomic problem. "
"Hope you document that S refused to attempt to use her network password and demanded the reset. Based on this transcript, she sounds like she will be busy blaming you for her predicament to anyone she thinks can punish you."
"First rule of scream testing: make sure you're in a position to reconnect the ""nobody needs it"" device when the inevitable screams happen.

Second rule of scream testing: when you run a scream test, and YOU are the one who winds up screaming, don't call up someone who you never bothered telling about what you were going to do and tell them ""It's your fault, you fix it""."
"Oh yeah, calls are recorded as well. She can huff and puff all she wants. "
"You send that man a bag of gummy worms and get his personal phone number. 

You just gained a lackey. "
I am missing something here.  What business thinks it is ok to leech another business's network? Get a decent connection installed. It isn't even that expensive compared to building out an office.  
"Sadly, I guessed the right answer by line three. Been there way too often."

"I often get calls that a device is not working in the office of the restaurant chain I support. My first question is always “is there a cell phone charging on the desk?” 

If if is yes, “unplug the charger and plug the device back in.”

99% successful!"
"So what they're saying is that I can:  
Step 1 - ""Throw away"" my new laptop (but not really throw it away)  
Step 2 - Call support and say I threw it away.  
Step 3 - Get new laptop!"
"In the words of my high school's sysadmin years back, ""remember kids, wireless only means that they've removed one wire!"""
Isn't part of getting a higher education supposed to be learning how to continue learning on your own after you leave school?
"It's triggering the magnetic lid sensor, making the laptop think the screen has been closed and that it needs to go to sleep/suspend."
"To paraphrase House, as we so often do around here:

Rule 1: the ~~patient~~ *user* always lies"
Ya any decommission server is to be kept on hot standby for no less than 30 days for this exact reason. &lt;- Actual official policy where I work.
Your local IT successfully outsourced IT work...to a user?  *looks around warily*  Is it the End Times already?
"If it was me I ^(maybe...) might have gone and attached the call log for her manager's manager to be able to ""thoroughly"" understand the situation.

Edit: spelling"
I'm sure [competitor] will be glad to give him free shocks in exchange for a pinky promise that he threw the old ones away. 
"Simple, just simply adjust the desk and floor height next. Problem solved!"
And then he realizes he could have been done by now if he'd just done it properly to begin with
"&gt; Her contact number is 123456789

Funny story. Yesterday, I got an email from someone who had that in his signature. So, without thinking, I dial 9 for an outside line, 1 for a US number, then 123--wait, why is it ringing already? Ah shit.

We got a visit a few minutes later from the local police department just to make sure everything was okay."
"They’re a contractor working for the hotel refurbishing the hotels rooms. So I can kinda see why you might want/expect to use their internet. And the office is probably a portable unit or two, so not so much building. Just plonk it down. "
"Sounds like he was using a literal pin to try and open the sim tray. He couldn't get the pin in the hole, probably missed the little key in the booklets. Assuming it's a modern device with the little pop out tray, instead of the good old removable backing and battery. "
"&gt;Well, Your sales people should really tell people that they need to plug in the computers before they can use them.

Sorry, we assumed you were smart enough to plug in a hair dryer before you use it, or start your car before you attempted to drive it.

This is why my old Best Buy had a running joke. There's a reason we called them 'customers' and not 'people'. Customers are unable to think for themselves and find any way possible to make their stupidity not their fault. Kind of like politicians."
"Lemme guess. Tier 1 has some ridiculous call time metric to meet, don't they?"
"Well there's your answer then. I wouldn't necessarily blame them.
The subtext to ""It's a long process"" is most likely that they get shafted for not handling it ""in due time"", when it's actually part of the process they also must follow at the same time.

Essentially they are in a position where they must close or escalate the ticket asap but also do the thing that requires shitty manual work for 30 minutes -- which inflates their even shittier metrics and gets them penalized for doing their job properly. I'm guessing _you_ don't have such a time metric, which is probably why they were trying to escalate the ticket.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Call Centers are nightmarish this way. No wonder the employee turnover in tier one is usually incredible."
"&gt; So users complain about laptop screens rather than appreciate they have a new superfast laptop with wifi they can use to work from home on.

Duh. They got a downgrade in ergonomics for an upgrade of on-paper stats they likely don't care about.

&gt;  Brilliantly the HR manager asks the user to step aside, sits down, adjusts the users chair and then shouts problem solved.

HR was being stupid then. Now the user sits at the wrong height…

Tbh., this just sounds like poor planning. What you think the users need is not what they actually need."
how does a smartwatch trigger a reboot? without ever being connected?
"Way over complicating things.  Just adjust the floor height instead.

Or maybe the user height."
That's why every smart company changed it to 8 to dial out.
"This is beautiful!

Now, I don't remember where i heard a story like this before. I think maybe my dad.

A airport had issues where sometime flight control sometimes could not start up their computers. After a colleague had done troubleshooting for 30 minutes it was given to level 2 support. They asked ""Are you charging your phone?"" The user replayed back ""Well yes?"".

After the user unplugged his phone from the computers startup process did not try to boot up from the users phone."
Exactly. Some tier 1 users think that if they call us we'll find the solution for them. This one is very known for doing that and we are allowed to tell users to do their jobs; professionally of course.
"Most likely these are 3phase electrical industrial machines,   the cost of doing that would be high, and hooking it up would take expertise and time...
"
"I thought in the UK it was 0118, 999, 881, 999, 119, 725…3"
Could you hire portable generators and charge the customer for it?
Same here... I didn't realize how many people have trouble with hide-able fields until I started in tech support.
"I really, really hope you got ALL of your emails regarding your recommendations in writing, because I would be tempted to attach EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. to an email and CC in EVERYBODY."
"You have to put it somewhere and engineer a hole in the case. That stuff costs money, whereas bunging a magnet in one place and a 
magnetic switch in another is a much simpler job"
Someone left this woman unsupervised for two weeks? 
"&gt; $C: *scoff* wow, he has no idea does he?

Ok, well, some users will be users....

&gt; $CIT: Yea those $primary-HD people are really the bottom of the barrel...

Nope. Not even cool. IT sticks together, even if someone is obviously less experienced. We back each other up, because we know how hard it is and how hard the user's are on us. 

Glad you stood up for yourself. "
"Sure, but it's all billable, right?"
"I really don't understand hot desking. 

Apart from the disenfranchisement of not having a place in the office to call your own surely there are major issues with back / posture etc. You can do untold damage to your back using the wrong chair / desk arrangement and it takes most of a us a while to get an arrangement that works. If you have to sit at a different desk / chair every day it must be a nightmare. "
You can if you use Amazon support.
It would explain her power trip. 
"Ancillary to rule 1 they sometimes lie without knowing it

Rule 2: its never dns until the one time it is dns"
Generators in the needed size are rented / booked about half a year beforehand and need to be unloaded with a crane so it wasn't an option in that case
"It's a good policy. Some fringe cases pop up in this sub from time to time where the server or device is only used seasonally, so after that month they think they're good until 6 months later somebody starts screaming. "
