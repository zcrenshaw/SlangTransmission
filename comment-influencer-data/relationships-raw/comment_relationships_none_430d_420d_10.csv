0,"Ask her why she cares? Play it off like you suspect your friends are the ones doing it. Give her enough rope and see how it goes down.

Sorry you need to deal with someone to shitty. "
1,"Codependency. Your husband is not healthy for his sister. 

You are 24. Should you date a guy who doesn't support you, doesn't see things realistically, and behaves in an unhealthy manner? What about your future kids? What if they choose actions or habits that will drastically negatively affect them but your husband thinks it's ok?

Honestly, your husband sounds mentally ill. 

You are gonna have to think things through.

It is very difficult being with someone who isn't mentally healthy. And it's your husband."
2,"Ask her relentlessly for it every single day until she will be happy to pay you $90 to get you off her ass. 

You can also say what you said here- that for her it may mean nothing, but for you it is lunch for 2 weeks. Also you can bring out the guilt trip and say you trusted her to pay you back, you can't afford it, and you can't believe she would be such a terrible person who would basically steal from a friend when you thought you could trust her. 

I pulled the guilt trip of ""You're not the man I thought you were."" when my friend owed me for a plane ticket, and was dragging his feet. He felt guilty and immediately Venmoed me the money. I don't know your friend, but you can try the disappointed approach, and if that doesn't work then raise hell?"
3,You should break up with him so he can be with someone who finds the whole package attractive.
4,"Yep. Does your family know you're a tissue match? If not, tell everyone you're not a suitable donor, which is true. Your medical records are private, and you can also request specifically that the results not be disclosed to anyone."
5,"Let‚Äôs be honest, she‚Äôs not getting an invite to this witches wedding after she bows out. Good riddance "
6,"Just... just stop, dude... why are you more concerned with trying to convince the friend to go to therapy than focusing on improving your relationship with your pregnant wife? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
7,"The thread you are asking about refers to OP and her boyfriend only having been dating for 7 months, whereas the current thread references a 5 year relationship.

I do see the striking similarities, though."
8,"OP says she 'also ends up doing a lot at home', so I'm really not clear on what exactly it is her husband contributes other than some casual cruelty...?"
9,"&gt; ""Why did you order a $19 meal and not eat any of it?""

This is where it went off the rails.

Now, teenagers can be sullen and moody, regardless of the time of day or phase of the moon.  But when you said this, you made it about the cost of the dish rather than her well-being.  Now, I'm not saying it wasn't rude to order an expensive dish and not eat it.  And if she didn't take it with her, doubly so.  Not sure about your in-law's culture, but this is something your husband needs to nip in the bud.  They're his family, so he needs to sort it out."
10,"Came here to say this. If I want to go out to a nice meal at someplace moderate or above, I offer to pay because I make significantly more than my SO. Same thing with concert tickets, etc. I tend to be the one who buys more groceries for us because of income (and damn it sometimes I want a NY strip!). He does other things for me like mowing my yard, changing the oil or servicing my car. 

He is great about figuring out less expensive but still fun outings (going to the river for an afternoon with a cooler, taking a hike together that is new). 

It took us a while to get here because for the longest time he felt guilty about it (still does sometimes) but I argued that if he just refused to go, then I lost out on some experiences I wanted. I think we've worked it out pretty well."
11,Yeah and be sure to bring up the amount of texting your wife and her husband do. I'm sure she will be thrilled to her about how much her husband has taken to op's wife. 
12,"Philosophically I agree with you, but I've been in several wedding parties and nobody has ever paid for any of my shit. It's just not how it's done, at least in the ~~the US~~ certain parts of the US.

edit - a lot of times the bridesmaids hair and makeup is covered, but that's it. And it's not always covered.

double edit - I am starting to suspect it has nothing to do with region and it's just that my married friends are all assholes."
13,"You deserve better than this mate. Someone who loves and respects you whilst and not someone who is cheating around whilst you‚Äôre helping raise her kids. See a therapist, talk to someone and get it out there. x "
14,"oh, no. Please don't let pride get in the way of you being safe and loved. Even if that means calling your family and asking them to wire you money for a plane ticket home. You may be able to get your marriage annulled. 

Are you in a country where you could legally and financially nail this man to the wall? If so, then maybe it's worth staying in the country but moving out of the house. But if you're in a country where this sort of thing is allowed to happen and where women are lesser citizens than men, swallow your pride and get the hell out of there. "
15,"&gt; Three internships and no offers for a smart well qualified graduate is kinda a pattern.

OP I tried this. It's awful. I figured the first job my ex GF didn't work out with was an asshole manager. The second, sure, they had turnover all the time, I could see it. What a string of bad luck.

After the third place fired her I realized that if it smells everywhere you go, you should check your shoe."
16,"It sounds like he for whatever reason doesn't want to be seen with you, likely because he wants to portray himself as single in case another opportunity comes along (while of course getting all the benefits of having a girlfriend in the meantime).

Your boyfriend honestly sound like a terrible person and your self-esteem is going to take a massive hit if you keep letting yourself be treated this way. He is actively excluding you from events that you are invited to in a real shitty and manipulative way. When he left you in the car and told you to go to some public toilet to avoid having to introduce you to his friends (who probably would be appalled to hear that he had had his girlfriend sit outside in the car the whole time), that's when you should have gathered your dignity and left that tool.

I want to point out that you sound like a kind and thoughtful person and you don't deserve this treatment. You are worth so much more than this and derserve someone who treats you well."
17,"Maybe rethink your relationship because dating someone who is unable to get and keep a job sucks. 

Did you have any idea that your GF may have these type issues (inability to apprehend appropriate behavior with superiors, laziness, etc.)? It‚Äôs possible that your GF can take some constructive criticism and learn from this experience. It‚Äôs also possible that she will be resentful, defiant and that these issues will plague her going forward. Three internships and no offers for a smart well qualified graduate is kinda a pattern. "
18,"YES. Quit the texting. It doesn‚Äôt help. 

In person is best.  I like the gift idea too.  Also making sure she knows you want her but not quite ready. "
19,"I‚Äôm speculating that it‚Äôs more along the line that Jane was assaulted by the police and still have some sort of PTSD for it and John cannot say anything because Jane doesn‚Äôt anyone to know the context. Still, it‚Äôs kind of a stretch to take it out on mike who isn‚Äôt even the police."
20,"I cannot even begin to explain how strange and creepy your father's behavior is. he's obsessed with your sex life? he kept saying your boyfriend ""put it in""? he shares information about his own sex life? your father is literally imagining you having sex.

that is very disturbing and NOT normal. 

I have a very good relationship with my father and we have never, ever, ever talked about sex. not even once. 

you really need to sit down with your mom, alone, and talk to her about this. seriously. your father's attitude toward sex, and you having sex, has the potential to really screw you up if you don't nip this in the bud. "
21,"I'm a father of daughters. Your mom was waiting for the call. She might not be perfect in the car ride home, but bear in mind that as soon as you click your seatbelt in her car, *things start getting better*."
22,You need to put your safety above everything else. Its not your fault your brother is a violent shit or that the rest of the family enable him. Leave and keep a distance from this person going forward. Your mom isn't going to open her eyes until the boy turns on her
23,How the hell do you have a surprise fancy dress party? Will the guest of honour be the only one not in costume? that's sucky planning 
24,"It wasn't bordering an emotional affair. It was definitely an emotional affair, and that's why you are currently feeling the way you do. Your wife replaced the communication you two should be having as a couple with communication with her coworker. I advise picking up the audiobook, ""Not Just Friends"" and listening to it together. This will give your wife perspective on how inappropriate her behavior was."
25,I have never thrown up after a night of drinking in my life except when I was keto. I woke up feeling like shit and started stuffing frozen raspberries down my throat out of desperation for some carbs and then projectile vomited neon pink all over the bathroom.

27,"There is also a risk to her - a friend of a friend essentially died of post-partum psychosis, she developed some delusions that caused her to blindly flee her house in the middle of the night and was hit by a car. OP, please work with her husband to get her help."
28,A prior post of his says 14. 
29,"You could tell him one last time that you don‚Äôt want to mix your FWB with your friends, and that he needs to stop pushing the issue. If he keeps bringing it up, then you‚Äôll have to find a new guy unfortunately. "
30,"&gt; phd programs almost always involve a stipend or some type of payment

and if they dont, you shouldnt do them.  Seriously, if your department think you are good enough, they'll *find* you finding. But if they don't find you funding, sure, they'll take *your* money happily, but you are wasting your time because you have no academic future"
31,"OP, this comment above is solid advice you need to remember. If your dad starts the guilt trip that he took care of you, remember it was his obligation and duty.  Even if he paid for things he did not have to. You don't OWE him to live in your house (whether he's a shit roommate or great roommate).  The relationship you had with him has changed. You are now an independent adult and he is taking advantage of that, living rent-free on top of it and treating you like you are still a kid."
32,"I have been on this sub for 11 years, and I have *never* seen an update post that went along the lines of ‚ÄúI loved him so much that he actually stopped being lazy and turned his whole life around!‚Äù

What I have seen, over and over again, is this: ‚ÄúI begged and pleaded for him to change. I threatened to break up with him. He decided to put in the work, and for three weeks he was the man I knew he could be! Then he slowly started going back to his old ways. We repeated this process about ten times over three years. We broke up. I feel like I wasted my time.‚Äù

Love is not enough to build a happy life on. You need love, yes - but you also need to have the same goals and values and outlook on life. Love gets you in the door and gives you an opportunity to see someone‚Äôs true self, and that‚Äôs what you got.

Leaving him because he‚Äôs a lazy mooch doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt truly love him, or that you didn‚Äôt try your hardest. It just means you‚Äôre not compatible - and that‚Äôs okay.
"
33,"HR is who would be enforcing the sibling policy if it was going to be enforced. But instead, HR is who pushed the hiring through despite the sibling policy, knowing you're siblings. If HR was going to fire you for being siblings, they just wouldn't have hired you to begin with. This is a non-issue."
34,"5 hours round trip or one way?

I think eitger way you just tell him that picking him up doesn't work with your schedule. If he is salty then he is salty, enjoy the rest of your family"
35,"&gt; he physically held her down.

And if Op had fought back you can bet it would have been more than just restraining and forcing her. :/"
36,"&gt;I don't think I'm expecting him to read my mind though.

You repeatedly get upset with him for not proposing when you think he should propose. 

You guys agreed to a deadline.  Just leave him alone and adhere to the agreement you made.  Honestly you're ruining it by having a hissy fit every time he doesn't do it when you think he should.  For all you know he has some grand plan and now since you've berated him about it so much it's going to feel like you forced it on him, even if he had been planning it all along. 

Seriously you're sucking all the spontaneity and fun and romance out of this."
37,"I struggle with similar anxiety starting important projects and I put them off until they become emotional deadweight wearing me down. I‚Äôm working through this in therapy (which I totally recommend if this is an ongoing problem for you) but in the meantime I reach out to the people close to me for support starting and finishing the work. Your partner is NOT doing that. Instead he‚Äôs making you feel worse about yourself and making it harder for you to finish your work which is probably feeding into the paralysis you‚Äôre experiencing. He‚Äôs not ‚Äúkeeping things light‚Äù because the only audience for his jokes (you) don‚Äôt find them funny. Maybe you can sit him down and say something like ‚ÄúI am feeling very stressed about this work and it‚Äôs making it harder for me to get started or finish it in time for the deadline. You joking about the situation is hurtful and upsets me.‚Äù And see how he responds. Also to be fair to your partner - even though he has experienced similar problems in the past, he might not know how to cope with them or help you. He might also be feeling a bit neglected if you‚Äôve been really stressed out and don‚Äôt have the emotional energy to do fun things with him. Even so he should communicate that to you insetad of mocking you."
38,"Wow.  This is the first time I've ever heard of someone else having to deal with the exact same thing.  My husband is the same, and then completely forgets that he was ever like that, and then it all happens again most weekends.  I have no solutions but I can empathise, it's so fucking tiring.  "
39,"Based on your wife's reaction here, his account seems very plausible."
40,"You are right.  She antagonized him by doing the decent thing.

He‚Äôs insecure. He knows he hasn‚Äôt earned this job.

Secure and decent people are grateful when someone fixes their mistakes."
41,"Gotta agree here.  My uncle and cousin are  engineers who do a lot of international consulting and often take their wives when they can go. But I can totally understand that ""bringing the SO"" reads completely differently for 2 very senior male engineers who are doing consulting in addition to their primary jobs as academic researchers  than it does for a 25 year old woman on a team of mostly more senior men.  Especially when they're working internationally in countries that may have a really different work/gender culture than the US does, and especially when it seems like her company doesn't have a culture where SOs are really welcomed.

Honestly, it baffles me a little that so many people are being so clueless about the gender and power dynamics at play here."
42,Start with your brother.  You don't have to mention the eavesdropping.  Just tell him that you are sorry you didn't get to spend more time with them because you are starting  to see why he likes her.   Mention her every time you talk with him and gradually become her friend too.
43,"You're supposed to be her lover and her partner, not her therapist. This is beyond Reddit's pay and it's beyond yours. If she won't go to therapy then you need to leave. 

Stop destroying yourself to try and make her feel better. Why do you feel this is what you deserve? "
44,Holy shit. These guys have been living rent free for 6 years and they have no money saved up? That is insane. 
45,"Hey, I have to tell you a story, because it's very relevant to this situation. I worked overseas for several years, and I worked with a group of Canadians. At both schools I worked at, several Canadians made really horrible remarks about native people. I told them, several times, that my grandmother was biracial, but I think they thought it was just that sort of thing where every other white person you meet has a ""Cherokee great great great grandmother."" At the last place, one guy was talking major crap. A few days later, I brought out a picture of my grandmother and I at a pow wow. I've never felt the mood of a room change so quickly in my life. It was definitely an ""oh crap"" moment for a few of them, as they tried to apologize for the things they had said the other day before. It was a weird, weird situation. These same people would have been up in arms about any other group being spoken about that way, but there is apparently a giant blind spot about Native people there (according to other Canadians I talked to about this). Some Canadians get really upset when I've told this story. Not all of them, but I've had a few of them go on about how ""it's not as bad as the states.""

I get it, we have terrible racial issues in America. Canada doesn't have the same history as we have, and they don't have those issues \*with the same groups of people.\* They do have a very similar, terrible history, with Native people there. Whatever you decide to do, I would urge your wife to be cautious about thinking Canadians will be much better than Americans in her particular situation. I have loved most of my Canadian coworkers, but I would be careful about thinking the sort of racism she has experienced will be different in Canada.

Again, this has always brought out Canadians who get angry that I tell this story, and try to argue that America is always worse at racial issues. That is probably very much true...for any other group than Native Americans/Aboriginals. I know first hand that I heard these random, racist comments from otherwise liberal Canadians at two different places I was working at. I know how awkward they acted after they knew that, hey, my family member really is part of the group you're talking crap about. I'm not debating the overall quality of life is much better for the majority of Canadians, and that it is a safer place, with better access to healthcare. I'm only saying, your wife's race will possibly bring out the same kind of racists there that it would in the states. :( Has she talked to any native people in Canada about this, and asked for their input? They would have a lot of insight into this situation."
46,"OK so the police telling you to call your parents is a breach of their responsibility. This is NOT their place to say that and i'm very surprised that they would say something like that that oversteps their responsibility/authority.

If I was you, I would reply to mom like this

""Mom, I know you're worried about me, but calling the cops to come to my house is incredibly overstepping. For that reason I am not going to talk to you for 1 month. If you call the cops on me again, I will go to a lawyer and get a temporary restraining order against you. You need to learn to let go, i'm an adult and I don't need you hovering over my life. Goodbye. I will call you august 10th."""
47,Yeah this is a dealbreaker. 
48,"This is a dealbreaker for me, too. He's already had a DUI, he should know better. "
49,"&gt;But who knows, usually ""vanilla"" girls have a sex-goddess inside of them which comes out in the weirdest forms.

Sure, some people are just vanilla as a default, because they haven't tried anything kinky. But a lot of people truly know that they're vanilla. Maybe they've tried kinky stuff and didn't like it. Or, maybe they just know they're vanilla!

I know you weren't trying to imply that vanilla people are all just prudes who haven't tried anything else...but speaking as a vanilla woman who's tried all sorts of kinky shit and HATED it...I like to make comments to this effect to clear up common misconceptions, or at least what I see as misconceptions :)"
50,"You are not a jerk. I had neighbors like  this and you are absolutely right that if you give an inch they will take a mile. I didn't give my neighbors a ride because that was the last thing they asked for when i said no in such a way that they knew i was DONE. It was my only day off that week. I worked 6 days and just wanted to relax on my day off. They knocked on my door FIVE TIMES asking to use my fuckin cell phone back when minutes were limited. They knew before they even asked for a ride that I was done because I was rolling my eyes as soon as I opened the damn door the 5th time.

You might actually want to stop answering your door. Just say you were busy when they inevitably ask, or say you were in the shower, napping, whatever. "
51,"Probably two socially awkward teens who met on an online forum or some such, of similar levels of immaturity and social inexperience. That‚Äôs my read, anyhow. And in their online echo chamber they‚Äôll see anyone who points out the age issue as just denying their love or some melodramatic way to ignore confrontinf the issue."
52,"Just to play devils advocate here, and I'm making some assumptions so please take into account this question is based off those assumptions.

Your comment reads like you find his reaction (raised voice... he communicated his reasons for displeasure and then later expanded on them) worse and in more need of therapy than ignoring your partners wishes and the fact they dont like spending money and spending money on them for their birthday? If I hated people spending money on me, and they spent money on me FOR MY BIRTHDAY I'm supposed to react calmly and controlled... when my wife literally did something I dont like on my birthday? Its... weird how most comments talk about his reaction. This is like buying your wife a vacuum for valentines.

What's passive aggressive about reacting, apologizing for your reaction, and then EXPLAINING why you've been in a bad mood all day (quiet) when asked?"
53,"&gt; I personally think they're only gender-specific if you yourself are sexist

I agree with you on this 100&amp;#37;. I don't see how either of these toys would be gender specific and as you said the kids share toys anyway. Easiest way to avoid her criticism is to ask her what sort of presents she thinks is appropriate for them."
54,"I dont mean to sound like a stereotype, but society has a very warped and often hypocritical approach to drugs. Some, like alcohol and caffeine, are normalised so much that people almost forget that they're biologically taking a drug when they have a cup of coffee. Others, though consistently show to be less harmful than legal things, are demonised to the Nth degree even though you're much more likely to harm yourself drinking beer regularly than smoking weed regularly. 

All that said there's still a balance to be had. I occasionally smoke weed, but I'd feel funny about having a partner who does it daily. I've seen a lot of full-blown stoners and in most cases its more bad than good. I've tried MDMA a couple of times as well and enjoyed it, but I can definitely see how taking that even semi-regularly could be quite affecting to someone. Personally I wouldn't want to have that more than even once a year.

You're also perfectly within your rights to feel as comfortable or uncomfortable about these things as you want to when you put it all in the perspective of your own relationships! There isn't really a right or wrong there.

So I'd encourage you to try and be open minded if only because I think being open minded is good for personal development (particularly if you've grown up in a very biased background). But if you find it's all too much for you even after that, these lifestyle differences are perfectly legitimate relationship issues and you definitely shouldnt feel any pressures around them! "
55,"I gagged reading how your BF leaves the house. 

Girlfriend, let me tell you, if they don't know how to clean up by that age, they never learn. Move out ASAP. 

Take this from someone who finally had to divorce to get away from the mess. "
56,I would guess that your boyfriend isn't into BDSM and is either consciously or unconsciously using this as an excuse to pull back from it. If he is very nervous and uncomfortable at the mere idea of hurting you and he associates the activity with giving you a black eye (even an accidental one) I can see how his reaction might be to retreat from the more extreme elements of BDSM.
57,"Came here to say this. Watch any episode of a judge Judy showcasing college aged roommates. If you paid for it, it‚Äôs yours. Take it with you when you leave and find better friends. "
58,"Run. I got warned about my ex.  I wanted to pretend he was good but this is how my ex would fight. He was brought up in an incredibly abusive household. He may have never hit me but the moment I heard ""this isn't yelling, do you want to hear me yell?"" I knew he'd heard it his whole life. As was crying on the couch and he  was standing over me I knew that things would only get worse. 

This was over him withholding contact from me because I was upset that he had been arguing with me non stop while I was in a very fragile state due to a recent and tragic loss. 

I only ever wanted to talk things out. I'm an incredibly understanding and compassionate person to the point of letting people walk all over me because I believe there is good inside of them.  I wanted to heal his wounds but he didn't care about the emotional wounds he inflicted on me, he thought it was normal to treat people you love like garbage.

It doesn't matter where he developed this behavior.  It's incredibly emotionally abusive. When people are upset with eachother it doesn't take 3 days to talk things out if they care about each other. He should have contacted you and apologized.  You deserve an empathic partner who cares enough about your relationship to breathe and figure out how to solve the problem asap with the least damage inflicted if you are willing to do the same. 

She said he was abusive and he is.  He just emotionally abused you.  He will not change. If he does, it won't be worth the trauma of seeing it through.

Cut and run.  Be happy.  The next woman he's with will get the same shit end of the stick. I've gotten to watch this personally because we work together (distantly) and so does his new partner.  I wasn't the first and it's living proof that I won't be the last.  "
59,"I mean, they live half a world away. It's not like Sunday BBQs can be a thing."
60,Shocking that you would even have to remind her of that
61,"you might be mature, but he's immature. please reconnect with people that care about you and get out of there. there's nothing about this situation that sounds remotely good"
62,"Unpopular opinion: but consider whether you should tip off her parents. 

These two are both young, immature, and not ready to make a life changing decision like this on their own -- they're not done with high school and neither are supporting themselves independently from their families!

Her parents reaction to this pregnancy is a wildcard. More than anything they will both disappointed and very scared for their 16 year daughter's future. Conservative values or not, their kid is a minor and her parents should be in the loop about something as life altering as an unexpected pregnancy.

It may sobering for Josh and Allie to realize they have very few options to raise a baby all on their own. OP, if you don't want to be raising their kid then you need to be clear on your position.

They're looking at the following scenario:

* Josh drops out to get a crappy full time job (what good jobs are available to 16 year olds without a high diploma?)

* Allie spends her days at home in their crummy apartment (they have limited rental options in their budget) with the baby, bored with the monotony, missing her friends and when prom was her biggest worries. Daycare is too expensive for them to afford and staying at home she had to drop out. She is stressed and tired.

* Josh and Allie live paycheck to paycheck and some days don't have enough money for food after spending for baby formula and diapers. OP giving them money here and there help them to stay afloat.

* By the time baby is 1 years old, they've split up. His side: Josh has gotten resentful from working hard all day and coming home to his now depressed girlfriend who always ""nags"" him. Her side: Allie does everything at home, all the cleaning, cooking, and childcare of the baby while Josh never helps and wants to play Xbox to ""decompress"" when he comes home so Allie never gets a break or time to herself. They never really talk anymore and haven't been intimate in a long time. They've grown apart and when she snoops on his phone and sees he's been chatting with other girls.. etc. The breakdown of their relationship is a song as old as time.

* Allie returns home and her parents have had a change of heart now that their grand baby is actually here in the world, not just an idea. They love the grandbaby and in time Allie is able to study for her GED while her parents help to babysit.

* Josh is bitter and filled with regret on how things turns out and how little he gets to see his child. He drinks to forget the pain but outwardly seems to be moving on.

Bottom line, them going alone in raising their kiddo will be a very hard path. But it's their choice on how to proceed. That said, choosing to terminate by and large would be for the best at their young ages."
63,"Which, to be fair, happens surprisingly (and sadly) often. That said, OP is doing nothing inappropriate with his niece, here, and needs to have a serious conversation with his gf about her issues surrounding that relationship."
64,"The unreasonable person here is your mum, who is

* Trying to crash a holiday you and your wife organised for *yourselves*. 

* Emotionally manipulating you for saying no.

Honestly, I don't think your mum wants to go on this trip to see *you*. I think she wants to take advantage of the overseas trip you've organised and get her own holiday out of it. She might even start insisting you cover her expenses. 

If she wants to see you, she can make the effort to see you another time. Or she can organise a mother-son holiday with you. Just say no. No to her joining you on the holiday, no to ""it's just a few days"", no to ""you'll regret this when I'm dead and gone!""

Go have a great holiday with your wife. Consider blocking your mum's number whilst you're gone."
65,"Does her doctor know about these wild mood swings? It doesn‚Äôt sound like your keto diet has worked out all that well, unfortunately."
66,"It's already over.   You can't compromise on kids, you cant have half a kid, this isn't King Solomon's court.   

Break up.   He needs to find someone who wants kids and you need to find someone who's CF.   You aren't compatible.   You're very young, this is ok, this is what dating is about.   "
67,"I wouldn‚Äôt be okay with my partner having a flirtatious relationship with someone else, and if he ever described it as being sexual tension I‚Äôd be out the door. In return I expect he‚Äôd feel the same way about me. I actually think it‚Äôs kind of uncool that you expect your partners to essentially be fine with the fact that you‚Äôre always kind of into someone else? Regardless of gender. "
68,"He's just projecting trying to make the world conform to his beliefs, rather then think of himself as a bad guy. 

Anytime someone makes a post such as ""Had awesome relationship for 5 years, then my partner cheated on me. I can't fathom staying in this relationship anymore and want out"" - you will have a bunch of people come in trying to say things like ""Maybe you should look at yourself, why did the person feel the need to cheat?"" And also things like ""Don't break up, it was just sex, how can you love someone so much they just because they sleep with someone else suddenly they are a bad person?"". - It's just people projecting, they don't want to see other poeple saying ""yeah! dump them!"" because of a fear that if they cheated and couldnt help themselves, that their partner would leave them.

73,"But would you stop your significant other from going to their sister's wedding because *you* hate the dude?  If wife doesn't want to go, okay don't go... but to guilt trip OP into not going is immature and petty."
74,"&gt; I still want to get back together and with him, but I know that's most likely impossible.

Probably. From what I'm reading, you'll never be with him again and you've lost him forever. The good news is that you've learned a valuable lesson here about the ""grass being greener"". You'll eventually be able to use this knowledge and experience to be exponentially happier in a future relationship with someone else. "
75,"It doesn‚Äôt look like you can find what you are looking for, which are people that agree with you. So now the question is which relationship do you value more- your wife and child or your college friend. I think the answer is easy.

80,"The CPS threats are fucked up and manipulative beyond all reason. First of all, that‚Äôs not what CPS does; they are not a boogeyman that punishes unruly children. They punish terrible parents and remove children from abusive/neglectful situations. She is using it as a tactic to get a certain behavior from you. If I were you, the next time she tries it I would call her bluff and offer to call them yourself.

I‚Äôm worried about you, OP. Honestly, I think CPS might be a really good option for you. Your mom sounds like she‚Äôs not able to give you the emotional support you need and your relationship may be coming close to being physically as well as psychologically abusive."
81,"It sounds like she's been a sweetheart to you, but has not been a good mother to your SO, including choosing a guy who verbally abused your SO over by staying on his side, allowing him to listen to phone conversations between your SO and his mother, etc. I don't see how wanting his conversation between him and his mom be between him and his mom is 'harsh'.

In my opinion you aren't being a good partner. You're not being understanding at all. It's nice you get along with your SO's mother, but your SO should be more important, especially over someone who allows him to be abused. You are about to choose his MOM over him. That's an interesting choice..."
82,"&gt;I think that if everyone treats me oddly at this party, I‚Äôll just have to accept what‚Äôs happening.

Please consider that you night not be able to judge objectively whether this is happening. If someone looks in your direction with an annoyed expression, that may not be about you at all! She could be bored. She could be bummed she's not the one getting married. She may have fought with her mom that morning. Imagine that she's having cramps! "

87,"I'm so sorry this happened to you /internet hugs

Would you do that to him? If it was him who said he's not on the mood or who was hurting, would you continue?

I often find that we should try to actually put ourselves in the situation and realize how we would NEVER do that and see how wrong it was, instead of trying to rationalize and find excuses for this behaviour (which btw IS rape). 
I know that is difficult to come to terms that people like that exist, we want to think the best of people, specially people that we love, (and we've also been socialized to blame ourselves and consent is only now being talked about). But really, would YOU do that to someone you supposedly love? To anyone? I guess you wouldn't, so there's your answer."
88,"Yes, this is super important. "
89,Tell him it‚Äôs over but he has to forgive you for dumping him because whatever a person does when they feel insecure is okay. 
90,"I think that deep down you want him to contact you and confess to what he did, then tell you it was all a mistake and beg your forgiveness so you two can live happily ever after.

Hon, it's not going to happen.  He just moved on with his side piece.  He's not worried about closure because he doesn't give a shit.  You're the one who's going to have to figure it out and provide your own emotional resolution.  Whatever you do, stay strong and don't contact him.  Just realize that it's over, he's a creep and move on.  I'm sorry."
91,"If someone does not put in the effort to be a part of your family, you can't make them. It's the bitter, sad truth. Yes, he *should*. He may come to regret this in his later years - and if he does, you can deal with that when the time comes. For now, focus on giving your lovely daughter the joy of being around family who *wants* to be with her. I guarantee that will be enough. I had very little family growing up, but the few I did have, plus my mother's closest friends, were more than enough for me to feel loved. :)"
92,"So she stopped meds using keto,  but now she's using neither keto or meds? I doubt her doctor is supporting this"
93,"Apologize and set a 'make up' date. Make dinner reservations somewhere nice, get your parents to babysit for the night again, set him a bath or buy  him a new body scrub/cologne/tie/etc. Do what he did for you. "
94,"just tell him you like him! i get the concern about moving away but even without attaching a label you would definitely both miss each other. you're kind of... already in a relationship, even if you haven't specifically mutually defined it. that, or I'm sure it'll come up organically, especially if you keep doing all the things that people in relationships do."
95,"My ex and I played that exact same scenario. The next scenario was being straight up tied up and held captive while he ranted about how much he loved me and how I'd be a bitch if I left.

Leave. You can. Call all your friends, any family. Ask someone to help you rent a car or an Uber. Catch a train or a flight back home if it's that far. Anything. If someone at the trip could be supportive, tell them and stick to them like glue. "
96," *I screwed things up with someone I really liked by being too clingy or needy. Should I apologize or will that do more damage?* 

Sending an apology would do more damage, it shows you are fixating over this when you really should just let it go. I have no doubt that she knows if she wanted to pursue you that you'd be receptive. Obviously she hasn't got her shit together so just leave her be and move your focus elsewhere. But if it helps I think your initial message to say 'okay, its cool that your not interested' was perfectly reasonable and you shouldn't regret it considering shes the one who is playing hot and cold and not vice versa. "
97,That's a very interesting point I never thought about. I guess first I should figure out if she actually wants to see me more. I assume she does but you know what they say about assuming. 
98,"Good chance this leads to the following, which sucks:

BIL is mad at OP for being a snitch

They get married anyway and OP's relationship with BIL is forever strained"
99,"This, OP. Especially re: the comment that the younger sister is 'better' at these types of discussions. He may have been breaking down her barriers for what is appropriate/normal for her. It is extremely worrying that he thinks he is owed something for being a part of her life. He is speaking like a child groomer. OP, you should take this very fucking seriously."

102,"&gt;For my birthday she did make and get me a photo album but that is all.

Why does that not qualify as a gift? She may just not know what to get you and went with something thoughtful rather than material. Which a lot of people honestly prefer, and I think it sounds like a sweet gift. 

So if we ignore that one, we're looking at Christmas where you claim you ""both took each other somewhere"", graduation which I don't know that I'd really expect a gift for, and then we have Valentine's and Anniversary. What did you get her for those occasions? What would you like her to get for you? Have you talked to her about wanting to receive gifts for these occasions as well and what you would like?"

106,"It sounds like you're an introvert and your mother isn't. Its sometimes hard to understand extroverts when you're an introvert, and to understand introverts when you're an extrovert. 

Unfortunately, you probably won't change her mind. The best thing for you to do is probably to continue going to therapy so that the therapist can evaluate you and tell your mother ""there's nothing wrong with fairapple, she just likes being alone"". Then I think your mother will probably listen. Still might not understand, but will more likely listen to a professional.

As for the therapy, I learned a lot of great stuff from therapy. If you feel like the exercises you're doing are childish, maybe you can express that to the therapist. Even saying ""look, I know my mom is concerned about me being solitary but I really don't think it's something of concern. Can you help me understand ways that I can talk to her better?"" or even totally unrelated stuff like ""I'm having this problem with a friend of mine"", etc. Use that therapy time to get something YOU want out of it. 

As long as you're living in her home, you'll have to follow her rules even if they're ridiculous. But as someone who is introverted and likes to be alone (and is married to someone who is also introverted and fantasizes about moving to the middle of nowhere), its not abnormal. As long as you're making an effort to be polite to people when you are in social situations and aren't being rude, it's ok to need and want and desire time by yourself. "
107,"Time to see if you can sublet your room and find a new place. Fuck that guy and his pathetic excuses, he knew what he was doing. "
108,"So I‚Äôm not saying anything to discredit your feelings about this. You have every right to be hurt and to talk to her about this. But based on what you‚Äôre saying, this might not mean anything bad about how she perceives you in a fundamental way. It sounds like a way she was grieving her old relationship and sorting out a new way of seeing herself in a relationship. I can‚Äôt speak for her but as someone who‚Äôs had similar thoughts in the past, I wonder if she‚Äôd say something like: with hindsight, she now realizes that what you offer is way more rewarding than what he offered, it was just new and different for her. Anyway, I‚Äôm obviously projecting a bit but just trying to give you an alternative perspective."

110,"It's easier to dump a mommas boy than it is to divorce one, both are easier than changing one. "
111,I can understand being embarrassed and man that would be such a hit to your pride. But the hard fact is he doesn't owe you anything. If the roles were reversed and he did the same thing but you weren't in the mood for whatever reason but also didn't want to say anything for fear of insulting him then would you like it if he were cold towards you after? It's a personal right to say no and it is his body to do with as he pleases. Like I said I understand you being upset but maybe instead just try talking this out with him? It could be something as simple as he felt too pressured to perform and made up an excuse to bail

&gt; I am already in so deep that I can't give up without a fight.

You realize how much of a sunk cost fallacy this is, right? Just because you've already dealt with a lot, just because you've stayed through worse, doesn't mean you should keep doing so. You're choosing to keep digging the pit, instead of trying to find a way out, because ""you're already deep in here anyway."" That's crazy.

If her son and his GF move in, can you imagine what the next 5 years of your life will be like? I know you think this will ""just be temporary"", but you also thought the GF wouldn't be there in the first place. What're the chances your GF will actually put her foot down and kick out the girl pregnant with your GF's grandkids?"
116,"Dude you knew it was on the same date when you applied. You can go, but don't expect your girlfriend not to be pissed"
117,"Probably because he planned this in advance. 

He insisted on driving because he knew he wanted to play the martyr. He spent the drive frightening her and making her physically uncomfortable. As soon as they stopped he knew she‚Äôd want some space. The gears were turning in his head *long* before they got to that rest stop. He knew what he wanted to do and he did it. And it likely worked as intended. In the future, OP will think twice before asking him to do something he doesn‚Äôt want to do. 

Unless she dumps him as she should."
118,"It's such weirdly common abusive behavior, too. We've had multiples threads here where a boyfriend pushed it to the point the OP was forced to wet herself in the car.

If you want to spend your Saturday waiting around, at the ready to drop everything and go watch a baby play in a splash pad for 30 minutes, fine, but it's not a reasonable expectation to put on someone else. "
123,[deleted]
124,"True, but it‚Äôs better than not seeking help at all."
125,"This exactly. His sexuality isn't relevant here. The point is, he's decided his priority is building a life with his best friend. And there's nothing necessarily wrong with that! I don't think friendships are inherently less valuable than romantic relationships, and if he's decided that the primary relationship in his life is the one he has with his best friend, that's his prerogative.

BUT. He needs to be honest with you and with himself that *that's* what he's doing. If you want a relationship with someone who is going to put you first (as well you should), then this guy ain't it."
126,"I hope you don't mind more people chiming in. I got a whiff of misogyny as well. Guys are way more likely to get really really pushy about expecting girls to like their stuff than the reverse, which is entitlement more than misogyny I guess. But he took it to the point of literally saying she needed to see a psychiatrist, which enters the territory of 'bitches be crazy.'"
127,"This is beating a dead horse.

She doesn't like you. You don't like her. Yet you want to force your friend/her boyfriend to mediate when you both know his girlfriend has no interest in that. Don't do a ""pick me"" dance with a guy friend/former Ex who is in a relationship. There's no point in that.

Either you continue your friendship with him separately and ignore the GF situation completely or you move on from the friendship. If you end the friendship, it's less drama for you and all parties in the long run."
128,"So I read both posts. I had a dad with a volatile temper although he got physical. At 13 I guarantee there are a lot of things going on with him you don't realize. All I can say is try to keep your head down, do what you need to, stay out of his way, and remember it is only temporary. I'm glad he isn't physical with you but the verbal abuse and mental headgames have much worse scars. I started talking to my school counselor in 9th grade daily as an outlet to help. "
129,"Frankly the content of the texts doesn‚Äôt matter.

I am an aunt to several teenage and now adult niblings. It would be absolutely unconscionable to consider going behind the backs of any of my siblings or siblings in law.

I have been the cool childless aunt, for a long time (Husband and I are both the youngest) and whenever a conflict of interest situation came up, I was firm but gentle about redirecting my niblings back to their parents.  I never broke my promises to my niblings by being very clear that there were something‚Äôs I‚Äôd help them with (dating advice, college stuff) but that I wouldn‚Äôt keep their secrets if I felt it was inappropriate. 

This included things like, yes I took one of my nieces to get plan B, then once it was done I sat with her whilst we told her mother, and I encouraged my sister and her to hug it out and get her the implant, yes I lent one nephew money after he blew cash his parents gave him for school, but only on the proviso he eventually told his Dad. 

My sister is a stricter parent and my nieces often came to me with stuff, I would try and get them to see my sisters side, I would support them but also gently lecture them to find compromises, I outright told my sister when one niece started to self harm so we could get her into therapy.

If a 16 year old came to me stating she was thinking about running away with an adult, AS an adult, I would absolutely tell the parents - I would encourage her to do this herself, I would offer to go with, I would hold her hand, I would try to broker a conversation, I would allow her to live with me if it all went wrong but never in a month of Sunday‚Äôs would I keep this a secret from her family and I would rather have hot tongs pluck my left eye out then encourage her in this dangerous and risky behaviour. 

Even if this guy was awesome, what about grades and college and having a normal college experience? Running g away means she spends her late teens worrying about money and bills not cultivating friendships, studying, partying and watching Netflix, he‚Äôs literally stolen part of her young adulthood she can never get back and your wife encouraged her to do that.

I am outraged for your family, you could be burying your Niece right now, all because your wife valued being ‚Äúcool‚Äù over being a responsible adult. "
130,"I lived the ""but he didn't hit me"" life for fourteen years and had no idea it was so much abuse, until the end. "
131,"He lied. People who arent racist don't say racist things. Unless they are total asshats. Also, he was ""trying to make you feel like crap""? That is not something an understanding, good person would do. Especially since he apologized AFTER the negative result. 

He sounds like bad news. You can try counseling, but I wouldn't expect him to want to, or for it to fix the issues. I hope I am wrong. "
132,"Exactly. No one has ever said ""I was worried something was seriously wrong with my neck, but I ignored it and now I'm so glad I never went to the doctor!"""
133,"Adding the extra to retirement is a good idea. They are already able to live on x amount of dollars, no reason that the amount needed to survive should increase his because she got a raise. Some people find a way to spend whatever they make, so an automatic savings plan is a good idea."
134,"Imagine this, imagine you get married, you have kids. Imagine you find out your wife cheated on you again after you truste her when you were in your 20s. You're now divorced and having to start over at close to middle age.

Or you could just break up right now and find someone that's trustworthy."
135,"I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs going well for both you and him. Worth pointing out: in terms of his professional life this may be far from over and he may be needing your support and understanding soon. 

You should probably make a point of saving any digital communication you have with him regarding Karen. 
"
136,"I‚Äôm inclined to say bail too. That‚Äôs dangerous shit and this person reached out to you in a timely manner after seeing that you were with him. The problem with talking to him about it is that abusers are great at justifying themselves and blaming everyone else. So I‚Äôm not sure what he could say to make this okay, especially since you haven‚Äôt been dating him long enough to really know his character. If he says ‚Äúthat didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù you don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs lying, if he blames it all on the other person you don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs lying. If he takes responsibility and is working on the problem that‚Äôs good, but it was recent so you can‚Äôt trust that it‚Äôs fixed. "

139,"I have guys tell me all the time, embarrassed, that they live at home.  That is NOT embarrassing.  What's more, if a dude still lives at home and makes his parents lives easier because of it (lawn work, cooking, pays bills etc) then I think this is even better.  Having a healthy relationship with your parents is an amazing gift.  This is NOT what this is.  The way he let's his mom take care of him is off putting and seems unbalanced by what he gives back.  If he was to move out amdive with a partner would he be capable of being an equal partner.  Could he handle when life's inevitable storms come?"

143,She would not object as I suggested that I might do the same. I appreciate the insight.
144,"He's not handling it graciously though. He's ""handling"" it in one of the worst possible ways with regard to his own mental and emotional well-being because he isn't actually ""handling"" it at all; he's just pretending the problem doesn't exist when the rest of his post screams that it sure as hell does.

She is abusive. What you described is abuse. 

&gt; she cries and begs me to take her back 

That is typical abuser behavior. She manipulates you into feeling bad for her, after she abuses you. 

&gt; I should have added this in the beginning but our relationship has been great 

You don't punch your SO in a ""great"" relationship. "
149,"Well. You can either bring this up with her, talk to her about it's starting to take a toll on your self esteem... Or wait until she does it again and address it then.  


It sounds like this isn't going to go away on it's own. Even joking, what she's doing is pretty mean and not the way you treat someone you care about, IMO."

159,"&gt;I don't know how to be around him now.

You don't. I'm sorry but this is cruel. Women who are pregnant put on weight. It happens. You've lost all of it but 15 pounds. You can totally lose those 15 pounds given some time. But your husband tearing you down like that is unacceptable. Your husband saying he's embarrassed by you, when you just had a child ffs, is just god awful.

Only do what you‚Äôre comfortable with! It‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt want to kiss him, just tell him respectfully that you‚Äôd like to wait. On the other hand if you want to, go for it girl!

Your sister is insane. Like, you might be broke, but you need to get out because this person is dangerous. I would try to get away from her asap and go no contact - and notify your workplace of her as well, if you leave I feel like she is the kind of girl to call up your workplace and accuse you of being a pedophile or something. She either needs to leave the apartment - or you need to leave the apartment. 

If you're in contact with your parents I would tell them about this - I feel like perhaps she is the golden child, but this is just such a fucked up thing to do to someone, I think your parents need to reign this little psychopath in. "
166,We spent ages trying to work out who an XL man's t-shirt was in our laundry... Turned out it was my dad's and had got scooped up with some stuff when we'd visited my parents.
167,"&gt;Is there a right and wrong in this situation?

I don't think right and wrong exists in this situation. It sounds like you both simply have different views and you both have valid reasons for thinking the way you do. 

You're understandably uncomfortable because ""sex sells"" is an understandably uncomfortable idea when it involves your spouse and when you have a daughter you want to share your same values re: sexuality. 

She's understandably happy because she basically got you free insurance, car registration, and gas for years. $10k would pay for the entirety of my own personal cost of owning a vehicle for four years.

I think this is just a case for the tried-and-true /r/relationships advice of communication. You two should sit down and have a talk about your differing views on this. Don't blame her for what she did (because IMO she's just as right in her views as you are), but discuss your boundaries on sexuality, how important money is with your finances, how much is too much to save on money, etc."
168,"I have an Aunt from Brazil that is REALLY uncomfortable around most of the family because she thinks they don't like her. She thinks I'm the friendliest and warmest person on earth just because I've learned a few phrases in Portuguese and make a point of touching her often because I know that's her culture (linking arms, more hugs than most Americans give, sitting closer, etc). I've put forward very little effort besides being culturally sensitive and wanting her to feel included, but it means the world to her. "
169,"The club admins are wrong in their approach. I'm sorry they are not doing their jobs. Is this club affiliated with the college? I would go to the campus ombudsman and talk about the situation and see what can be done.

You're not being passive aggressive. You say you plainly state to the hosts why you are leaving, which is sort of the opposite of passive aggressive. I'm sorry the men in the group aren't standing up for you and also leaving or not inviting him in the first place. This is how Missing Stairs become missing stairs."
170,Ok that makes sense thanks you. Although it is a little dumb to think that a single good review would hold that much weight. ü§∑
171,"No you're not crazy for feeling this way, you ARE crazy if you act on it immediately though. 

Know that you barely know this person and the honeymoon phase is real. Hold off on Vegas weddings and moving in together immediately. Know that you can like someone this much and STILL wait, he's not going anywhere. You don't have to act on these feelings. Take your time. "
172,"To answer the question that has been asked by many- Yes he knew her since she was about 8. We were good friends and he was often a guest at our home and vise versa. After I changed jobs 7 years ago we didn't see each other nearly as much and fell out of touch. But he was definitely around while she was growing up.

Also over those years as dumb males we share a lot of what could be considered ""locker room"" talk so I know the type of guy he is, making it impossible for me to accept him being with my daughter.

The other thing I want to clarify is I said my wife was indifferent about the relationship, but I feel she may have started way she but is now more supportive of it which I can't understand and because of that I feel angry every time I see her."
173,"This sounds like a comedy film-two slackers and their together friend, live rent-free while funding their 'startup', find out they might be turfed out due to together friend getting serious with his partner. Andrew Garfield plays OP, Lily Collins plays his girlfriend, Zac Efron and Dave Franco are his friends.

Zac Efron and Dave Franco try and split Andrew Garfield and Lily Collins up so they can have their free ride, followed by a heart-warming ending where they realise their friend being happy is worth more than free rent, get the couple back together and move out, Dave Franco comes out as gay and Zac Efron ends up with Emma Stone who thought he was an idiot at the start but saw his soft side when he got the couple back together. "
174,"&gt; I'm not saying enable them. I'm advocating to not change the behavior at all

Paying for their meals *is* enabling them. Why should OP have to dance around, jumping through hoops for people like this? A simple thank you is not asking too much. Asking not to order a $19 meal they don't touch is not asking too much. Family or not, rewarding bad behavior is not a good idea if you expect to see change. This isn't passive aggressive, it's direct. OP cannot change them, but she can change herself. She can stop being so generous.

180,"The manipulation and trying to get her back will start immediately, because she called his bluff. I highly doubt he told her to leave thinking she would actually do it. He was likely saying it just to hurt her, and will lay on the charm thick to get her back. 

His actions are pretty textbook abusive behavior, down to telling her he wants to hit her. I guarantee it won't take long until he does actually hit her if she decides to go back. OP, you're making the right choice, and being single is 1,000x better than being in an abusive relationship. Have tried both, do not recommend."
181,"Why does everyone always say stuff like this?  If your goal is to be absolutely pedantically correct, then you don't need the ""sorry.""  But if your goal is to get the wife to lower her defenses and listen to you for a moment, then just say ""I'm sorry"" and show some empathy for someone who is obviously hurting.

BTW, people say ""I'm sorry"" when someone is going through something difficult without it meaning ""because it's my fault."""
182,"It‚Äôs only been nine months with the boyfriend, your career is forever.

This is super high and unacceptable. I would cancel anyone who missed more than 20&amp;#37; of the time unless there was 1) super extenuating circumstances and 2) plenty of advanced notice, and 3) promptly rescheduled at my convenience.

If you MUST (and i dont think its necesary) you could talk to her and tell her that unless she can be more reliable its not working out for you."
187,"I'm sorry you feel used. 

From the experience that you recounted, it doesn't sound like they got everything they wanted. It sounds like your friend was definitely not okay with things by the end of the night for whatever reason.  

I don't think they meant to hurt you. I don't think either of them were necessarily intending any of this. Just because they're working on a relationship now, doesn't mean that either one was planning on it. 

To put it poorly, from their perspective it's ""nothing personal"" 

As far as your friendship, might need a little space and time for all parties involved, but if you talk with your friend and let her know that you aren't interested in pursuing him, it would probably help mend that gap. 

Hope that helps, and I hope you manage to feel better about yourself."
188,"&gt; Guy says they were broken up for a while and wife kept tailing him around so he publicly told her off because he was sick of her stalking

189,"I used to work at a place that had intense levels of customer service, so by the end of the week I was exhausted from listening to people. I told my ex that I love him, and I love that he wants to talk to me when I get home, but he can either be quiet now and save what he wants to say for later, or he can talk but accept that I'm going to watch TV and utterly ignore him. It worked well and no feelings got hurt.

Point being, it is currently owned by *somebody* and that somebody is responsible for addressing this issue immediately. It‚Äôs not your problem that a sale is going on and these things happen all the time during a sale process. The owner and buyer will square away the cost of exterminators when the sale is actually being completed.

Contact the owner. Tell them about the issue, that it‚Äôs bad and that it needs to be treated immediately or you will have to take the cost of an exterminator out of your rent. It would be best if you said all of that in an email to cover your ass. "
192,"Very true, we don't really know each other, she has no incentive to lie. Thank you."
193,"I wonder if he felt that you deliberately left early as a snub and so was reacting emotionally to that, or if he also felt guilty for existing you and so blamed you to alleviate that guilt. I think your reasoning on the limited number is likely accurate."

Like it or not, you are somewhat the company you keep. And I think she‚Äôs justified that she not have to put up with that. That‚Äôs so HUMILIATING, watching people actively try to get a whole group to laugh at you. And while you may not hang out with them as much, you certainly could have done something. You could have left, you could have told them off. You could have made it very clear that SHE matters but you didn‚Äôt. "

216,"Female ex fatty here üôã

I lost 100lbs. I was fat because I ate too much i am a naturally a big eater and I love food. Still do. However I ALWAYS knew why I was overweight and it was being greedy and not exercising will power. Tbh that is the reason that people are overweight as CICO always results in weight loss but I digress....


When I was overweight it would not have helped me having someone tell me what I was doing wrong or criticising because *I already knew all this* but I was doing it anyway as I had no self control.   Your wife is no different. She KNOWS she shouldn't stack away beer, chips and salsa before dinner. She KNOWS she is eating too many calories but she either lacks the will power to stop herself or her desire to eat that food right there and then outweighs the desire she has to lose weight.  So, when you point out that she is doing this thing that is counterproductive to her alleged goal she will get defensive as she has to excuse this action to you AND HER. Only problem is you call bullshit on these reasons and the voice in her head doesn't - they just go ""oh ok that's cool - go ahead""

She could have done a tonne of things differently. She could have had cucumber sticks and salsa. She could have had one beer or mixed the beer with lemonade to make it last longer. She could have drank a big ol glass of water to gool her tummy till tea time. She could have waited 30 damn minutes to have dinner but she chose not to and you pointing that out is not going to give her the weight loss epiphany - so dont bother.


Next time she gives you the spiel about how she is ready to listen to you etc tell her that you will support her within the home but you are not the person to be mentoring her through her weightloss. My advice would be for her to join a gym and get a diet from a PT there. Get her lifting weights. Doing some cardio. Counting her calories but make is so she is answerable to someone else not to you. She can easily tell you to bugger off if she wants to eat the crisps and salsa because you're her husband. She will have to answer to a PT of they're weighing her every week and they will know of she isn't following her diet. Making her accountable to someone else will help her and stop you arguing. 

As for what you can do as a husband and a couple- don't buy any of the unhealthy stuff. Don't have it in the house. No crisps, chocolate, cakes, biscuits etc. That's how I did it. If it wasn't there I couldn't mindlessly eat it. I never wanted it enough to go to the shops of an evening. If she is buying pints of ice cream and eating it during the day - well she needs to exercise more will power.

Plan a cheat meal at the weekend where she can have anything she fancies - for this one meal. If she wants pizza with ice cream afterwards then go out for it and let her fill her boots. Don't order in as... leftovers....

Overall she needs to be responsible for her weughtloss. And words won't make the weight come off. Only hard work on her part will do. 

Feel free to PM for any info you want. I would also say that I lose my weight doing very little cardio. The majority of it was weight training and a good calorie counted diet. With my weekly cheat meal. "
217,"Due to the lease, this discussion needs to happen sooner rather than later. And be prepared that if you say you don‚Äôt want to live together, she may want to know more - and possibly leaving her to wonder if her relationship is over could be more painful than just getting it all over with. "

And even if there was one such person, how is there a table full of them?

And if there IS a table full of such heartless animal haters, who cares what they think, honestly."
223,"Okay. 

First, you need to realise that for your girlfriend this is not a silly argument or a small thing.  From her perspective, the person who is meant to support her (you) has enabled people close to them (your friends) to harass and mock her for a period of several weeks, culminating in a publicly humiliating stunt. You may have pulled back from these people, but the fact of the matter is that they are your friends and you should have stopped the situation from ever getting to this point. 

It may not seem this way to you, but to her, this is what has happened. 

Second, you need to think about why she feels that you pressured her into sharing the videos with friends and family. Put aside the intention behind your actions here and examine what you actually did. Did you, for example, repeatedly suggest that she share these videos despite her repeated protestations that she was not yet ready, comfortable or willing to do so? How many attempts did it take you to persuade her? If it was more than two or three, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that she agreed because she felt that you wouldn‚Äôt let it go if she didn‚Äôt. While this would not have been a good way to handle it, it may be what happened from her perspective. 

Third, you need to apologise to her properly. No ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you felt that I pressured you‚Äù because that isn‚Äôt going to cut it here. What you need is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry that my suggestion to share your videos on Facebook lead to these guys acting like this. I didn‚Äôt think that it would happen, and I certainly should have done more to stop their behaviour before it reaches this point. I apologise for their behaviour and if you choose to forgive me I promise that I will not fail to stand up for you again.‚Äù

If she accepts your apology and chooses to forgive you, you damn well follow through on that promise. Telling your mates to shut the fuck up or to fuck off is all well and good, but they may well take it as joking. You have to confront them seriously about their behaviour and what about it you don‚Äôt like, and tell them what you need to change. 

If she does not choose to forgive you, then remember that this is her right. She feels that you have let her down, and to be frank, I agree with her. If this happens, respect her decision and move on. But cut those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù out of your life. You need better ones. 

Take a long, hard, critical look at yourself. You need to do better. "
224,"Honestly you and your wife sounds entitled AF. Does she realize that if your business went south your father would be liable for all of the loan? 

I have had a successful business for nearly 10 years now, I still operate like it could go under any minute.

If someone has gained a significant amount of weight over the course of a relationship, there's a conversation that could be had.  If you're the person who cooks dinner, you could silently make some changes and see how it goes, but that isn't really passive aggressive.  Passive aggressive is things like ""forgetting"" to buy unhealthy food they asked for.

And honestly, to be a decent person you have to realize that your partner is a person, not an improvement project.  /U/Icantchoosethis's husband was attracted to her when she was 30 pounds heavier, but by pointing out the fact that she wasn't his ideal he created a problem that he is still living with years later.  I'm sure he has many great qualities, but that was an incredibly self-centered and foolish thing to say."

If she ever wants to vent or get ideas on how to grow her viewship or just shoot the sh*t about ASMR, just have her message me. 
It's a hard community to break into for a new artist, so I'd be happy to help.

That being said, your friends are asshats. Eventually they'll find something else to laugh about because they probably have the attention span of a turnip. Just continue to support your girlfriend and hopefully she'll come around. "
239,"I would wager the truth is something in between with neither side meaning any malice. 

Knowing my wife and how she struggles with social contexts, it is probably likely that they were dating but she thought it was more serious than he did. He then went abroad for one summer and probably broke up with her in a way that was very unclear and not concise, leading her to believe they were still together. 

So he was with other women and my wife saw and thought he was cheating. She thinks they‚Äôre still together while he didn‚Äôt. This is the best I‚Äôve pieced together based on both accounts and my sisters help. "
240,"Well first off, is this a dealbreaker for either of you or not?  Because if he is absolutely no guns in the house and you are absolutely insistent that you need to have a gun in the house to feel safe then there is no way to resolve this aside from not moving in together. So you need to talk to him and figure out if there are some situations in which he would be okay with a gun in the home (for example, if you take classes, use a gun lock, keep it in a gun safe unless you are home alone, etc.).  If he still says that a gun is absolutely a violation of his boundaries in his home than you need to decide if there are some situations in which you would be okay not having a gun (aside from the ones he has suggested that you've already ruled out). For example, is it important to prioritize a security system, a gated community, or an apartment complex rather than a house and, if so, are those options feasible for you right now?  If the gun is a deal breaker for him and there is a way that you would live in a house without a gun but you can't make that happen right now then you two should put a hold on moving in together until you can live in a manner where you would feel comfortable not having a gun (i.e. wait until you can afford to live together in a place and manner you feel safe).  If you can afford to live together now in a place you would feel safer without a gun then reconsider the place you are looking to move to. If the gun is a deal breaker for him and not having a gun is a deal breaker for you then it make sense to reconsider the relationship (because quite frankly you're both allowed your deal breakers in that area and both of you should only live in a home you feel safe living in). If he is willing to compromise on ways for you to have a gun then you figure out what those will be and move forward. It really is that simple. But the first piece starts with you asking him whether there are any circumstances at all in which he would feel safe and comfortable with a gun in the house and what those are. If he says yes then figure out if those circumstances are ones you can make happen. If he says no then the next step is to ask yourself if there are any circumstances at all in which you'd feel safe and comfortable without a gun and what those are.  If those circumstances are feasible then make those happen.  If you're at a standstill even after asking those questions, then I think you need to accept this as an incompatibility in the relationship and consider ending things, regardless of how many people on reddit agree with him or you.  You're going to get a lot of comments about the gun (on either side of the fence) but the real issue here is whether the two of you can find a compromise in this relationship or not through communicating and trying to get both of your needs and wants met."

You're already so far in his direction that compromise for you would seem to mean giving up basically everything.

Stop telling him what he should do, or how he should feel. Tell him what you are feeling: You are dissapointed in him. You are weirded out. You are concerned he has hurt his relationship with your mutual friend. You are further concerned that your friend is also dissapointed and wierded out by what he did and he is taking no steps to find out, or address the situation if she is.

And finally, you are further dissapointed that he is not taking these concerns seriously. Nothing you can do can make him respect the words coming out of your mouth, but it sure is shitty that he isn't. "

Honestly, it seems like maybe even her friends are influencing her. Typically if women act like this towards someone they care about, then they‚Äôve had someone talk to them beforehand to make them think about their situation. Additionally, it seems like she could be surrounded by friends that encourage behavior such as her going out and drinking quite a bit. I could be wrong. But it‚Äôs food for thought.

You‚Äôre not being unreasonable. You‚Äôre in a relationship. It‚Äôs not a relationship if you‚Äôre doing distance and come home to her basically just spending time doing her own thing and not acknowledging you. It‚Äôs super selfish and she‚Äôs treating you like a doormat. "

Was he sober when he tantrumed at your 8-year-old cousin?

The ""pity fuck"" thing he said to his friend was incredibly cruel.

The kindest thing you could do for him is to break up with him and let him know it's because of his unacceptable drinking and associated behaviors. People often will not change until not-changing costs them something they care about, and often that has to happen a number of times. It doesn't sound like he's faced many consequences so far.

You need to get you power back, if only to save your child from growing up to be passive and emotionally dependent like his mother.

Surrogacy is only a solution in a very very tiny subset of infertility cases. In our case the Endo led to a very low number of eggs. Surrogacy would not have fixed that problem and even severe Endo that has spread here there and everywhere won‚Äôt necessarily prevent your sister carrying her own children (IME it‚Äôs more likely to have tanked her ovaries).

Anyway, stop listening to your MIL. Why does she even know about *your* sister‚Äôs infertility struggles??? It‚Äôs precisely none of her business and if she makes this kind of ridiculous comment to you she‚Äôs liable to bingo your sister all the way to a full house if they‚Äôre ever in the same room. 

So, step 1, stop worrying about something that‚Äôs unlikely to happen anyway. Step 2, stop sharing your sister‚Äôs medical information with your MIL (and any other people- it‚Äôs not your story to share). Step 3, keep your MIL the hell away from your sister at any family events when they‚Äôre liable to cross paths.

Edit:  you don‚Äôt need to be walking on eggshells around your whole family. Enjoy your pregnancy. Yes it will probably suck for your sister and her husband to be lapped by her younger sibling, and yes, you want to prevent that, but you can‚Äôt. Just be kind. Be aware that they‚Äôll probably appreciate heads ups on big announcements (if you know someone going through infertility it‚Äôs generally agreed that it‚Äôs kinder to let them know by email before you see them so they can deal with any grief they feel in private) and be aware that if you‚Äôre planning baby showers/ gender reveals and whatever there are some times your sister may need to take a step back- but let her decide when/ how much- she might be fine. Also your sister is not the person to hear about how terrible morning sickness/ stretchmarks etc are- moan to someone else about that stuff). But otherwise you do you and if your sister wants to take a graceful step back... let her. "

He apologized so let it go is my advice. Also, I would be confused if I were him. You bring this memory up every time you get together with family, showing it is important, then get this upset when he tries to incorporate this important  romantic thing into your anniversary. Yeah when you said you didn‚Äôt want it done he should have taken it at face value, but bringing it up at every get together isn‚Äôt helping. Plus you said your mom loves the story but feigns embarrassment - perhaps he thought you were doing the same by saying ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ever do that‚Äô. You have to admit, it‚Äôs a mixed message. I suggest your family moves on to retelling other stories, at least around your significant others, instead of romanticizing it.

1) He was the at-fault driver in an accident that injured you. He might be feeling ashamed and guilty, and your continued care or discussions about your pain remind him of his mistake. So he shuts you down.

2) People sometimes have an implicit bias about women and pain. Google ""doctors dismiss women's pain."" Long story short, there are a lot of article and a few studies that have been conducted about how gender bias affects women seeking treatment for pain. Women are told their symptoms are ""all in their head"" in a way that men aren't, even though neither sex has truly been proven to have a higher or lower pain tolerance. Some studies conclude women‚Äôs reports of pain were more likely to be dismissed. Your hubs may just have a bias you weren't aware of that causes him to think you're just over-exaggerating or being a ""sissy"" about it. 

3) Money. I don't see how this would be the biggest deal as the two of you have excellent health insurance and the other party's medical bills will be covered by the liability car insurance. Does he think you guys are going to be sued or something? This honestly seems like the least serious worry given your description of your financials.

I can say that for me, it came from thinking TV was what real life and real relationships would be like. The older I got and the more I experienced, the less that was true. "
333,"Sounds like he's having some kind of mental break. See if you can convince him to see a doctor before it gets any more out of control.

In the meantime, try to talk some sense into him. He's overwhelmingly more likely to be killed by heart disease, or a car crash, or cancer, so why isn't he obsessing over any of those? If he's in the early stages of paranoia then it might be possible to get through to him at least enough to get him to see a professional. "
334,"He sounds slightly more mature than her though, so I think he‚Äôd be better off in a relationship with someone of a more similar maturity level. There will still be plenty of cringe, but hopefully not *unhealthy* cringe.

I agree tho‚Äîhe is young, and I shouldn‚Äôt fault *him* so much, I just want him to see that it can be better. "
335,"A few times a year is still a *lot*, especially when you consider that the vast majority of people don't lose their shit or waste afternoons over insignificant things like missing pills or parking tickets, *ever*. I've been with my boyfriend 4 years, I can't remember the last time he went on a tirade of righteousness indignation over something warranted or otherwise. I can't remember the last time I did either. 

I think your husband has really selfish reasons for doing it. He didn't want to help your friend, he either A) wanted to feel like he was righting some enormous wrong, B) he wanted the gratitude and admiration of your friend and you (""oh thank you big strong man for doing what we couldn't!""), or C), he just wanted an opportunity to yell at someone and pick on some poor customer service representative. 

I don't think you're going to convince your husband he's wrong or that he should apologize to your friend. But have you told him how embarassed you are for him? How disappointed you are that he ruined everyone's afternoon?

Next time, walk away. Next time he causes a scene because his McDonalds meal didn't come with a special sauce, or because he got a ticket for coming to his car 2 minutes too late, just walk away from it. Go get yourself a coffee, go catch a cab home, go shopping. He's got a phone, he can call you when he wants to find you. Don't let his attention-seeking tantrums ruin your (or anyone elses) day."
336,"Totally disagree. I think people like her future SIL don't understand or accept a polite no. My sister's MIL sounds exactly like this woman, to an uncanny degree (the control freak planning, the assigning tasks ‚Äî hell, my sister's MIL literally tells her what she and her family are allowed to eat and how much when they get together, and if they deviate from that or bring their own food, she flips out). My sister has tried to politely tell her no more times than I can count. I told her, ""What you need to do is lose your shit on this woman and put her in her place,"" because she will not take a kind, reasonable no. She's incapable of it. And all the while, my brother-in-law does everything his stepmother says for fear of rocking the boat, he's so afraid to tell these people no that he guilt-trips my sister into acquiescing. 

Every summer, my sister's MIL decrees that everyone come to a 1-2 week away at her lake house. My sister has dutifully gone year after year even though she hates it because MIL decides the itinerary, MIL decides whether they can have air conditioning (that's always a no, even if it's 100 degrees out), MIL decides what time they can go to sleep and get up in the morning (ex: the kids are not allowed to get up until late because MIL likes her morning quiet time). My sister has never (not in 16 years of marriage) had a summer vacation that she wanted because MIL is so pushy and throws fits if my sister so much as hints she might have her own plans. Finally, my sister put her foot down, told her husband they could go every other year but on the off years, she wanted to plan their own vacation with their kids. This was their year to do their own thing. MIL asked her to go, my sister told her no. MIL sent her a series of ""I'm very disappointed in you"" messages, then went behind my sister's back and got sister's spineless husband to agree for the both of them. Now my sister's the bad guy for refusing, it's a big scandal because she called MIL and told (nicely) her no again and MIL is calling everyone crying that my sister is ruining her vacation. So my sister is now saying she'll probably go just to get her to stop flipping out; I say let her have her tantrum, maybe she'll stop trying to push people around. It's not just the vacation, MIL does this for everything, holidays, get togethers. And there's always a list of tasks to go with every outing, just like OP is describing. So my sister spends all her time doing this woman's bidding. People like this can't take no for an answer. No matter how hard my sister tries to refuse, her husband is so fucking terrified of rocking the boat with his family that he overrides her and basically tells her to comply with whatever MIL Dearest wants. 

OP is smart to be putting her foot down now and setting a precedent. If her fiance wants to go, he's can be the errand boy. I say go nuclear now so she doesn't have to suffer through years of this shit like my sister.

OP, do not apologize to this woman. And if your fiance can't grow a spine, think long and hard about marrying him."

You ought to be less concerned about explaining this to him, more pissed that he's butting into your sex life and controlling you in terms of your sexuality, privacy, and who you date. Time to grow up and get your own place."
349,"&gt; she took him to a strip club (multiple times) and bought a couples strip tease

Personally, I'd consider that cheating.  Going to a strip club &amp; getting a couples dance, without you knowing is definitely way beyond ""girl talk"" and a harmless crush.

Even if you don't think that crossed the line, she's clearly TRYING to cheat, just hasn't succeeded yet b/c it appears the other guy has drawn his own line in the sand.

If you are still considering following through w/ the engagement, you really should check out couples counseling asap."
350,"Yeah, you nailed it there. I was trying to to a little lighter as we all make mistakes, especially with emotions if you feel you've been cheated on, but that was just waaay too much."
351,"So, basically, she's accusing *you* of lying to cover up a friends infidelity.

So **this relationship is fucked**. She can't be with someone she believes did such a thing, and you can't be with someone who thinks you'd do such a thing, and you can't be with someone who accuses you of lying, and neither of you can be with someone they dont trust. Oh and she's *hatefully* sexist ('thats what men do""). And her girlfriends suck. 


It sucks that your GF doesnt trust you; you clearly dont deserve it; but one day her lack of trust was going to surface and destroy this relationship anyway; today's the day. Next time it could be *you* she accuses of cheating on no evidence - bullet dodged.

"
352,"Seems to me like maybe you should step back for a minute, let him process what you‚Äôve said - ‚ÄúI want to get married. It‚Äôs important to me.‚Äù

While you‚Äôre letting him process on that, personally I would focus on what negotiators call your BATNA - your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. Essentially, once you know your BATNA, you know at what point you can and should walk away from the table - in this case the marriage negotiation. 

The thing is, I get the feeling you maybe haven‚Äôt been focusing on that...you need to figure out, as a practical exercise, where you would go and what you would do if you walked away. 

I‚Äôm also (totally guessing) that your boyfriend may be scared of marrying you because he‚Äôs already sort of ‚Äúyour everything‚Äù, and he knows it. It sounds like you‚Äôve made him the centre of your current existence, following him to another country, not having any close friends etc. Having been in that role before - being someone‚Äôs whole world - it‚Äôs both suffocating and terrifying. It may be that the best way to show your boyfriend the value of committing to you would be to start working on building a life and interests that are completely apart from him. "
353,"I was in an abusive relationship. The reason I left in the end is because a friend  picked me up and made me!

360,"Wait. You want to cancel your wedding to go to the world cup?

Enjoy being single man. That is the single stupidest choice you could ever make in your entire life.

&gt;t's just a wedding day,

Sounds like you don't give a shit about this girl, to be frank. She'll be happy to be rid of an unfeeling asshole like you."
361,"I agree with all of this.

It sounds like he's trying to work his way up to this, but there are a whole bunch of reasons why he'd be hesitant to actually propose. 

For one thing, OP keeps working herself up about a proposal, which taints their time together and probably just is making things even more miserable for him. But for another there's all kinds of other issues going on in the background (like their lost jobs, the LDR situation, their failed last attempt at cohabiting, family issues, etc.) that OP seems to be ignoring in favor of a wedding. If I was this guy, that would really worry me. OP seems to care more about the proposal and some imagined idea of ""being married"" than of actually fixing their situation and living together. It comes across as really immature and divorced from reality. 

There's no rule that says the must be engaged for them to move in together and move to the next step of their relationship. Nor will an engagement magically make this happen. If he proposed tomorrow they'd still be in the same shitty LDR they have now. And if they do get engaged and married, that's a chunk of their money going to a wedding rather than improving their combined situation.

There's also the fact that the dude is only 24. Even if he's 100% committed to the relationship and 100% on board with marriage *in the future*, he might not be ready for it right now. It's a really big commitment, especially for someone that young, and especially for someone who's life situation isn't going very well. But with OP putting so much pressure on this he's probably afraid to even communicate whatever doubts he has, no matter how well-founded they might be. She's talking about refusing his proposal bc he hasn't given it well before their deadline, or even breaking things off entirely if he doesn't propose. She's willing to completely annihilate their relationship over this, so he's being forced into it ""or else."" That's not a good place for him to be and will only compound any anxiety and doubts he has about this."
362,"There are countless ways that people test others in their social group to discover if certain needs and wants can be met (platonic or otherwise).  You can sum it up as: If I do X, will that person respond the way I want? Every interaction contains information like this.

Most of us do this all the time without consciously realizing it. We also constantly signal other people about the ways in which we are willing to relate to them. Through your habits, reactions, and behaviors, you actually teach the people around you how to treat you.

This is not a bad thing, but when a maladaptive behavior/pattern comes into play, it can become bad.

Sounds like you've been teaching people to use you as a band-aid.

It happens to a lot of us. At some point in your life, doing things this way probably helped you out, and that's why it became a pattern. Even if the intention behind it is good, sometimes you just outgrow old ways of doing things, and it gets uncomfortable.

Being ""scared of upsetting people"" is something you probably broadcast in ways you don't realize. But they aren't going to perceive it as that; what they probably get from you is that you're ""willing"" and ""available"" and ""sympathetic."" (And that you don't shut them down when they cross lines or get inappropriate: something predators look for). I say this as someone who has struggled with the same issue, by the way. I also somehow ended up with a string of friends who needed me to be their emotional crutch.

 Once I started asserting myself, it ""magically"" stopped happening. Case in point: new guy at my workplace likes to give spontaneous backrubs. I turned around and calmly said, ""Stop. I don't like that,"" the first time he touched my shoulder. All he did was laugh and back off. Amazingly, no one burst into flames or had their bone marrow leak out on the floor. Want to know what happened? I am now the only person there he doesn't routinely drunk-dial at 3am to whine at. That's what happened. He doesn't even try it with me. (Side bonus: other coworkers have started apologizing if they bump into me and giving me way more physical space. It's nice. I didn't even have to ask).

You might be attracting people who are whiny, clingy, needy, or attention-hungry because your own boundaries are softly defined. Soft boundaries aren't bad, but they might be *too* soft for what *you* need right now. Many people who are too accommodating to others find it so challenging to set a boundary they end up just stewing in resentment and frustration until they're ready to blow up.

You said you're not sure how to stop indulging these people without seeming like a massive jerk. You don't have to blow up at them. You can start by making your sympathy less satisfying. ""Aw that's too bad. Good luck with that."" Done. Time for a new topic. Start telling them about a headline/tv series/your weekend plans.

You can be warm and affirming as you set your boundaries. You mentioned being an introvert. That can come to your aid, too. That friend of yours who wants to vent about work for two hours? Just as they get started, jump in: ""It's too bad your coworkers are still acting so rotten. Hey, I gotta go, I'm wiped out. You know how it is, being an introvert. I already had to spend my whole day dealing with people. I know you know EXACTLY what I mean. Hopefully tomorrow treats you better, dude!""

The less nice, more direct version you can use on persistent ""friends"": ""It's not really my thing to listen to people vent for a whole conversation. Hey though, have you seen the latest sports team score? What the heck, right?"" They'll get the message real fast.

I actually had to write out scripts for myself when I started standing up to the friends who were used to leaning on me. People who have come to expect your emotional support on demand can get cranky and overreactive when you suddenly don't drop everything to comfort them. I've had people ignore me, lash out at me, and (in some cases) wail hysterically when I tried extricating myself from their business. But afterward, they treated me very differently: with respect.

My advice: become a broken record and give yourself an out. ALWAYS have a thing you've just GOT to do SOON, and don't explain it. It can be made-up, that doesn't matter. ""Sorry to interrupt, this is so bad, but I just have to go--so busy--life is hectic, right?""

Don't let them side-track you back into what they want (a captive audience). It's too bad for them, but they've got to learn that you are not a band-aid. After the first few times trying this, it will get easier. Over time you'll start to hold yourself differently, gain some confidence in asserting yourself, and discover that suddenly people have a harder time forcing attachments on you.

Just repeat your chosen line-- ""Right, that really DOES suck. Ghosting people you're dating is so immature. Can't they just say 'this isn't for me, nice to meet you tho, you'll be great for someone' and peace out? Gotta go binge my favorite show now, I promised my housemate we'd finish season two this week. I'll be in touch. BYE."" Then really, actually leave. And enjoy your newfound space. :)"
363,"&gt; but what if she secretly wants me to be a surrogate? 

What if she secretly wants to kidnap your son and eat your husband?

You don't know what she wants, you can't read minds. Don't project this on her. If you actively WANT to be a surrogate, offer it. If not, don't. If it ever comes up, be clear and honest. If it doesn't, don't bring it up. It's really that simple. Just don't assume things and let them eat at you for no reason."
364,"Ok first up.

This needs to be clean. You don‚Äôt need an explanation or reasons.

Take screen grabs of as much info as you can just to keep you covered - don‚Äôt go into the details, it won‚Äôt help.

Work out the mechanics first. Call the jewellery place, explain and hopefully get at least 90% of your money back. Same goes for the party.

Is she on the lease? If not call a moving truck and have her stuff out in storage. Give her the details. Don‚Äôt worry about her, she has places to stay.

Then take some time from work if you can, maybe a week to decompress. Go get tested also.

When it comes to friends and family, just tell the truth. She quit her job to be a full time prostitute which you were not aware of, once discovered you ended the relationship and would prefer to just move on.

Good luck.

365,"One day, when you are in your early 30s, you are going to run across a 17 year old kid and think ‚Äúoh, there is a child‚Äù and then you are going to realize how truly horrible it is that your boyfriend thought that starting a romantic relationship with someone that age was ok. 

I know you don‚Äôt have the experience to know how gross this is yet, but please listen to other people in your life who have. This is not a healthy relationship. He doesn‚Äôt see you as his equal, and he never wants to. A SO is supposed to be your partner in all things, and partners need to be on equal footing and treat each other with respect. None of this is your fault. You should definitely never marry this man, and instead find a partner closer to your age who loves you for everything you are, not because you are naive and willing to be a house husband. "

Hold her to that. It doesn't have to be a battle or an argument - you've been through this cycle a few times now, and whatever her reasoning, you're within your rights to say enough. She wants to do it her way? Great! You'll support her regardless. But after having your head bitten off more than once after she asks for help then rejects it, there's absolutely no reason to keep repeating the same actions and expecting a different result. She no longer gets your help, because whatever she *says*, her actions say otherwise, and they're what matter. So don't frustrate yourself by trying to win her over or talk it through, because there's nothing to discuss. **She doesn't want your help**, whether she says she does or not, because she's made it abundantly clear that she has no interest in losing weight, or at least losing it your way. She's now blown her chance. If you're happy with how she looks now, great, don't bother encouraging her, weight-wise.

Let me fill you in on a secret. It's HIS money! He could rake it all into a pile and burn it if he wants to. He certainly has the right to spend it on a woman who makes him happy. He earned it, he gets to decide what to do with it. It is incredibly RUDE to argue with your parents about how you feel you are enititled to something they earned. If you were my daughter, I would tell you it is none of your damn buisness, and the next time you bring up my money, there will be none for you.

392,"Hey Staralfur,

I know this sub has a reputation of jumping the gun and leaping to ""break up"", while other options are still feasable. I respect your strenght and dedication to your wedding vows that you want to make it work.

But honestly? When people tell you who they are, believe them.
Your husband says he's a bully. He's now bullying you. Ask yourself: Does he also bully your kids?

You're doing your best, and it's not good enough. Will your kids' best be ever good enough?

Lots of kids grow up with divorced parents, and honestly: Divorce just meant their parents weren't a match. It's not something that destroys children.

Lots of kids are also bullied, and most of them will carry the scars of bullying for the rest of their lives. And most of these kids will not even have been bullied by their ""dad"". Children getting bullied definitely destroys children.

Please try everything you want to make it work, but realise that if your husband refuses to change and nothing you try works, you won't be the only victim if you stay with him.

Do what you can, just realize that giving up after trying everything you could doesn't mean you failed, it just means you're protecting your kids."
393,"&gt;So they are on their way to visit me now

Don't let them in. I'm totally serious. This needs a serious example of boundary-enforcing  to make them wake up"
394,"Also, like, try and understand it from the dog's perspective. Random person comes into your house, gets up in your face, *lifts your damn body off the ground*, steals your toys. The Human seems to think everything is okay, but part of your job is protecting the pack! Now this creep is making a sudden move? Hell naw."
395,"My husband is a scorekeeper (acts of devotion). I know this about him. I know he needs this to feel settled and loved. So, I try to make sure that when I tell him I am going to do something, that I do it or I let him know I can't or have to put it off. I also clarify with him, that if he wants me to do blah-blah, that he has to let go of control of it. He cannot expect it done his way or on his time-frame. It has really helped. You have to get purposeful with your words. Say what you mean and mean what you say. 22 years and counting."
396,"Seriously. I dropped a bridezilla 10 years ago and have never questioned the decision. She expected us to buy a $600 dress, $300 shoes, pay for hair and makeup at a salon of her choosing, get matching manicures &amp; pedicures, spend a good thousand on a destination bachelorette party and attend multiple showers. She lives a 7 hour drive from me and wanted me to travel to go bridesmaid dress shopping. She had 14 bridesmaids and 4 personal attendants at her 700 person wedding. I have never been happier to not stand up for someone and haven‚Äôt missed her high maintenance antics in my life whatsoever. It‚Äôs all so unbelievably selfish."
397,"You dodged a bullet here. That kind of emotional immaturity and instability would make married life and possible parenthood with this man a living hell. He sounds pretty underhanded to do the twoface text thing. 

Please be with friends and family. Cry your eyes out until they‚Äôre so dry they hurt. Scream and beat up a pillow. Go for a tiring run. Just get it all out and then let it go. Realize you have grown from this and that you were just saved from a life of living with someone who would do that to another person. You‚Äôre better than that!"
398,"OK, another secret is that you won't actually find ANY truly well-adjusted older men.

Why? Because by definition, if they were well-adjusted, they wouldn't be sleeping with you.

Obviously he wants to act like he's in college again. He's banging someone HALF HIS AGE. How did that not clue you in?....

OP, you can't have cake and eat it too. If you want to sleep with older men, you're gonna have to accept that they're all secretly either creepy, immature, or having a crisis of some sort where they want to relive their past. ALL. OF. THEM. That is why they are sleeping with you to begin with. You are going to have to accept some level of icky behavior if you wanna continue sleeping with guys his age. It's just the reality...

Why? Because well adjusted 42 YO men are married, or dating women their own age already. Not on Tindr looking for college hookups."
399,"&gt; Flirting isn't cheating.

It most certainly is.  Fliriting is an invitation for further engagement.  You even admit that you'd like to go further, and if you and Clare keep it up, you will.

Also, your incessant texting is not innocent.  You are busy building up a separate intimacy with Clare.   You are also in an emotional affair that has reached the point where you are rewriting history back 5+ years to justify your emotional cheating.

"
400,"&gt;  is important for me to hear at the same time. 

yea, there's your problem. its about what YOU want, and not about whats good for him or the both of you. "
401,I was going to say it's a belated anniversary trip or something like that. It defs needs to be made known it's just for the 2 of them. I don't want to make OP feel bad but this should have been done face to face so SIL would know.
402,"I couldn‚Äôt do a relationship like this. 

I do not like sharing my SO (romantically/sexually/physically) with anyone else. I find it disrespectful. I like trusting my instincts and if I feel something is off there must be a reason for it.

I think this is how you‚Äôre feeling. There was something between them, maybe still is. If it makes you uneasy then it‚Äôs up to you to decide how much you wanna be part of. 

I wouldn‚Äôt stay in a relationship where my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have a clear line of who I am and who his friend is. "
403,You don't have to give him anything. He doesn't have to keep paying your tuition though.
404,"Bull.

I have an identical twin sister. I'm talking SUPER identical in appearance. No way could she have tricked anyone into thinking that she is me. And no way the other way around. There are still differences. Especially noticeable to someone who has been with you for an entire year. 

I don't believe this story one bit. I've known many identical twins in my life, and this is made up. If it's not, then your boyfriend and brother are terrible liars and you need to end contact with both of them."
405, He said he didn't want a black child. How can that be taken as anything but racist? You are in extreme denial. He's a disgusting racist and you need to get away from him.
406,"""We've already made a compromise by letting Dan stay in our lives at all, and we did this in order to maintain a relationship with you. I'm sorry to hear you don't understand the gravity of what he did. We're unable to compromise further, so if a time comes where you're willing to accept that please let us know."""
407,"I wouldn't be so quick to be so harsh. It might just be the type of therapy doesn't work with her personality/issues. I found CBT and Transactional Analysis had basically no effect for me, despite trying very hard for a long time. DBT was better for me, and I'm about to try EMDR. 

Also, the actual therapist is very important and if she's seeing someone she feels she can't open up to it can cause her to feel even more hopeless because she may feel like even a mental health professional can't help her. I've gone through a lot of therapists with varying degrees of success based on their personality even thought they were using the same techniques. 


edit: /u/notatravellingman, have you encouraged her to try out different therapists and types of therapy as hers isn't working? There are online directories where you can get information on local counsellors and their techniques and see if any look good. Also there may be types of therapy that work better with her issues, e.g. EMDR for trauma "
408,"She definitely needs to keep some $$ for herself. You should too frankly. Everyone needs an escape fund. 

Divorce -&gt; moving costs -&gt; New apartment -&gt; New furniture -&gt; possible job loss -&gt; etc....."
409,"It's really up to her whether she can forgive it, but I wouldn't be surprised if the answer is no.

I don't think occasionally searching for an ex is a big deal, but (1) doing it every few days is a *lot* and definitely suggests that, even if you wouldn't date her again, you're still hung up in some sense, and, more importantly, (2) you lied to your girlfriend's face.  That's dishonest and disrespectful, and suggests that your general mentality is that lying is okay as long as you don't think your girlfriend finds out you're lying.  That's not a guy I'd want to be with.

Six months in there's not too much invested so if I were her I'd just leave and find someone a bit more honest who respects me.  You should maybe consider therapy or at least some time alone to think long and hard about how to become a more honest person."
410,"Yeah Reddit comes down hard on fb and instagram, I‚Äôve noticed that too. I have to agree with the rest of your posts though, changing relationship status is no big deal imo, the rest you can talk about."
411,"Yeah, they probably would want to know that someone is regularly hanging out on that property."
412,"You can either lock your stuff up, take the stuff you like the most with you, or buy him some started stuff and tell him to stay out of your makeup. 

I do have a friend who‚Äôs sister never stopped stealing her makeup lol. They have their own too. Idk if it‚Äôs a sibling thing. I don‚Äôt live with my siblings anymore, but until I moved out my sister never stopped taking my clothes. I‚Äôd get so mad lol. "
413,Ive thought about that too but she will notice and make a huge deal about it. As will everyone else. I might go ahead w that though honestly.
414,"So because it‚Äôs a tour company aimed at young people, OP is definitely going to want to fall into bed with another guy? No. It sounds like she‚Äôs invested in this relationship (also, if you want to do an organized tour and it isn‚Äôt specifically organized for young people, it will be full of retirees). But she‚Äôs young and shouldn‚Äôt be giving up her dreams for this guy‚Äôs insecurities."
415,"I think this is probably a big part of it. I realize exactly how immature and stupid it is to feel that way but I've done it. I""ve never fought with my husband over it, I just avoid playing games we would be competing against each other in because of this exact scenario. It makes me feel bad if we're playing with another couple who are helping each other while my husband will knock me out of the game in 15 minutes if the opportunity is there. I've never said anything to him about it but when he did it in Monopoly after I had been asking for a game night to play it for weeks, I was really upset and didn't play anything the next round. I just watched. He kind of realized he just forced me out of a game 15 minutes in while the rest of them played for 3 more hours after I had been asking for a game night for almost a month. He felt bad about it but I just don't play those kinds of games with him anymore. I know its a stupid thing to feel bd about but I can't help it so I avoid the situation."
416,"Wow dude. You could not have said a worse thing to her. She discovered she was pregnant with the child of the man she loved, and wanted to share the big news. Instead of comforting her and offering support, you instead question her fidelity and don‚Äôt offer any support. Can you imagine how she‚Äôs feel id you randomly accused her of cheating? But now she‚Äôs also pregnant?! 

Why did you think she was cheating in the first place. Where did you get this behavior from? Think deeply about why or how, and go apologize sincerely to her.

 I would be surprised if she gave you another chance."
417,It's odd how only married men can console her. 
418,"Just break up already!

Cheating is wrong.  So is no sex.  This relationship is super unhealthy and needs to be put to the grave."
419,"Plus, wouldn't you do the same if the roles were reversed? I think it's great she wants you to have a good time and not let finances dictate the terms of your relationship. So go out, have fun! :) "
420,"You need better friends. And have you considered contacting the police?

I suggest getting both of them out of your life as much as possible, and getting therapy to deal with your trauma. You‚Äôre right, she‚Äôs a shitty friend, and love doesn‚Äôt excuse it. She likely realizes believing you means she would have to dump him and she‚Äôs chosen this asshole over you. But continuing to be emotionally invested in this terrible person is only going to hurt you. Join a support group, start going to meetups, talk to your other friends about it, whatever it takes to find people who will actually support you. "
421,"&gt;  I told her it‚Äôs not her fault because I must‚Äôve given her a reason to cheat.

This is doormat thinking, nothing noble about it.  It's unhealthy, and shows an astounding lack of self-respect.  You were actually correct to suspect this drunken party girl but somehow you've turned to blaming yourself.

This is not the kind of girl that is right for you."
422,"Yea I feel like he's trying to keep control to :/

Who end the relationship is a funny one, he claims to have ended it, but in reality I've been trying to break up with him for 3 weeks, overtime i made it clear ""I don't want to be with you anymore"" he was like it's okay we can work on it. XD"
423,"My current SO tried to be too casual about a kink that's important to him, and he basically annoyed me with the little comments until *I* had to force *him* to have an open and honest conversation about the kink.

Like, he'd try to joke about his kink, and I'd be like ""wait, is that something you really want?"" And he'd get scared and back off for a while before ""jokingly"" bringing it up again.

I'm a really blunt, straightforward person. I appreciate that not everyone is like me (probably a good thing), but nothing pissed me off more (and turned me off more) than needing to force him to be ~~a man~~ an adult and tell me what he wanted."
424,Because it's obviously all the woman's fault/s
425,"This. Never ever fake an orgasm. You are just short changing yourself. Also, tell him what you like and give directions."
426,"&gt;Personally I would start playing Wu-Tang until the walls shook while I made margaritas at 8am in my underwear.

Can I come over? This sounds fun. :)"
427,"Whenever these ‚Äúmy partner complains all the time!‚Äù letters come up on r/relationships, it‚Äôs almost always one of two things:

1) the OP is dragging their partner to do a ton of things and is being demanding and uncompromising, and is irritated by their partner pushing back

2) the OP is partnered with an abusive dill hole

This definitely sounds like option#2. And I see a lot of advice here to talk to him firmly and let him know it‚Äôs unacceptable, and I‚Äôm willing to bet OP has already tried this to no effect.  It‚Äôs a control tactic - they keep their partner scrambling to try and pacify them, which keeps the attention directly where they want it.  Which is, on them and their needs/desires/wants.  It especially stood out to me that he expected you to make an awkward excuse to your family for his incredibly rude, childish, and controlling behavior (if he really needed to go to the hotel, he‚Äôs perfectly capable of saying it politely and arranging it himself).  I had an ex who, like clockwork, threw a major fit every holiday when visiting family that would have him insisting we both had to leave IMMEDIATELY (or he‚Äôd threaten to just storm out and drive five hours home in our mutual car, stranding me with no explanation).  Took me years to figure out that it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence - he was intentionally trying to ruin the family holiday time and wanted to upset me so the focus would be back on him.

He sucked, and holidays are much happier without him.  OP, how much happier would you be without all this constant negativity in your life?"
428,"I think you're on the money bringing up the point about some sort of hidden love triangle that op may be blind sided to. 

In op's other thread she mentions that Jane had a crush on her before moving in. This very well could be a situation where John and Jane are both jealous/ mad and are trying to control who op is seeing. "
429,"Yes, this is in fact emotional abuse. Look out for yourself here and protect yourself. She's deliberately trying to hurt you and make you feel bad, such as with the driving. I would get an individual counselor for yourself to help you figure out howbest to get out of this."
430,"I agree, I don't see anything good here.

&gt; I get halfway there and she texts me that she‚Äôs going out, which usually means she‚Äôs pissed and going to drive around for hours until she doesn‚Äôt hate me anymore.

Can you imagine being in a relationship where one partner hating the other is this normalized?"
431,"&gt;Listen, no one is going to advocate for you. Ninjas aren‚Äôt going to fly down out of the ceiling, and throw the bill at your BF, and say on June 5th you told your GF you were going to take her out to sushi and so the bill is your responsibility!! 

I feel there is a need for these ninjas.

Relationinjas? 

Ninjammunicators?"
432,"Yep. OP, your mom sounds potentially sociopathic - I mean, she had so little empathy for an animal that was *literally dying right in front of her*, that she couldn't be bothered to make a vet trip (or even just give the cat its prescribed pills). That's monstrous.

And that's not even to mention the other less extreme moments, where she feels no remorse majorly inconveniencing you to save herself even the slightest bit of effort.

&gt; Anyways, I cut her out of my life and I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do. I am an only child and if I really cut my mom out, she doesn't have anyone left in my family besides my dad. She pushed her sisters away and my cousins don't talk to her much anymore. Am I wrong to cut her out?

Just remember, *you* didn't cause this rift between you and her, *she* did. There's a reason the rest of your family doesn't talk to her, and it's the direct result of her own decisions. Follow their lead, and cut yourself free of her incredibly toxic influence."
433,It‚Äôs not that big of a mystery. He understands what you‚Äôre saying and feeling. He just doesn‚Äôt care or respect them because his desires are more important to him than yours.
434,AVENGER DISASSEMBLES 
435,"I was kind of venting to my parents about how I felt they could have raised me differently, and he came out and said this as an admission he may have messed up.

He didn‚Äôt say it to hurt or insult me, he actually seemed really regretful. "
436,I'm in a bad relationship is one of the more over used ones. Most times it's a lie
437,"/r/legaladvice's legal advice is significantly better than the legal advice you get here. /r/relationships might be good at giving relationship advice but there's absolutely terrible legal advice going on in every thread.

Look at this thread for example:

[Illegal disposal of a tenant's belongings](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8y5dys/my_m29_girlfriend_f40_of_several_years_had_a/e28b6v8/)

[Illegal Eviction - being arrested and institutionalized does not automatically terminate your lease](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8y5dys/my_m29_girlfriend_f40_of_several_years_had_a/e289z7k/)

[Illegal disposal of a tenant's belongings](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8y5dys/my_m29_girlfriend_f40_of_several_years_had_a/e28u923/)

[Incorrect definition of an eviction and advocacy for an illegal eviction](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8y5dys/my_m29_girlfriend_f40_of_several_years_had_a/e2916su/)

Some of these comments are pretty highly upvoted too. Absolutely terrible advice. The Kindergarten mantra of ""Two wrongs don't make a right"" applies even to law. Your (ex)girlfriend having a breakdown and burning your house down does not mean you now get to sidestep proper legal procedure. Improperly tossing her stuff away means OP will get sued and pay his ex for damages for everything she lost. Being put in an involuntary psychiatric hold for a day or two does *not* constitute abandonment of property. Similarly, illegally evicting her means he'll have to pay for any damages *and* have to allow her to live in the apartment for at least another month while he is forced to go through proper eviction procedures he should have done in the first place.

Do you want to end up in court with the crazy ex you're actively trying to get away from? Because this is how you end up in court with the crazy ex you're actively trying to get away from"
438,"Yes, ask to talk with the social worker on her unit."
439,"Originally he was ok with you visiting and then he had a change of heart, correct?  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he has a change of heart when they create the family portrait too. "
440,"She's not your friend, and will never pay you back."
441,"This is what it really comes down to. Don‚Äôt cave, OP. Don‚Äôt waste your hard-earned money on someone who will always put you second.



This double standard makes me so angry, having dated a loser like this guy. I couldn‚Äôt take the selfishness and his fucking weirdo helicopter mom. I must admit I was curious how OP got him to ‚Äúwork‚Äù on that attitude, but I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs correctable."
442,Not the most mature way but still the best way.
443,"You sound like you're probably an awesome person who's just been so emotionally beaten down you don't know which way is up, and I think you could benefit immensely from seeing a therapist or other mental health professional. Those people have the tools you're looking for."
444,"To me, the real issue is buying a house. I wouldn't want to buy with a boyfriend as opposed to a spouse. That could go wrong in so many ways. So if you live together but he wants to buy one in his name yet have you live with him and contribute while having a prenup that says the house is just his, that's a problem. It makes me wonder if he's even serious about this as a longterm thing. I'd definitely sit him down and ask about what he's really trying to do here."
445,It doesn't state anywhere in the post whether she took his advice and ended it or not. Sounds more like she carried on with the affair and that's how it all blew up. 
446,This is definitely worth taking to counseling. It was really fucked up of her to go behind your back on this. 
447,"Bring your own non-booze was what I was saying in my head, haha. "
448,She‚Äôs only 18 and at 18 I had many ideas for tattoos I know I would regret now. I‚Äôm only 25 now and have 15+ tattoos including a sleeve but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt start when I was 18. Your opinion is fine. As long as you don‚Äôt FORCE her to do anything which it doesn‚Äôt sound like you did at all. Life is long and she could always get the same tattoo in the future if she still wants it.

450,That's a huge age difference at that age. I'm a bit squicked out.
451,"The messed up part is you never asked him to lie, you just asked him to not mention it to other people.  THat's not lying.  This is a normal ""contract"" that most couples have.  It's common to have this arrangement. Until he understands the difference, you are going to have to be very careful about what you tell him."
452,Stay in communication with your sister. Give her a support network. Make sure if it happens again you take action. Document everything.
453,"I don‚Äôt read it like a passive aggressive poke. I read it like someone with a compulsion freaking out because he had to try to ‚Äúfix"" the nonexistent problem.  It‚Äôs like someone with severe OCD would react if you made something ‚Äúdirty‚Äù. "
454,"^^ That's literally the best advice your going to get. Anyone who tries to hurt you isn't worth your time or energy. Don't let her get away with this, drop this relationship and find yourself a girl who will treat you with respect or just hookup and have fun. Your young. It's going to get nasty if you ever move in together. She'll find new reasons to rip you down and hurt you over time. "
455,"Good luck! Just to calibrate your conversation with him... slapping a partner is pretty extreme for a lot of people (assuming we're talking about slaps with some force behind them). I've got my own kinks, but the thought of seriously slapping my wife is revolting to me.
"
456,"She will always side with her son over you no matter what a loser he is. Now there‚Äôs future grandchild in the mix, which will make her even less likely to kick them out. Of course this is what she should do, but I‚Äôm thinking she won‚Äôt. Unless you want a world of pain I would recommend you leave the situation now. Painful for a while but you‚Äôll get over it. You are a decent person and will meet someone else. "
457,"It's funny how people here refer to drunk partying as some kind of dream to see the world. You don't even want to go do it with him. Sure, break up because you're not that committed if you can't even see why this would be an issue. I disagree with everyone calling him an insecure asshole, he has every right to decide he isn't comfortable in a relationship where his gf is drinking and partying with other guys like that. He is not manipulative, he laid it out clearly for you. You have every right to go, he has every right to no longer want to be with you. 


It really annoys me when people downplay both common sense and personal self respect and call it insecurity. Trust isn't blind, trust is earned. A trustworthy partner isn't just someone who in theory never cheated, it is someone who considers you and shows where they stand through actions and choices. 

Also, it's complete bullshit to pretend he is trying to not let you see the world and travel because he has an issue with drunk sexually charged partying (not exactly any culture or exploration here...). People are very biased with these types of topic and I think it's completely ridiculous how they expect others to react. In real world outside of this subreddits fantasies,this reaction is pretty normal and understandable "
458,Yeah this isn‚Äôt so much nipping it in the bud as struggling to cut off a fully bloomed flower. 
459,This is awesome you group is treating him as a ‚Äúmissing stair‚Äù. You girls have decided to avoid him and I think you are doing the right thing making new plans and being vocal about why! Feel proud. 
460,"It is ridiculous to expect someone to cosign a 500k+ loan, like really unreasonable. Without knowing any details of your self-employment, anything could happen, businesses fail, people die suddenly, etc. 

It is also not unreasonable to not want to sell your land to family who would then be your new neighbors. I think your wife just needs to go about it with more tact and get over the fact that your parents didn't ""sign some papers""."
461,"When someone creates a crisis for themselves, again and again, it's not your responsibility to bail them out again and again. 

If it were me, I would schedule some study time for myself at the library every day between 5 and 8 p.m. I would insist that this is mandatory for my schooling, and it wasn't negotiable. That way, you get your study time, and your girlfriend will have to take responsibility for her own child.


"
462,"Start going away weekends, without him"
463,"Assuming he is in the middle of that $2-5k a month, he took roughly $40-45k from OP over the past year.  If this was a taxed job, that‚Äôs roughly $55k a year salaried position just for holding the position of ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô

And the only job requirement was to not yell at his sugar momma.  And he couldn‚Äôt do it!"
464,Then she can't afford to have the dog and should re-home it. The way she's treating it now is cruel. 
465,"I personally think your expectations are too high in some regard. I would certainly cook for a house guest and not ask for money.

However, I probably wouldn‚Äôt go out for dinner and pay for them. Just because you‚Äôre a house guest it doesn‚Äôt mean they should pay for everything for you. In her mind, she might be thinking ‚ÄúI live in a big expensive city and she‚Äôs staying here for free using my gas/electricity etc, she could offer to pay for a dinner‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to expect dinners, that would amount to a pretty big bill for her.

The dog thing is totally weird. I‚Äôm with you on that one.

Maybe she thinks you‚Äôre coming for a getaway and not to keep her company so she doesn‚Äôt feel obligated to ‚Äúrepay‚Äù you for the visit. You should also remember, parents generally have more money to spoil house guests than a 27 year old living in a city. "
466,What a douche. I thought maybe you did a bookshelf or something but all that was definitely some work put in. Get your parents invloved but  honestly look at it as a lesson that even family can screw you over and don't count on getting the money but still try.
467,Its an adventure! Go live life. Your country will still be here when you‚Äôre ready to return. Can you say the same about your relationship?
468,At this point I wouldn't even waste time or money attending the wedding of such a rude person. 
469,"All the more reason he should have absolutely no problem adding you on Facebook. If he's not cheating, then the reason might be even worse. You really deserve better than this."
470,"&gt; but maybe part of his upset comes from feeling like you don't actually know him at all, and that the expensive gift was all about you, and not about him.

bingo bango bongo"
471,"Honestly, I figured the reason I wasn't chosen was because they had decided to limit their wedding party to three each - obviously not everyone you like can be in the party. The reason I never asked him was because i figured there was no need to have it confirmed im his least favorite person in the group, what would be gained by that. 

I didn't realize we apparently had an actual problem until he berated me. maybe there is more to the backstory than I realize and they've all agreed that I'm the terrible, negative person he said I was. if they cared enough to want me to fix it one of them could have spoken to me about it before and certainly not how Jake approached it.

472,"People understand soft ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù in other contexts and they should respect them in sexual situations as well. If you‚Äôre not getting enthusiastic consent from your partner or you‚Äôre unsure of whether they want to continue you should check in with them instead of trying to continue to convince them.

OP gets to be miffed about getting a room and not getting laid, and should probably stop holding out hope that this will ever happen, but honestly she should have also stopped pushing when he acted weird and eventually put on a robe at least when it became apparent he wasn‚Äôt into it."
473,You have to give up every ‚Äúdeep down inside‚Äù hope you have about your dad. No one is a monster 100% of the time.

475,"Like many others have said, consider it as a dodged bullet for you, but you do not owe him a dime."
476,"Nope. 

Are you into jogging?

May have to up that just a tad and..RUN FAST RUN FAR. "
477,"Or leaving the toddler alone and going to the neighbors house when she should‚Äôve called 911 ASAP or loaded up the two kids and driven to the hospital right away. Wtf was the neighbor going to do?

If you‚Äôre a parent and your kids are hurt or in danger you need to take action quickly in an emergency, the emergency‚Äôs not going to wait for your husband or neighbor to come over and deal with it so you don‚Äôt have to. In both situations OP exercised really bad judgement and wasted valuable time trying to get other people to deal with the situation."
478,"I think he deserves a last call once op is back in town,  then op has to involve cops"
479,"It‚Äôs honestly a little upsetting that he‚Äôs turned this around so that *OP* feels bad and is ‚Äúapologizing profusely‚Äù, when *he‚Äôs* the one that was inconsiderate of his partner‚Äôs clearly expressed feelings. And accusing you of ‚Äúbamboozling him‚Äù? C‚Äômon.

That‚Äôs some shady emotional manipulation if intentional. If it‚Äôs unintentional and this is his true emotional response, it strikes me as seriously immature and obtuse.

OP, you are not a jerk. And you should be able to have this conversation about how your partner ignored your very clear wishes, without that partner turning it into a pity party for himself."
480,"Yea, my sister in law did this. She conceived every reason why being a stay at home wife would be a benefit to both parties, and then EVERYTHING became the excuse as to why no housework is done. After she had her second kid she convinced her husband to hire a nanny to help catchup on all the work, she now wants a maid as well to upkeep the house. 

Everything is just sliiiggtly more important than any house work (including but not limited to her most recent pyramid scheme)"
481,"eh. As long as its not cutting into your daytime functionality I think you need personal time.

Does he ever do solo activities? Watch the video about mating in captivity by esther perel. She talks about the difference between intimacy (having, being secure, comfortable) and desire (wanting, not having, distance). Helped me realize that doing separate activities from my partner and pursuing separate interests kept us more hot for each other ;)

Not that it sounds like you guys are having intimacy issues. "
482,Great response! You did NOTHING wrong OP! Your father is the wrong one here!
483,"&gt;he wanted to use a condom when we were having sex last night, which we NEVER do, but I also just stopped birth control 

Seriously? You know how babies get made, right? You ready for that?"
484,"You may need to do more than suggest. Make it clear that this is a huge deal for you, and she's going to need to do real work to earn your trust back. "
485,"This is normal life with well-adjusted children. They feel happy and comfortable and safe to be their ridiculous, disgusting selves. That‚Äôs awesome and the last thing you want to do is shame them and make them feel bad like your parents did to you. I think your best course of action here is to get yourself into therapy to keep working on the scars of your childhood. It might be something you need to stick with for a lifetime, but as long as you keep moving forward, that‚Äôs okay. "
486,"Not much to get really. You're overall concern seems perfectly reasonable but the Instagram follow and Facebook status is getting lumped into that concern.

I honestly wouldn't even bring those two things up because those are reasonable requests on her part and she's going to get hung up on those two complaints and not hear the more important stuff."
487,"You may want to look into the legality of the procedure she had done. I know where I work, we don't dock tails after the puppy is 3 days old. If it has to come off after that, it's a major surgery with full anesthesia and a lot more expensive (like several hundred dollars).

Another arrow in your quiver for when you sue your sister, which you should."

489,Then buy a locked box or a filing cabinet with a lock and put all of your products in there. It's time for him to buy his own. 
490,"&gt; Have a real conversation about what you want in a proposal. Tell him your ring size. Show him rings you like the look of. Discuss when you'd ideally marry him based on a proposal in August. Do you want to marry in December? April 2019? June 2019? Where are you going to live? When do you want to start trying for kids? You need to have the conversation.

Sorry for not making it clear in what I wrote, but we've had these convos, at length. I created a whole pinterest board with rings in the budget that we discussed and he's asked me the correct names of  what to ask for at a jewelers, etc. So there shouldn't be any confusion there. 

I think what's holding us up is where to live. We talk about that a lot too. Neither one of us want to live in our hometowns. I freelance FT, so I'm not bound to a location, but we don't necessarily agree on where to live."
491,"It's not the perfect wedding if you're marrying someone that is marrying you or not based on the appearance of your teeth, wow. "
492,"As a married couple, I do not question my wife‚Äôs small purchases (anything less than $100), and even larger purchases we discuss with the other partner first out of respect. We do not leave it to one partner to be in a position where they feel like they have to question the other. We might have budgets we should stick to, such as $50 a month for fast-food/drink (like Starbucks), but it‚Äôs our own discretion what to buy within that budget. But that‚Äôs a marriage situation, where our finances are managed together. 

In a dating relationship, one person has no control over the others spending habits. None. At all. It‚Äôs one thing if you had trouble with money and asked his advice on where to make cuts, and he respectfully gave it, but that isn‚Äôt what is going on here. Like others have said, he is trying to control your habits and money. That isn‚Äôt his to control. Same as you have no control over how he spends his money. If he wants to spend it all on video games and you, that‚Äôs his decision, which also makes it not your responsibility and therefore not a lever of control that he has over you."
493,... dude. I‚Äôm sure it was also a bombshell for her when she discovered that she was pregnant. It‚Äôs not like you were the only one that was surprised. 
494,"SHE is the one being completely unreasonable. Frankly, this Bridezilla doesn‚Äôt sound like much of a friend. You were clear with her from the start and she upped the ante. Walk away from this dumpster fire before it costs you thousands. It‚Äôs so self centered of her to expect ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends to incur this kind of expense for HER wedding. Unbelievable."
495,"If OP has a maid of honor, she can help get the word out. That‚Äôs what the job entails sometimes. "
496,I think so... He's fun and adventurous and into trying new things
497,"The definition of condone is to ""accept and allow"" something.  You accepted and allowed your friend's affair by keeping it secret for her, and now by being her shoulder to cry on after her shitty decisions blew up in her face.

By continuing to support and spend one-on-one time with this woman, you are saying that this behavior is not a deal-breaker for you or for your friendships.

I would be *terribly* uncomfortable if I were your wife, and I think the overwhelming answer here is that you are in the wrong by choosing your friend's comfort over your wife's.

**EDIT TO ADD:**

My boyfriend was once the ""other man"" with a girl who was in a relationship (she was not married, but his involvement with her was still definitely not kosher).

This happened **years** before he and I met and he is an entirely different person now, but it still gave me pause when getting into a relationship with him because it made me doubt his respect for the boundaries of a relationship. I know him well enough to know that he has changed, but I am still wary of the friends he has who were aware of the situation and did nothing/kept it a secret at the time -- because I do not know them as well as I know my boyfriend.

My point is that this is not a case of your wife not trusting you, it is a case of her not wanting you to spend alone time with someone who does not respect the boundaries of marriage. The company you keep does matter."
498,"&gt;I have to call her ...

No you don't have to call her and you shouldn't.  You should stop all this calling and texting right now.   Do not try to gradually cut back, you have to go cold turkey.   Tell your mom that you've tried to be understanding but her stunt last night showed you how unreasonable she is and that it has to stop right now.

Then don't call her at all.  Block her number.   There is absolutely *nothing* that they can't handle on their end without you and you don't need their constant surveillance.

You might to consider getting yourself some individual counseling to help you deal with all the guilting they are going to pile on you because it is going to be bad.   

Just as a point of reference, when I was in college, I called my parents once a week -- on Sunday"
499,How has no one recommended r/legaladvice yet?  
500,"Why are you okay with the way your grandmother treats your mom?  Honestly this doesn't sound like a 'both sides' situation, it sounds like your grandmother is a straight up hateful abuser and you enable her by acting like they're equal participants.  Why should your mother  apologize for the letter your grandmother sent?  I don't even get it.

OP, please don't force people to accept abuse just because it's more convenient for you that way."
501,"The spider thing was a big misunderstanding and you didn't intentionally kill someone's pet.  This is actually pretty funny, but hearing people talk about you like that is horrible.  It's like a cruel, real, Meet the Fockers.

It sounds like she is doing her best to get you mad, which will result in you blowing up at her in front of her family over something small which has really been a whole list of stuff. 
 
Avoid blowing up at her even if she deserves it, because her goal is to make it look like you have an anger issue and her the victim.  Use this time to observe what triggers her and when these kinds of interactions occur.  If you are marrying into the family then you need this info to survive.  

If you are mean passively back, she'll get what she wants.  If you are nice back, then it will be hard for her to cause problems (and probably make her mad) but by all means avoid her as much as possible.  If it comes to a head, only state the facts and avoid any name calling.

Thank goodness her dad has your back.

Good luck!"
502,"&gt; My name is the only one on the utility account, but he won't be able to open a new account in his own name if I cancel it. Outstanding bills.

Lol that is 100% his problem. He sounds like he‚Äôs been using you to band-aid his financial stupidity. Time to rip that band-aid off. 

And you might want to freeze your credit while you sort out exactly how many accounts he has in your name. He sounds like the vengeful (at best, stupid) type, so you‚Äôd be wise to prevent him from doing any more damage than he‚Äôs already done while you figure your shit out. 

Lesson learned: *never* let a partner open accounts in your name. Ever. Ever ever ever. Even the most well-intentioned person (which this guy is not) can do major damage to your credit that way. "
503,"This is unfortunately a common pattern, boomer ‚Äúfeminists‚Äù who act as if that means that young women‚Äôs choices about their bodies and lives should be determined by what old women want instead of what gross old men want. They acknowledge a pyramidal social hierarchy but instead of dismantling it, they would prefer to turn the pyramid over so they can be the asshole boss instead.

I‚Äôm not an expert but as far as I can tell these beliefs have literally nothing to do with feminism. ‚ÄúFeminist‚Äù just becomes a feel-good/look-good title for them, just like the people who start sentences with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist, *but...*‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt bother trying to change your mom or validate her crazy by engaging with her on this topic. The strategy you‚Äôve described using is called an information diet and it‚Äôs extremely effective. Keep her out of your love life as much as possible and do not feel any obligation to justify, defend or explain your choices. Her opinion literally doesn‚Äôt matter."
504,"Anyone who rents knows there's a time they may have to move.  Especially in this type of situation, and at the ages you all are.  It's nice that you are worried about them, but in the end it's your home and their startup etc aren't your problem.  Give them a realistic timeline to find a new place to rent. 2 people with a combined income should be able to find something to rent."
505,"It's absolutely awful when things like this happen, but in some ways they are a blessing because you realize who the camouflaged sexist assholes in the office are. There's so many people who want to defend their perceived right to behave inappropriately. 

This will blow over. Try to just keep your head up and focus on your work. Hang in there."
506,"Minority opinion here. This does seem out of perspective to me as you've been to the vet and there's nothing specific wrong with your cat. All responses so far have spoken as if kitty only has a few months to live, but cats can be 'elderly' and 'in declining health' for years. That's a long time to go without visiting an elderly loved one. A responsible pet sitter will call you and/or a vet if need be. It's true that something could go terribly wrong, but you being present wouldn't stop that. If she were to become ill in your absence, it wouldn't be because you left, but simply because it was her time.

On the flip side, do you actually want to visit your grandma? If you don't enjoy time with her and are looking for an excuse, this would make more sense to me. It does sound like there's some uncomfortable family dynamics in play, and maybe a week with her is more intimacy than you want."
507,You need to have a consultation with a divorce attorney just to go over your options. I highly doubt your relationship can bounce back from this. Probably best you just go into Vulcan mode and do the logical thing.
508,"6-7 months is *nothing*. 

Leave him. He‚Äôs shown you who he really is. "
509,"I don't understand why you would think of couples counseling, it would just prolong your unhappiness.  She has zero interest in your happiness, What would you lose by lose by leaving now?

As far as I can tell, you are trying too make it work because you think you should try to make it work, not because there  is anything there you actually want.  

You were 22 when you married, it's time for you to lawyer up and move on with improving your life."
510,"Thing is, you don't get to decide by yourself what a compromise is - you work *together* and find a solution *together*. It's not you vs. him, it's you both vs the problem. You should both be looking out for each other's feelings - you need to defend yourself, but also put yourself in his shoes, and consider how he's feeling about the situation. And of course he should be doing the same - if he's not, that's another, arguably bigger problem.

Best thing may be to discuss the best approach when you're both calm and happy - you say what you need, he does likewise, and you agree on a middle ground. Because fighting about how you fight is really unhealthy, and means you never really resolve the core issue because you're too busy bickering around the edges! "
511,"Stay out of it.

This guy wants to cut ties with a loon. And your family is making it worse! Your parents are now separately involved in the divorce proceedings? Just what he needs... More lawyer bills.

You stay out of it entirely and get your parents to make amends and call their lawyers off. They could start with a sincere apology and acceptance that he may not think contact with them is appropriate.

You guys have done a real number on this guy. "
512,Your girlfriend is creepy. The fact that she thinks a relationship with a child that is family is creepy makes her a giant weirdo. 
513,I find it interesting that he is so very worried about the comfort of other people but doesn't give a shit about his own wife's comfort. This dude is just a blabbermouth who is making up a pile of bull to cover his ass
514,"Honey it is time to realize that your healthy easy coparenting is now over.  She's not going anywhere and it will just get worse.  Heck, it may even be time to start asking more questions about how he is treated over there.  "
515,"This. She can think he looks got her the car for cheaper but honestly timing, research and the desire that made the sale. She may have looked amazing and he may have enjoyed the attention but it didn‚Äôt make any difference. My MIL who definitely is not a yoga teacher got 12k knocked off a car and her trade in increased."
516,"*You already gave him one, and he's still lying to you.*

*He will continue to lie to you.* 

It's discouraging because no one is telling you what you want to hear. "
517,"&gt;I don't know what to do. I think it's great she's so driven, and I understand why she wants to graduate early and not have to take out as much in student loans. But I miss her during the week, when she's not home till 10 pm and she's too tired to do much. And I'm not having fun with all the weekend partying anymore.

Suck it up.  You've already established yourself in a job/career, she's working on securing her future.  You started dating her when she was a high school student and you were just finished/finishing college (or had already been working for several years?).  You're in different life stages, and will be until she graduates, at least."
518,"&gt;OP's relationship with BIL is forever strained

Didn't that already happen? I wouldn't be able to look at BIL the same way again if I was OP, seems like that's his perspective too."
519,"My dog is a schnauzer, and she has her tail. A lot of people make comments about it, how weird it is to see a schnauzer with a tail. But she needs her freaking tail! She uses it to communicate to me, to communicate to other dogs. It is so much easier for me to understand her moods, to know when she is happy, nervous, or uncomfortable. If a family member took her to get her tail removed without my permission I would never speak to that family member again, and I might try to pursue some type of legal action. OP's sister is terrible."
520,"Well, your husband's behavior is far from that of a righteous Christian man.  
  
1 Corinthians 7:15  
*But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace.*  
  
Do not enslave yourself any longer to this man.
"
521,"I‚Äôm between jobs at the moment so I do probably 85% of the housework and all of the cooking now, there‚Äôs not much more I could do on that front, and you‚Äôre probably right that doing even more than that would just look like I was trying to dig myself out of the doghouse.

Unfortunately because of some family engagements there was no way to avoid each other this weekend, and she‚Äôs been pretty physically clingy actually. Just ... sort of emotionally distant, if that makes sense? So that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm confused also. "
522,"Absolutely right. Reading this, I was waiting for the husband to attempt to at the very LEAST comfort his wife and show a sign that he‚Äôs on her side. Didn‚Äôt happen he could be ignoring it because he doesn‚Äôt want to give her friendship up, or affection up for his own pleasure. It‚Äôs wrong."
523,That‚Äôs really fucking funny to think about. Not for the hypothetical kids though. 
524,God. Yes. They sound generally terrible.
525,"I think that couples who help each other during a non-team sort of game ruin it for everyone else playing, so when my husband and I join in a game like Catan I'm pretty concious of not showing him any favouritism because I don't think it's nice or fair to do that, especially to any singletons who are playing.

"
526,"Very much agreed. I'm glad I found out before we married and started a family. 

I would have to call and ask. I didn't purchase the ring from your typical chain store jeweler. I'm going to give them a call tomorrow during business hours. I unfortunately can not cancel the party. It is this Friday. I guess I could throw myself a party. 

I've started packing some of her items. I just need to get a lawyer asap to make sure it's fine for me to kick her out."
527,"This is all a lot of bad ideas you are saddling yourself with.

Of course you aren‚Äôt going to buy a house for him while he gads off back to school and walks away from a six figure salary. And of COURSE you aren‚Äôt going to pay mortgage payments on a house that‚Äôs not yours, right? Right?

And your mom and brother may be very trustworthy people but the reality is that of your name is on the paper, you are the one on the hook for the $. Now if you are buying the house as an investment and you are able to cover the payments and are mentally prepared to do that should the time come, great! Any other arrangement is a problem. "
528,how do you feel about talking shit to your parents. saying things like i can't even watch a movie without you wringing your panties in a wad. call them at 3 am WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU OK? ARE YOU WITH ANY STRANGE MEN? YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN CAN BE! you don't love your parents. you fear them. you fear disappointment. you fear confrontation.  
529,Don't give him another dime but don't expect to ever see any of the money you invested in his home either. He'll use the promise of future payment to bleed you dry.
530,"I agree, but is there a way to confront someone so that they tell u the truth rather than get mad and lie?"
531,"I read your post and your comments and it's clear that you do love him or deeply infatuated with him. That doesn't mean it's a good idea to marry him. Life isn't just about finding another person you love and then blindly follow them off a cliff. It feels like you have a Disney filter over your eyes and reality is a lot more grounded.

Marriage is 100&amp;#37; about respect. The age gap suggests he is into a power dynamic which is fine if you are also down. However, it doesn't matter if the other person is wealthier, bigger, older, smarter, or whatever. They need to respect you or the marriage will not work. End.

He is talking down to you to maintain the power differential and he definitely enjoys it. Until he respects you I suggest that you do not marry him. Personally, I think this is a terrible idea. He doesn't want to respect you and this is why he looked for someone so young. If I was to guess... if you pressed him about this issue and demanded respect he would dump you and find some other 18-22 year old.

Anyway, If you are 100&amp;#37; committed to marrying him (You Shouldn't)  then my suggestion is to grow into a respectable man. You are 21 and your entire life is ahead of you. Get educated, Get a good job, work out until you are fit as hell, get hobbies, master skills, and become the best version of yourself. These actions will give you confidence and make you respect yourself. If he still doesn't respect you then you know he is full of shit."
532,"That's my concern- if this is just part of his personality, then I don't think I CAN live with it.  I'm worried that talking about is going to make him defensive and not really change anything at all."
533,"OP you still feel bitter about your past and while it looks like you have moved on. Your interaction with his apology seems to indicate otherwise. 


While your ex-fianc√© has not sent anything malicious or hateful, the apology appears to be sincere and there is no asking for forginess or closure, he has apologised and moved on and you should seek therapy if you dont think you can too by your current feelings. "
534,"&gt; otherwise it's just Eat, Pray, Love but with a dude this time.

Ouch.  Accurate, but ouch.  "
535,"Since you‚Äôre an actor, can you think of attending the wedding as performing the role of being a supportive friend and give yourself some emotional distance from this? "
536,"They know why. 

This wasn't an accident. There's no way they can claim they forgot and now don't get why you're making a big deal. They deliberately have your husband a drug without his knowledge and with whatever the opposite of his express permission is. Has your mum apologised for not coming clean? 
"
537,The problem with that is it means op has to take on the emotional labour of planning 
538,"Does he roll a window down for you? Because I don't even leave my dog in the car like he leaves you.

He is cataclysmically rude, there is no excuse for this behavior, no matter how he tries to torture one out of thin air. Why on gods green earth would you put up with this?"
539,"""They asked so there wasn't need for a knock""

I don't understand this? I said they could have some cherries, not that they could come onto my property, especially while I wasn't home? How does asking for cherries give them that right? If someone told me I could have a cup of sugar I wouldn't climb in through an open window to take some.

edit: realised this sounds rude the way I wrote it. I'm sorry, not my intention at all. 

Edit 2: I only really have my mum I could take but she's had a stroke so isn't good with her words anymore. I might take her just for moral support though. "
540,"‚Äúi'm drunk as fuck and i made some bad decisions‚Äú

Nah, you made a pretty good decision based on a tipoff that turned out to be sound. Make another good decision and dump this guy. 

(For future reference, Tinder and I‚Äôm pretty sure Bumble clear your profile from the card stack if you don‚Äôt log in for a week. If someone‚Äôs showing up on there, it means they‚Äôve been active recently.)

EDIT: Maybe not on that last part, see replies."
541,"She sounds lazy.  That would not be acceptable to me. 

Are you guys planning on her being a stay at home mom? If so, my concern would be that she would put your kid in a bouncer and play WoW all day. This does not bode well for the future."
542,"Yup, the best thing I ever did was write down a list of abuse that my ex hurled at me. It seriously helped with the breakup whenever I started to miss him."
543,"That‚Äôs an accurate portrayal. Talking and even counseling hasn‚Äôt helped in the past. He‚Äôs not going to change now. 
Ultimately, I‚Äôd like her to realize that there is simply no reason for her behavior. We don‚Äôt have to be friends, but there‚Äôs no reason to not be respectful either. 
I can‚Äôt get through to him, but was hoping I could with her. 
The kicker here is that her degree is in child development and quite frankly, she should know better. 
"
544,"Op, I'm not sure if this is totally relevant, but my parents are just like this.

I will get into arguments with my parents, they will act extremely immature and childish. I will explicitly to show them why they are wrong, never with an attitude or vindictiveness, but just very factually. They will then resort to saying I'm being disrespectful, seemingly as some sort of defense mechanism to protect their ego. They won't acknowledge it after that, and just try to ignore that it ever happened, almost acting like they're doing me a favor for not pursuing the whole ""you're being disrespectful"" argument. It doesn't get better and calling them out on it of course just resorts to them saying I'm being disrespectful. It's obnoxious, I've lost boatloads of respect for them, and probably will go no contact within the next few years. 

Outside of that, they are nice enough. They don't tend to be abusive or anything of that nature outside of arguments. However, I can no longer take them seriously. Every interaction seems like a mask they put on, just waiting to bring up some past transgression they have to prove a point. I had an argument with them today where, when I was trying to respond to my dad's question, he kept repeating the same question over and over again so I couldn't respond. Like I said, childish. You may only see small bits and pieces of that now, but sooner or later the whole beast may unveil itself. It's not an issue of being frustrated in arguments, but the extreme lengths they will go to protect their insecurities and ego bleeds over into other aspects of life I've been noticing more and more. You may not have the same experience, and I don't want to give you bad advice just based on my situation, but really keep an eye on that. People like my parents become very good at projecting a sense of self worth and perfect-ness because that's their largest insecurity. They will often go to great lengths to protect that, and you may find yourself questioning whether you're really right or not. So many times I have had to find re-assurance that I'm not delusional or reading situations wrong because of how deeply rooted my parent's egos are. It's been extremely damaging to me, and I have to make a conscious effort to not do the same thing myself. It may just be a pride thing that is insignificant. You very well may be able to continue a perfectly healthy relationship and this was just a one off. I will say, though, if you start to notice these things again and again, I would get out ASAP. It's so manipulative in that masking it is fundamentally part of their defense mechanism. They don't even know they're doing it. It's essentially hardcore gaslighting, where they are so convicted that they know best that they will sooner convince you that you're insane or ignorant than admitting they were wrong."
545,"Especially considering student reviews are both quantitative and qualitative. One student leaving five glowing comments on each question is nice, but it's not going to outweigh the fact that the rest of the students rated you so poorly that you're now performing below average in terms of the numbers. I'm honestly struggling to believe this guy believes what he's been saying. If he does, then he must work somewhere very different from anywhere I've ever been or he must be confusing undergrad education with grad school (where having one rockstar student really might mean something.) But frankly, I think he knows he's selling OP a line of bullshit and is just trying to justify flirting with Karen rather than teaching his other students. 

I've never been so furious over a 'positive' update on this sub before."

Don't. These kinds of conversations are the ones you should be comfortable discussing with your partner.

Not something out of this world, but something to show that you appreciate the fact that he listened and that you love him and wouldn't want it any other way. We love attention ;)

&gt; So how crazy was i 

Not even a little bit. Could be he never had the opportunity to explore this much. It's going to be hard now that he is already 30. BUT, baby steps and you'll get there. He might even let you tie him up or something eventually.... I'm just kidding don't ask him to do this :P"

&gt; her career doesn't put food on the table (it barely supports her lifestyle as is) or provide for our family the things **I want to provide**.

&gt; **I want** to [...] provide a cushy life for my family. 

You are asking *her* to make sacrifices in *her* career in order for *you* to be able to provide for your kids in a way that *you* want to.  

Essentially you are saying that the things that you want to give to your (for now hypothetical) kids at some date in the future require that she crater her career in the very-real present.

And you're doing it because of:

&gt; the things that I was never afforded

So, in short, because your parents did not give you certain opportunities, you are feeling an obligation to give your kids a different childhood and lifestyle from the one you had.  And that's commendable; we (those of us who are parents) should of *course* strive to ensure that our kids have a life of as much quality as we can possibly give them.

But.

Quality of life is not *just* about money; having to consider going to an in-state school rather than an out-of-state one is hardly cardboard-box destitution.

I think you are putting *way* too much weight on the idea of money-as-success and money-as-happiness, and you are doing it at the very real expense of the stability of your current relationship.

Let me ask you this:  If you follow your career goals, and it costs you your relationship in the *now*, what happens to the dreams that you have of this family that you are planning on having with her and providing a cuchy life for?

This should not be all about what *you* (as a person) want; if this is a partnership (and it *must* be for the relationship and family to be healthy) then it has to be about what you as a *couple* want.  Which means that her desires have to be just as important as yours.  Her *fulfillment* has to be just as important as yours."

Sometimes people try to rationalize abuse by thinking the abuser is nice to everyone else so they must be at fault - if you sister knew how he treats you, she'd not let it fly, and she'd be happier if she got rid of him. Their marriage is strained because he's an asshole, and if she sees that he's an asshole to other people too, especially her sister that she loves, she may come the the realization that she deserves better. You both do. Good luck OP, you've come a long way, don't let that asshole ruin it.

There are a lot of people that don‚Äôt have that.

I mention my own case because if it makes you feel any better - at least you‚Äôre not me. :)

Also, it‚Äôs 2018 for goodness sake! Why haven‚Äôt you proposed to him? You want to get married. You love him. He is taking too long to ask you (your own words). What is stoping you from asking?

*Is it not sexist to think/believe that it‚Äôs only the man‚Äôs job to propose for marriage?* Can‚Äôt you buy a ring and propose to him? I thought you 20-somethings were woke... ya‚Äôll can‚Äôt stop talking about being woke for this, that, and the other thing... so what is happening here?

Edit: Your post reads as him needing to do something for you or consequences (he proposes or you end it), but maybe you are afraid that he doesn‚Äôt really want to get married to you?

Most people talk about doing something as wild as your friend, yet she did what maybe 1 in 1,000 have dreamed about and never do.  She should be proud to sit around with some beers and tell her triumphant stories of her POS rig, crazy breakdowns, and people good and bad on the road. And maybe when she thinks of her next big adventure, she will walk more confidently because she survived this.  So how bad can the next one be? "

You can buy a few basic ingredients for several different meals, and freeze  them. Throw them in the cooker, and it will be done at dinner time. This guy is probably going to complain about that though, cause he's criticizing your freaking knife skills, of all things, so yeah, that's a different matter. I do swear by our crockpot though.

I'm banking on him never experiencing your world, 24/7, for several days in a row. I would suggest he try that, but people like him are deliberately closed to that idea. He can't even tell you what he really wants, and that borders on gaslighting behavior to me. It's not full blown, but  it's that idea that he is presenting as rational, and getting upset that you don't understand. Clearly, that's ridiculous on his end, but makes it come off like \*you\* are the problem for not understanding.

Your wife used your niece to play out her own retroactive fantasy. This was 0% about what was best for your niece and 100% about what your wife wishes she‚Äôd done as a teenager.

And therefore you‚Äôll never be able to trust her around any underaged family members again.

The answer would be no. What about on the second date? Still probably no. Now take that punch down a notch to a grab or a forceful shove. Now how about after three months? Now three years? The point I‚Äôm making here is that violence starts somewhere, and it doesn‚Äôt always start with an obviously aggressive move. In fact, it‚Äôs usually something like what you just experienced. An abuser waits until you‚Äôre dependent on him in one way or another - you‚Äôre in love, you have nobody else in your life, you don‚Äôt have money. And once violence starts in a relationship, it will never stop until you leave or you die. Sure, it might seem better for a while, but that‚Äôs the upturn in the cycle. You can‚Äôt go back to the relationship you had before the violence started because it was a mirage.  

This might sound harsh or extreme, but I promise you it is 100% sensible. Don‚Äôt worry about how long you‚Äôve been with him, three years isn‚Äôt very long in the span of your lifetime. But a future of fear and hiding in bathrooms is not an ideal one. Take care of yourself."

First off, you made it very clear that you were planning to use the Internet, so they should have given you the low down on the data limits prior to your stay. They‚Äôre responsible for that one.

However, once it came clear that you were costing them significant amounts of money ($200 definitely qualifies), you should have stopped using their internet and found other ways to watch TV. It‚Äôs the polite, decent thing to do. You may be saving them money overall, but this is still not an expense that they anticipated or explicitly agreed to pay. And I love Netflix as much as the next person, but, well, it‚Äôs not a *necessity*.

That being said, you are not only saving them tons of money on dog care, you are also doing actual work (pool maintenance) that someone would normally get paid for. All while sacrificing your home comforts and receiving no compensation of any kind. So, the most strictly *polite* thing for *them* to do would be to just let you use the internet and shut up and pay for it, given all the work you are doing for them. 

But, the thing is, we don‚Äôt know what they can afford. Maybe they are being stingy with you, despite their fancy pool and huge vacation. Or maybe they scraped together their savings to go on that trip, and can‚Äôt manage any extra expenses. We just don‚Äôt know.

Edit: clarified last bit"
620,"I'm so sorry you're hurting. What a painful situation to be in.

I think when you're a teenager, sometimes you overlook behaviors that you would never accept if you were an adult in a mature marriage. Imagine for example if I told my husband every morning ""You'd better not hook up with anyone while you're at work today. I need you to prove it. Prove you won't be cheating on me."" What kind of marriage would that be? I love and trust my husband, I don't need that kind of verification from him.

Imagine if my husband and I had a disagreement. It happens, all couples disagree now and then. I'm not going to go out and take a sledgehammer to his car to hurt him, to show that I have the control in the relationship. That would be a crime, that would be a terrible thing to do. But it's basically what your girlfriend did to you. When a man punches a woman in the face, to show her who's boss, that's what your girlfriend did when she tore up the gift you made her. It's a control tactic. Your girlfriend wants you to be terrified to stand up to her. But a relationship needs honesty and love, not control and terror.

My husband has to travel for work now and then. I don't get upset, I don't demand that he follow a set of rules, I don't make him check in with me. Instead, I tell him how much I love him, and that I'll miss him. I tell him to try and have a great time, and treat himself to a nice dinner if he can get away from work for a bit. I tell him I can't wait to see him and hear all about it when he gets back. I let him know I'm here for him if he has the time for a quick call, and if not, I absolutely understand. I'm here to support him in whatever he needs, not badger him into doing what I say. We're a team, not rivals.

You need a girlfriend who is a true teammate, not an opponent. I'm so sorry for the pain you're going through. Someone who truly cared about you would never tear up a gift that you made for them. My heart hurts for you, thinking of the time and effort you put into such a loving gift, and having her destroy it in a moment of anger, simply because she felt entitled to controlling you. It sounds like you're a great boyfriend, and you can make another woman really happy. But it sounds like the girl you're dating now will never be happy unless you are in her full control. She's not a good partner or teammate, she sees you as a rival, someone she needs to conquer. That's not how we treat people we claim to love. Love shouldn't be a combat zone, it should be our safe place. She hasn't done much to give you a safe place in this relationship."
621,"Yeah, my husband went out to a local fair with a woman I've never met this week while I was out of the country.

But I was happy for him to because he told me about it, sent me photos, etc. Nothing about it was secretive in the slightest.

If I got home and happened to *discover* that he'd done the same without saying a word to me I'd have been bothered as fuck by it."
622,"Yeah, sounds like OP needs some physical and emotional distance to fully heal from the breakup and move on with his own life."
623,"When they come to visit, you tell them what time you will meet up. Plan parts of the day when you won't be with them or responsible for them. You don't have to attack them, just be direct, like with the racist comments or if they are rude, ""That was a rude thing to say. I'm not going to discuss that."" Call them out every time and then try and change the subject, if they won't stop, end the conversation and leave/hang up etc. Set lines, communicate directly, and follow through. Consistency is key and hopefully once they figure out they can't strong arm you, they will adjust to meet your expectations. "
624,"&gt;He blew up on us, telling us we abandoned him and how the dog is better off with him than us.

Do you have any other friends who could show up and re-possess the dog immediately? If not, I would consider calling the police and asking them to take the dog into their possession temporarily.

Forget about the relationship - this guy has already burned it to the ground with his behavior."
625,"I am asian. In my experience i feel asian ppl tend to give thing or feed them without other intention. I live in the building there is Thai old man lives. Everytime he seems me he asked me if I want eat something. He is owner of restaurant and he always try to get me food. And after I finish food he just let me go.  This kind thing happen only in asian culture. 
Not just only old man, I met some good looking young guy who just like to treat me for dinner without any intention. I never seen this kinda thing from western guy. Of course guy try to take me dinner cuz he has intention to sleep with me. One he know this never happen they not gonna just try to feed me for free. But with asian guy, they know nothing he gonna get but still they try to feed me."
626,"You need to stand up for yourself, you are and adult and if you keep backing down to avoid conflict he won't respect you. It's time you renegotiated boundaries with him. "
627,"I would tackle this pragmatically and emotionally. On the pragmatic side, encourage her to do research and prepare for parenting - consider such topics as the general 'what to expect' type stuff as well as other potentially troublesome spots like breastfeeding, sleep training, discipline approaches, creating routines, etc. She may just find that if she arms herself with a lot of investigation and knowledge she'll be more confident. On the emotional side, remind her why you feel she'll be a great parent, how her education will help, that you'll be by her side, that you'll tackle the difficult stuff together, etc. 

If she retains this fear after all this, and it is really debilitating / preventing her fro moving forward, she should consider a few sessions with a therapist to get to the bottom of it and figure out what traits specifically she is worried about making her a bad parent. "
628,"A well adjusted 42 year old would not want to go to a college party..

I guess try to put in perspective how pathetic his behavior is. Just end this. FWB is FWB. There is zero commitment. Just stop putting up with this BS. You owe him nothing."
629,"I feel gutted after reading this. Absolutley gutted. I feel your rage and grief and get it 100%. What your sister did was a such a *violation* -- literally &amp; figuratively. And for what -- some twisted sense of satisfaction?  I'd cut her off cold and make sure *everyone* knows why. I'd post the incident on Facebook in detail, with photos of your sad pup. I'd tag your wretched sister and the vet who performed the operation without verifying that she was the owner. Forgive? Not in this lifetime. She's a hideous human being who intentionally caused you &amp; your puppy pain. Who needs a sister like that?!"
630,This is called an affair. They‚Äôre already having one or they‚Äôre about to.
631,How many phone numbers do you know these days?
632,"&gt;The way OP should approach this is asking them to say she is not a *suitable* donor rather than telling him he is not a match.

Oooh I like this"
633,"&gt; beard

i thought op and bf lived together"
634,"&gt;If that's the case then I wonder if OP and her husband would fill if they opened their ""relationship"". 

If they don't want to be a miserable couple at home, they should first become friends at least and be able to communicate about what they want from their ""relationship"" before involving others."
635,"You know what stood out more to me?

That you go over to his house 90% of the time. 

Ask yourself...  what is this man bringing to the table?

Or was he just the first guy to say he wanted to be your boyfriend? "
636,[removed]
637,Get the abortion and then get a new boyfriend. Some things can never be unsaid. Double up on protection in the future.
638,Have you talked to her about training her dog or having someone come over to walk him/ play with him during the day? 
639,"So you are married to an abuser.

Why would you want to pretend that you are not?

It's not time to sweep this under the rug, it's time to get out of this abusive relationship."
640,"He may not be excited about getting married (having a wedding), and that could be fine. What you need to figure out is if he's excited to be your husband. Friends of mine got married after 10 years together. Honestly, I think most people didn't even realize they weren't married yet. They did it super chill - called it a wedding-themed barbecue, did it on the lawn at her parents' place out in the country. But let me tell you, when she came down that ""aisle,"" he was *bouncing on his toes*. He was so excited to marry this woman, even after 10 years. And you deserve nothing less than that same kind of excitement."
641,"I want to quickly say that you shouldn't feel at all guilty or terrible that she had to respond to you, it's nothing you could have known and I'm sure she knows that- I appreciate your empathy in thinking that though, because yeah, most of us have experienced death and sending messages like that in grief certainly can feel a little redundant in the light of tragedy.   


I wouldn't say it's over the top to send a card and/or flowers. She would probably appreciate that a lot, to know that you are in her thoughts. If she has any fear that you might drop her as a client if she's unable to work for X amount of time because of this, that would put her mind at ease too. I think that if you go with the card option, be slightly careful about what you might write and what the card already says.   


People deal with death differently and a widely used pre-written sentiment might be nice for some, but not for others. I'd go with a condolence card that has no text, and write something like:   


'Client's name',   


I'm terribly sorry to have heard about your loss. I hope that you are coping as well as you possibly can at a time like this, and that you are surrounded by friends and family. Please know that you can take all of the time that you need you properly grieve.   


You are in my thoughts,   


'Your name'  


If you're too worried about what to write in a card, perhaps send flowers with a short attached note that says something like 'sorry for your loss'. "
642,"She spoke with OP because she said she believed he wouldn't judge her, but knew everyone else would. She knew what she was doing was incredibly wrong but still didn't stop, even when he advised her to. This is more than just a simple mess up. She may not be a terrible person, but she did a truly terrible thing with far reaching ramifications. "
643,"You know it's weird as hell that he ""refuses"" to introduce you to his family, right?  The only way that makes sense is if they're abusive."
644,As someone who was talked into staying it causes resentment. Most of the problems didn't get worked out or got worked out and we're good for a week or so and then feel right back into the old ways. I think the relationship has run it's course. It might hurt but it sounds like you guys aren't right together
645,"So he instead taught his brother how to disrespect his partner and not be there for her in a time of need.

I'm sorry for your loss. Focus on yourself and find support with friends and family. Deal with your so called bf when he is back and you're ready."
646,My thoughts as well. We live 3 hours away from our small hometown and the people he told so there is no way they would be knowledgeable enough of our daily life to ask so specifically if this even my occurred without him telling them. I never once thought this was an unreasonable expectation of him but now with his family joining in I feel gaslighted and betrayed. Then they always just follow up by stating the thing in question shouldn‚Äôt be something I should be embarrassed about and when I say that doesn‚Äôt matter they tell me I‚Äôm acting ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù and looking for things to be mad about. 
647,"Have the police accompany you to go pick up your things.  It sounds like you are at risk of harm if you go alone.  See if they will go with you, he will probably back down."
648,"&gt;This!!!  You having a mentoring relationship because of shared interests with your NEICE that has been encouraged and facilitated by her parents is perfectly normal unless there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre not telling us. 

The niece is actually incredibly lucky. Not everyone gets an opportunity like this. For the girlfriend to demand it stops is almost criminal."
649,"Even if you two are fighting and dislike each other in the moment, you shouldn't be dating someone who takes that to mean that they hate you and want to hurt you because you are fighting."
650,"OP there is literally no way she doesn't know about the affair with the way she is acting now. So your husband lied, again. "
651,[deleted]
652,agreed. i don't understand how someone hurting himself like this could possibly be seen as a good or mature thing.
653,"Agree with your advice here. Except I would also add

&gt; Of course, you could talk to her and see if she'll be willing to give up partying for every other weekend and do a date night instead, but it sounds like she's just being the typical 20 year old. 

She‚Äôs *already* cramming her studies in so she can graduate early, and I‚Äôd bet money that decision is influenced by her SO being 25 and in the working world. So she‚Äôll already be missing out on a lot of the college social experience, relative to other students, (at least partially) for his sake.

Asking her to *halve* that seems unfair, and bound to result in resentment (especially if she later ends up regretting rushing through college).

OP, either learn to be okay with your GF‚Äôs schedule without putting more pressure on her, or end the relationship and find someone in your own stage of life to date. You chose to date a college student (or to be more accurate, a *highschooler* at the time). It would be cruel to pressure her to lose out on even more of her fleeting college social life."
654,"Seconded.  I have met some great car salesman who were stand up people, but also others who lie and manipulate.  Sounds like his wife just did it right back by

1.  Doing her homework.
2.  Walking away to make them sweat. 
3.  Looking good while doing it. "
655,"Your girlfriend is an idiot. It's okay. There's room for idiots in the world. But you need to stop letting her walk all over you with this stuff - you're only going to build up resentment. Don't just go quiet. Don't let it slide. If she wants to participate in adult conversation, she needs to handle being wrong sometimes.

On the flip side - do you think there's more you could do to make her feel less insecure about her smarts or knowledge? Or just generally make her feel comfortable when out with your friends. She's acting out of some impulse. See if you can together address the root cause of this silliness."
656,"Your wife sounds great, congrats on saving $10k. "
657,"Your husband is not a good man. You used so many excuses about ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù and how he‚Äôs a ‚Äúman‚Äù which none of that is acceptable excuses. He‚Äôs feeding you such bull shit. 
As for your sister, if you have been married for 7 years, and he‚Äôs been helping she was 13. That‚Äôs nasty to have feelings for her and messed up. It‚Äôs sick. ‚ÄúNo benefits‚Äù from taking care of a teenager?!? What the actual Fuck. No. It‚Äôs just sick and not okay. Absolutely not. "
658,"&gt;he‚Äôs ‚Äújust trying to prepare me for life, which is hard and mean.‚Äù 

Next time tell him the only thing hard and mean about your life is him.  

&gt;if I want to make adult decisions, I should be able to deal with being ‚Äútreated like an adult.‚Äù  

This cuts both ways dad. If you can't treat me like an adult, then I'll make the adult decision to minimize my contact with you. 

You may not approve of my decisions, but that doesn't give you the right to belittle them. You can love and support me even if I make poor choices, or you can live without knowing what they are. 
"
659,"Why would she even know you have a locking box unless she's trying to steal things from it?  You can even be honest. ""I noticed the other day at home my stuff is disappearing.  I think someone is breaking into the house and taking my expensive make up.  I was going to set up a camera but thought this was cheaper.""  The camera thing should scare her too.

Keep your handbag with you at all times, even in the bathroom, too.  "
660,Very succinct. You‚Äôre right. Thanks
661,"They clearly will never support you financially or emotionally, so what's the point of maintaining a relationship with them? Like, what would you miss out on? Being yelled at and getting to watch your sister be loved? "
662,"I'm sorry, I'm not being sarcastic, but I am having trouble understanding why you're really upset at the guy. For all intents and purposes he was just a random guy correct? You only later found out that he was kind of dating your friend so you're upset you all had a threesome without them mentioning that?"
663,"I think part of it is just maturing a bit. 

She was with the ex in her early 20s, right? I know in my early 20s I though the perfect relationship would be all passion and spontaneity. I thought stability would be boring and giving up and that without the PASSION (really fights where we both ferociously defended our side and there was very little compromise) then it wasn't real love. 

I was a fucking idiot hahaha

Now in my early 30s I know better. The kind of relationship that lasts is stable. It's comfortable. Being able to depend on someone isn't boring. It's fucking amazing. Compromise isn't a lack of conviction or emotion or passion, it's realizing that the other person's view is valid and they deserve respect and consideration. 

I'm willing to bet a decent amount of money this has a lot to do with your situation. "
664,"and you don't see that as Emily being inconsiderate?  She knew you already had plans with Dan's family that day, and she couldn't offer you a specific time until immediately before??"
665,"Stop playing by their rules! You are an adult and not living with them, I assume you pay your own phone bill? Call her ONCE a day, not 12 times after every move or bowel movement. I feel so sorry that you had to deal with that after being away from your phone for 4 hours but this is really the consequences of complying with your moms crazy calling before you do everything rules. Your mother has a crazy anxiety issue she needs to get in check. "
666,"He says that it would be a waste for me to continue school. I was saving up for school stuff when I started working for him and he talked me out of it. 

I don't think I can stay. I do love him, but I am miserable, and I miss my family. "
667,"&gt;Not sure what to do.

Really? You're not sure? Dude, you're rounding 30. You're old enough to know better."
668,"&gt; I'm a sensible girl

""Sensible"" people don't fuck married people and then act shocked when they refuse to leave their spouse, but I digress. 

This guy is an asshole, but you're not innocent either. You've created a huge fucking mess. 

You don't sound like you're in any condition to raise a child. And he's not going to be any help to you (even getting child support with him in another country, probably denying it's his, is going to be a huge problem). You'd be doing it on your own.

You're worrying about losing a guy who was never yours who's treated you (and his wife) terribly, when you should be focusing on what choice you're going to make regarding your pregnancy. 

While, honestly, I find it hard to have sympathy for someone who would knowingly have an affair with a married person, you should talk to a friend/family member you can trust to be there for you through this. Because you can't count on him for anything, and you shouldn't have to do this alone."
669,"I have so many thoughts here. First if you've been in your job for 20 years in Silicon Valley as a systems analyst you are probably a hundred percent underpaid. That is not an exaggeration. if you actually want to make more money and do something where you don't work what it sounds like is hourly, or at least the bonuses are somehow based on you staying later, you should be looking for another job. You should have been looking 15 years ago frankly if you are as ambitious as you seem to be. That's just not how the tech job market works. Raises are useless, everyone knows this. Job changes are the only way to make increases above the cost of living index. It's not 1960. 

That aside, your situation does sound very crappy. I suppose cynically I don't feel that bad for you that you married a trophy wife and got a trophy wife. The Stereotype on marrying a model isn't that they become magically hard-working friendly mom types. I'm sure there are many former models who are wonderful sweet wives and mothers but that isn't 
the stereotype I think of. And it's not the one you got. it's not normal even for a former model to have a dozen pictures of her just herself on the wall. And it's not a normal relationship for you to basically ask permission to do things like change where you live or exercise or have a birthday party. If you're bringing in all the money and this is such a problem between you why is it all going to her still? 

At the core of your question is do you deserve a birthday party. Sure, yes. You deserve that. you also deserve to not be treated like a piece of s*** with a bank account. but her ""grow up"" comment, I think the only thing useful in that phrase is that you do need to grow up and stand up for yourself like a grown man. If you want to stay together and get some therapy, but I for one wouldn't stay with a partner who treats me like that."
670,"Just reading this was exhausting, I can't even imagine living it. This is supposed to be your wife, not a child that you have to track and read their messages to make sure no-one is grooming them. She is jeopardizing her marriage to get attention from this dude. And why are you acting like physical cheating isn't still going to happen?

&gt; During the following two workdays, messaging between them was perfunctory, however they met daily at his or her behest. He was off for a few days and she said to me ""this break will do us good.""

Nooooooobody talks about a work friend like that. Nobody. This isn't a red flag, it's Mars. "

If you were my husband, I'd tell you to go ""find yourself"" and don't come back. "
672,"I picked up on racist with the ghetto and Chris Brown remarks. You sound like you're knocking it out of the park every day with their daughter for the last six years. Her dad loves you, enjoys time with you, and used personal connections for your benefit (ha-yooge one there).  I guarantee her antics make her look progressively more and more shitty. She's hanging herself. Just let her keep wrapping that rope around her own neck."
673,"We're pretty good at splitting up the work in the house, but areas where I excel are in areas of personal finance and stewardship of important things. She was doing her cursory job and when I offered to help, she jumped at the chance to go and do something else. 

The emails (and there were a lot of them) seemed to focus on our personalities - he is a social butterfly who can't be alone and has seemingly endless friends and contacts where as I am friendly and outgoing but nowhere near as socially outgoing or connected. Many were about how she was at a cross-road and me was ""settle and give up"" her lifestyle and him was ""continue being free and fun"". She chose me (ultimately) but a lot of it was about how she felt about making this change and how she was ""giving up"" so much. "

Wait, will the Chinese even let you into Tibet?  Do you speak and/or read any of the relevant languages?  Do you understand that a land under siege by a much greater power is not going to tell you anything other than the official ""truth?""  Also?  Unless something scarily dramatic happens while you are there, you won't see any interaction between religion and politics *because Beijing--THE ONLY PLACE THAT MATTERS--doesn't allow it.*

I wonder...how many of these places you intend to visit are in First World nations?  Are you going to interview a lot of French people about their pattern of Catholic-through-high-school then secularism-for-life?  Or only picturesque places like Nepal and Tibet?

Don't do Poverty Tourism.  Don't use Second and Third World people as props for your ego.  Being poor doesn't hold secrets to enlightenment and happiness.  

**Studying poor and oppressed people is creepy.**  It is **condescending.**  Seriously, the Ick Factor is just off the charts here."
676,"There's nothing really wrong with getting pleasure from rejecting those that wronged you when they reach out to you. However, it's coming from an emotional place where you still feel like that bullied little girl. You'll get past it when you realize that you're not that little girl anymore. You're a successful person and it sounds like you have your life together. It's not worth your time to expend any mental energy on those that wronged you earlier in your life. You have too much good stuff going for you to waste that time and mental energy. "

90% of why we stay with people that don't value us can be answered in this quote. It is my favourite quote, I remind myself of it everyday. "
679,"You're the side piece.  No one in their right mind acts this way, unless he/she's cheating on their partner.  Please rethink this whole situation.  He's a cheater.  He's pond scum.  He's less than pond scum."
680,"My recommendation is to stop focusing on semantics and start focusing on behavior and actions.

When he used the term life partner for another woman, you told him why it made you uncomfortable and he apologized.  That's resolved.

I think what's causing you concern is his friends' behavior and his behavior towards them.  You described it as acting cagey.  This is something to discuss and you have a right to know what that caginess is hiding.  Were they sexual partners?  Did they commit crimes together?  Why are they unfriendly towards you?"
681,"That's what I've been doing. He considers it's rude of me, and that I'm mistreating them for not wanting to spend time with them.  


Still, coming back home in the evening is depressing."
682,"Wow, that's a real jerk move and I'd be pretty angry at you in his shoes. 

What you need to do when he comes home is first and foremost offer him a very sincere apology. Acknowledge the effort and expense that went into his plans, tell him you're sorry you made it all go to waste by being an ass, and promise you'll do a better job of being appreciative in the future. 

Once you've done that, it's your turn to go all-out and set up a really nice, fancy date. Do all the planning, get him something nice, take him somewhere you know he'd love, and enjoy spoiling him. "
683,"This is definitely a real phenomenon- people who, when they get upset, want to see that same energy reflected in the people around them.  I find it to be bizarre, but it‚Äôs common enough that I know it‚Äôs A Thing.  The only way to deal is to walk away when someone‚Äôs actively trying to get a rise out of you."
684,"don't give him the option.  He does not respect you, why respect him?  Just send him a break up text and immediately block him, no contact, don't give him the opportunity to manipulate you into staying."
685,Fairly positive the reason the advice is so angry and black and white is most of the people in here aren't that happy. There's a good chance they found this sub because of a breakup or relationship problems and that leads to bitter advice and all the misandry and misogyny. 
686,"As a geneticist I'll just note that ""genetic testing"" as a blanket effort can never guarantee healthy children. A large fraction of human genes still have no annotated function. Spontaneous mutations also arise in every gamete to the tune of several thousand per genome. There's no way to know that your baby won't draw a random harmful allele.

Now: if one of you has a specific family history of cystic fibrosis or huntingtons or something, then it makes perfect sense to check and see if you are carriers for those conditions. But for recessive disorders (most genetic disorders) it only makes sense if BOTH of you are checked. 

TL;DR: if he thinks he can guarantee healthy kids through genetic testing he is mistaken."
687,"At 22 what are you doing gifting a boyfriend a $1200 gift.  Most couples discuss a reasonable range.  If my daughter gave her gf a $1200 gift I'd have a long conversation about setting expectations, etc.  And giving someone a gift with the expectation of receiving something in return, without ever having had a simple conversation about it is foolish"
688,"You are still incredibly young and have so much time to find someone who will love you unconditionally! so don‚Äôt let the falling out with your ex define your worth. 

Also, we‚Äôre all proud of how strong you are and how quick you are to protect yourself and do what‚Äôs right for you! Wish you luck and I hope your ex finds it hard to sleep at night when what he lost dawns on him! "
689,"You said you wanted to get out of your town and she‚Äôs letting you stay with her so you don‚Äôt even have to pay for a hotel. 

Among my friends and family it‚Äôs the houseguest who takes the host out for dinner and cooks meals as a thank you to their host - honestly I think you splitting every check instead of picking up a meal or two is much more rude. She‚Äôs the one dealing with the imposition of a house guest and it doesn‚Äôt sound like she begged you to come visit against your will or anything. You chose to visit her. "
690,"Unfortunately, it *has* come to this, and she's the one who brought it here.

2. Does *not* believe you are a liar, but is willing to falsely call you one out of solidarity with her friend (in which case she's worth *no one's* time)

691,"I dunno, the thought that I potentially exposed my child to a predacious individual would keep me awake, along with wondering about how long he groomed her.

OP is obviously not culpable here, but I understand the parental guilt that might be at play here."

693,"Opposite sex friendships can be tricky in and of themselves. Add on a pregnant wife and a female friend who doesn‚Äôt respect marriage and this outcome is less than surprising. 

How much is this friend relying on you for support? I understand wanting to be there for her but at the same time, I would NOT be cool with my husband being this woman‚Äôs support structure and I‚Äôm not even dealing with pregnancy hormones. 

She‚Äôs not automatically a terrible person or up to anything wrt to you but you are putting your wife in a really bad spot. It‚Äôs natural to feel threatened by an opposite sex friendship where the opposite sex friend is a known mistress. Regardless of how faithful and loyal you are. She knows for a fact now that your friend is okay with sleeping with married men. That‚Äôs going to fuck with 9 out of 10 wives. I know it would fuck with me. It introduces a new dynamic to the friendship because she can‚Äôt trust *her* regardless of how much she trusts *you*. 

"
694,"So I left this out of the original post but she also made it clear that if my life plan had been to work at the restaurant that I currently do (like it was my passion or something) then she would have broken up with me already.  She says its because she sees a lot of potential in me and I know ""love doesn't pay the bills"" but I really didn't expect that."
695,"Seriously, even just for him it‚Äôs an extra 10 hours in the car. Maybe $20/hour is reasonable for him but certainly not once you add OP‚Äôs time and expenses. "
696,"Kinda sounds like he doesn't want to restrict *himself* with a commitment, but he's trying to get *you* to bring him around like he's your boyfriend.

The fact that he keeps bringing it up despite you saying no, and now he's getting ugly about it, I'd probably be done. If everything else is excellent and you're hesitant to cut him loose, maybe try being direct. 

""I'm not comfortable inviting you to hang out with my friends because we aren't dating. I prefer to keep my sex life separate from my social life. If that's a problem and you think we should stop seeing each other I understand."""
697,No it's not weird at all.  it's not like it's some random 13 year old..it's your niece.  Your gf sounds creepy.  FInd a gf that is more supportive of your family
698,"I like how you immediately jump to the conclusion that she's a controlling and bad person, when it seems pretty obvious from your story that your friend hides things from his wife and does things he knows she doesn't like, behind her back.  That is on HIM if he is choosing to lie to her and sneak around, instead of being honest about what he does and doesn't want to do.  Your buddy is a hypocrite.

And it's not that he isn't ""allowed""...it's that he's choosing to be part of the ""ask permission, get permission"" dance they are doing.  He DOES have the ability to say no, he just chooses not to.  He is just as responsible for how their relationship is as she is.

And besides...it's his marriage, not yours.  You don't have any say in how they run their life.  If he is as sad as he seems, then talk to him about how you can help....but unless he chooses to grow a spine, it's going to stay the same way."
699,"As someone who teaches, thank you, thank you, thank you.  It is utterly unhealthy that I keep seeing so many kids who come to school without strong male relationships in their lives.  And it is utterly destructive that so many men are driven out of teaching by the suspicion of ""Why would a grown man want to spend time nurturing children unless his penis is involved somehow?""  Ugh.  Children need a variety of kind, loving, healthy men in their lives.  Not all relationships are sexual."
700,"&gt;That's so cool. We always wanted to go to the Maldives **but didn't wanna go alone**

This is so weird to me. A married couple going somewhere are not going on vacation alone! Haha! That's one of the perks of marriage, *companionship*.

Anyway, tell her this is a romantic trip for you and your husband. You're both looking forward to spending time together and reconnecting. It's not a group or family trip, but husband thinks it would nice to plan a family trip with them next year or so. This softens the blow.
"
701,Don‚Äôt give him anything! 
702,"Yes, you should react calmly. Because you're a grown up. Yelling is never necessary."
703,"&gt;like she says those things all the time, 

i'm SURE she doesn't say this all the time, it's STILL a huge problem  and you confirm my theory , you are normalizing this crazy behaviour.This is NOT normal."
704,"yeah this seems a bit more extreme than just ""I don't like OPs boyfriend because he considered joining law enforcement"", especially since so many people have dropped OP out of their lives because of this"
705,You know when you hear about mothers killing their babies?  Or themselves? It‚Äôs often because of post partum psychosis. Your daughter has lost touch with reality. She needs to be hospitalised now for her own safety and that of her family. She literally cannot tell what is real and what is her paranoid fears. Call an ambulance and/or the police. Best I‚Äôd call your local mental health crisis team. Do this now and tell them what you‚Äôve told us. They‚Äôll know what to do. 
706,"Why in the fuck are you friends with an obvious creepy loser? You need to seriously reevaluate your sense of boundaries and danger. Why are you doubting even for a second that what he‚Äôs saying is shitty? Why are you hesitating to cut off this dangerous-soundinf motherfuxker who is clearly trying to pressure you into sex? In a really toxic, transparent way? 

I‚Äôm not being rhetorical. Examine yourself and see why you are giving so much benefit of the doubt to a man who amounts to a big walking red flag. "
707,The fact that he's known the sister since she was 13 makes this even creepier...
708,"It‚Äôs disturbing how he talks about the sister as if she has no free will. Her feelings on the matter aren‚Äôt important, of course she would marry him if her sister died, he‚Äôs a big strong man. I bet she would be majorly creeped out that this man she has known and trusted since she was a child feels this way about her. What a disgusting person."
709,I hope you dumped that cheeseduck. 
710,"&gt;no way to compromise

Nope. All you can do is date someone who does.

Sexual attraction is a fragile and inexplicable thing. He's not to *blame* for what he hates. (He's to blame for the way he worded it though, sheesh, what an asshole)"
711,"He wants to sit on his ass and call it a gap year like some teenager living on his parents dime, rooming in their basement. Grown men/husband's don't do crap like this!"
712,Can I Venmo you for cheap champagne? Not even kidding. 
713,"I agree with him, he IS a terrible boyfriend. He has some major issues and zero self-control. Maybe several years of therapy could help him, but you should not stick around for that. He put you in danger both because of his driving and by leaving you in the middle of nowhere. Something terrible could have happened.

Please break up with him. (And if you don't, at least never go in a car with him again until he has had those years of therapy.) And since you are afraid he will blow up again, you don't owe him a face to face conversation. Figure out the logistics of how you can leave / separate while keeping yourself safe. If you don't feel ready to break up yet, at least leave and stay with family and friends for a few weeks if at all possible to think and process what happened. 

You can leave him a written letter or send him a message later, saying that what happened was unacceptable, he put you in danger. It was pure luck your sister was able to pick you up, who knows what could have happened otherwise. Then say you are leaving permanently or ""for a while"" because you are currently feeling unsafe. And he needs to deal with his issues, whatever they are. 

Also, since I have a very low tolerance for ""road rage"" behavior, I would be tempted to call the authorities and report him for speeding and wreckless driving - but not until I was safely away from him."
714,Reading that story about the kid with the coconut oil allergy is fucking heartbreaking.
715,Omg please call the cops and tell them what happened. You were sexually assaulted. 
716,Nope. The allergy could get worse with exposure and an itchy mouth and throat could become a closed throat and suffocation. 
717,It‚Äôs possible to shower your body without washing your hair. 
718,"&gt; It is not a permanent arrangement... 

Lol the hell it isn't. "
719,"If it‚Äôs only Sunday‚Äôs, can you stay with a.m friend from Saturday-Monday. Do this for a few weeks. Let him handle his bad mood himself. And then tell him he needs individual or couples counseling.  His choice. "
720,"Came here to say this. You owe no one anything, especially an explanation. Focus on yourself and if he changes go from there. If not, you are not responsible for his life. 

There is a reason on an airplane they tell you to put on your oxygen mask before assisting someone else. You can't help anyone until you help yourself. 

Don't beat yourself up. Keep doing better in your own life. 

Good luck!"
721,I vote you hit up Marie and take her out to dinner. She sounds like the kind of person who could be a great friend.
722,"I'm canadian and you are completely right. Native is the worst thing she could possibly be to move here. Open racism towards natives is not rare and is barely even hidden, and horrible systemic abuse towards them continues unstopped and unquestioned to this day. It is unbelievable how bad shit is for them here. 

I have no doubt that her and op's quality of life in terms of social safety net and safety in general will improve and she should def follow her dream but oh my god the racism she's going to experience. "
723,"If my boyfriend wanted to marry someone else, for any reason? I would be out of there so fast his head would spin. ""I don't want you to marry someone else"" is a reasonable relationship requirement. Run. 

A) I don't believe him B) Marrying someone for financial reasons is shady and weird (and, again, I don't buy it for a second).

&gt;  BF is also very scared that I would take half his stuff if we got married even though that is not and will never be my intentions.

This toxic attitude about women/marriage would be enough to have me running for the hills. I've known guys who think this way. They don't like women. (Has he ever used the phrase ""divorce rape""? Bonus points in the ""Fucking run"" column if he has)"

726,Your bf is awful. dump him. 
727,"&gt; it will probably be higher than hers

If this is true then she absolutely needs to find a different job and quit working at your company.   If you two work as a team there is no reason that you should get a larger bonus than her."
728,Korea is the best market in the world to teach English as a second language. I second this.
729,"The other issue is that, the company you keep says a lot about you as a person.  It really doesn't say much about you if you are still extolling the virtues of this women to your pregnant *wife* while she is understandably horrified at this womens behaviour.  You seem to be justifying her staying in your life because you feel so sorry for her being found out be be sleeping with someone elses husband.

You are directing your sympathy towards someone who slept with someones husband, on an ongoing basis, and assisted in breaking up a family, rather than to the people who were collateral damage to the affair.  The wife of this man and those poor children now have to live with the consequences of their selfish actions.  And there you are trying to champion to your pregnant wife how she isn't really like that and that she made a mistake.  Well she *is* like it, this was not a one time mistake and if I was in your wife's shoes I would feel the same way.  Your sympathies are grossly misplaced."
730,Contempt is the death knell to a relationship.
731,"Okay, so in addition to accusing her of cheating, you also basically said, ‚ÄúIs there any way I can get out of this?‚Äù So even if you convince her that you don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs cheating on you, you still have to convince her that you have any level of interest in having a child. Because ‚Äúis there a chance it‚Äôs not mine?‚Äù also basically means ‚Äúis there a chance I don‚Äôt have to raise it?‚Äù"
732,"Your boyfriend is being a jerk. Even \* if \* you were stalling on purpose... he shouldn't be shoving you towards sex you are even a tad bit hesitant about. That's not nice or considerate. His foursome sex is coming before your work, your comfort and he's acting like a child about it. Gross. 

End it. "

734,I'd say drive/laziness is a major part of personality
735,"Oh for god sake. The number of times you have posted these supposed cries for help. 

Your ‚Äúbf‚Äù has a wife and a child. What did you think was going to happen - you thought he would leave his wife for you? 

You have always just been his play toy on the side and to be honest he is probably bored of you and moving onto his next catch. This is not the kind of guy you should want as a bf - even if you are lonely. 

You are young and attractive - go find a nice single guy to date. "
736,I was going to write something almost identical in that I've bruised my wife's arm a couple times by grabbing her to avoid her getting hit by a car.  She was very surprised the first time because A. she almost got hit by a car and B. realized how strong I could be especially with regards to her safety. Unlike OP there was NO question as to what happened and why it happened.   In OP's case it is obvious her BF has issues as you wrote. 
737,"Dude. Dump this immature asshole. There's nothing wrong with you. It's your partner who doesn't take responsibility for the way he acts and doesn't even TRY to improve himself for YOU, he just passes the blame on someone else.

741,Exactly. Technically they drugged him. Why? Did they think it was funny? Dan is a drunk and can‚Äôt stand to see someone else get sober and has to undermine him? They would be long gone from my life. 
742,"This is some of the only good advice in this thread. If OP doesn't want  him to care about her affairs, don't vent to him about them. If she wants to be able to vent, then she needs to accept that the person she vents to will have an emotional connection to the topic.

If she wants to use him as a friend, treat him as a friend. If she wants to use him as a fuck buddy, treat him as a fuck buddy. But don't ask to use him as a friend and treat him as a fuck buddy."
743,"Let's forget L for a second. The main problem is that your boyfriend allows his friend/roommate to be nasty to you. He not only won't stand up for you but expects you to kiss her ass until she's done being a jerk? Yeah no. In fact it sounds like he's not very nice to you, either. Why are you putting up with either of them? "
744,What would that accomplish?
745,"Talk to them: ""Hey, I wanted to be a good neighbor and share the cherries on my tree with you when you asked for some. I assumed you wanted to be kind, too, and meant to pick a few cherries from the walkway side of that tree. You probably noticed that the garden is locked. I have a dog and neither want him to go missing nor attack people who are entering my garden.   
Last night, a neighbor told me that you entered my garden and stole all of the cherries. I am very upset that you didn't take ""some"" cherries as we had agreed upon but completely stripped my tree naked of all cherries. That's not okay and I feel you significant betrayed my trust. As a result, please don't ever enter my garden again or take cherries from my tree next year, not even from the sidewalk. If you do, I will consider it theft and press charges. I trust we can move past this some time."" 

It might not be the most diplomatic thing to do, but there's just no way to 'negotiate' here. You don't negotiate with terrorists whether they are 2 year old toddlers or fighting for ISIS. Because: some people don't understand kindness. So you have to be firm and clear. Everyone who is somewhat sane doesn't take EVERYTHING when they were given *something*. "
746,"While ethically I think saving the nudes is worse, I think using the FB pictures is worse for their relationship (and I think that is what people are saying, rather than meaning they think saving the nudes is fine).

Like I'd expect my SO to get aroused by naked pictures of his exes despite how unthrilled that would make me. But if just regular pleasant pictures of their faces got him really turned on, well I would find that a lot more surprising, in a bad way.  "
747,"I'm like this. I know myself, and so I'll ask my bf to hold off on a major or emotional conversation if I'm already mentally exhausted from work or life. I don't think I'd make him wait days or anything, but I will ask for some hours. If he allows that, he gets a better ""me."" It's on ME to let him know when I can come back to the discussion, so I don't ever say ""later."" That's rude. I give him a specific timeframe, such as after dinner or after I watch a show to unwind. Maybe this could be a compromise for you two?

That being said, your story shows that you tend to make heavy conversations REALLY heavy. It's hard for some types of people to deal with that, especially a year out from the hypothetical issue. I'd rather gnaw my own ankles than drain myself on a hypothetical, maybe, what-if type of discussion. Your feelings and emotions are valid, but maybe you could handle them in a way that meets him halfway? 

"
748,"You shouldn't convert just for the convenience of it. Don't let anyone pressure you. Do what you feel is the right thing to do.


Just a side story, my DH is a Muslim and I'm a Christian. We never even  discussed about converting to Islam or Christianity. I respect his beliefs and support him in his religious activities (like during Ramadan). He does the same with me (like when it's Christmas). We never discussed converting because we don't want to change a fundamental aspect that made us who we are now as a person. This works for us but may not work for other couples. I think it is good that you are both discussing this this early on so you can both decide what you ultimately want before investing more into the relationship."
749,"At 29 he needs to understand the concept that the smallest number on a list of flight prices is not going to be the cheapest option.  He's trying to make you cover the monetary difference (gas, wear and tear, cost of rental car if he were driving himself), but he's not even thinking of the cost in time.  Even if you were to do this (DON'T!), that's 20 hours he'll be sitting in a car instead of at the reunion, working, doing anything else.  To save $200?!  That's only 10 bucks an hour!  His time has got to be worth more than that.

But obviously, don't drive him because this is well outside the bounds of a favor.  I just wrote the above because it's a request for a favor which makes no sense for anyone involved, including him.  I am also so curious where you live!  5 hours is SF to LA almost!"
750,"What came up first? It's honestly really selfish to choose the conference over the wedding IF you had already agreed to attend the wedding. It sucks, but that's what obligations are. Like yeah, you're entitled to do whatever you want with your life, but that doesn't mean you don't affect the feelings, plans and expectations of other people.

However, perhaps you could talk to her brother and see his opinion on the matter? Maybe he would be fine with you going to the conference, which would be awesome. But the whole attitude in this thread that's pretty much like ""fuck it and just do your thing!!!"" is pretty cringey. "

I can't believe you agreed to move in with this guy. I would make learning to clean and demonstrating in his own place that he is capable of keeping it up a condition of moving in together."
754,You said you told him you wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable moving in with him if you weren‚Äôt engaged??

Do you feel used?

758,"she fought for you foo, you better stay with this chick"
759,"It would be a weird ""joke"" to pretend Santa was real and carry it on this long. 

What's even weirder is for her to honestly believe it. I mean...there are no words. 

This would be a dealbreaker for me. "
760,"Yes I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean to come across that way but it reads as though she feels she is owed sex and is upset he said no.

He probably realized he was into your friend at some point after the threesome. He also knew if he had sex with you that would end his chances with your friend. So he said no. And he is now in a relationship with your friend.

It sounds like you were into this guy and angry he turned you down.  If you continue to ignore him, then it will affect your friendship with your friend. Look at the bright side. If you did have sex that night and he ended up in a relationship with your friend, you will feel even more awkward than you do now.

If anything your friend should have been upfront that she was into him and not used you as a way to get to him. I don‚Äôt think he deserves your anger. Your friend is the one who acted poorly in this situation. "
761,No dude. Just no. Stupid grownups dont believe in vaccines. Stupid (or immature) 10 year olds believe in Santa.
762,"She didn't tell him she ""didn't want a gift unless it was an engagement ring"" because she is being petty. She did it because he has consistently got her hopes up in with his lack of social graces by using signals that usually indicate a pending proposal. I mean, a photoshoot one time and insisting family be present another time - those are pretty classic proposal signals.

She didn't say she wanted only an engagement ring either. She just said she wanted nothing at all if a proposal wasn't going to happen. At this stage, he just keeps pushing the timeline back farther and farther. She's allowed to set expectations for what she expects a reasonable timeline is for marriage and break up with him if he can't stick to that timeline. She doesn't have all the time in the world to wait for him - especially if she wants biological children."
763,"Write her an email - 

""Hi (name), I wanted to write to let you know that unfortunately, I won't now be able to be a bridesmaid at your wedding. 

You'll remember that I told you right at the beginning that I had a budget of $400, and since then I've been dealing with getting over an injury, so things are even more difficult for me. It seems that your celebrations are now going to be much more lavish, and so I'm going to have to regretfully stand down from being in your bridal party.

I hope you have a wonderful day and that the wedding is everything you hope for.

Wishing you every happiness,
Strawberry Stewardess""

(She's being completely unreasonable, of course)."
764,"&gt; I'll sometimes walk around the house in something revealing, sometimes just a plain t-shirt and my panties, but he'll usually turn his head or if he has to talk to me, he'll just look me in the eye. 

He is trying to respect you and your body by not ogling you or groping you since you are *not in a relationship*.

He might not be attracted to you because he's not in love with you.

He might feel as trapped in this arranged marriage as anyone else would.

You guys need to talk about what you want from this. Are you just married on paper and have your own lives and relationships on the side, or are you both going to put in an effort to actually be in a relationship?"
765,"Dude, I'm jewish guy myself and I swear some of these moms are dead set on the guy being jewish as well,I have no clue why.

766,"Yeah I hate the ""blame the spouse because the affair partner doesn't owe you fidelity"" crap that's spouted here too often.

The job of the listener is to truly take in what the talker is saying and try to keep their attention on the talker. I start small 30 seconds each way and build up. It sounds like your GF may need practice not talking. Also if the talker doesn‚Äôt talk, the listener still has to listen. They can‚Äôt fill that space.  "
768,Tell her what you saw and stop playing games. You know she is actively hiding things and lying to you. Time to call her out on it. 
769,"Two things. 

First, is it your plan to live the rest of your life with zero contact with your ex? If so I see no need to return the gift to him. Simply throw it away. By returning it to him you are making contact with him. You are sending him the message that you are so angry with him that you would rather not even receive gifts from him. There is no need for this. This person is dead to you. Whether or not they know how angry they made you shouldn't matter to you, because who are you now has absolutely nothing to do with them. 

Second. You should consider forgiving your ex, at least in your own heart and mind. You don't have to tell them, you don't have to know them but you should try. Forgiveness can be an integral part of healing and moving on. ""holding on to resentment is like drinking poison and expecting it to kill someone else"" as the saying goes. 

Although if you are genuinely worried about your safety that is another matter. I'm not sure what advice to give in that situation, except to say that a single wedding gift wouldn't be enough proof for me to think some one is stalking me.  "
770,Make sure you‚Äôre at least keeping a record of how and when he contacts you and how you‚Äôve told him to stop. Hopefully you won‚Äôt need to use it but if he escalates it will be helpful. 
771,"Normally, I'd say 11 years really isn't terrible. You're both adults, so whatever.

But, you've known her since she was 8 and you were 19. That makes it creepy, to be honest. "
772,"I don‚Äôt think you are overreacting at all. What D did to you was incredibly mean. Considering it was your birthday and the mean stuff he said, I‚Äôm impressed you didn‚Äôt throw a drink in his face or something. Tbh I think you handled it well!!

I also think your BF has handled everything well so far! I would maybe bring up that D never apologized and decide how to navigate the friend/business partner situation together and what D and your bf‚Äôs relationship will look like from now on. It seems like your BF doesn‚Äôt want to be friends with D anymore but it may be hard to separate the business part immediately."
773,"Life is too short to police your own behavior like that. She'll notice what you're doing anyway. 

  I'd just be open about it. You will probably get an angry reaction out of embarrassment. But friends like this, I've learned not to walk on eggshells or try to socially engineer a specific reaction. If you have to do that they're not that good of a friend. 

  So best to either call it out or pull back in general."
774,"I agree with this. I think OP should suck it up and go. Be there to support his friend, and yes friendship is all they've ever had or will have. So since their social group overlaps, it before for him to deal with this reality rather than avoid it.

Bring a date (romantic or a good friend who knows your situation) and make the best of it."
775,You both sound insane.
776,"See, the thing is, people who self-aggrandize often exaggerate their accomplishments. It's perhaps a white lie from her, but the pattern of what you've told us shows that she really inflates herself. I don't mean to say she's some evil liar from hell! I just mean she has some traits that are close to unemployable... I'd bet they can be fixed if she faces her anxieties about what you and others think of her. "
777,"Building off of this OP. I would say express it to her in a way she knows you really miss that dynamic, but try not to pressure her. Also, only bring up your ex if directly asked why you have this fetish."
778,"You exist for a lot of reasons, but being a broodmare for your father isn't one of them. Your relationship isn't less-than just because there's not a marriage cert attached to it. LOTS of folks never get married but spend their entire lives together. Are they less committed than a couple who gets married, then divorced? Of course not! There are lots of ways to live, with or without marriage and with or without children. Do you even want kids? Have you ask yourself that? You are not failing  your father, no matter what anyone tells you. There are fantastic reasons to have kids - earning parental approval is not one of them. 

There are a few things you can do here: 1. Establish boundaries. When anyone who isn't you/your partner brings up lack of kids/marriage, refuse to discuss it. Change the subject, tell them ""I'm not talking about this right now.""     

2. Work on valuing and loving yourself and your life for what it is. Stop focusing on what it isn't. You'll get there when you get there, and rushing something as huge as marriage/kids is just a horrible idea. 

3. Remember that we are not all meant to be the same. It's okay not to want or have kids ever. It's okay not to want marriage or get married ever. Remember that you have been gifted one single and short life. It's YOURS. Live your best life, whatever that looks like for YOU. Real family loves us no matter what. Your real family will love you no matter what you choose. Work on developing a thick skin and deaf ears. Become a brick wall and let them wear their voices out talking to it. Good luck - I know this isn't an easy burden. But as someone who lived her life for everyone else for 30 years, I promise you, rebellion is worth it. "

780,"What happens to your friend when her incompetent husband gets sued by someone whose car he messed up?  Being married to him might get her sucked in to the liability issues, and would essentially ruin his ability to provide for his family. What if he looses their house or their vehicles in the fall-out?  

Even if the worst happens and your friend decides to divorce her husband over this...she gets to make that choice.  It's not your fault that he's incompetent and negligent.  That's all on him.  And it's her call if she can live with a husband like that.  And two, when this all blows up in his face, which it will at some point, if she's divorced from him she'll be protected from the shrapnel of financial ruin he may find himself in.  "

783,"I'm a bit more worried about your SO's behaviour than Blue's, he shouldn't be enabling her shitty behaviour so much."
784,"I had a pretty similar convo with my SO recently. My SO opened a message on snapchat from a girl that had flirty emojis (in the message). I told him that's a red flag to me because I immediately knew this wasn't an innocent girl. He makes it clear to her that he has a girlfriend.

Lo and behold, a few days later she tells him ""you just seem really cool and fun to hang out with."" He's feeling cautious and makes it clear that they can be *friends*, but that's it because once again, he has a girlfriend. She gets pushy about when they can hang out so he noped out of there and deleted her (and showed me).

OP's husband is not showing this kind of respect."
785,"Exactly. OP's husband is in no way responsible for her mental health. I think they should keep their relationship purely professional from now on. Also, not necessarily helpful to OP, but if some chick was grinding on my husband and giving him long hugs and doing all that stuff in front of me, I'd seriously question my husband and immediately cut her out of my life."
786,"She doesn't have to be projecting. As I'm another self-righteous liberal (now just liberal), it could be simply outrage at a ""wrong being done.""

The problem of course, is that there's no wrong here, and she doesn't believe you. By trying to ""save"" you she's disrespecting your boundaries stating that there's nothing wrong.

You could give her a last chance and ask her, what would it take for her to believe that you're ok? But if she continues to disrespect your own agency, then let her know that's why you can't hang out with her anymore.

Self-righteous people (from anywhere on the political spectrum) are exhausting."
787,"I would bet money right now that if he quits his job, he‚Äôs never getting another one. He‚Äôs either going to sit around the house playing video games all day while not ever doing one household chore/cleaning up after himself, or he‚Äôs going to start a string of businesses that he quickly gets bored of and abandons.

This is going to turn into the marriage equivalent of ‚ÄúMy cousin fell on hard times, so I let him, his baby and his girlfriend move into my house until they got back on their feet. It was supposed to be for 1-2 months, but it‚Äôs been over a year. They‚Äôve taken over my house, their shit is everywhere, they never help to clean anything and don‚Äôt contribute financially. And they just ‚Äòrescued‚Äô a dog off of Craig‚Äôs List that‚Äôs not housebroken and that I‚Äôm allergic to. How do I get them too see what a burden this has put on me and that they need to find their own place?‚Äù "
788,"Yeah I was appalled at his behavior long before I got to the part of the story where he actually abandoned her. Any of those one things alone would be more than enough grounds to end the relationship, and all of them together makes this 10000% inexcusable. 

OP, if my partner did even one of these things (act pissy, blame me for something he decided to do, drive recklessly, blow up on me when I asked to use the restroom) he would have immediately apologized and felt awful. This is not because he‚Äôs some kind of saint (because he certainly isn‚Äôt) it‚Äôs because any normal human is able to tell immediately if they are acting in a way that is cruel to their partner. The issue is that your boyfriend knew that ENTIRE day, from the moment he woke up, that he was being unfair and cruel to you, and he simply didn‚Äôt care. He only cared enough to apologize hours after the fact, when he had done something he realized might be unforgivable. 

You said at one point that the screaming at you in the car wasn‚Äôt the point of the story, but honestly it should be. Had he not driven off without you you still should have seriously been questioning staying in this relationship, because treating you the way he did all morning is totally unacceptable. The fact that he literally abandoned you at a random rest stop cause he was slightly annoyed he had to drive for a few hours is just the cherry on top of this shit sundae.  I really really hope you find a partner who treats you right, because this one is not giving you what you deserve. "
789,"&gt;Your friend is doing exactly what she is accusing your boyfriend of doing: refusing to respect your sexual boundaries and personal autonomy. 

Well said"
790,"\&gt;She wouldnt be with you for this long if she did. 

Yeah you'd be surprised. People stay in relationships for lots of reasons, not all of them are good."
791,I second this. 2.5 months is nothing how/why tf did you move in together so quickly? Was it after like two weeks of dating???
792,"Okay so:

1) I think your biggest issue is that this should be about HEALTH, not about looks, and she needs to get in that mindset. How you'll accomplish this, I'm not totally sure but I think it would be worth thinking about and attempting to approach. Have you guys talked about why she has these body issues at all? Has SHE even worked out why she has these body issues?

2) I think maybe you need to sit her down and say ""(girlfriend), do you know that I love you? Because I love you very much. Since I sit at a desk all day my body is not getting the work out it needs during the day, if I don't get good workout habits going now while I'm 23 then when we're older I won't be able to do things with you that I want to. I want to be in shape now so I can stay in shape as I get older both for myself and for you."" Make it about self care, make it about wanting a long and prosperous life for you both, make it about bettering the relationship. And make it clear that it's something you want for yourself, it's your version of relaxing. Something like: ""I know after a long day at work you want to come home and relax, I love knowing that when I get home from working out that my beautiful partner has had her chance to relax and enjoy herself in our home. How can I help you learn to enjoy this time for yourself without feeling like you have to be doing the same things I do? I go to the gym to relax but I know that's not always how you want to enjoy your time after a long day at work and that's okay because I just want you to be enjoying your time off like I get to enjoy mine!"" Maybe she's just feeling like she's not doing enough, and needs a reminder that YES! It's okay to want to veg on the couch instead of going to the gym after being on her feet all day.  

3) As for her having this issue of you going more than her or whatever, maybe you need to point out to her that she IS working out as much as you, she's just doing a lot of that at work. Would it be possible for you to sit down and point out what kind of workouts she's doing at her job? Or find a way to frame it so she can see that you sitting all day vs. her on her feet walking around/lifting boxes/etc. means she's being more active than you for a large chunk of her day? Maybe framing it this way will help her see that your not really MORE active, just active at different times and in different ways. 

4) As for the food thing, maybe you guys could do meal prep one day a week. She gets foods of her choice and you get yours, and then you guys also have more time for each other during the week that's not cooking. This way you can each make foods you like (you can have chicken and she can have salmon or whatever) and also do some things that you both enjoy that pair well with your protein choices (like veggies you both like!), you get to spend a few hours in the kitchen together hopefully having fun, and you're still making those healthy choices together without limiting yourselves food wise. 

5) It sounds like you're partner is dealing with a lot right now. Depression, body issues, she definitely seems to be struggling with her own self confidence, etc. Have you talked therapy at all? I know a lot of people are against it, and I try to understand that, but she really needs to work on some self love. It sounds like you see this great woman who's sexy and hard working and totally for you, but she doesn't. That needs work. That's not necessarily a ""you"" problem (although to be fair maybe there are things you could be doing too, idk because I'm not your GF). If you can discuss this option with her, if it's an option for you guys at this time, I would try to. ""Girlfriend, I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I see this stunning and powerful woman, I'd really love for you to be able to see that too. Do you think you would be open to the idea of talking to a therapist? I think if we could find you someone who fit your personality well that maybe you could begin to see just how wonderful you are. I appreciate you so much and want to make sure we're taking care of not only our physical health, but our mental health too!""

I hope any of this helps even just a little. Also, as a caveat, don't say any of the stuff I suggested if you don't mean it. &lt;3 Best of luck. Update us in a few months, I hope you guys find your balance. Above all, keep taking care of yourself. At the end of the day your health and well-being does need to be your first priority, I think there's some stuff you can do to try and get her on board but that will ultimately be up to her to do, you can't carry her through everything you know? So keep going to the gym and doing what you want for yourself, just maybe try and help her find her best self along the way where you can. 

Edit: I forgot to add: that statement about ""who are you trying to impress"" SCREAMS ""I'm insecure and not confident in myself,"" and is a larger part of the reason why I think she needs therapy. She doesn't think she's ""good enough"" for you to want her, and that needs to be addressed. It's manipulative and uncool of her, but it's also stemming from some issues within herself that need work. "
793,"Breaking into your exes house (you broke up, you having the keys does not give you the right to enter his private place at will, you should have contacted him) and then making a scene in front of his daughter is pretty fucked up.

796,"Sometimes people get things they don't deserve. Don't screw it up, OP.





On the other hand, don't beat yourself up if she breaks up with you anyway. From your update, it sounds like she's checked out and ready to leave, she's just scared to- she may one day find that courage, and jump ship. As another poster said, one weekend of hysterical bonding does not a stable relationship make. If she does leave, do better with the next girlfriend. And for Heaven's sake, don't lose your passport."
797,OP listen to this dude this is the crystal ball of the future 
798,"Dude.

You had your wife investigated.

WTF is going on?

Your wife won't take no for an answer according to you. Will she take ""yes"" for an answer to marriage counseling? Your office hours are going to make it tough, but start seeing someone. 

Your complaints and your feelings are valid. But you also act as if you basically had no say in ANY of these decisions. Surely, somewhere out there, there are books and therapists and other things to teach you how to communicate your needs.

Let me tell you:

Your needs are valid. Your needs are valid. YOUR needs ARE valid!"

800,"These are the very questions, aren't they.

The fact that OP thinks that he cannot complete this journey with his wife along is the thing that makes me believe it's escapism more than it is anything else.

If it were, as he says, purely an academic journey of discovery, then he could do it with or without her there; either they could discover together, or she could go off and do other things while he's making rubbings of cartouches or whatever.

But the fact that he's unwavering about the need for this to be done *alone*...that's what those of us in the ministering business refer to as a ""clue""."

803,"I am so glad you did what you did and so glad you called your mom!  As someone who left a similarly dysfunctional relationship in the past, I know it is so hard to just move on without that person.  I recommend reading up on narcissistic personality types and morbid jealousy.  It really hurt me to learn more about what happened to me, but it also helped me to understand it and see it for what it really was, which was a huge factor in my being able to move on.

Cry as much as you feel like and be as sad as you want to, this was a real relationship, even though it wasn‚Äôt a very good one.  You are allowed to be sad, but don‚Äôt fall back into old habits.  I really do think you need to block him.  Unless you still have things that need to be retrieved (and I don‚Äôt think you should do the retrieving) you don‚Äôt need to talk to him anymore.  He is going to keep going back and forth between sweet and salty just see what gets your attention, and he isn‚Äôt going to just give up.  I know part of it feels good, because it‚Äôs like you have some small amount of control over the situation now, but trust me, being free from the burden of his calls will feel SO much better!

Good luck with everything OP and congrats on getting out and taking back control of your life!"

806,That‚Äôs a very efficient way of handling things and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre husband appreciated it. I just feel like some things are not anyone‚Äôs business. For instance I have a GED because I was homeschooled this used to greatly embarrass me because I thought people would judge me unfairly. If people asked if I had a high school diploma I would just say yes (I suppose in the strict black and white morality of my husbands family it would make me a liar but unless you‚Äôre an employer you don‚Äôt have a right to that info). Now I not only have a bachelors degree but I‚Äôm in med school so it‚Äôs clearly not a question of intelligence or motivation (not saying this is why people get GEDs but it was what I feared people would think of me) and I have no problem telling people. Everyone has some chapters in their life they‚Äôd rather not have read out loud to everyone they know. 
807,"Yeah, I agree. They're babies - young enough for it to be good for them to get exposed to everything and the people be good for them. The smoke isn't good for them, and I certainly wouldn't ask her to pet sit anymore. "
808,"I think if you have pets you need to be prepared for the costs that come with them. This is also on you for relying on a quick, cheap fix, as much as it is your friend that you trusted.

Keep in mind, you were imposing rules on her behaviour *in her own home.* I can't imagine doing that to someone without offering some form of monetary compensation. While I totally understand your disappointment, you made a huge imposition and didn't really have the right to, imo. While your friends will always enjoy your pets, you're the only one who will take their care so seriously. Your friend probably meant well but doesn't feel that same way. That's why you need to pay people to treat your pets the way you want them treated.

I think, if it's important to you to share your disappointments, you should also take the time to acknowledge that your request was unfair. 

I say this as someone who's owned cats my whole life, has fostered, has baby sat pets, and had my pets babysat as well. I think you need to take more responsibility for how things transpired.

ETA: Kittens are no joke. At three months old they're little monsters than can fuck themselves up, or your shit up. Beyond socialization, they require boundary enforcement/training. You should have absolutely just ate the cost of a professional. "
809,"If he was nervous he should've been honest about it. This dodging around running errands was a very poor way to handle it, and it understandably hurt OP's feelings.

Obviously he's not obliged to have sex with her, but OP isn't obliged to give a second chance to a guy that flaked on her."
810,Focus on your child and get the hell out of this relationship. It started when you were really young and you did not know any better. But this is the hard truth. 
811,I'd move out first and then tell the bfs wife
812,"I would tell them next time I see them that, yes I said you could take some cherries, but that you did not intended for them to take all and that you would not want then to take in the future.

813,"Almost like
Gaslighting "
814,"From your post, it seems like you have full custody of your daughter since she only just connected with her father recently. If this isn't the case, you need to get a lawyer and make sure that you either have an agreement with her father that you have full custody or a court order saying so. This isn't to say that she should never have contact with her father, but that you get the final say over who has contact with your daughter and under what circumstances. I wouldn't allow him to have any unsupervised visits with your daughter until you're convinced that he will do everything in his power to protect her. Given the way she was treated in his home, that may never happen. However, it's your job to protect your daughter from everyone. If her father can't or won't do it, then he shouldn't be allowed to visit her without supervision. "
815,"We live together in his house. He is home every night. That's not to say he can't be cheating, he certainly may be. "

817,"I know you probably don‚Äôt want to hear it, but I get where your GF is coming from. What happens if you break up? What happens if this is longer term for her and you leave on awkward terms? It could also influence the way her coworkers see her if her boyfriend works with her and is a little too boyfriend-y, for lack of a better term. Working together is hard on a couple, and she has valid concerns. While she shouldn‚Äôt have encouraged you, it‚Äôs good that she was honest with you about how she felt and how it made her feel. Is it worth making her uncomfortable over a job that you fully admit isn‚Äôt for more than two months, if there are other possible options? (Surely other places are hiring and you haven‚Äôt only applied to one other job.)"
818,"yeah, I'm gonna add on to this, that you guys should probably do some aftercare. it's pretty common after bdsm stuff to get some pretty wild emotions, and that's exactly the kind of thing that aftercare is supposed to provide a cushion for. #domsneedaftercaretoo"

For every once in a blue moon couple who truly love each other, there a couple dozen stories like this: young people who have suffered since they were too young to legally drink bc grown ass adults wanted an easy victim. 

(Which is NOT to say that OP is in any way shape form or fashion responsible for her abuser targeting her. Children/young adults should be vulnerable and should get to be as young and dumb and naive as they naturally are. The fact that we have to teach young people, and particularly young women, how to locate and evade murderous, sadistic predators is heartbreaking.)"
838,"This is such a sad situation. 

You are absolutely not the one who is being unreasonable here. No good friend would expect their friend to shell out so much money when they simply don't have it to spare. Of course you should prioritise your health and the other costs you have around just generally living your life. 

In my view, even if you were a millionaire it would be unreasonable of your friend to demand that you spend any particular amount of money. It's rude to dictate to people what they ought to spend in order to attend a wedding. 

Your friend is also being a bit of a coward here by pushing the responsibility for all of this onto her MOH. It is her wedding, it's her job to deal with this. 

It will most likely end your 'friendship' but I think your only choice is to pull out. There is no way you can enjoy this wedding and it's silly to spend money you don't have on a friendship that is pretty much ruined anyway. "

842,"So you could not clean the furnace room because you were watching your kids, but you also did not notice that your wife had done some of it while watching the kids (I presume, since you were not home and there is no one else she trusts to watch them)? If your wife is able to manage to do both but you say you cannot I can see how that could be annoying to her. I can also see how it annoys her that you didn't even notice what she did when you litterally had to walk through an impacted area, and that when she brought up that she did some of it you did not immediately thank her. She went above and beyond to fill an area in which you slacked a bit and you were not appreciative. It actually sounds like you really do not appreciate her contribution much at all; you want to take the stipend and have her go back to work and find it frustrating that she doesn't want the same thing. You place the responsibility for having helpful friends on her. You seem to blame your performance in bed on her lack of sex drive. You ascribe to mallice what could easily be kindness and feeling unappreciated when you accuse her of setting a trap for you. You also that you daughters are averagely demanding but then say your second daughter has a disability that the Canadian government is willing to give you a stipend to help cover the cost of her care; they do that because she requires extra and/or more specialized care than the average child. Show your wife some appreciation (in a way that makes her feel appreciated, not just a way that makes you feel good) and I bet everyone in your family will be happier. "

Oh and if your just going to respond to me with ‚Äúget off my post since you won‚Äôt help‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not your problem‚Äù spare me. 

Furthermore, don‚Äôt tell someone they don‚Äôt know the full story or didn‚Äôt read all the details, when you didn‚Äôt provide much context. We know very little about the situation, and still people try to chime in, just for you to laugh them off. 

I personally am not gonna offer any advice on what you should or shouldn‚Äôt do, considering I don‚Äôt have much knowledge or expertise in this area. I wish you good luck, but I think the way you are handling this post‚Äôs comments is immature. 

The way you handled the top comment is the only one I thought was good in terms of people telling you it‚Äôs his choice to end it. Otherwise you seem to think this is all a joke or an excuse to be rude to people. I‚Äôd recommend you seriously look at how you‚Äôve been replying to people."
848,This man is going to kill you if you stay.
849,"WARNING: I've been in your shoes. This guy **will** try to win you back. Block him or else you'll get lovey dovey texts, I guarantee it. Or verbally abusive ones, or ones threatening to hurt himself if you don't reply. Abusers only operate on 3 channels: charm, pity and rage."
850,"That was my thought as well. I knew from the first sentence that he was going to get all sorts of advice ignoring the fact that they‚Äôre teens in an LDR. Is this relationship unhealthy? Yes. Is this supremely abnormal behavior and a sign that his gf is evil and manipulative? Nah. She‚Äôs 17. In a few years she‚Äôll probably look back and be ashamed of many of the things she did at 17. 

EDIT: Oh she‚Äôs 14. That changes this all even more. "
851,She clearly still likes him. She didn‚Äôt conveniently stop when y‚Äôall started dating. 
852,"This. 

If you have a fire, you call 911. If you have a medical emergency, you call 911. Then you call or text your partner. 

It's fair to ask him to be more responsive, but sometimes, people are out of reach (family emergencies have existed long before cell phones made us as accessible as we are now). You need to know how to act like an adult without your partner being there every moment."
853,"Yep. Because sometimes you need to GTFO NOW. I can't count how many threads I've seen on this sub about a poor woman (and a few times, man) who was being abused but didn't know how to get out because they had no place to go and no money."
854,"Yeah, I feel like this is weirder than everyone else is making it seem. Why would someone else's receipt be at your house? That's weird. "
855,Spend time with other people. They're dealing with the same things so they understand. Pool your resources. Plus it just helps to pass time if you have other people to talk with. 
856,[deleted]
857,"The response I just got from him was ‚Äúanything you need to talk about, you can text me‚Äù "
858,"Planned parenthood are your friends here.

Also, do some research: if he's not your attending dr, *can* he access your records, as a parent? Isnt that a conflict of interest? Also, call the insurers. I bet they can find another practice.

I have to say, if he won't prescribe the pill for agonizing periods, he's a shit doctor.

And, you need to look into how the hell you will be insured once you do turn 18, because clearly this cant continue"
859,"Agreed.  
This was my schedule until last May for four years. It‚Äôs rough for her. 

If you‚Äôre feeling left out, then talk to her constructively about making the most of your time together. But definitely don‚Äôt make it all about you, because odds are she‚Äôs feeling strains from all directions. "
860,You have good enough reason to cut her out of your life. Your life will only get more complicated with her in it. 
861,"Just stick to the facts and the law (i.e., those portions of your order or agreement requiring cost sharing). Become so boring that trying to engage with you and bait you into arguments isn't worthy their time. Hopefully, she'll give up after a while and find some other source of drama. 

&gt; The kicker here is that her degree is in child development and quite frankly, she should know better. 

My mother was a child psychologist, and I think probably a good one, but it didn't prevent her from being just as flawed as any other normal parent. "
862,"I think the only person who's been extra shitty is your friend. Bloke has basically done nothing wrong. 

I think you are angry at your friend but love her too much that you are transferring the anger to Bloke."
863,"Kill 'em with kindness!

This is the best answer. /u/bklove1 ... you're marrying this guy, which means his parents are going to be people you'll have to, at least on a surface level, get along with. Refusing to let them visit your home is going to score no points with them. But being welcoming and loving ... that's going to do better."
864,"we don't know op's situation.

he might be in a different country. He might be too broke to go. He might need some sort of approval to get in"
865,"Yeahhh...

You set yourself up for this one, and it backfired hard. Please don't take your mistake out on your boyfriend or the relationship."
866,"Bondage is consensual. This was not. There is NO justification for his behaviour - he pretty much thinks he's entitled to fuck you any time he wants. There is no ""making him stop"" - he clearly doesn't have the same set of rules as normal humans so he won't care. "
867,"Lazy ass troll.

So he *just* got tickets? In Russia. To the final itself. ""conditional tickets"". Right. Sure. That's exactly how it works. Just like that. And you are going to find the money for a flight and hotel. And take time off work. And throw away the non-refundable cost of a wedding. And irritate all your friends and relations. And wife.  Oh, and you are *such* a mega-fan, yet you didn't consider the date of the final when planning the weddng. Yeah, r/thathappened

"
868,Dude is not ready to marry anyone right now. That much is painfully obvious. And neither are you if you think you can somehow change his personality. You can‚Äôt. This is what you would be choosing the spend the rest of your life dealing with.  
869,Have you tried getting her name tattooed on your chest?
870,I've considered it. I know he has had long-term girlfriends before (posted on his social media that his family is not involved with) but it doesn't mean he couldn't be. 
871,[deleted]
872,"You should tell the owners plainly that the family is going to freak out.

You should also accept that if the owners going to base their willingness to rent to you on something outside of your control that you might not get this place and have to look for another. And that your parents will know what you're up to and may try to sabotage your efforts"
873,"You were part of these ""locker room talks"" as well, right? So why do you judge him? You're just the same kind of man you don't want for your daughter. But you were her role model growing up. Go figure. "
874,"It's not necessarily a nice gesture. He wants closure and instead of finding that within himself, he's reaching out again instead of leaving her alone. It's like needing to have the last word. If he treated her so shitty, he needs to stop contacting her and leave it at that. Don't reopen old wounds. Not to mention, it's *very* strange that he bought something off a list that he had no business looking at in the first place.

I do agree that OP can donate the gift or regift it, without saying anything to the ex."
875,[removed]
876,"This! If you were the 31 year old dating someone who was 14 years *older* than you, your relationship would still be unhealthy and abusive. But the fact that he preyed on a minor in a vulnerable position really concerns me.

What do you get out of this relationship, truly? "
877,[deleted]
878,"This isn't a misunderstanding. My neighbours plum tree overhangs my garden and every year I ask him if I can have some, every year he says yes. I get bag fulls (it's a waste to let them fall and spoil) and I always take a bag to him. I also bake him a plum crumble to say thanks, I tried making him jam but that didn't work. Her neighbours are greedy and took advantage, not only that they climbed over locked fences to satisfy their greed. I'm amazed all the people here saying it's a misunderstanding - who would really think it's okay to climb over someone's locked property and steal every last cherry? "
879,"Ugh, my ex spent $100 on flowers for an anniversary. Yes, I acted appreciative, but I was internally screaming inside that he spent that much on flowers. At a separate time, I brought up that I really like flowers, but cheapo grocery store flowers are just as good as ridiculously overpriced arrangements (in kinder words, lol)."
880,"Even without the whole reason you posted this, your boyfriend is the worst. No excuses. He sucks. Trash tier. Pick whatever last straw you want. They all work."
881,"&gt;she says she didn't want to reveal her role to protect our relationship with my brother and also because she thought Emily was fine and didn't want to sabotage her life by sending police to drag her back home.

Translation:  ""I knew what I had done was wrong but I didn't want to get in trouble so I didn't own up.""

That kind of behaviour (ie, ""I hid what I've done because I was scared of the punishment"") is the kind of thing I'd expect from someone Emily's age. Not an adult. Your wife has shown a shocking lapse of judgement, and not one I think you should forgive.

She encouraged Emily to put herself in an incredibly dangerous situation. She watched your brother and sister-in-law go mad with worry. She lied to you when you asked if she knew anything. She kept silent, and then deleted the evidence of her involvement. I think she's only told you now so she has a chance to convince you to stay before the police, or your brother find out. And when they do find out, and they find out you're still in a relationship with the woman who encouraged your niece to run away from home, they will cut you both out of their lives forever."
882,"We might give it a try. We'll see. Even he suggested it, but he told me to go into my savings to pay for that, and I said ""If you have enough to support your parents for 10 weeks, you have enough to invest on us.""

Thanks! That's great to hear. She's not OK with boundaries at all, she's not used to people confronting her or being assertive. She sees all that as aggression, and my husband defends her."
883,"Cool... now have an adult conversation with her and enforce some boundaries.

""Listen mom, it's really not your business when Husband is working or not.  He's doing what he's supposed to be doing when he's supposed to be doing it, and you sending him frequent messages about this is just distracting and annoying.  I need you to stop, or he and I will both be blocking you on facebook.""  

If she doesn't stop, block her.  If she's still always getting on him, stop going to family events.  If she's still always asking, stop talking to her about him.  Be an adult and enforce boundaries--it's much more effective than yelling at someone once."
884,"Sam sounds like a great guy. But your parents are significantly prejudiced and ignorant towards the working class. I don't think they're going to come around any time. There's not going to be much advice Reddit can offer to change their minds, they've been probably exposed to years of prejudice and inflammatory articles about people in council estates in the Daily Mail.

If I was you, I would look into moving out of home and getting some independence. It will be important to establish some barriers between you and your parents. They need to understand if they want to have a good relationship with you, they need to be respectful to Sam. If they disrespect him, they will have a distant relationship with their daughter.

For some parents, the realisation that they will lose their daughter is enough for them to pull their head in and start making an effort with their daughter's partner."
885,"It's not only that he's hiding something. By his reaction, he is showing you you have no power but to put up with anything he wants, or leave. He is forcing every situation to go nuclear. So that, if you don't end it, he knows next time you won't even make extremely reasonable request or observations or criticism. This is manipulating and controlling behavior. But let's say it turns out he was just lying about something dumb. You're not leaving over the silliness about social media. But because of his absolutely unacceptable and childish, not to mention inept, attempt at manipulation and control."
886,"&gt;I think I also need to add that I feel he's somewhat emotionally unavailable, making me think his romantic interests are somewhere else and not directed to me. He rarely gives me compliments and is not good at making me feel secure in the relationship.

Leave out everything else (which are indeed red flags), and even with just this...why are you with this guy?  Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone who doesn't make you feel secure in the relationship?

I've been in these relationships, and let me tell you, it is worth the wait for a guy who makes you feel special and loved and safe on a daily basis.  There is just no reason to waste time on emotionally unavailable guys, especially ones who are still trading selfies with tinder hookups.  Find a guy who shows his love for you consistently."
887,"Yeah... I'm a woman and I get lunch/dinner and drinks with male friends but I ALWAYS tell my husband before hand and then we discuss how the meal went after (like ""oh John just bought a boat and he and his wife are going to Italy!"").  The not telling her thing is bizarre and what would set me off."
888,"OP stop trying to be friends or reconcile with this garbage person (john). He's a fucking toxic human being and so is Jane. 

I would say if you're forced to be around them then try to be as cordial and polite as possible but don't try to rebuild your relationship. "
889,"You made the right decision, without a doubt, absolutely. If you didn‚Äôt report him, other people would be left vulnerable in the future. 

Once upon a time, I made the same decision. He made awful comments, promised to wait outside for me after work. I was 19 years old and he was in his mid 40s and several hundred pounds overweight. After weeks of not sleeping and calling in ‚Äúsick‚Äù, I reported him. It sucked. My friendly coworkers would openly talk about me. I had to make a formal written complaint, and they brought him in the room and read it out loud in front of both of us. I was utterly humiliated. He denied everything formally and later I heard him laughing about it, denying it and saying ‚Äúwho would ever want to fuck someone that looks like her?!‚Äù  I wish I had a spine and confronted him in that moment, but it was crushing. I quit that day. He continued to be employed there, because his position was extremely hard to fill. A few months later, I found out he was fired for doing exactly the same shit to another 19 year old girl. How many others had it happened to who remained silent? Looking back now, I should have contacted a lawyer and pursued it further. The company handled it terribly and he walked away without consequence. That company has since folded and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm sorry. 

Standing up for yourself is INCREDIBLY important, but standing up for other potential victims is imperative. It‚Äôs not okay for it to just be normal. Defend yourself against anyone who thinks otherwise. You are worth the fight, worth the dirty looks, worth the whispers, and worth the write up for HR. Pursue it as far as you can. And then learn from it and grow from it. There is absolutely no shame in leaving the job and making it known why. 

You did the right thing. You are worth the fight "
890,"well.. making you walk on a broken ankle and refusing to take you to the doctor was already reason to cut her out of your life. 

this is just *another* reason. 

it doesn't have to be ""because you hate her"", it can simply be because you have the right to keep yourself safe, healthy, and happy... and she isn't compatible with that plan.

"
891,Dude why are you asking a girl to your place on the first date? Change plans to go somewhere public.
892,"Rat her out to the bf. She probably has you blocked already on his fb, so you may need to make a burner acct. After letting him know what's up, block her everywhere and move on. Her excuses are straight out of a cheater's handbook btw, don't fall for those. "
893,"...this sounds *exhausting*. 
Address it. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed that sometimes you mention the wrong fact or incorrect information. That happens to all of us; I have noticed you‚Äôre really uncomfortable with the idea that you might not know an answer, or that you fight back when you‚Äôre wrong. It is starting to affect me. I would like you to stop correcting my written work. I‚Äôd really like to be able to point out when you‚Äôve cited something incorrect without expecting you to lash out. Do you think we could work on this together?‚Äù

My issue here wouldn‚Äôt be the behavior itself but the issue behind it, ie. your partner is rude, inconsiderate, and patronizing, and clearly has little self awareness. Those are qualities that will continue to affect you. "
894,"There is nothing you can do to make an abuser stop abusing you. You cannot make him treat you with kindness and respect. You cannot change yourself into some other person that he would like better, and even if you could, the cost of that is far too high. The appropriate reaction to a childish temper tantrum is to recognize that your boyfriend is a child and is not capable of being in a relationship with anyone until he grows up. Adults manage their own anger. You do not need to manage his anger for him. 

The reason I comment on posts like this is because I've been there. Twice, actually. I know every single thing they do and it's always the same. Your boyfriend is a very ordinary kind of abuser. You can do so much better than him. "
895,"I'd be waiting every night with a knife and fork in hand, wearing a bib.  My only fear would be how to return the favor, as at best I can make hard boiled eggs, but often even mess those up."
896,"&gt;I got home and he had done the dishes which melted my heart

This makes me really sad for you. I hope that you get an amazing new partner in the future and you realize how beyond tablestakes this type of treatment is."
897,"Holy cow. That is intense. I am sorry that happened to you, and to your girlfriend. My advice to you: if you love her, stick it out. Her family needs to learn to accept others. If she loves you, which it seems like she does, they will hopefully learn to love you as well. It probably didn‚Äôt help to keep it hidden - not blaming, I can‚Äôt imagine being in her situation. However, the fact that they are reaching out to her and apologizing is a good sign imo. Good luck, bro. Like I said, if you love love her, it would be beneficial for everyone involved to not just drop it. Stick it out and prove to them who you are "
898,"&gt; **missing stair**

&gt; The phrase was coined by blogger Cliff Pervocracy in a 2012 post on The Pervocracy, a blog about BDSM and kink. Describing a man in his social circle known to be a rapist, Pervocracy wrote:

&gt; People had gotten so used to working around this guy, to accommodating his ""special requirements,"" that they didn't feel like there was an urgent problem in their community. They did eventually expel him, but it was after months of it being widely shared knowledge that he was a rapist. [...] I think there were some people in the community who were intentionally protecting him, but there were more who were de facto protecting him by treating him like a missing stair. Like something you're so used to working around, you never stop to ask ""what if we actually fixed this?"" Eventually you take it for granted that working around this guy is just a fact of life, and if he hurts someone, that's the fault of whoever didn't apply the workarounds correctly."
899,Yeah it seems very enemy-ish to go after someone's reputation like that. 
900,"If it was something more serious - for instance if you were trans, or you had some kind of condition that would prevent you from having an active sex life - then you might have something to worry about. 

As it is, I think you're being far too self conscious and insecure about this. Lots of people have scars of one type or another, and this is no different. Just relax. This is not a big deal at all.

The only significant stuff about this isn't even the scars - the psychological effects can't have been good for you at all when you were a teenager. I imagine with the surgery any issues have probably alleviated somewhat, but you shouldn't feel afraid to ask for some kind of counselling and support if it still bothers you."
901,"Yeah I mean fuck that. He felt bad about disclosing what she told him? This is him straight up prioritizing her over you. 

This needs a serious conversation. 3 signs of an affair brewing:

- texting on the reg
- talking about relationship issues
- going for coffee/lunch one on one


At the very least, you tell him that you will be present if/when they hang out alone. Honestly though, you should just be way more adamant about him stomping out his relationship with her. Everyone knows what is happening. Maybe not him, but he is just enjoying the attention. Another way you could phrase it is to ask your husband how he would feel if you were chatting up a hot guy who booty danced with you and came to you with his problems all the time. Hmm... what are his intentions? "
902,"I was thinking the same thing. Getting engaged/married doesn‚Äôt make it magically better. Seems like there are bigger issues at hand. My BF and I have been together for ten years (we‚Äôre both 25) and yeah we wanna get married but also wanna buy a house. Some things take priority. 

Being married really doesn‚Äôt change much except taxes and legal things. To me it‚Äôs a status symbol mostly. I see way too many young people getting married 1-2 years into their relationship. 

My advice: get stable jobs, save money, move in together despite not being engaged, work on issues, and then MAYBE get married in a year or so. "
903,"&gt;how strong she seemed the next morning

yeah, no one seems to notice that by how 'strong' the boyfriend described her, it means that she wasn't as sad as the boyfriend expected her to be based off how he treated her, because she had sex and probably an unconscious backup plan "
904,"if that's what he says in front of you, imagine what was discussed behind your back. 

Either way, he sounds more like a 14 year old than a 20 year old..."
905,"The cheapest option would have been to suck it up for the more expensive tickets.  No way transportation or renting a car costs less than $200.  How on earth do you get to 29 without knowing this?

For some context, I just checked, and this would be more time than someone flying into DC and driving to NYC (3.5 one way without traffic) or flying into Detroit to get to Chicago (4 without traffic).  Think about how utterly insane that sounds, right?  What bro wants is worse."
906,"Upvoted a million times in spirit. I think that's exactly what will happen. And though I'm not a lawyer, I'm assuming that if they ever divorce, she would then likely be responsible for alimony to keep him in his accustomed lazy ""lifestyle"". 

He's asking permission to quit his job now, but I have a feeling that if you say no, something will ""magically"" happen to make him lose his job anyways. 

I'm sorry OP, but he sounds like a huge jerk. Please don't let yourself get stuck with a leech, take care of yourself."
907,"&gt; Pack your shit, tell grandmom your brother is an abusive piece of shit and you're done dealing with him, thank your boyfriend for being a wonderful human being and LEAVE. And then never speak to your mother or your brother again.

This, this, this, this, and this."
908,"He is not a normal or a healthy person. 

So glad you are able to move on and live your life. Jfc what is wrong with some people. "
909,"It‚Äôs 50 because that‚Äôs what he insisted on even when she went part time FOR SCHOOL. Maybe they can negotiate a lower amount at some later time, but he should at least hold himself to the same standard."
910,"I‚Äôm admittedly no expert on wedding etiquette, but it seems to me that if the bride and groom are requiring a particular style of dress for their bridesmaids, it should be the bride and groom‚Äôs responsibility to pay for it. If it‚Äôs just ‚Äúwear something nice,‚Äù then fine, that‚Äôs up to the individual, but it kind of blows my mind that people expect their friends to shell out hundreds of dollars for a dress they‚Äôre not really choosing and wouldn‚Äôt otherwise wear, for the sake of matching some theme."
911,Yes my younger sister told me because she admitted to my older sister acting as if she was better than me. And I have 2 older brothers (30/25) and 2 sisters (27/14).
912,"It is true she has never mentioned it. The only reason I started worrying about it is because my mother-in-law asked if I would ever do that for her. I was so blindsided, I didn't know what to say. Luckily, my husband chimed in saying ""I don't think I'D want her to carry a baby that I didn't get to keep."" But ever since then, I've thought about it often. I'm sure it's at least crossed their minds.
 "
913,"I dont think she was surprised. I dont think you spoiled anything. I dont think she'll care. And I dont think anyone will find out.

it was a brain fart, these things happen, people who are harsh on you.... yeah, fuck those bastards"
914,"I read your original post and I'm a little shocked by this update. While I wish you both the best, I don't think that a relationship this toxic and one-sided will last very long. I also don't think that you took previous suggestions as seriously as you would claim.

Considering how you booked for HER to visit YOU instead of vice versa also makes me wonder if you learned anything at all. One weekend won't undo all the damage, but I suppose that it is a start."
915,‚ÄúWho do you piss off‚Äù is what people pleasers ask themselves. Family is important but you already made plans before. It‚Äôs okay to put your foot down and tell them you have plans and that they should come visit you another time. 
916,"There's a reason why someone coined the statement ""old habits die hard."""
917,"Maybe you could offer to extend one (or more) of your trips and have him join you at the tail end, so he could experience the travel with you but not horn in on your work time or give a bad impression to your colleagues.

As a woman working in software, I get exactly what you mean when you say that having him tag along would destroy your standing with the male engineers.  Don't sacrifice your career for a man.

It sounds like Todd just really doesn't respect your career.  That's what you guys need to be talking about."
918,That's excellent advice.
919,Dude. Just divorce. This is ridiculous.
920,[deleted]
921,"Given that your boss is within her rights to *fire* people who are persistently late, I'd choose your battles carefully"
922,"Ditto. From the other side it could be ""I'm trying to work through my PTSD over horrible gang rape by cops, but my roommate keeps bring her cop boyfriend over despite my repeated explanation that I don't want him there.""

Especially with the therapist involved and John becoming very defensive (like it sounds straight up ""you are hurting my girlfriend and it's pissing me off"").

Or from John's perspective it could easily be ""My good friend is constantly picking the same kind of jerk guy. Now she is bringing her new same-old-same-old boyfriend to my girlfriend's place and refusing to see how it makes us both uncomfortable.""

Soemthing's going on here that we can't see.

Edit: clarification"
923,"Additionally, make sure you get comfortable with having that conversation in person instead of non-verbally simply not escalating it. It stands to reason that some people would take a lack of progression without a reason in a comfortable scenario like this personally. And while it wasn't intended as such, being able to put that forward at the time would save whoever from the doubts in their mind later."
924,"Knowing all the parties involved doesn‚Äôt make this situation your business, or your responsibility. Disengage from this whole mess. 

Side note, the time for your friend to confirm with the wife that their marriage was open was *before* sleeping with her husband. She made a bad decision and now she‚Äôll have to deal with the consequences. But you inserting yourself into this situation is just going to make it worse. "
925,"His brother agreed to pay him $15 an hour-where I live thats the going rate for a hs student to babysit, do yardwork-anything.

If his brother didnt have the money he 1) shouldnt have said he would pay and 2) should have gotten off his lazy ass and done it himself.

Op-tell your parents and if they dont come through and make your brother pay you (even over time) then take the stuff apart.  never do anything for your brother again without gettiing paid i advance."
926,"I mean, you've waited three years to take your bra off during sex - isn't it possible he could sense your insecurity and didn't want to push the issue, and that's why he didn't take it off himself? And of course he waits until you're gone...I feel like a lot of guys do that. How have you communicated about this issue previously?"
927,*Daily showering/brushing your teeth and general human hygiene is a requirement for being in a relationship with me.  I love you and and I want to be with you...But I will not budge on this.  So you need to decide what is more important to you.  Being with me or being a disgusting slob*
928,THIS POST is why I am so glad we have this sub. I see how you would be confused too
929,"If you are the one buying the tickets, then get them for your Dad. I don't understand why she said ""why should I give him a birthday gift?"" in response to you bringing this up if you were not asking her to financially contribute to it. I'd talk to her again and tell her that of course she has no obligation to get your dad any gift, but you and your siblings would like to do this for him as it's unlikely he will ever be able to go again, and while you know they have a difficult relationship, you hope she can understand her kids wanting to do something nice for their father. I would maybe even mention that him going would give her a nice break from him!"
930,"Start applying for jobs in your field all over the country, once you get one, move. "
931,"""I would estimate she cancels 30&amp;#37; if the time and reschedules about 10&amp;#37; of the time.""

That's really all the information you need.  This is a business arrangement, and if you aren't happy with the service you're receiving, you have every right to end it.  However, if this was a traditional office setting, the first step would be simply approaching the employee about their behavior and coming to an agreement about expectations.  What is an acceptable rate of cancellations for you?  How do you want to handle payments in the future?  I think seeing her reaction to this conversation would be important information for you.  If she is defensive and uncompromising, it's probably time to end it.      

With regard to the stove situation, it's possible that the problem is a difference in perspective about this ""gift"".  Since you were planning on having it disposed of anyway, she may be under the impression that it did not have value to you.  She also initiated the exchange by asking.  The real thank-you should be for your time and effort.  However, the picture I'm getting from your story is that you're a pretty helpful, agreeable person who doesn't say ""no"" when someone asks for a favor.  She may not have been aware of the fact that it was inconvenient for you.  Also, unless you explicitly said ""I cannot move it for you.  You need to bring someone help you haul it"", I can see how she would expect your help.   "
932,"Eventually you are probably going to have to choose between your marriage and your desire to have children. If you had to make that choice, what do you think it would be?"
933,"So very true, my SO cheated on me with a girl who acted almost exactly like Natasha. She was so all over him that our friends were asking wtf was going on. He was 100% oblivious to it and just thought he was supporting her through a hard time, he bought her ""I have no one, my life is terrible, I just need a friend!"" sob story hook, line &amp; sinker and I became the big jealous meanie. He didn't intend to cheat, he genuinely just thought he was being kind, but things got completely out of hand one consoling drinking night and he immediately realized everything I'd said was right and came home with his tail between his legs.

I decided to give him a chance because I knew how completely oblivious to what she was doing he had been, but it took 3 years of him doing some very hard work in therapy till I finally felt like I could trust him again. I only regret not dragging him to a therapist the minute I realized he wasn't seeing how manipulative and brazen she was being. It was incredibly painful to fix and not something I'd recommend to someone unless both people are 100% clear that they still love each other under all the painful emotions following something like that.

I hope OP can get ahead of this."
934,"&gt;A man with a me first  attitude does not succeed in a small business. So don't think that's going to go anywhere, except draining your bank account.

This is exactly what I was thinking. Every successful businesses owner -from small start ups to the larger company I work for now- is able to work well with others and that means either having the empathy to do it, or at least being able to fake it regularly enough.

Me first doesn't inspire loyalty. Me first doesn't make a client trust you. Me first doesn't understand employee's needs and context. Me first doesn't even pay its taxes on time. Me first doesn't build relationships with the city or other governing officials. Me first doesn't take criticism and feedback on a product/service or whatever ""small businesses"" he wants to run.

Me first mops the floors for minimum wage. That's what me first does."
935,Thanks man. I really appreciate it. It helps a lot.
936,"You're in your 30s, what on earth are you doing screaming and cursing at each other? That's incredibly immature for your ages. 

If the plan is to sit with your mother, your part of that plan should be listening, not explaining. Hear her out. Don't defend or argue. Ask the occasional calm question for elaboration, but primarily listen. End the conversation with something like ""you've given me a lot to think about, thank you for taking the time to help me see your side. When can we talk next after I've had time to think?""

Pretty easy litmus test on this one: if she demands an on-the-spot admittance of guilt and/or apology, or escalates the drama of the conversation, the problem is very likely not you."
937,"Google ""good giving game"". A good sex partner needs to be all three. Good as in good in bed or willing to practice if inexperienced. Giving as in caring about the partners pleasure. Game as in game for new things, or at least things that the partner knows they will find pleasure in.

Sex is a two way street. If you need foreplay he needs to give it, to make sex more fun for you. If you tell him something doesn't feel nice (kissing so much you feel suffocated or grabbing you too hard) he needs to stop, never do it again and find a way of initiating you actually do get turned on by.

No more jokingly doing things you find no pleasure in, like the nipple pinching. I don't care if he thinks it's funny, if you don't and it's killing your desire, he needs to not do it. These need to be boundaries that he needs to abide by and even if you're low sex drive he needs to be a better partner to you so that you can nurture your desire toward him.

He needs to hear what is turning you off, listen and stop doing those things. A lot of this post is shit that turns him on but not you. If he's the higher libido, more easily turned on then he has to adjust. "
938,"&gt;It's not like he's a social invalid

You sure make it sound like he is. Or you're misinterpreting conversation.

It's one thing to get a conversation rolling off of something you learned. He's just learned something interesting about a tribal group, shares that, conversation ensues - no different than saying ""I just saw the best movie"" and rolling from there. But it's another thing entirely if he's not making conversation, but instead is just a series of trivia. And interjecting *relevant* fun facts into an ongoing conversation is totally normal. 

So what is he doing? Is he using a fun fact to start a converation, interjecting relevant fun facts into an already started conversation, or is he just spitting trivia in lieu of conversation?"
939,"Offer to take the pets away as a 'favor' because, as your dad himself mentioned, he can't pay for their food, vet bills or look after them."
940,"Personally, I'd want to know. That is some serious boundary crossing. Like, the couch is one (still grossly inappropriate) thing, but in your bed?! That's crossing some serious lines, and actually pretty disrespectful, in my books. "
941,"Yes, and if he can‚Äôt fly close to OP, it might be cheaper for her to fly to Seattle or wherever else so they can at least see each other "
942,"I don't think that's petty.  She sexually assaulted him in his sleep.  Even if it's ""just kissing"" that's still very much not ok.   I'd freak the fuck out if I found out some dude kissed me in my sleep.  Especially someone I considered a friend and who I was helping so much.


I'd definitely want to know, and then I'd go scorched earth on this. 


But I'm also petty so maybe we are just 2 peas in a vengeful pod. "
943,"Can they call?  Sure.  Will the police do anything?  Probably not; you are 18 and therefore legally an adult.

However, the way you are approaching this proves that you are not yet *emotionally* an adult.  There *will* be consequences when you come back, and as long as you are dependent upon them for *anything* (food, clothing, shelter, financial support of *any* kind) you are responsible for following their rules.

Going haring off to Greece against their express direction will only prove to them that they are correct that you are not yet ready for adult responsibility."
944,"Also in regards to cooking, are you two big on vegetables? Freshly chopped and cook vegetables should be like 60% of your dinner plate. Add spices and you have variety, Mexican, Asian Chinese, Asian Thai, creole/Cajun, western savory, Ethiopian. "
945,Wow I would be rethinking the whole marriage thing with this dude. 
946,"OMG, he wanted you to drive 20 HOURS to save himself $250?  hahaha.  Was he planning on giving you gas and road trip money? It's like a 40 hour drive from California to Montreal.  He wants you to drive half the way to California to save himself your gas money.  What a tool.  

You did a great job!  I hope you have a wonderful time with your mom and grandparents.  "
947,"I will for sure.  Our ability to communicate our concerns effectively has really helped our relationship in the past.  That being said, this situation feels different than previous conflicts.  "
948,"Dude, its not like shes cutting her from her life. Shes just not gonna pay for her meals. Seems pretty fair and balanced.

You gotta realise, shes angry because she felt entitled to the money, how dare she question what she does with her money, how rude! Right? Why on earth would you continue to pay for someone who is so ungrateful that they think YOU are rude to the point of no longer speaking to you for simply questioning why you just took $17 from my pocket and threw it in the bin?"
949,"And there you go! Honestly all these people saying you should figure out how he can go on these trips with you are making massive assumptions about what your job is and what you can do. 

I work in entertainment which has crazy unpredictable hours and schedules so I feel you. If you are traveling for work then duh work comes first. 

This is 100% just about him keeping his eye on you and maybe trying to get a free vacay because he is jealous. This is SUPER unhealthy. 

How long have you been together? "
950,"Ehh, I think that sounds unlikely given the timeline. It is far more likely given OP's description that she's distracted by shiny new things and makes impulsive, dramatic decisions. "
951,Would it be worth op going to their local station and giving advance warning of a possible false report?
952,"Even  if he is argumentative call 911 and call in a psychotic episode. 

Don't wait ""a few hours"" - with the brain *minutes* count. This could literally be the difference between getting you old fianc√© back or him becoming  a vegetable.

CALL THE FUCKING DOCTOR AND DO IT NOW FOR CHRISSAKES

You are not taking this seriously enough, you are way too relaxed"
953,"I wonder if she's already borrowing it, and going you'll say yes.  I'm with the other commenter, don't let her, she'll kill it"
954,"Is your mother an animal hoarder? It sounds like she has a lot of sick animals she doesn't have the means to care for. 

You don't see it now, but cps might be the right call for you. 

You're 13 and she won't let you go to school instead of changing your school after the bullying incident. You don't even know how much she is crippling your future right now. You're isolated, living with a mentally unstable mother, I believe CPS is the best call for you to make. You fucked up, and thats true, but your mom is abusive. Normal parents don't keep their kids like sick animals in a cage.

You know how your mom has all those sicks animals? Would you love to see them taken care of? That's you. You need outside help you're being deprived of it, just like them. If you call CPS you, and maybe even possibly the animals, will be able to get the help you need. 

I think you should also seriously think about your route back into education and getting back into society. I dropped out of school at 14, and it's my biggest regret. The longer you stay isolated, the harder it will be to re enter society. Your mom does not, and will not help you on that front, you need to think on your feet and do what's best for your long term success. Right now you might not see the future, but you seem like a very smart kid, you just need some help right now. 

Please look after yourself. You messed up, but you're isolated and cornered, you need help from a stable adult. "
955,"Marriage counseling, ASAP! Don't wait for his parents to leave to do so. Find a counselor and make the appointment now. If he doesn't want to go, that means he doesn't see a problem, that you being unhappy isn't a problem for him. Do what you will with that information, but I know I couldn't build a life with someone who didn't care enough about my unhappiness to even bother to go to a simple one-hour appointment with me.

Also, because of this...

""When I swore in front of her, she said she didn't like swear words, and I answered ""Well, fuck that. I'm in my own house and I can sweat as much as I want"".""

...I think you've got spirit, and whatever you decide to do, you can handle it."
956,"Do you really have a complicated situation? Or do you have a situation where you feel shitty about your relationship already and then your girlfriend cheated on you WHILE YOU WERE NEXT TO HER and literally redirected you back to sleep when you woke up and caught them? That's vile. 

Doesn't seem complicated to me dude. Some people don't deserve a second chance even if they were honest. Forgiveness is one thing, but I wouldn't keep dating her. I'd thank her for her honesty and politely remove her from my life. "
957,That‚Äôs more what I imagined. And it might not have even been intentionally altered but skewed through her bizarre perception of it. 
958,You need to break up with her. Seriously. Never stay with a person who hits you.
959,"From my personal experience, people like her never learn. She showed who she is. This will happen again. Right circumstance will bring it out again."
960,"Girlfriend is only 14,  FYI "
961,"Woah dude, this is just a shitstorm of red flags. Within a 24 hours your girlfriend has:

1. verbally abused you
2. hit you
3. thrown things at you
4. emotionally manipulated you into having sex
5. kicked you out because you dared to express your desire to not have sex
6. gotten angry at you for expressing a basic, reasonable need (sleep! for a job interview!) with hours of warning time

It's clear from your language that you are used to having to walk on eggshells around her and being a victim of her temper. This is not what a healthy relationship looks like. Get out of there.
"
962,"The first paragraph is a huuuuge red flag. She is going to crash and burn if she doesn‚Äôt keep being handed opportunities like the internship. 

I would tell her what they said, for your own good. Her response to that may tell you its time to get out."
963,"&gt;no pension savings

This is the just the tippy-tip of the mooching iceberg then. "
964,You just answered yourself... Fucking stay far far away from this guy.  This man is old enough to be your dad and started hitting on you in high school. What could you possibly have in common with this guy to try and hold a friendship with him.
965,"Right but he's also suspicious of that fact. So I don't think she wears lingerie everyday, at least that specific set of lingerie"
966,A well adjusted 42 year old probably doesn't want a 21 year old fwb either.
967,"You're not the villian. You've been played for a fool. She knows how to emotionally manipulate and she made you her target.  She's almost certainly targeted other family members as well. 

You asked, ""what the hell do I do?""

You stop being a fool. You take care of yourself. You treat yourself as if you are every bit as important as the other people in your family.  You allow your family to think whatever they want. You know the truth. Live in the truth.

And don't apologize for anything you said. Someone has to start being an adult in your family. It may as well be you."
968,"Those outcomes are shitty too. And to be clear, every shitty outcome is the sole resposibility of BIL for behaving this way.

BIL has put OP in a position where he's left with multiple risky/shitty outcomes. Very uncool"
969,"I do too. She‚Äôs so sweet and he treats her how he treated me constantly. The worst part of it is they have a child together. My boyfriend and him have been friends since the beginning of high school when he was much different, as he‚Äôs gotten older his ego has just gotten completely out of control. It‚Äôs a good question why they‚Äôre still friends though. "
970,"Sometimes you have to be the bigger person. It‚Äôs fine to be petty but if you value maintaining the family relationship then it something you have to consider not being able to visit to being a small thing.

It‚Äôs natural to be bothered by someone who doesn‚Äôt want you to visit but is visiting but maybe it may change their view overtime to let you visit them? "
971,[deleted]
972,It‚Äôs honestly alarming how involved they are in your sex life. This isn‚Äôt any of their business. 
973,"It's not with trusting him per se. It is with trusting ANYONE. 

My fiance knows my history, that is probably why he isn't upset about what happened. 

I have been in therapy for it for some time now (My fiance has joined me in sessions as well) but the truth is that I may NEVER be able to implicitly trust anyone due to past abuse. It is something that I continue to work on.  


"
974,Oh this is good!! I really should just screenshot it if I still have it.
975,"Miraculously, I've managed to go through all of my solo trips without falling into a sexual craze. With patience and deep meditation perhaps OP can manage too /s"
976,He sounds a bellend. Tell him you're not gonna move in with him because his empathy is under developed. 
977,If she's worried about that then she should get a divorce and leave permanently. 
978,If it‚Äôs reasonable I am very amenable. 
979,"And realise it‚Äôs *equal* share and not a *fair* share. If it was fair, he would have supported you studying and helped you out financially! Perhaps you only paying 1/4 or 1/3 of the bills and he pays the rest. That would be fair, because the long term would benefit you both! 

Equal is just a: split it all evenly regardless of circumstances but only if it benefits me okay cool? "
980,Because this isn‚Äôt a simple mistake. It‚Äôs a relationship ending comment. 
981,Or maybe he is just not interested in women?
982,"Why would you talk to her? At least why would you initiate a conversation? Actions speak louder than words, and she ghosted you without an apology or explanation. I'm not sure there's anything to say until she gets in touch."
983,"Your idea inspired me!

OP, take out your phones. Show her how many steps she's getting in vs. how many you are. Tell her you think she's beautiful, but for you to be healthy you need more gym time since you're always sitting down. And that she doesn't need to worry about going with you all the time because she's always on her feet and deserves to rest.

Also most meals you can substitute protein. Making tacos? Prepare everything else together. You can cook your chicken while she cooks the fish. You get chicken tacos. She gets fish tacos. She can't expect for you to cook for her all the time and still get exactly what she wants. Turn it into a team building experience!"
984,"You posted recently about him getting mad because you had to extend a work trip, right? some of the details are different... Anyway. Whether or not you're the same female railway engineer that posted before, this is a red flag because your boyfriend sounds CONTROLLING. If he wanted to come and was *genuinely* OK with fending for himself it would be one thing, but I have a feeling he wouldn't be. 

**edit:** and, you know, the fact that he *immediately* assumed he couldn't come because you were using these work trips as opportunities to cheat on him is truly pathetic. He's controlling and insecure and he won't be happy until you're locked 24/7 in his basement so no other men can ever look upon your shining visage. Just run."
985,"Okay so I am going to throw this out there: as long as you were as polite as you possibly could have been you are not responsible for someone else's passive aggressive attitude. If she even dares to fight you on this you remind her that you had plans, told her well in advance, and she reassured you it was ""all good."" 

If people want to play games with their words and feel a totally separate way theyre aren't friends, they're children who will never give you anything but confusing answers. Say what you mean and mean what you say. "
986,"...you knew your girlfriend was uncomfortable with you being friends with your exes, so you decided to *ask them for relationship advice*?? After telling her you were no longer speaking to them? Did I read that correctly?"
987,"The only thing I can think of is that complacency kills. 

I could be reading too much into this, but if you‚Äôve spent the past 3 years wholly focused on work and keeping a tight budget, you may have missed some times where the relationship needed some attention and lost the spark. Did you both keep putting in the effort to keep some passion alive?"
988,"Just a heads up for when you're grovelling to your fiance don't use the fact that you were 24 in your explanation (stick to spiteful idiot). 24 is wayyyy to old for your age to be an excuse, 16 is the latest your age could be an excuse for that shit. "
989,"My dad did &amp; still does this &amp; lemme tell you, it made for a shitty childhood. Dumping that guy was a good move. "
990,"Everyone always blames this on being a mamas boy but really a grown man can put his foot down and say he wants to do his own stuff if he wants to.

He doesn't want to. 

Proceed only if you want to be the new mom."
991,"Love it not an emotion. It is not a noun.

Love is a verb.

You can tell if someone loves you base on their actions. You can tell if you love someone based on your own toward them.

Cheating is an act that shows you completely lack love for the person you are with. It shows that you care more about your own short term gratification than respecting, let alone loving, your partner.

If he cheated on you, he can not love, no matter what he says or thinks.

Cheaters only love themselves."
992,"I've noticed this, as well. 

He probably hasn't outright defied her like this before (that she knows of) because she never asks anything of him, or is *always* the one bending over backwards to please him."
993,"Wow dude you sound like a really terrible partner. She should be calling you instead of your coworker of course but you‚Äôre a liar who hides things so no wonder your girlfriend is freaking out - she had almost certainly picked up on the fact that you‚Äôre not committed and going behind her back flirting with someone else. 

Quit the emotional affair. Quit hiding things. Get couples‚Äô counseling. You have kids for Christ‚Äôs sake. "
994,"Eh, he tried to deflect by getting lovey dovey. He knew exactly what his mother meant. He's lying to you somewhere in there, whether it is what MIL knows of the past or even of the present. She probably knows he has an Asian fetish, and I wouldn't be surprised if she enables the cheating by using her place.

I know a family friend who had something similar. The woman has 2 sons and loves to control them and be the center of attention. She felt threatened when they both got married especially if the wife had more 'power'. With both sons, she helped them cheat, even posing with her sons and the other women in pics. One son ended up getting divorce and is now living at home with her. He's in his 40s or 50s. The other son continues to cheat. His wife is in denial and refuses to leave him or even confront him, although it was their daughter who caught him and told everyone. She overheard a convo he had with the other woman and saw a pic of her father, with the other woman and his mother (her grandmother). 

That's their story. Not sure what your husband is hiding but his mother definitely knows at least something about his thing with Asian women. He could have at least been honest about that even if that is all she knew."
995,Does he want to communicate with this woman? Why?
996,"He's sure acting like he wants commitment. No normal 42 year old wants to hang out with a bunch of college kids (and most college kids don't want a weirdo 42 year old at their party, either).

He's creepy and has repeatedly disrespected your request that he drop it. I'd find a new FWB."
997,"&gt;I'd hoped he'd respect what I was saying, especially because he always says he's more easily convinced by logic and facts.

So now you know that THAT'S a blatant lie, and that logic and facts matter less to him than his *feelings*, and apparently his feelings are that you are frivolous. He seems like kind of a douche."
998,"The problem imo is that you're trying not to hurt her. I'm doubtful that anyone who shows to be so clingy won't be hurt no matter how you put them down. If you both put her down together at least you can share the guilt and talk about how you felt about the whole situation with each other. The priority should be setting more boundaries for this friend. The less you set, the more they have to walk over. "
999,I second this. It's super rude to have a guest over and leave them at home while you go out with your friends. 
1000,This was absolutely fascinating.  Thank you.
1001,"Nope nope nope. Girlfriend, you can love someone as much as you want and they can love you back even more, but at the end of the day a relationship without respect is barely a relationship. You're out of college now in the real world. Maybe you should think about leaving the immature, inconsiderate boyfriend where you left term papers and dorm rooms. "
1002,"It‚Äôs a kind of platonic codependency.  Your husband and Amy both need therapy for it.

I wouldn‚Äôt be so quick to suspect sexual cheating, these kinds of relationships aren‚Äôt about that kind of intimacy.

It‚Äôs a lot easier to be open with someone whom you don‚Äôt have to worry about leaving you for saying the wrong thing."
1003,A job is another one of those things to add to the list. A lot of places check credit as well.
1004,It doesn't even have to be malicious rumors. The honest truth that he prioritize students who flirt with him over those who don't and chit-chat with his fan club over time-sensitive work is enough to be a problem for his career.

1006,"&gt; She just never saw it.

Then show her, by choosing not to go back to her. "
1007,"&gt; Then, he wants me to get my messed up teeth fixed because he feels like it's more important than getting married (my teeth are just wonky, not unhealthy, never caused any problems besides cosmetic issues). Then he wants me to gain weight for the wedding even though I'm naturally quite thin.

Don't marry him. You will never be good enough for him and will spend the rest of your life being put down."
1008,"I agree, obviously if he walks around saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hate me look I did chores xyz!‚Äù Isn‚Äôt going to help but I also think that doing more will show he is trying. Also the flowers thing, I personally would like it if my husband bought me simple grocery store flowers and a card that says ‚ÄúSorry Iwas such an asshole when I got drunk‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt hurt... not going to be the the bandaid on this but I think it shows a healthy dose of remorse. "
1009,"It also would make me doubt his character, that he was describing this incredibly depersonalizing relationship and reducing an ex to just a thing. his narrative didn't seem to be ""I no longer think like that,"" but rather ""I would rather have an emotional connection than one based on crazy hot sex but I could totally still have the latter if I wanted."" Like he wants brownie points for thinking of his girlfriend as a person. "
1010,"&gt; Not our home loan or deed. 

Ok so that's scary as fuck. That's real old-school patriarchial ""I own you"" marriage. This has potential for ""financial abuse""  (yes, I realise that 50 years ago nobody would have batted an eyelid at this, but it's not 50 years ago: since then we discovered that it turns out women are people too )

Do you have a job? Do you pay part of the bills and home loan?  because if so, you need your name on the home pronto, not negotiable."
1011,"Sorry to say but that girl is going nowhere in life. Time to move on. She might screw guys while too high to think. Did she use needles? If so, her getting tested is NOT being selfish. If she refuses that it's certainly over forever.
I noticed you never said one positive thing about her. That speaks volumes as if you already knew the answer."
1012,"I focused on the woman because she is the one that has a personal relationship with OP &amp; she is the one he is emotionally supporting &amp; defending in all of his replies. OP isn‚Äôt trying to remain friends with the married man, so he isn‚Äôt relevant to the situation at hand. It‚Äôs not which of the two involved parties is ‚Äúmore at fault,‚Äù just which one is involved in the problem between OP &amp; his wife. "
1013,"&gt; you don't love your parents. you fear them. you fear disappointment. you fear confrontation. 

ouch. But more than a grain of truth"
1014,I definitely care--at this point the ceremony is just a formality for us since we've been together for so long. It'd be nice to take the next step when we're financially secure but it just seems as thought talking about it kind if bums him out now and he can't see past the people nagging him :-/

It‚Äôs not your job to be supportive of her in this time‚Äîit‚Äôs damaging for your relationship with your wife, and she can and should lean on someone else on Team Her.
