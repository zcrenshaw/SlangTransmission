0,"Except she doesn't see what you see. 

And there's a possibility that you are seeing something that's not there. "
1,I reckon this is the simple and obvious answer. Others are overthinking this and I don't believe someone without ptsd would react unlike your guy. You simply triggered his fight or flight reflex. 
2,You broke a promise and she broke up with you. That’s how it is. Just move on. 
3,"What facts can you present to convince him that something didn't happen? Sounds like he's using this as an excuse to get out and still be the ""good guy"". He really thinks you were making out with a friend at a party in front of him? You'd be the world's dumbest cheater. That's what he thinks of you.

""If you want to break up, be an adult and break up. Don't invent some bullshit excuse to break up with me and try and claim it's my fault. For the last and final time, I did not nor have I ever cheated on you. If you cannot accept that, then our relationship is over."""
4,"I agree with the person suggesting the church, or other organizations which help with people who can't make it on their own. I live in the US so my knowledge is kind of based around here, otherwise I could give more specific suggestions 


You have a good heart and I am glad someone is looking out for this girl. Thank you for not judging someone harshly for being different and for understanding that being different is not a disease like some people seem to think. "
5,"God the temptation I would be fighting if I was OP to plant the seed that she isn't his first affair. They started right after his mum gave birth to his first child. Whenever they took a step in their relationship, mortgage, house, kids, it was almost like he reacted to the commitment with cheating. 'Mum had been looking at an extended holiday to recconect as the kids became adults and moved out.'.

But that would likely lock down access to dad even more and the baby. 

Edit: though if you can slip the following information to her naturally in conversation, like a mild complain session about your mum... 'ah mum is messaging me again, she isnt good with space. Totally controlling.  Same with dad tried to control when he could see family and friends, it may have been what broke down the relationship.' Obviously far more subtle than that... But I'm not writing several layers of dialogue for you.

A much younger side chick who managed to lure a married man away... I'm betting she is the type to fall into the constant need to prove that she is not like his ex wife.

Wait? Don't they talk? Won't it have to match what he says? No not really. She is likely hyper sensitive enough in her position not to to trust him to accurately describe his marriage. And he is unlikely to defend any negative representations of his ex."
6,"&gt;I asked him for anything in general to make these weekends more enjoyable and **he asked that we take time to go on a drive just the two of us for him to decompress.** So we're doing that, but it's not really what I was looking for.

That's your answer.

Your husband doesn't *want* to hang out in a big group with your college buddies.  He does it for you, but he doesn't enjoy it.  So stop trying to force him to interact with your friend group.

You go do you and hang out with them on your own.

Make sure you and your husband go out alone and do things together as well.

Is he an introvert and maybe that's part of why he's not a fan of these large group get togethers?"
7,"&gt; Anyway, I asked my husband a while ago where he'd like to move since I know he hates the state we currently live in. His choices were Texas, Florida, and Alabama.

Husband knew that he'd have to quit his job and was fine with it."
8,"I really want to rip your girlfriend for being inappropriate but... I just can't.  What she did was extremely hard for her, and I think she picked someone she knew she was comfortable with. I honestly don't think anything was up with this. I could be wrong completely but.... It just seems like she was naive. "
9,"I don't understand...does he plan to not get a job there? I don't see why the salary has to meet that level unless he plans to be unemployed.

You may want to sit him down and talk about the emotional cost of living where you are. You clearly have a very high emotional cost, and he doesn't see it - and it's elitist as hell to only focus on salary and ignore fulfillment. And it's hypocritical when he's limiting your moves to 3 places to fulfill *his* dreams.

Don't give up the job."
10,"Yeah, a friend got a tattoo a little bigger than this. He decided to do it when he was a young professional living downtown because he could keep his expenses down (no mortgage and didn't need a car yet). He spent 2-3 years going for a 4-5 hour appointment once a month and paying the equivalent of a car payment. This is a big investment of time and money."
11,"This. And if he threatens suicide again, call the local police department to check on him. That'll stop the suicide talk."
12,"&gt;I didn’t accuse her of anything

&gt;""I said I didn’t believe her""

You accused her of lying.

&gt;She’s lied to me about interactions with guys before

This is something you should have included in your post.

&gt;I still don’t see a better way of going about it.

You trust her, or you don't. You don't have the right to know everything in her life."
13,"Also depends on how close they are. Are they people he hangs out with regularly or are they people he only sees at the occasional get together or parties. I'd think it's the latter, because it's strange to me that these people would immediately start hitting on her at the first mention of breakup, rather than contacting their friend and asking if everything is ok. Maybe if it was a 1 month relationship or something, but ending a 4 year relationship usually results in  friend group support."
14,"Lots of excellent advice, and it’s definitely reminding me of many years ago when I first met my husband. There is a LOT about female sexuality and desire that is not covered in sex ed or popular media. In addition to u/relmamanick ‘s suggestion of “come as you are” I’ve heard good things about “she comes first” as a guide. The NY Times had an excellent article in 2009 explaining what scientists have and haven’t figured out about women’s desire - try googling “what do women want” by Daniel Bergner. 

Finally, something that helped me and my husband talk and explore was an openness for him to read the “romances” I liked (he was horrified to learn all those books his mom read were really soft core porn) and for me to look at the pornography he found exciting. It was a bit eye opening to see the differences between how male and female authors/photographers/film makers depict sex, romance, and desire in completely different ways. We also did things like read erotic fiction to each other. For us, and really for me, this was a “safe” way to explore different ideas, positions, fantasies while sorting out what I actually liked. 

Best wishes for you and your girlfriend, it can be a lovely journey to take together."
15,"OP's sister has blinders on too. I think she knows what's going on, yet she chooses to blame OP and not her creep bf."
16,"Hes picking up bad habits from coworkers and friends here, in my opinion. The only guys I know who act how you are describing are single bachelors or divorced dads. Sure, a lot of guys play video games and all people can be forgetful, but this is to a extremely selfish and immature degree. Its like he has suddenly forgotten there are two people in this marriage, and that he cant walk all over someone at the expense of their own happiness and mental wellbeing"
17,He understands. He’s just a jerk trying to make you think he’s not out to bone someone else. Drop this loser. Dodged a bullet there. Do you have time for these kinds of games? I sure don’t. 
18,"1. Alarm: this isn't cool. If she needs to wake up gradually, maybe look for some sort of vibrating alarm clock she can wear on her wrist. But this is the one example you gave that I would put my foot down about. I would probably tell her ""I'm going to start turning off the alarm when it goes off. Either get up the first time, or find a new solution.""
2. Kissing/sex: sounds like she just wanted to cuddle and kiss and wake up slowly. Nothing wrong with that. When you said ""Now I'm not in the mood so I'm getting up"" she probably felt like ""he doesn't think kissing/cuddling me is worth it if he's not going to get sex, and now he's irked and punishing me.""
3. Shower/chores/memory, etc: I can understand how some of this can be annoying, but this is just standard stuff. Any other human you live with will do things differently than you, will do things that bother you. As tempting as it is to think the other person is ""wrong/bad/stupid,"" you have to be humble about it. Part of marriage is letting this kind of stuff go, in my opinion. If you've talked to her multiple times and she doesn't seem capable of actually changing it (and you don't think she's ignoring you in order to upset you on purpose) then you have two choices: decide you can't live with her and leave, or accept it as part of the total package. Continuing to nag and gripe and resent her is bad for both of you. "
19,"That resentment your son is feeling towards your husband is going to roll onto you as well. This “unified front” is going to damage your relationship with your son as well. I’ll be honest, I wouldn’t want anything to do with either of you. I would be counting the days down until I was out and no contact. "
20,"&gt;  I would never ever discuss her weight, just that you want both of you to be healthy and start a new lifestyle. Good luck

She's almost 300 pounds. She's not an idiot. She *knows* OP will be referring to her weight. It's better to just be honest about how he feels instead of dancing around the real issue. 

I'd be more devastated if my partner secretly lost his attraction to me and never said a word. I'd be furious, because at least if he tells me I can do something to fix it. Sometimes honesty is the best motivator. "
21,"I think all of us had the misfortune of dating this guy once. I remember walking through the Met with my version and he was pointing paintings out--not obscure, Monet, etc--and slyly saying to me, do you know who painted that, honey? Like I was a child raised by wolves and he was edifying me with his (very basic) knowledge.

Anyway, yours sounds even more obnoxious than that. Dumpeth thy douche, you'll feel much better."
22,"Great and supportive people don't laugh when they find out a persons mom left them when they were kids.

It sounds like your sister and your friends are still part of that highschool-clique 'mean girls' type mentality and your boyfriend isn't one of the ""cool"" kids.

&gt; beginning to avoid hanging out with them because I feel judged.

That's because you're absolutely being judged. If they say those things about your bf to your face, I'm guessing they have similar, or worse, things to say about you and your choice of relationships behind your back. I'm willing to bet if you stand up for him and get mad they'll try to make it seem like they're just playing or joking and you should lighten up. Or use it as an excuse to push you out and so you can be with with your awkward and weird boyfriend away from them."
23,"This isn't a 20yo man thing. This is a 20yo thing.

There are just as many 20yo women who aren't interested in committing as there are men."
24,Call the police every time they scream. 
25,"He's the one who isn't being fair.  He's trying to go on vacation and stick you with the bill.  That's a crap way to treat a partner.

So tell him:  He either pays or he doesn't go.  It's that simple.  And it should give you an idea of the kind of person he is and whether you want to stay with someone who plays mental gymnastics and makes excuses why he's trying to make you pay for his expenses."
26,"I dated someone who refused for me to meet their parents or even mention me for years. It was a cultural and religious issue. I decided it wasn’t for me to be this hidden live in gf that had to leave my own home when his parents came to visit. 

Met someone later who was of the same culture and religion and was happy to introduce me to the family, who made every effort to accept me. 

So if you’re told it’s just a « cultural » thing. It’s not necessarily. Some families accept outsiders some don’t. Don’t avoid having the conversation even though it’s a tough one. You deserve respect. "
27,"90% agree. My only caveat is if dad falls off the wagon, he more than likely has a spare set of keys to the house. "
28,"Sex drive isn't really something a person can control. You're out of the honeymoon phase and her body is back to its ""normal"" sex drive.  She can't force herself to want more, unfortunately, just like you can't force yourself to be less interested in sex.

Sexual incompatibilities are a perfectly acceptable reason to end a relationship."
29,"She’s upset because it’s dawning on her that she probably chose her life partner poorly, seeing we how he has to remind himself to pay her any attention. I went through something similar, and it really sucks having to admit that your partner does not and probably will never desire you the way you need them to. No amount of therapy can fix some things."
30,"I suggest a doggy day care. Unfortunately, most require the dog to be fixed in order to stay and play.  If this is a no go with your partner, I would insist on a dog kennel to keep the dog in for when you are busy and unable to keep an eye on it. It sounds like this dog is causing a serious strain on the relationship and it would suck to end up at your breaking point and have to make your partner choose between you and the dog. "
31,"Sorry, you don't get to be above ""menial"" jobs when you have no income at all. Doubly so when they're likely the only jobs you'll get thanks to a big gap in your work history. Although I doubt it'd go over well if you told her that directly, I'd be tempted to say it anyway.

Either way, don't give into her, and don't enable her by giving her money. She can and likely will keep mooching off other people, but eventually she'll run out of willing targets and be forced to stand on her own two feet. I'd also make it clear that you are *not*(and never will be) her retirement plan, so she needs to figure something out for after her father passes.

She'll probably cry and stomp her feet about getting her free money cut off, but in the long run this is the kindest thing for her. She's perfectly capable of getting a job, and her situation will be much more stable in the long run if she gets one and learns to budget responsibly."
32,"People are weird about this; family even more so.

When my first husband died, my family assumed I was going to put on black bombazine and retire from normal life, and they've been pretty mean and rude about the fact that I didn't. I've had the same reaction from friends who knew me from when my first husband was alive--the idea that I would marry again was apparently just too shocking. "
33,NEVER stay for the kids. This ruins people. Your children will know very well that you actually hate each other and this will fuck them up for life. Show your children what a healthy relationship is after divorce. 
34,"It would have been polite if you texted her you were using her spot for a while to meet with a buyer for your car. Then you should have moved it. This was the second it happened. Her reaction was way over the top.

Some people have anger issues when their dose of Vyvanse it too high. She needs to discuss this with her doctor.

Since you are 3 equal roommates stop going through your brother. Talk to her like adults living together."
35,"I was actually confronted by “the other woman” in the past and I very much appreciated her honesty. It was a similar situation being that she had no idea he wasn’t single. It was really very empowering to hear the absolute truth about the situation. I can honestly say that i’m thankful she had the balls to confront me about it.

I hope this helps a little bit in your decision. I’m sorry you found yourself in this situation! Boys drool "
36,"I can see your wife's point of view.

Meeting your brothers and their entire families **every weekend** is *a lot*. That's a level of intensity that many families wouldn't be able to deal with, let alone people who aren't original members of the family. Not to mention that if you have anything resembling a normal schedule (work 5 days a week, 9-5) then that's a huge, time-consuming priority. 

I'd add that if you want/expect people to put this much time into being with you, you need to facilitate it for them by integrating them into the conversation, etc. It sounds like your family doesn't realize they're not actually that welcoming."
37,"OP I think you should add this bit to your original post. Most people responding assume you haven’t met the friends and they’re going to clubs etc. and drink.

I’d have a conversation and try to find a compromise and balance. E.g.: she can go out with them twice a week still but maybe be back at one. You can go out with your mates with the same framework and you keep inviting each other, telling each other where you are and then tell each other what fun you each had. And then maybe parallel do more outings or fun stuff as a couple. Maybe that’s balance this out a bit.

I knew my relationship needed more care and that wasn’t happy when idealised that I enjoyed dinner, deep conversations and drinks with friends more than being home with him. So we have started to do more together (outings), but I also keep those friendships and dinners going, as they are so good for me as a person."
38,"Holy shit, wtf did I just read? If you can't date, don't freaking go on dates! 

&gt; Did I reject him? 

Well, no, actually, you invited him to go on a road trip to a cabin and have sex in a hot tub. Then you said you would call him.

He's expecting to hear from you, so text and say, ""It was nice to see you again, but I'm not interested in seeing you further."" Then don't respond to anything he says, unless you want to have that whole stupid conversation again and end up inviting him to Rome for a gang bang."
39,"Your wife's libido fell because she was stressed with being the sole breadwinner and likely figuring out how to keep your household afloat. This happens to many people - when life has turned upside-down, their sex drive plummets. 

The worst thing you can do is shame them for their lack of sex drive, or try to guilt them about it, which seems to be precisely what you did. It almost seems like you're trying to punish her.

I would suggest you both go see a therapist together and learn how to communicate about this issue. I'm of the mindset that very few relationships are unsalvageable, and that it's almost always worth trying. You owe it to not only her, but yourself, to try to work through this."
40,"&gt;I told her that we were losing the thing that defined us as a couple.

Man, if my SO said that to me it would for sure kill whatever libido I had left. You spent so much effort for sex, did you try doing things to lessen her stress? Did you start doing more around the house, cook dinner, anything?"
41,"I think you posted with your main, OP."
42,"Honestly, if this came out when I just made the stupid ass eggs for him, I wouldn't mind so much, but like I said, I've made these gosh darn eggs for family parties, enough for 50+ people several times a year through the course of our marriage with no help from him. Hours I've spent boiling damn eggs and whipping them up. It's not hard at all and if I asked for a hand, he'd mess them up. I am pissed."
43,"If you're able to read your post from a third person's perspective, you'd see the answer can be pretty obvious.

The bottom line that I saw was she doesn't know what she wants. How can you go all out on blocking and removing someone from your life and then pull a 180? I'll tell you, she got what she wanted, ""to be free"", and it hit that it isn't as fun or as easy as she thought.

She wants the safer option and that's to be back with you, but this is just a set up for an unhealthy on-again-off-again relationship - or a light switch relationship.

Keep doing you and let her find a way to figure out what she wants."
44,"Sounds to me like Janice needs to put her foot down and make her husband grow up. But that's a totally different thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Best thing you can do, and this may hurt your friendship, is tell her the exact reason you don't like to go over there."
45,"'Hey, I accidentally overheard your conversation with fiancee the other day and it made me feel really sad. I am honoured that you asked me to be your best man and I am looking forward to that. I hope you don't regret your decision but if you do, please tell me directly.'

Something like this. You are NOT too ugly to be in you brother's wedding photos. Cerebral palsy doesn't make you any less of a human or any less of a brother. It definitely doesn't mean people have a right to disrespect you. You are self-sabotaging. Don't try to assume what your brother is really thinking. The most mature way to handle this is to talk to him. You are not shielding him from anything if you stay silent and suffer on your own.

The talk doesn't have to involve his fiancée's words at all. You just make sure you two are on the same page regarding his wedding and your role in it.

You are owed respect!"
46,"I like what you've done, can I suggest an amendment?

""I have self-respect"": Dump him and any future pigs and hold yourself and your boyfriends to high (and equal) standards.

""I have no self-respect"": Dump him and seek therapy to help you regain your self respect. "
47,Situational depression is a thing and needs be taken seriously.  You really should make time to see a doctor about how you are feeling.  Make an appointment and let your job know not to schedule you for that time. They won't mind if you let them know before the make that week's schedule. 
48,"Sooooooo . . . I was groomed/molested by my mother when I hit puberty. Luckily, when I was 14, I physically fought her off until she stopped. I've been in therapy ever since.

When I have nightmares, they often take the form of an alternate history in which I never realized what was going on, never set boundaries with her, and never moved out. My subconscious will often throw in weird adult baby shit/over the top infantilization just to make it all the more terrifying.

To sum up: for me, a person molested by her mother, your brother's situation is literally the stuff of nightmares.

I really, really, really hope that this post is fake. For your sake. And for your brother's sake.

If not?

Get yourself a really good therapist. You're going to need one for the days ahead.

And if it's at all possible, financially support yourself from here on out. You don't need to stay in your mother's house ever again. Do you have any other relatives or a support network you can reach out to?"
49,"Well for one, schizophrenia often emerges in the early twenties. Thyroid issues, hormonal imbalances, all kinds of generally treatable things could cause paranoia, including someone actually following you. It never hurts to go to the doctor for a quick checkup, you're probably due anyway if you're anything like all the twenty-somethings I know. If you're healthy, then you know your gut is actually trying to tell you something and you can move forward from there."
50,He already knows this 
51,"He's the father and the court is going to give him rights to that child. If you go to family court, when he asks for custody he will be presumed to be a fit parent and will likely get joint custody. Abusive partners frequently use the courts to continue to control and abuse their victims after they leave. Do you want to be tied to him for 18 years? Without a documented history of physical abuse the courts tend to believe that abuse histories are being made up for advantage. It's happened to me and other women I know. 

You may be attached to this child and not want an abortion and that's your choice. But just know that if you go after him for support, or let him know about this child, chances are you will end up in a joint custody situation with this man and have to spend the next 18 years co-parenting with him. Family court has done nothing but exacerbate my PTSD. But they will see the situation as being about the child's ""right"" to have a father even if he's an abusive POS and having him in their life will do more harm than good."
52,"I mean, 16 year olds in the US can become emancipated minors. One of my friends in highschool did it to get away from his parents. If able, sister can help finance it."

54,"The 401k covers it. Period. She worked very hard for that money and it doesn't sound to me like he deserves a penny given the chaos and harm he caused her and the family. 







He was denied Medicare because he has assets you don't know about.

56,"I had this with my great grandparents, they were super important to my mom but I only ever saw them once a year. When they passed, she was bawling and I felt so terrible that I joined her. Funerals suck and you shouldn't feel bad for being emotional during them."
57,I agree. The most positive spin I can put on this is maybe he is angling to collect disability so he never has to work again but can still get paid. 
58,"You have an extremely negative view about working. I don't know anyone who works 90 hours a week. You must run with a very driven crowd. Most Americans work 40 hours a week.

60,"You are not responsible for his emotions. Your crying does not somehow give him permission to yell at you. I also feel like this is almost bordering on emotional abuse, and I say this as a survivor of a relationship where I was emotionally - and eventually physically - abused. 

Saying that you should just know how to act or respond to him and additionally not telling you what he needs when you ask is manipulative as hell, also. He’s portraying himself as a victim in a situation that he caused. Lots of us have been shoved/had our space invaded by others and kept our cool. It’s the adult thing to do. And playing it as though he’s being protective of you? Dear god, that just screams bullshit. 

TBH, I’d break up with him. There are a lot of red flags in what you’ve just described. And my partner now is one of the most caring, gentle people I’ve ever known. He’s made me realize that being with the right person really brings out the best version of yourself. And it doesn’t sound like this guy even comes close to that. "
61,"Rebounds don't really work like that. There's no set time frame. Somebody could be years out and still rebounding, somebody else could start a new relationship on day 2 of being single and get married to that person.

62,"Holy extra unnecessary details. 

&gt; Am I in the right (as my friends would say) or am I wrong for breaking up with him for how he is and not for wronging me personally?

So you can pretty much take this question and throw it out of the closest window to you. You **never** need a reason to break up with someone other than you no longer want to be in a relationship with them. Anyone that tells you otherwise is an asshole. "
63,"Your friends can’t sit back and watch you potentially get hurt again - they can say how they feel and if it’s easier for them to break contact than watch another disaster happen, it’s their choice. 

If you genuinely think a relationship of any kind can be salvaged with this person, so be it. But don’t expect the friends who supported you in the bad times to be okay. If the roles were switched could you watch a friend take back someone who mentally and physically abused them? "

Just fade out of her life and block her on everything. Try not to be caustic, as you already have evidence she stalked and went crazy in the past.

70,"The argument against this is that your daughter chose the lower paid path, why should you and your husband pay extra/subsidize/reward her choice?  What if she ends up earning less over her lifetime, are you going to leave more money to her in your will?     

But back to your original question: yes, your son is not going to forget this.  Ask your husband if he is prepared for what life is going to be after your son gets his degree - holidays without his son, grandchildren he will not be close to, etc. over what amounts to pocket money now."

72,"he's testing his boundaries with you. yes, it's a shitty thing to do but you're going to need to reassert them again if he's worth it to you. and he might think just because you didn't say anything after he started up again, it means you don't care anymore. "

Step 2 is to get support. If that’s a friend, a family member, or a personal therapist, great, whatever feels right to you. Know, however, that on the very slim chance you’re able to work through this with your husband, confiding in a friend or family member will *permanently* torch that person’s opinion of your husband. Only go that route if you know in your heart that you’re done. 

Step 3 is to breathe. Your husband needs to give you space to think. As much as you require. No more tearful apologies or begging or desperate promises. He needs to back *all the way* off while you process this and decide what to do. If you can’t handle making a decision until after your child is born, fine. Take that time for yourself. 

Treat this like a sudden loss. Because it is - the husband you thought you knew is dead. If you decide to continue this marriage, you’ll be getting to know a whole new person. It will be a different relationship, with a different dynamic and new rules that will take time to work out. And you may not love this new relationship enough to stay in it. Chew on that for a while, and grieve for what you used to have. You don’t have to make any final decision right now so don’t feel pressure to do so. It’s a hard thing you’re facing, and you’re human. The right path isn’t always clear to us immediately. "
75,"&gt; I read it like she is assuming a lot and putting her needs above his. 

Did you read the part where *she* is drowning in debt?  IOW, he apparently doesn't consider her debt as *their* debt.  She has an opportunity to better herself and their shared situation in the long run and you are calling *her* selfish?"
76,What’s with your post history? Are you cheating on your wife?
77,"You're having meltdowns, hint that you are overly dependent on him, the two of you aren't having much sex, and he wants to live around the world from where you want to live.

I'm just pointing all of this out to ask 

1) Do you think you're ready for a relationship - ANY relationship?

2) Do you think that it makes sense to be in relationship with this particular person?"
78,"Time to go the RD.  An RA is just a student looking for free R&amp;B.  Sometimes they are great at dealing at stuff like this, lots of the time they are completely useless at handling conflict.  Hence, why they leaked OP's private conversation."
79,"Shes not ""immature"", she's a teenaged girl. Drama and confusing feelings about boys is exactly within the realm of reasonable maturity. 

**Edit:** I didn't say that the ""friend"" was right, just that this is the type of normal drama and bs that teenaged girls have to navigate. OP has done nothing wrong, and hopefully her friend learns an important lesson. "
80,"You have a choice here, OP. You can either stand with the victims this guy has been sexually harassing and say in no uncertain terms that you don't tolerate that kind of behavior from your friends, or you can minimize his behavior and it's affect on your other friends, continue to let him be your friend and live with you, and continue to be an enabler who is low-key condoning his behavior. 

Because by not telling this guy he's an absolute fucking creep and is no longer a friend of yours, you're telling him that what he did wasn't *that* bad and, even though you're mad at him about it, you're okay with him doing it."
81,"Try going to therapy yourself, and see if that will encourage her to go as well. Sometimes just talk therapy (not medicine too) can do the trick. My best friend doesn’t respond wel to medicine, but talking therapy has been good for her"
82,Also OP make sure they didn't make copies of your keys.
83,Dump her dump her dump her
84,"Break up with him immediately and take a pregnancy test.

Someone who is trying to change your life so drastically (new baby and said responsibility for the next ~20 years) against your wishes and against your will is NOT someone you should stay with."
85,I've been in a similar situation in the past. I discovered my ex was lying about everything (even crazy little stuff) and I realised I had been taken for a ride in terms of finance. I realised that none of the money I had lent over the years was coming back in spite of promises to help me rebuild the money that had been taken. In the end I was about £6k down and I have never had a single penny back. I hate to say it but it's extremely unlikely your husband will change and its best just to cut your losses and leave.  
86,"Yeah of course he'd apologise! No surprise there. He wouldn't want any consequences now, would he? Photograph your injuries for evidence. I'd have gone to the police already. And leave, as your life is in danger. 

Also, for future reference, milestones like moving house together is when the mask of an abuser slips. Don't be another statistic.

edit: And take the cat with you to protect it."
87,"**Your boyfriend is abusive.**

You cannot convince him that it's not a big deal for you to talk to your family because he already knows it's not a big deal, the reason he's doing this is because he's abusive - the whole purpose of him doing this is to isolate you from your family and from anyone else, it is to berate and punish you so you lose all self-value thus you will be less likely to leave him, this is about him maintaining control over you and it will continue. It is very likely that his abusive behavior will become worse, not just the controlling behavior and emotional/psychological abuse but he may also become violent.

You need to think about finding a way to get out of this relationship.

Let your family know *exactly* what's happening asap, they can help."
88,"&gt; hit a few times

Get. Out. Now.

I guarantee your anxiety is caused by being WITH him, not being AWAY from him.

That aside, you need to get out immediately. GO BACK TO YOUR PARENTS. "
89,[removed]
90,"Does he need money?

Offer to buy the pigs off him, then sell them to recoup the losses? 

Nuclear option, set your phone to record, talk to him again, if he threatens violence, go to parents, or even police. 

Hell, even just threatening him with it might work, but I don't know your family."
91,Gradual fades don't work on people like this.  It's either all or nothing.
92,"As much as I dislike the smell of cigarette smoking you are handling it respectfully in my opinion.  It appears that you are feeling the tension and rejection.  You are within your rights so bottom line your smoking is these neighbors problem, not yours.  It will probably continue to be an issue if you live close to anyone.  "
93,"I used to be like this when I was a teenager; kind of insecure about having a crush on someone in case they weren’t cool or popular enough and it reflected poorly on me. As soon as someone else would crush on or date them, they became a million times more attractive to me, both because of the added validation and because jealousy can make you yearn for people. 

In any case your friend is being really unfair. She said she didn’t have feelings for him, and is now changing her tune. Sit down with her and talk, and if she doesn’t come around then maybe leave the friendship on standby for a while. I grew out of it eventually. "
94,"Even if he had a perfectly valid reason for not wanting to do oral, he tried to turn it around and make *you* the problem for having been with other men before him, like you’re “damaged goods” or something.

This is a very valuable insight into how he sees women, and you in particular. It’s a very red flag, and you’ll do yourself no favors by sweeping it under the rug or trying to make up a more pleasant reason for it."
95,So it sounds like it's about more than the eggs here.
96,[deleted]
97,"It is just an excuse I think he has a pee fetish and loves thinking about her bathing in his ""dirty inside water"". I would check his search history. But first dump him."
98,"Nah this guy ain’t friend material. Cut him off and stop talking to him, he wants to keep you on a string and keep your hopes up that eventually he’ll wanna commit but he never will. Don’t listen to his weird manipulative crap. Cut off contact ASAP "
99,"Wow, this is amazing advice! Yes, tell them it was a false alarm, quietly have the procedure done and dump this guy completely /u/Helppppppmeee"
100,"Exactly.  The dog also sounds like he is too big for the space and the amount of exercise/stimulation he gets.

OP needs to make her boyfriend understand this is a requirement and not optional.

Also, he should definitely have the dog neutered!  OP, no offense, but your boyfriend just sounds like a lazy dog owner!"
101,"&gt;I texted my boyfriend immediately saying it was over because he's still on Tinder and here's where it gets insane. He responded that his best mate has apparently been chatting on Tinder with a girl from my country and living in my current city. My coworker's housemate is from my country, which is super rare. It honestly wouldn't surprise me that she would get on with my boyfriend's best mate. I know she has friends that live in his town and is there from time to time, because she said that's why his profile came up straight straight away. Anyway -- when my boyfriend's mate went on about her, he thought immediately thought I was being a catfish so apparently he decided to download Tinder at the festival to try to catch me

Girl, no. "
102,[deleted]
103,"That’s a compromise I’m hoping for, but I think she wants the satisfaction of seeing that money go to the organization.  Need to confirm "
104,"I think you should start with talking about his well being in general, and not start with mentioning the injuries. People harm for different ressons and many feel ashamed about the behaviour. This might make them reluctant to talk about it openly. I had my brother ask me straight up about my scars recently which worked out fine because I hadn't harmed for a while but if the injuries are new, I think you have to be more careful. "
105,The only searching for these symptoms happened the night of the argument. That's another reason I'm suspicious. If there was a longer history of searches like that (and behavior like yesterday) then I wouldn't be doubtful.
106,[deleted]
107,"There is nothing inappropriate about this. Is there a reason why he thinks this is inappropriate, or is his answer just “because I say so”? 

It’s for work. Also, does this mean you can’t have guy friends? "
108,"&gt; “are you throwing away your entire future for a boy?”

""No, I'm throwing away YOUR expectations of my future in favor of my own.""

Follow the path that will lead to you living a fulfilling life. No one else has to walk in your shoes, so why should they get a say in how your live your life? Ultimately, your parents want to see you succeed, but how they define success and how you define success is completely different. You know yourself better than anyone else does, so you're really the only one qualified to make the choice that is best for you."
109,Didn’t OP say that he can relocate and continue his mission that’s why he gave the options because they have the same space company?
110,"Ya seriously the poor mom. If my dad did this to my mom I'd never see him again, and I'm very close with my father."
111,"Like how does him being a ""joker"" make it okay for him to walk up and grab the ass of his friend's gf that he just met???"
112,"He wants to be your mentor and savior etc. He doesn't want you to actually fix yourself or be happy. I get that this guy helped you but how did a 24 year old come to be the mentor of a 15 year old? 



he may have been a help to you but I don't think he's ready for you to leave the nest so to speak. 

"
113,"No money, no friendship.
Money, no friendship.

They showed you who they are.  If you get the money will you truly be able to move on or will you always be wondering just how they'll try to turn things against you next?"
114,"&gt; He says he appreciates that I come from a solid background and can show him a different side to life

There you go. He’s told you that this is his background

It’s possible that as a younger man he didn’t realize these kinds of women were abnormal. Maybe he thought *because* this was his background he didn’t deserve better. 

I wouldn’t judge him too harshly for it just make sure it all stays in the past. "
115,"Yes. 

It sucks your pet is dying but you're choosing to stay away from your apartment. She has nothing to do with that decision. Why should she have to pay money to you to finance your life choices? It's frankly entitled for you to ask her to reimburse you for rent because you won't be there through no fault of hers. "
116,[deleted]
117,"He’s untrustworthy, and you’re creating fake profiles to catch him. This is so obviously unhealthy. Two months is all you’ve invested - walk away and find something that actually works. "
118,"Yikes - since when did pointing out that it's ok to want a partner who demonstrates empathy, good decision- making, and respect for others' relationships constitute being part of a ""hate train""?

It's honestly terrifying how you try to paint her devotion to him as a positive thing.  I'm mean, it's actually astounding.  She left him when she realized that they had no future together, when she came up understand he wouldn't leave his wife and two kids for her. 

**She stayed when that was a possibility, BECAUSE it was what she hoped for.**  Let me say that again - she WANTED him to break up his family for her.  And you're trying to portray her as some kind of model of fidelity.  Unbelievable. 

""Lapse of judgment"" is a hell of a way to describe a three-year period ending about one year ago.  The past is not some random thing.  It is a part of us, as it demonstrates how we behave - not how we say we'd behave - when we're put in certain real-life situations.

Op, ignore reality at your peril.  Those bending over backwards to insist that a homewrecker who they've never met has truly changed, and loves you, and will be the perfect spouse - they are not going to be suffering when this all blows up in your face. "
119,You and Alex should take a DNA test. 
120,This post meant SO much to me. I loved my dick before (A LOT). I thought it was the best thing in the world. Need to work my way back up to that one day. Thank you for your kind words. 
121,"You don't even need to tell her how you found out.  You know what you saw.  She may try to instill doubt in your mind but rest assured there are better fish in the sea for you my friend.  Take the moral high ground rather than getting too worked up, if possible."
122,"""You agreed to date nights once a week. I'm not asking for *more* from you, I'm asking for what you agreed to."""
123,"I agree that it can be upsetting to watch your partner be upset and process things on their own, but eventually you have to trust your partner and *give them a few days* of being upset on their own to deal with things.

I personally find it extremely irritating if I'm being quiet, upset, or even depressed, and someone else starts telling me how I'm being unfair to them because I won't open up and it's making *them* feel bad.

Partners need to learn boundries and respect wishes. ""I'm processing something a friend told me, and it's rough. I'm sorry my being quiet or moody is upsetting you, but I swear it's not about you and this isn't my secret to tell."" I think that should be enough. Not making life for the partner who's already dealing with another persons issues difficult by making them take on your issues too."
124,"People tend to act this way partly due to the fact that they know they can’t lose you. Like he can speak to you anyway he likes and not have to worry about you leaving. The best way to make him realize this is to leave, just temporarily at first, then he’ll see that he in fact can’t speak to you however he feels "
125,"Dude you're spiraling. 

This could have been the start of that conversation youre upset that you haven't had. It was not some degree from on high saying this is the only way. 

He clearly cares about you for you. And as someone who's done his side of supporting partners financially I know I didn't do it for any motive beyond this is someone I care about, I don't want them homeless. 

And your last paragraph is a false dichotomy, with the second option being insane. 

Can you book an emergency appointment with your therapist?"
126,He did it to himself
127,"A friend of mine was in a similar situation only he was meeting people on Craigslist and bringing them into their home while he was watching their child. 

She immediately filed for divorce. He endangered their child and her health by having sex with all of these people. It was hard for a while. It was such a betrayal but she is now a happy single mother. 

Only you can decide what you are willing to work through and what is a deal breaker.  This wasn’t a one time thing. Can you really trust that he won’t do it again?  Do you want this as an example for your child?
"
128,no no no... you absolutely should see an attorney before you tell him. Get your plans in place. 
129,"&gt; however he has said that he views me as an adult even though we started talking when I was 17


How does that help in any way? Ofcourse the dude wanting to fuck a teen is going to say that. He'd have said that to a 14 year old too. 



The fact that he saw a 17 year old as an adult is the problem. "
130,"&gt;  I am now thinking to be honest this was a feeling of dread because I would be stuck with her.

Didn't need to read the rest of it.  This here is enough to break things off.  Also, she wants to have kids soon, don't drag things out a few more years and then dump her.  Just end it, and let each of you get on with your lives."
131,"Good people can make mistakes, but is this really a mistake? This is a series of deliberate actions that your friend and this man are taking to go behind his dying wife's back.

What if your friend stays with this man? What if they get married a few years from now after his wife dies? Could you attend the wedding knowing that this is the kind of man to duck out of a relationship when things get hard?

If your friend gets hurt she honestly deserves it. She's a 30-something year old woman who knows exactly what she's getting herself into. "
132,"They’d have to be suuuuper distinctive tbh. I wouldn’t even recognise my best friends nudes in that situation and I’ve seen her naked more than a handful of times (am also a woman, we get changed together sometimes)"
133,"If this is what comes next then OP can call the police. They shouldn't have to stay in their apartment all the time  to avoid this person and be guilted into giving into Friendly.

Friendly  has some issues, but they are not OP's problem to solve. I'm sure at 30 years old, Friendly has dealt with people all their life who do not like her behaviour. But there is no reason why OP shouldn't instill some boundaries.

If things do go south to the point where Friendly starts destroying things and being passive aggressive, then it's time for OP to call the landlord and police. "
134,"It’s probably “Hey guys I’m part of a revenge porn group and what I’m pretty sure is my gf posted a nude on there. The tits and vagina seem similar. I’m not 100% because I look at lots of porn, but I’ve confronted her about it and she’s straight up in denial. I told her my friend sent it to me because she would freak if she knew I was part of this group. (It’s a guy thing, whatever) how do I get her to admit that she posted it and not that I’m just projecting? I made her show me her phone and nothing was there. She probably deleted the photo. That’s what I do. She asked to see the photo but I can’t show her because obviously my friend didn’t send it. Help!” "
135,"So you’re constantly throwing pie in the sky wacky and irresponsible ideas at her that would disrupt her life as well as your child’s life. You complain about doing things with your wife and child, but go along with it begrudgingly. Family time is a burden. Now your new idea is ditching your wife and child, that you complain about spending time with, to go away for a few days with someone else. 

You need to get a grip on reality. "
136,"He's projecting. Really hard. He's projecting so hard that there isn't much more he could say to you than, ""I'm still flirting with other girls"". 
You can do better. You should. "
137,Just stop paying for the phone under her name and get your own. 
138,"If you ever go back, there are a couple of nice ways that end the interaction with goodwill on all sides. The first is to prevent an interaction. Put your index finger to your lips in the shh gesture, then put your hands together in the prayer position and bow your head. Smile gently, communicate goodwill with the eyes.

This second one ends the interaction. Bright smile, all of a sudden, hand out for the handshake, say quickly ""Nice to meet you bye!""

These two have never failed me (outside the cases of drunken arseholes or the clearly nefarious), and everybody leaves feeling quite good about things and not ruining their day. "
139,"She isn't interested and you need to respect that. If you can honestly be a friend without ulterior motives and support her when she starts dating again, do that. If you can't, pull back from this friendship for a while. "
140,"&gt; threatens to leave me

lol leave him, gets you away from the locking-out and nullifies his only threat."
141,"I think more good questions for the OP to ask himself (in addition to your excellent list) are:

- if the situation were reversed, how would i want my partner to treat me? Am i treating them as i would want to be treated?
- which of us is more vulnerable to harm in this situation? are we doing things in a manner that the more vulnerable partner is protected and secure?
- do the choices or decisions i make affirm to my partner that i love respect and accept them for who they are, and support them in achieving their goals in life?"
142,"Wait. What about when you're not doing an errand. Do you ever get to just be home, relaxing, while he watches the kid? Because the answer sounds like ""no.""

Yes, but you don't want to do Pilates or Yoga. He could be find with mountain biking but if that's something you don't want to do, it doesn't matter. "
143,He’s one of the “poor people should just get better jobs” type of folk. It’s so easy to talk.
144,"And then what does he do?  

He needs to set firm boundaries with them, and then enact consequences when they trample the boundaries.  "
145,"You know what? You are right. She just told me that I can ""go complain to my mother in law or live with it. People have to just live with these kinds of jokes.""

I'm done. "
146,"Yeah, OP, send her a card, no gift, with your congratulations and move on with your life. Just because she's getting married doesn't mean she gets a free pass to be a shitty person. Don't waste your time or money on her. You have a mom and a possible new kiddo!"
147,"You should truly be commended.  To have accomplished this at a relatively young age when that sort of knowledge and control is often lacking is really amazing.  I believe this is especially true because I am sure you have had a variety of bad habits that stem from you mom that really needed to be broken.  Doing it at that age will be beneficial long into the future.  Continue to tell your mother that she is wrong, and also let anyone else who shows concern for you know the same.  Don't let anyone take away what an incredible accomplishment this is for you!"
148,"That’s a pile of nonsense and you know it. I very much dislike dogs. I dislike their mannerisms, needs, and how they look. I know that people dislike cats too, and I don’t mind it (cat lady here). There’s a huge culture of dog worship and I just don’t get it. 

Not all dogs like humans either. "
149,"You let her know that you're an adult and you've chosen a wife. You will side with your wife and defend her from all insults including from mother. You tell her that you will never side with her with anything negative she has to say about your wife. If she can't be bothered to show a modicum of respect to your family, then you won't expose them to that.

Don't engage with a discussion or just aw mom don't be mean. You have to clearly state you have started a family she can either support you and your family or not be a part of it. Your dad is a big boy and can choose. "
150,A medical issue where he has no trouble getting off but can't be arsed to return the favor? That's a new one...
151,"Thank you for your great reply! I'll try my best to reply on my phone.
I do think he believes offering to move in will help me out and is coming from kindness. But it'll help him far more than it'll help me. We would split the house, he has quite a bit of stuff. We haven't talked about decorating or changing stuff in the house but I honestly don't even want to talk about that. It's my house! So he wouldn't have a say. This just sounds like an absolutely horrible idea to me now. 
It seems we do have very different values. If I were in his position I wouldn't even entertain the idea. 

"
152,Yup. This 100%. She used the heart attack scare as a BS excuse. If I were in this situation I don’t know if I’d be able to repair the broken trust here because this is SUPER serious. 
153,"I feel like we DID have the gf's version of this post maybe 2 weeks ago. She was furious, he swore up and down he didn't do anything, she was wondering what to do?

Nvm - [it was very similar, but not the same people](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95ynit/23f_my_boyfriend_25m_of_4_years_cheated_and_gave/)."
154,"I'm sorry you are going through this, but wow - I mean, you ignored everyone's advice a year ago, why ask again? Or are you ready to listen now?

I can't improve on this reply to your question from last year:

&gt;*How do you break up with someone knowing they are probably going to die of an overdose?*  
&gt;  
&gt;By realising that it would also happen if you stayed together.

Just walk away, dude, like you should have done a year or more ago. You'll NEVER stop suffering until you do. You've  got to a point where you are literally hoping *a baby dies -* because it's better than the mess she's created - I can't imagine that level of desparation you are feeling. You keep going back for more, and getting sucked in deeper and deeper. Save yourself. Just walk away. Walk away."
155,"OP is young, nervous &amp; probably not experienced in taking pregnancy tests. I doubt that anyone would question her if she stated that didn’t fully understand how to use the tests &amp; misinterpreted the results. "
156,"She's being passive aggressive and immature, but at the same time no one likes to hear ""I want to see you less."" You guys are approaching 30, she might be hoping for something long term, marriage etc. You saying you don't want to be together all time probably didn't bode well to these dreams (if someone wants to see me less I would assume they also don't want to cohabitate anytime soon). 

You are allowed to have your own expectations and she can have her's, but yeah this might turn into an irreconcilable problem. 

You say you want to keep things ""special and exciting,"" that's well and good, but you might find many people at your age are looking for a stable partnership rather than excitement."
157,"He is abusive, OP.  He uses the threat of breaking up as a way to control you.  He is also condescending, manipulative and cruel with his words.  And this is in the honeymoon phase.  If you stay with him, this WILL escalate into more and worse kinds of abuse.  He knows what he is doing to hurt you and does it on purpose.  He likes to control you and enjoys making you scared.  Please leave him."
158,"&gt;And she has a child. Children come first.

The correct way of putting your children first is by not scheduling dates on days when your child will hinder them.

Her excuse, ""it would be easier if I didn't cook tonight as have Max and that will mean I'm cooking twice which I don't want to do really - esp as off to theatre this afternoon,"" appears to consist entirely of information that she would have already known the day before, which is when she confirmed these plans. And it's not really an excuse: she can cook dinner for OP, shed just rather not.

That's not prioritizing her son, it's just bad planning and zero foresight."
159,"I don’t really think that’s being unreasonable tbh. He can do his own laundry and he can ride a bike to work or Uber or something. It’s unreasonable for a 20-something to expect their parents to chauffeur them to and from work. I understand it happens, but it’s unreasonable. 

EDIT: for what it’s worth, I really like my mom’s fiancé, but I’d be uncomfortable asking him to pick me up from anywhere. And although he likes me, I bet he’d be ticked if he had to do it regularly. Once in awhile? Sure! The kid might not even be comfortable asking you to pick him up."
160,"It isn’t fine. I was a wife in a situation like this. It destroyed me, my self esteem, self confidence, and that’s the tip of the iceberg. I am still broken. I spent years trying to work it out with my husband. Years in tears, being gaslighted, lied to, and abandoned in my marriage. I was independent, successful, highly educated, had a great life with family and friends. Now my kids have a shell for a mom who goes through the motions and lives in fear of having the rug pulled out from under her yet again. Finding out what you think is real isn’t is damaging. Why would you consider a relationship with someone who participated in that? "
161,"The only way to successfully move past infidelity is if the partner that cheated shows remorse and is fully truthful. She was obviously lying to you during counseling since you just learned about this, and even now, instead of having learned anything from counseling, she is continuing to hide, deflect, and fan your fears. This relationship is over. You will never be able to trust her, because the only thing that she will ever admit to is what you will be able to discover on your own, and it will be like pulling teeth getting her to tell you the truth.

Since she's still fighting you on this instead of being honest, you can be certain that she physically cheated on you. Lawyer up, save all of that evidence, make copies, and get an STD test."
162,"I have but from what I've read they're all pretty high risk. They also usually require you to lose some weight and maintain that loss for a few months before the surgery to show you're serious because you have to follow strict diet guidelines after the surgery or you'll be in a lot of pain. That weeds out the people who can't commit to a healthier diet...which seems to be my husband. At least, when it comes to longterm effort nothing has materialized so far. Just a lot of attempts and relapses.

The other issue is I can't monitor him all the time. Sure, I myself don't buy any junk food for the house and don't serve him huge portions, but when he's on his own he will do these things. 

Ultimatum time has crept into my mind. Tbh I don't know if I could follow through when it came down to it. I also don't know that it wouldn't send him into a binge spiral rather than motivating him. It's just a lot to consider. Thank you for the thoughts."
163,Call your local Legal Aid. Perhaps they can help.
164,"Keep Granny away until she decides to respect your rules of parenting. 

Ask your husband, why a disrespectful, toxic grandparent is better than none at all? I grew up with a grandpa I disowned, and never felt the lack. "
165,"You're right, I fixed it. I still don't think he should have lied, though. She was letting her daughter's boyfriend live with them rent free until she found out he was blowing most of his money on presents. In the mom's place, I'd feel taken advantage of and would check in with him too."
166,"When I was 18 I barely knew anything about my body, and I expected the guy to know how to get me off. Unfair, I know. But women are taught very little about their own bodies in school, in the media, or even in porn. What I would do is head over to the /r/sex sub Reddit and start reading. Ask questions there if you have any. It can be a non judgmental place. 

One thing that I would like to let you know is that penis in vagina sex rarely brings a woman to orgasm on its own. It’s a common misconception perpetuated mainly by porn."
167,"&gt; I'm always the family peacemaker and I'm angry that I feel this internal pull to resolve the situation.

No dude. It's not up to you to resolve the situation. She threw a shitbomb into your relationship, it's not your job to clean up her mess. 

Would an apology from her really make you feel better? I doubt you'll be able to get a sincere one out of her. How about giving yourself a gift: the gift of freeing yourself of the responsibility of being peacemaker. Of having to fix this.

Block her number. Tell your siblings what she said. Vent to your wife. There's no need to explain to your sister that you're upset because she knows: her whole objective was to upset you! So cut her toxicity out of your life. Don't answer her calls. 

Relationships are a two-way street. If she doesn't want to contribute in a positive way to your relationship, then it's not up to you to do it for her."
168,"Those aren't morals, those are values.

Now I'm not Mr. Rogers but I personally don't know how someone could sleep charging their own family ABOVE market price because they are ""desperate"" for it..

&gt;Maybe these examples are not the most illustrative but she generally has zero issues with something that is morally wrong and questionable as long as it serves her purpose. I’m pretty sure she’d snitch on her own mother if there’s something in for her.

So would she snitch on her own BF if it served her purpose?

169,"I have longer, darker hair and wear earrings/other jewelery and she doesn't, in general we have a pretty different sense of style. We're identical in face/body (I'm a little taller) but aside from that very different. No one else in our lives have any issues telling us apart."
170,"It's possible that her family has made her paranoid about being taken advantage of, but I think you made it very clear that that was not your intent. 

Regardless, you were definitely being manipulated. 

I have a family member who is very manipulative and it always takes the form of distress and indecisiveness. She just agonizes about things all the time until someone finally implores her to do the thing she wanted to do all along. Often, this thing is bad or hurtful to the person she is manipulating, but she still makes them convince her to do it, resisting all the way and making a huge show about not wanting to do it.

You can always tell when you are being manipulated because as soon as you put your foot down and offer the solution that they want to hear, they magically stop going in circles. Anything other than that will keep you on the crazy train. 

A manipulative person will come and find you to offer you the last piece of pie that was in the fridge. You probably didn't know it was there until they asked you. They only came to talk to you because they want permission to eat it (instead of just deciding to eat it because they wanted to). So if you say ""nah, I'm good"", you're gonna hear something like ""oh but I want you to have it...if you want it of course"" or ""ohhh but I shouldn't. I'll just put on weight. You should go ahead"". The cycle will continue until you say ""I absolutely loathe pie and would derive no enjoyment from it. The only way that pie could please me is by bringing you joy. Also, you look amazing and will never gain weight."" Then and only then will they shut up and go eat the pie. If they'd eaten it in the first place, you'd never have known. But because they weren't comfortable owning their wants, they made you spend 15 minutes bullying them into what they really wanted. And now, after arguing about pie for 15 minutes, you really want some. But you can't ever admit it now, can you? That's what a manipulator is like. 

Notice that your girlfriend went round &amp; round...right up until **you** forced the decision that she obviously wanted? Yup, you got played. If it helps, people like that don't usually realize (or at least own up to) what they're doing, but that doesn't make it any healthier. "

That way you can go out and feel safe, and have understanding people to vent to when it seems to be too much."

Obsessing over this is probably more damaging to your mental well-being than smoking a few bowls.

Ultimately people need to relax and unwind, and have fun - it's actually good for your mental well-being. Some people unwind by cooking, or by reading a book, or watching some tv.

It's why I wouldn't take away anything from a conversation you overheard vs. your lifetime of experiences with him - you know your brother a lot better than a few lines from one conversation.

Nothing so dramatic happened but my family doesn't like him because they thought I should've stayed with my abusive ex husband. I've been no contact/low contact with all of my immediate family for years. I get plenty of support from his family. And in terms of his wife, if I were her I'd never be able to forget what my family did to him and how it affected me during a tumultuous time. "
198,"Honestly, I have met people like this and there is no talking to them. You just ""don't understand"" in their mind which makes you somehow lesser.

200,"I just saw a post about a male partner poking holes in condoms and saying it is sexual assault. Even if you’re married, having the type of sex that you didn’t consent to is sexual assault. You’re not overreacting, you’ve become a victim and she doesn’t realize that that kind of sexual manipulation is abuse because she’s a narcissist. You can’t make these decisions by yourself.

Edit to add: that being said hormonal BC can put you at a higher risk for many things including heart attacks but there are other options that should be discussed between married partners anyway."
201,"Until you got to the kissing and cuddling bit, I was thinking it was like my great aunt and her son as she did everything for him. But then the bed sharing and diapers and him not going out at all and not being able to get ice cream etc. That is so not normal.

Your brother could have a developmental delay that your mom never told you about. How was he at school?

More likely though is that she's conditioned him, frankly groomed him, to be what he is. He will never be able to leave her because he is utterly incapable of living in the real world. I suspect that he might quite like to go out but your mom has spent 24 years making sure he can't. She's told him again and again he can't cope out there. And she's rewarded him for staying in and complying. Can you imagine what it's like when you're not there?

I don't think we can say with any reliability if she's doing more with him than being touchy feely in a babyish way. But it is a concern.

You could try calling adult protective services and ask for advice. I suspect they may not feel they can do much but they might view him as a vulnerable adult and try to check on him. That said, if they do, it might break your relationship with your mom and brother for good."

The fat comments are almost more troubling to me, because he seems to ONLY judge women on their body.  If my husband had EVER made a comment like that about a woman i would have dumped him on the spot.  Can you imagine how he will treat you if you ever gain weight from pregnancy, illness, stress, etc?   His comment about the nurse is way way beyond inappropriate as well.

He is doing it on purpose because he is a sexist, disrespectful piece of shit. He has probably watched too much twin porn and is objectifying you.

You should create a log of all his actions. Call him out loudly every time he pulls this shit. You can come to your twin first with that log of yours, or even this post. Explain to her calmly that he is disrespecting both of you, and he's making you super uncomfortable. You would rather not be around him.

He is absolutely sexually assaulting you. I don't know how comfortable you are with the police, but if he keeps grabbing you, you need to report him. Having the log will become extra useful then. 

Edit to remove the parents part because I somehow thought you stayed with them, too early in the morning I guess.

Anecdotally, my brother spent significant time away from his wife while they both developed their careers - good communication and shared life goals kept them together, and they've got 3 kids now and a beautiful home in a nice city.

213,"&gt;we both knew we wanted to get married soon

Wouldn't be so sure about the ""we"" part of this. I'd say cancelling the engagement is the least you need to do. If you're going to work through it you can do so, but without the perceived pressure / obligation of being engaged, and with a counsellor, not just between yourselves. You caught him lying, he claimed he wanted to rebuild trust, then he shat all over that by lying again, making out with someone else, drunk driving... I mean at this point why would you believe it was just making out? People tend not to drunk drive to a girl's house just for a kiss and a cuddle, even if they're not **in a fucking relationship**. What makes you think you can ever trust a thing he says, ever again?

Did he even give a reason? Because this isn't even ""I got drunk and a random girl kissed me and I didn't reject her quickly enough"". He made a real effort to meet up with this girl. That's not what someone does who's happy in his current relationship, or who gives a shit about his partners feelings. You can do better than this guy, surely? Because bluntly, he has no qualms about trying to do better than you. "

216,"So I'll say the whole it's his body thing and ultimately his decision. Which holds true but it might be more fruitful understanding where he's coming from . Forgot where I heard/read this, it was SUPER recent, but it was about men seeking out and benefiting from what they call a 2nd father in their lives. It's super common among guys who do martial arts, who develop deep bonds with their teachers who they believe to have help equipped them to better handle life.


So with that in mind, it might be better to understand really how deep your husband might be grieving. The camaraderie he has developed with this guy is probably beyond that of a teacher. But like someone else said, he's grieving. Another good rule of dumb with tattoos is to table an idea for a year and if you still want get it. For his case it's probably even more applicable considering his mental state. "

But this is...the opposite of that. He chose to quit his job. He chooses to live in a housing situation that doesn't fit with his finances. There is nothing stopping him from going back to working, nothing stopping him from getting roommates or finding some other kind of situation that would enable him to live more cheaply. He just doesn't want to.

I absolutely wouldn't give him money now, and honestly I'd probably reconsider the relationship. It's not a romantic thing to consider, but I really feel that shared financial values are one of the most important factors in making a long-term relationship work."

But the fact that he pursued his full blood Aunt shows some serious boundary issues; these issues are even more clearly highlighted by the fact that his aunt was also a willing participant in a sexual relationship with her nephew who she has presumably known since birth.

The fact that his coping mechanism when his (exceedingly unhealthy and incestuous) relationship ended was to do a massive run on prostitutes is also very concerning.

Even the start to your relationship together (sleeping with someone in a relationship) shows he's still not good at understanding healthy boundaries.

Has your boyfriend seen a therapist for any of this? If he hasn't, what concrete steps has he taken toward having healthier boundaries and coping mechanisms?

As an aside, you might consider getting tested and having your partners get tested *before* you are months into a sexual relationship. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when you are talking about STD/STI's, ya know?

All that being said, even if his affair with his aunt and running a train on hookers to cope was decades in his past AND he had years therapy to figure out why his decision making process for sex was so wonky to begin with, I'm not sure I could ever be with someone long term who had this as part of their past. Only you can decide for yourself if this is something you feel capable of handling.

Also, if this relationship were to continue, what are the chances that you will go to family events/holidays and end up having to interact with this aunt? 

Just a few things to ponder before you decide whether or not continuing this relationship is even feasible for you."

They were probably changed together, bathed together, were put in the same stroller, went to the same day-care, etc. 

So maybe it's a little weird by non-twin standards, but they have a different viewpoint on life having grown up in a way no one else really gets.

If someone practically never cries and they cry in response to something, that might be a sign to back off and wait because this is a particularly bad time for them.

If someone cries every time you try to have a tough conversation with them, then you can't take that as a sign to back off and wait because this is always going to be the response.

You need to get past that feeling. If you notice your wife crying then get her tissues or whatever, show her you care, but then keep going.

EDIT: Also, medication for depression is not the most precise area of medicine and to some extent resembles slinging shit at a wall and seeing what sticks. There are a range of options that do all sorts of things and some people respond well to some, others respond poorly. If your wife tried one and didn't like it, that's not the end of her medication journey by a long shot. Full disclosure; I only tried two before deciding to work on myself sans meds, but I don't have a family depending on me so it's a luxury I can afford."

You are proceeding from a number of erroneous premises, and presuming to speak from authority you do not have.

The fact that you are certain of this does not make it so, and it does not give you the right to dictate how another person will live her life as a result.

You *need* to inform her that God will forgive her...if only she does what *you* have decided is right for her?

No.

You do not speak for God.  For that matter, *I* do not speak for God.  I speak for myself, and my understanding of what is best, and so does every other person.  

It is not your job, your right, or your privilege to try to make this woman conform to your grand vision of What Should Be, no matter how convinced you are that it is God's Plan that you are following.

If you subscribe to the idea that God has a plan, and that it is destiny that people should follow it, then by *definition* whatever happens *is* God's Plan.  So if you and she end up not together, then *that* must have been God's Plan all along.

But Yeah I certainly wouldnt say OP has done anything wrong. Just a classic teenaged kerfuffle "
250,Try to call him. See what happens.
251,"Lol You missed out on her pregnancy? You were busy with work and she was alone in a strange city. You were texting till 10pm what the fuck did you miss out on that you would have actually been around to participate in mate? 

She left because of YOUR behavior. You're mad at yourself, not her. Direct those feelings in a more productive direction before you really fuck your marriage up."
252,"Your dad needs to realise it’s *better* for your grandma to be downstairs, and making things better for her is not disappointing her.

It might be useful to tackle it from another angle than simply safety when talking to your dad. Your still mobile grandma clearly isn’t happy being confined to the upper floor all the time. By trying to confine her to only the upper floor it causes her to take unneccessry risks, it makes her resentful of the family, and it makes the family to be angry at her. It just makes everyone very unhappy. By moving her downstairs it takes away the conflict and your dad and grandma can get along again!

Expecting an adult to confine themselves to one floor or to always wait for an escort to move between floors wasn’t that realistic to begin with tbh. If your grandma can’t safetly walk in stairs, then she can’t live somewhere that requires stairs to get there.  If your dad can agree that his mum can’t walk safetly in stairs, then he should also agree that living on the first floor is the only reasonable solution,"
253,"He is never going to be okay with anything that threatens the sweet deal he has now. 

You are going to need to enlist some help from family and friends. You aren’t seeing him for what he is. 

The only question you should be asking yourself is how to safely get him out of your house and out of your life. 

Edit: I actually would strongly advise against bringing this up with him again. Just have someone help you tell him to move to his mother’s house. If he senses any more resistance I worry he’s going to get ugly with you pretty quickly. "
254,Exactly. I think it’s so hurtful and disrespectful to break up in public - it’s such a private moment.

256,"I cannot for the life of me understand why you want to date someone so much older, but at least you're a full-fledged adult (usually it's like 17-year-olds saying, ""he likes me because I'm so mature for my age,"" ""He didn't know I was so much younger when we met,"" etc).

Do you plan for this to be a long-term thing? If it's a fling, don't bother. If you do want to be with him long-term, you're going to have to introduce him to your family. They're going to be upset, and you're just going to have to tell them that you're happy and they don't have to approve of all your life choices."
257,"I had actually prepared to tell her exactly that, but that's when she hit me with the fact that her 3 close high school friends told her they find her too intense and don't want to hang out anymore. They told her she comes on too strong and they can't handle it (which is my issue with her exactly). She basically cried to me at work for an hour and she was so emotional. If I were to talk to her, I'd basically be saying exactly that, and that clearly hurt her a lot in the past so I don't know if the results would be any different. Thanks for your response!"
258,"I would want to know if I were the neighbors husband.  It’s a tricky situation, I would find a way to spin it into a conversation without being too obvious and see the reaction. I don’t understand the wife’s friend telling her she is using a vibrator. That is strange and out of place. "
259,"As a lawyer with past experience in family law let me reassure you – almost everybody performs a role assigned to them by society. Being honest with yourself about your real needs and dreams is probably the toughest thing in the world – and very few people actually manage to do live up to their own expectations rather than expectations of others.  
 

You have already done a plenty by taking the correct small first steps – there is not a magical formula that makes all the things right within one day. It is always going to be a balancing act between your parents/friends and later a boyfriend/husband and kids. Everybody wants a piece of you – but it is up to you how much you decide to give them.  
 

You simply need to find balance. The easiest way how to find it is to start being honest with yourself and learning to say no. Stop doing things because you are expected to do them and ignore the angry comments you get once you start performing like others want you to perform – it is your own life.

Keep going in the direction you already started. And remember – it is impossible to satisfy everybody. There is always gonna be somebody telling you you should do that , be that , have that job and that many kids – dont listen to them, lsiten to yourself.

Last pro tip: Even people who seem to live the perfect life (like your friends) perform to some degree to make others happy. Trust me – you never know what is really happening in other peoples lives – its okay to be sad or fell down. Everybody does once in a while. As long as you are honest with yourself a do the right and tough choices the happiness will come – it is a tough road, but one surely worth taking. "

262,"Has it ever occured to you that _you_ might be the bad driver? If you’re driving so cautiously, chances are you’re going too slowly. That’s a perfect opportunity to get hit by someone whirling onto the highway because they’re right to assume that the people on the highway are going actual highway speed. Not to mention if you’re being hit by other people each time, maybe you’re tailgaiting/not leaving enough following distance. "
263,"Oh yes, definitely learn from a driving school. I'd be saying that in any event, but given your father's anxiety issues about you driving, I'd say this is absolutely necessary.

And when practicing, go with your mother, not your father, if you can."
264,Isn’t it standard advice to avoid non essential trips when the roads are icy?
265,"She’s going to have to learn the hard way. Tell her you love her but you can’t enable her bad decisions and disrespect anymore. Set her up with help through CPS (or whatever other organizations exist for her circumstances) or give her an ultimatum to start respecting you and rules while holding down a job. Either one still having the end result of her accepting responsibility and feeling the gravity of her life choices. It sucks she may have to struggle but she had an option not to...she’s the one who opted not to practice safe sex..to have an abortion (please let’s not debate that friends, just saying)..or consider adoption. 

In the bigger picture of her situation she luckily had an uncle to fall back on. Something she took for granted..and just saying she appreciates it doesn’t mean shit. It’s actions! 

Really though..Your sister should be stepping up. 
You could always send her back to her Mom, druggie or not she doesn’t get a pass. 
Speaking of your sister..crying because you’re going to be raising this baby?!! What!!! No. How could she expect that from you and not herself?! 
Bottom line, They’re still her kids...and she can sober up, or not and they can live a rollercoaster life together or she can find other arrangements for her daughter that don’t include you. (Though I’d understand wanting to keep your nephew still- I’m not suggesting you insert him into that shit show). 

You’re a good guy. And you tried. It’s ok to stop overextending yourself for people who don’t appreciate it. It doesn’t mean you don’t love or care about them..it just means you can’t continue to enable everyone around you. Because YOU are the only one suffering consequences for everyone’s shit choices here. That’s not how it’s supposed to work....

 "
266,Again - stop talking to her. She's being a bad friend. You shouldn't talk to people who purposefully hurt you and make you feel bad.
267,"Your parents were ok with their early 20s daughter in college dating a man with over a decade on her. 

...

They'll be just fine."
268,Honestly it seems clear that he just looking for excuses to not take care of his own child. Also he seems to selfishly not want you to have fun if at that very second he isn't also having fun. Honestly this is a big enough hill to die on. I'm terribly concerned about what value system your children will grow up with if they see it it is acceptable for a man to have a life outside the family but not a woman and if they see the dynamics of the family being the woman letting the man control her every activity. 
269,Take it. So so much take it. 100% you will regret not going.
270,"Piggy backing off of this comment. The brides mother already says you should be demoted to a bridesmaid because you’re pregnant— obviously they’re not too concerned about your role in the wedding. They’ve betrayed your trust and hurt your feelings. You don’t owe them anything at this point; all your friend had to give you was basic decency and respect and she threw you under the bus. Do what’s best for your mental health and the health of that baby and cut all ties. You don’t need that kind of stress in your life, especially now. It sounds like this wedding has been a massive burden on you, and it won’t be worth it in the end to put this much work and emotional effort into an event for someone who can’t keep their mouth shut out of respect for you. I think you’ll notice a huge weight is taken off your shoulders. "
271,"I assure you I am not exaggerating my anger. If he can lie for years over something so stupid, I don't know if I can trust him anymore."
272,"&gt; I feel as though that would come out of the blue for him, as we have had much larger arguments and disagreements. 

Uh. 

Then it most certainly will NOT come out of the blue. He knows this relationship is *deeply* flawed. It just hurts you more than it hurts him. 

You don’t need to wait for a big blowout fight to leave him. His constant possessiveness is plenty reason enough. "
273,"People can be assholes about things like this. I don’t doubt for a second she said that but still comes across as likeable.

Source: am wheelchair user. Have had similar bullshit things happen to me."
274,"Are you certain it's a car payment? I understand that you're probably not about to go through his bills or something; does his ride look expensive?

To be fair his credit could have been shit (but that raises even more concerns)

Just asking for context; the short length of the relationship and (from what I've gleaned) it sounds like he might be looking for someone to carry him through life. A dude version of a gold digger (IDK if there is already a term, or if it's gold digger for dudes too). 


I'm with everyone else either way, trust your gut. Don't let him interfere with what you've worked hard for just because it makes his life easier.

279,"And when he can carry it and give birth to it, he can have the final say on what happens."
280,"&gt; I'm guessing she looks better than you since she makes you so jealous, so why not improve yourself in some way? Start working out / eating better, look up some make up tutorials, get some nice clothes. You'll improve your life and at the same time you might feel like you're doing something to combat this jealousy. It might even make you feel less threatened by her if you see your body improving.

OP *thinks* her BF's coworker is better looking than her, but I want to point out what women think is aesthetically appealing is often different than what men think is aesthetically appealing.  It's quite possible and even likely that OP's BF thinks OP is better looking than his coworker.   "
281,If you have an 8 week old and he is bored...how much parenting is he doing??  Diapers?  Wake-ups?  Bathtime?  Tummy time?
282,"I suggest you go proportional. If he makes twice as much as you, he pays twice as much of the household bills and housing costs as you. 

This way you each sacrifice the same proportion of your incomes to your common home. 

If he wants 50/50 then he should be willing to downgrade to a lifestyle &amp; living quarters that avoids you being penniless at month end and maybe provide for some savings. 

My brother and I, do the proportional thing and together we are 49 years happily married to 2 great women, each of home have nice retirement funds of their own and income to spend on themselves.  "
283,"Not only is this disrespectful to you, few people want to be oggled when they’re out and about. What he’s doing isn’t “checking people out”. He is leering at people. And at 43, it’s not really excusable. As someone else said, teenagers can learn how to shoot a brief look. He’s being obvious. That’s gross. 

So now you have to face the reality which is that your boyfriend doesn’t respect you or other people and feels entitled to stare at people. This isn’t something that can really be fixed by mutual beliefs; if there isn’t respect there’s no relationship. I think the time has come to walk. You can always put down an ultimatum: It happens again and you’re gone. Thing is you will need to be ready to honor that ultimatum when he does it again. Because he will. "
284,"Sure! 

Like if he says “it’s a co-worker messaging me on WhatsApp”

You say, “ so your co-worker is messaging you on WhatsApp?” 

And he’ll probably say yes, to which you can surmise that he’s telling the truth 
And if he says, “she’s asking me for help with her classes” 
You should say, “so she’s asking you for help with her classes?” 

It sounds like an odd tactic but my husband uses it on him MIL and we catch her in lies all the time. 

For maybe a better example of how we used it: 

She said “you don’t do anything that I ask you to do!” 
And my husband said, “I don’t do anything you ask me to do?” 
And she replied, “no that’s not what I said” meaning she was trying to manipulate the situation and get out of the lie. It also helps you to retain the information and understand what it is exactly what is going on.  

So if you ask him what they talk about and he says “nothing”
You say, “nothing?” 

If they catch on, you can say, “I’m just trying to understand what exactly is going on”

I’m not sure if what I’m saying makes sense. 

I can reassure you that it does work. 

"
285,"“Stop making me feel guilty for not wanting sex”

He needs to be told directly. Another one I like is:

“Baby, whining isn’t sexy.”"
286,"ITS HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE WAS GONE FOR FIVE MINUTES! Dude, how controlling are you honestly? Do you call 911 if your girlfriend takes a shit?"
287,"&gt;Genuine question, why don't you just have your boyfriend provide drinks for you?

Provide? PROVIDE????? Ooh, yeah, baby, go hunt for me. Imma just gonna sit here and gather. Drinks.

And ""club girl""? Who are you? Why are you taking a WOMAN to a club if you're going to call her some stereotype? 

If you're embarrassed by your GF having fun, you have serious control issues. Do you think women's pants just fall off when a guy buys her a drink? Pick on someone your own size. She is far more mature than you are. So glad this thread kicked your butt. "
288,[deleted]
289,"Nah, i would tell that girl to grow the hell up. Her boyfriend can’t control the sizes of other’s breasts. Being insecure is perfectly normal reaction but making your insecurities other’s probables isn’t cool. Also it was his idea for them to go to the nude beach in the first place. "
290,By... bringing... RANDOM... strangers... into the house... from Craigslist. 
291,"&gt;He claims to understand most of quantum physics effortlessly

JFC why is it always quantum physics with these people

&gt;his own estimation of his own IQ is ""in the ballpark of 150 to 160.""

He thinks he's as smart as Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein? 

In the words of Professor Hawking, ""People who boast about their IQ are losers.""  Do you want to date a loser? "
292,"Good point sir, thank you!"
293,"&gt;I see nothing positive of my wife going through my exes social media.




Ok, the better response would have been to talk to your wife about your concerns in an adult way, not just go in and delete. You are treating her like a child or like you are the only reasonable one. If she is a mature adult then you should be able to either trust your wife to handle social media or to talk about your concerns, and if she isn’t then you shouldn’t be with an adult you can’t trust or reason with."
294,"Wtf? No. If anything she needs the support, confidence and strength to see she doesn't need him and deserves better. "
295,Jesus christ! What kind of tough love bullshit is that??
296,"First off, I'm so sorry about your son.

Second, I think you hit the nail on the head here... she does want kids, but they haven't started trying yet. I do think it could be bothering her that another woman got to have a baby with her now-husband, and she hasn't yet (which is totally understandable). In this case, should I just nod be sympathetic? I feel like fueling what she says may not be the best thing, especially since she's driving friends and family away with this talk (something I forgot to mention above, it's not only me who has noticed this pattern). Thanks so much for the insight"
297,[removed]
298,"These examples don't really sound like a probably with morals

The niece thing -- If she lent out her apartment for hundreds above fair market value, why didn't the niece just rent an apartment in the same area for hundreds less? If there were no other apartments available, then your gf didn't offer it under fair market value. That's market value. 

The friend thing -- I personally feel like once you are approaching 30, you're a little old to be helping friends move for pizza and beer. I mean, hire movers. Since it was her car, I presume she would be driving and wouldn't even get to enjoy the beer. She could have been nice and just done it, but she is hardly ""morally wrong"" for declining moving some guys stuff all across town for a slice of pizza.

The only maybe slightly morally questionable thing is calling the cops on a guy who wanted to work for cash. She could have just told him that's unacceptable, but I don't know the full situation.

I think you are being too sensitive about this. Your girlfriend just sounds like a strong woman who doesn't let people take advantage of her."
299,"Lace gloves maybe?


I like gloves
"
300,This is good practice for you. She's not mad that you booked a 6 week trip to New Zealand. She's mad that you didn't think of her during this decision making process and completely forgot about the promises you made her. My best advice is to figure out a way to work out vacation/apartment hunting with her asap. 
301,Apparently you want to find a reason to break up with him.
302,This is the most reasonable solution to me too. It's just a matter of getting my dad to realize it's right (he doesn't like to disappoint her in any way).

“God, you’re so stuck up.”
“Yes, I am.   I want the comments to stop.”

Own the insults - they’re designed to make you back down to “prove” that you’re not whatever she says you are.   Embrace it instead and insist on what you want.  

“You’re right, I don’t have a sense of humour.   I want the comments to stop.”

“Okay, so I’m a bitch.   I want the comments to stop.”

“Okay, so I have jealousy issues.   I want the comments to stop.”

“Okay.  I still want the comments to stop.”

306,"You're facing homelessness, that's not having your finances figured out. Either get a roommate, move to a cheaper area, or look for a better job."
307,"People have given really good advice about your husband,  though I also want to point out that the fact that you've watched a loved one spiral like this... that's an awful experience.  I'm so sorry your husband has turned into this person. It's hard on him,  but also on you. 

You need to see a therapist for your own mental health. You need your own support. You deserve it.  It was a very good step to post this on Reddit, you should feel proud that you sought help. "
308,"If she's comfortable with it, she could post at r/progresspics, which has a very supportive sub base. Or she could just look around at other people's pictures, and see she is 100% not alone. I definitely second r/loseit - I visit that sub nearly everyday, and it's incredible how supportive people are to each other. "
309,"Your father isn't willing to do anything to protect you, your wife, or anyone else your mother decides to declare The Enemy at any given point. He is simply enabling her behavior, regardless of whom she ends up hurting. Going no contact certainly isn't for everyone, and I can understand the desire/sense of obligation to stay in some form of contact with him. However, you might want to take a step back and really think carefully about his role in all of this.          

Another suggestion: If you haven't already checked out r/justnomil, I strongly suggest you do so. Don't let the name fool you, it's for mothers and grandmothers as well as MILs and GMILs. It's a support sub for people with maternal/maternal-in-law figures who range from problematic and rude to outright abusive and scary. The toxic mother paired with an enabler father is a *very* common pattern over there, so you would probably get both support and useful ideas from that sub.        

(Edit: Fixed an error in grammar.)"
310,"Wow. After gaining that info that he pressured this kid onto her when she wanted adoption,
And is now trying to leave her with said baby to be child and care free all week while she hates her life there with a 5 m/o. 

AND he said he didnt get her an abortion because its too expensive as if having a whole ass kid isnt gonna be 100x more in the long run.

Im sorry OP, but you’re a fucking moron."
311,"Yeah, they're not afraid of having sex with a virgin, they're afraid of having sex with a Christian virgin who they probably presume will infer a lifelong commitment from sex with them.

Agree with everyone else she needs to find a Christian bf who wants marriage."
312,"I have to agree that I am detecting almost zero empathy from OP towards the wife.  As a SAHM she spends a huge portion of the day working to make the household run, and then instead of helping her vent/relax by getting out of the house for a bit, you complain about having to be out with her? And then you plan a trip away with a friend leaving her behind to babysit? And you want her to apologize?  Can you not imagine what it is like to spend months like that? I suggest you prioritize this couples therapy over weekend trips with friends if you want to stay married.  I don’t think you mean to be an asshole, but you are accidentally causing massive resentment from someone who is supposed to be a partner."
313,"Would you feel comfortable with something vague but firm? Something like

&gt;My mother was very abusive, physically and emotionally. I don't want to get into details about it, but I need you to believe me and to stop pushing me to let my abuser back into my life.

could work at making it clear that you don't want to have an in-depth conversation about it, while also not dumping anything on him, and if he respects your boundaries he would stop pressing the issue."
314,"You are making some very smart moves and decisions and it is a breath a fresh air. Cut your losses with this guy. Maybe you were a mark all along, but even if it started innocently for the BF, he obviously doesn't have the first clue of what a healthy, normal relationship looks and feels like. He needs to grow up far longer than you have time to wait. "
315,"&gt; there is no reason for him to be nice just to be nice. 

What reason might there be, then?  Is it only to get your way, like if you want to get laid?

Your BF is a peach."
316,"Give them both notice to move out, hide and lock away any valuables in the meantime just in case they trash your place or try to get back at you. Look up the laws regarding eviction for where you live though, to make sure you do it properly. They'd probably have 30 days to go. "
317,"Based on the several arguments you’ve had over this matter, he’s not going to realise he is wrong until it is too late.

Stay strong, you’re doing very very well and I wish you all the best. Take care of you, because you’re the most important person in your life."
318,"This is so spot on.  I feel bad for OP.  First her parents tell her she can’t listen to the devil music that isn’t classical.  And then she ends up with a boyfriend who tries to do the same thing under the guise of being a music lover.  
Op you already know you like pop and soundtracks. There’s a whole wide world of music, music theory and new ideas out there just waiting for you.  You don’t need to like it to be socially accepted but you might just like it because you enjoy it.  And that’s ok.  
I like metal, rap and hip hop.  I don’t care if my friends and family hate that kind of music, it’s my favorite!"
319,"Either he's worried you'll drive away and get into trouble or he's genuinely concerned with your safety but is inadvertently scaring you away from driving.

If he wants you to be independent and also be safe, tell him to teach you (or pay someone to teach you yourself) how to be a safe driver.  Adulthood is taken, not given."

323,Yeah these people shouldn't be around your kids.
324,So I think your wife's concerns about your temper are valid and you should address that in addition to the financial issues. 
325,"Yep, this is very reasonable. Totally fair that he doesn’t want to travel constantly. Totally not fair that he wants you to drag your friends over to his location. OP, your friendships will likely suffer if you do what he asks."
326,"Oh dude I can say with almost certainty that he was nodding along to her so as not to create a fight. When we are emotional it’s often easier for our partners to just say ‘yes dear, of course dear’ and then to bring it up later when we are not emotional over it. There would have been nothing productive about him arguing with her about it then, as she is only human like the rest of us and would not be in a state of mind to recognise that what she was saying was wildly inappropriate, or to do anything but get defensive. I’m sure if he knew you were listening he would have spoken up because then he’d know it’d hurt you, but if he thought no one was listening, he definitely took the best route so long as he brought it up again or will bring it up again. 

Talk to him about it and say you overheard maybe. Perhaps when his fiancée isn’t around "

I love you guys but you’ve left me disappointed.”"

332,"Wow Lol.  This sub kills me sometimes.

If you wanted/were interested in moving in with him, and made less;  Would ""Are you sure you can afford it"" be a reasonable and acceptable answer from someone who had healthy ideas about relatiomships?

If you think it's to soon then just say so.

If you just dont want to live with him then just say so.

If you have a problem with the amount of money he makes, perhaps say it in a less condecending manor.

If he can't respect that then it's probably a great thing that you didn't let him move in.

But if he is serious about building a relationship with you, and you ask him if he is sure he can afford it.  He'd be an idiot not to dump you on the spot."
333,She’s looking for a sugar daddy to support her financial choices. Red flag.
334,"I'd say that while she's covering some of your major expenses, she does have a legitimate interest, yes.  Her point being twofold: why should I pay for my son's car when he's pissing it away on booze and videogames, and I want my son to develop good savings habits."
335,"I have trauma that's just more starting to get treated, anxiety, and depression. It absolutely is essential to reframe how you approach things.

345,"If they're in the U.S. then yes, that's a VERY bad time. In home care (which she will need unless she is INSANELY lucky) costs me just over $4k/mo for my mother. that's $48k/year. That cost does not include food, diapers, utilities, fucking medical bills, or the property taxes on her house. We are hanging onto the house for now, as paying all of that is just barely cheaper than putting her into an assisted living facility. Even so, the break-even is coming up soon. "
346,My boyfriend's friend dated a twin for quite a while and he confused them exactly one time as well
347,"She’s probably mad at herself for getting knocked up by a married man. And the fact that he has older children... yeah, I’d be pissed too. It’s your dads responsibility to make sure you guys get along and well... seems like he doesn’t care. I would leave it alone. "
348,"Don't miss this chance, he is free to go with you, do long distance or whatever.  The ""making more money"" part seems like an excuse not to go."
349,"Sorry but I totally understand your grandmothers POV. The money was meant for something that would help and benefit you for the future. Using it for rent is such a waste.

I understand it’s not a waste in the sense it’s keeping you alive but if you couldn’t really afford all of your rent / bills with whatever job you have you probably shouldn’t have moved out. "

354,"Here's another way that same conversation can go:

My husband went back to school to become an engineer, and it took up a ton of his time.  We decided our family mantra would be ""We're paying the price to win.""

Every time he collapsed exhausted at 3 am from working on a project I would cuddle him and say ""Paying the price...""

Every time he would apologize for me taking on more than my fair share of the chores, I'd say ""No worries hun, we're paying the price to win.""

If your BF saw a future with you he would be willing to sacrifice some time now for your future success.  The fact that he can't see past \*right now\* doesn't bode well for being a good match for you during this time."
355,"I agree that it needs to be a conversation, but since he “works very little” and “wouldn’t be able to contribute much,” I would guess he’s crashing with a buddy 1-2 nights a week rather than having his own place. "
356,"How long have you been together? 

&gt;so it’s not like I can use the “have constant sex” solution.

Yeah, that's not the solution. Doing something more doesn't magically make you better at it. Ask anyone who golfs. Kidding! 

First, no way she knows the answers herself yet. She is still new to sex, too. If you ask her a question she can't answer, there is no ""magic switch"" that goes off in her head where she can suddenly articulate her sexual needs. 

Second, quit pushing. You guys are unfortunately blindly taking this journey together. Hold hands and walk down the Young People Road. Take the pressure off you both. She says things are ""okay"". Believe her. 

Have more fun dates, laughter, goofy times, long talks. Quality-ass time. When you have sex, way more foreplay. I doubt too many 20yo males exist that understand the importance of foreplay. Make that your new focus. 

And toys. If she's open to toys, they can be fun. 

Mainly, enjoy your GF. Orgasm is the Finish Line, sure, but the fun is getting there. You are not getting graded on this. Laugh, fall off the bed, make mistakes, have FUN!"

If this is a regular thing I see how it can be a problem but it kind of sounds to me like you wanted her to shower because you were expecting sex."
361,"If you saw your family die in car crashes, would you disapprove of your girlfriend driving a car?

If she saw you eating an ice cream cone and said, ""ugh, all I can think of is a morbidly obese 600-lb man sitting on his couch and shovelling buckets of ice cream and potato chips into his mouth"" would you not feel offended?

If you look at something that is used mostly safely every day, and can only see the worst possible outcome, that's a hard thing for her to handle. 

There are plenty of somewhat harmful things that can be used in moderation. It's very illogical to look at an example of moderate use, and equate it to fatal overindulgence.

You should feel free to be straight edge, and are completely within your rights to find a partner who is the same. And your gf is within her rights to feel upset about the way you would be sad about her having a beer."
362,"This guy is using the hell out of you.

363,"I had a best friend that I argued with constantly. He really believed that I was a burden on him and he was helping me, and at the end of every argument, I’d cave and do whatever dumb shit he wanted me to do, because the arguments were so unpleasant that I just wanted them to stop. I tried a couple years of putting distance between us and refusing to argue, and he thought things had gotten better, when actually I had almost entirely given up on ever having an adult friendship with him. 

Eventually, I got to the point where I decided that having him in my life was much worse than the consequences of cutting him off. I wrote him a short email to avoid a potentially crazy yelling/screaming public scene. In his mind, I never gave him a “reason” because he was the kind of person who got in arguments with all his friends constantly. The arguments he got in with me were just normal. The sad thing is the friends he has left are the kind of people who would never tell him the truth. I was the last one standing who actually had hope he could behave like an adult. 

I’m not saying you and my friend are similar. I have no way of knowing. However, all the people telling you that your friend must be the problem are going to give the same advice I am - leave her alone. Give up on the relationship entirely. Whether she’s right or you’re right, that’s the answer."

He was totally attracted to you, in part because you sought out being friends with him and in part because I'm sure he found you cute. In no way was he settling.

Honestly, just tell him casually what you liked about him when you started dating and ask him what it was about you that made him ask you out. I'm sure the answer will surprise you. "
370,"You're in tech, right? 

Unhelpful advice of the day:
1. Build a time machine. 
2. Go back in time. 
3. Tell your younger self not to get married so young because you're both still growing and deciding what your futures look like. 

My actual advice: 

Take the job and don't look back. You have no idea what your life is going to be like in 5, 10, 20 years. If your husband is this insecure now, you have to think ahead and plan to be able to take care of yourself. You got married really young and you both still have a lot of growing to do. Getting out of debt ASAP is never a bad choice. If your marriage is strong and he is worth it, you'll make it work, long distance or not. "
371,"Let me tell you how this reads from over here. You spend time in the shop every day when you have down time at work, you spend time as a family at night but not just with her, and then when you two have some alone time to watch tv or a movie, you leave to go into the shop again. The shop sees more of you one on one each day than your wife does. 

When you didn't have childcare arrangements, you made time for the shop but not for alone time with your wife, who was presumably stuck taking care of the children while you were in the shop again. 

If you are spending time in the shop during the day, than night time should be for just your wife, you and family time. "
372,"This is good advice.

My family has done this to me my entire life. Our relationship actually improved once my husband and I got some distance.

376,"OP I'd like to add:

I work with a community group who works against intimate partner violence. A fellow member is a psychologist, one of the ones to whom court-ordered appointments must go. One of the reasons he joined the group is because he has a few short questions that he often asks these men. He will ask things like have you ever struck a police officer, have you ever berated your boss, Etc. Because they do not do these things when the power dynamic is different he is of the impression that it is not an anger or impulse-control problem but is a power and dominance problem.

If ultimately you decide to stay be practical. Make arrangements to leave quickly. Separate some assets, put the car in your name, have a bug out bag. Watch your husband's reaction to you having control. I suspect that it will be informative.

However, before you take any of my half cocked 5am advice contact your local shelter. I suspect that they have materials prepared for you. Moreover, they likely have staff to talk you through the process and (more importantly) the emotional turmoil."
377,"Not only this is emotional unfaithfulness, but it seems to me like she's projecting a lot of stuff. It may also be the novelty of feeling certain way about someone else so great and refreshing that she's seeing things which aren't there. I mean, according to her, her friend haven't shown any sign of romantic attraction or making any move or hinting towards anything."

380,"If this is what you want:
&gt;  I just want her to want me like she did and have crazy sex

I don't think it's gonna happen. It's expected during the honeymoon period to fuck like rabbits. But now it just sounds like she's kind of back to her regular libido which is lower. Even if you don't pressure her for sex, just the fact that she obviously knows you have a higher sex drive and wants it way more than her, can feel like a lot of pressure, which in turn, reduces her libido even lower. 

Have you tried having scheduled days where you both know you will have sex? It doesn't sound sexy or spontaneous, but it actually might help her meet your needs. 

But to be honest, I think you are both sexually incompatible. Even if she can improve her frequency, I honestly don't think she'll be able to do all the ""crazy"" things that you want to do or try. And if you want or hope for those things, this girl isn't for you. 

Just because she liked it in the past, doesn't mean she likes it now. I used to do it a lot more in my younger days and that is not even close to appealing to me now. 

Also it absolutely sounds like you're setting yourself up to cheat if you stay with her. You mention it twice. 

&gt; I haven't cheated on her
&gt; I don't want to cheat on her but the thoughts of what if this continues after we marry

Like why is that even in your mind? Isn't she your fiancee? 

I admit she has poor communication skills, but it does also sound like she genuinely doesn't know why she isn't in the mood. I think if this relationship is going to survive, you need to go to couples counseling and frankly talk about it. But honestly, you two sound very sexually incompatible. 
"
381,This doesn’t sound like a healthy comment. Maybe you guys aren’t that compatible.

Do you ever talk about anything besides the baby?

391,"I dont know you so it’s hard to know what possible opportunities for improvement you have... but firstly know you aren’t alone! You’re young and still figuring out who you are and dating guys who are too. 


The one thing that caught my eye in what you wrote, is that If your reaction to them saying “I’m not in love with you” is “duh! We have just been dating a few months”, maybe that indicates that you aren’t being entirely vulnerable and open to deep love, and are dating because it’s fun and you like a lighter slower pace. Some people don’t want to exclusively date someone for months if they aren’t feeling those big emotions. They’ll want to move on and find someone who they feel they can fall in love with. 


For what it’s worth I mostly dated casually for all of my 20s and early 30s and really thought that I was happiest single, and then met the man I love so deeply and who loves me like I never knew I could be loved when I was 35. So you never know who is just around the corner. "
392,"This 100%. You’re at an age where men just simply don’t usually commit. As a male myself, I can tell you that there are plenty of women I dated at 23-26 just for the sake of exploration and discovering what I liked and didn’t like in a partner. I ended things with a few girls for no specific reason - not something I would do now at 30...but ya somewhat normal. 

We live in a society where people on average commit to serious relationships closer to 30 than 20. Try not to let it bother you, and use this time do a little exploration yourself ;)"
393,"There are a lot of trans people in my life. So here’s my perspective:

Having mixed-up feelings about something like this is totally normal. When you’ve known someone your whole life, and suddenly they start dressing/talking/acting in ways they never have before, it IS hard to get used to, and it WILL feel weird for a while. You might also have these awkward feelings because having someone keep a big secret like this makes you feel like the other person doesn’t trust you. 

So, it’s okay to have many feelings at once. On one hand, you might feel happy that your parent is finally showing you this side of herself. On the other hand, you might feel sad that your relationship and the things you do together won’t be the same as they used to (I’m generalizing here; I’m thinking of father-son type activities). 

Keep spending time with your parent and her new partner. If you feel like the partner is being too critical, take a deep breath and tell both of them “sorry I keep getting it wrong. I’m still getting used to all of this.”

As for what you can call your parent... since “Dad” is too masculine and “Mom” is out of the question, what about “Ren”? Ren is used by a lot of queer/gender-non-conforming parents who don’t really want to fall into a dad/mom category. 

Overall, don’t worry too much. It sounds like you’re really trying to get used to your parent’s new life; give it some time!"
394,"We can take the formal route, my husband can, which is request to speak to him formally in the presence of his first shirt. That would be the end all type situation, and could result in bad things for the guy she’s been sleeping with. Don’t want to do that. Just really want the guy to know. If he chooses to believe, great, and if not, that’s fine too. 

I’m genuinely just not sure if it’s our place to let this poor guy know. From a personal perspective, I would want to know if my neighbors heard my husband having sex while I was away. I know my husband would want to know as well. But then there are people who don’t want to know. "
395,"If this were my partner, I'd be *frightened*. The scale of his lying is absolutely insane and remorseless- this isn't a cover story because he was embarrassed to tell you the truth about something. I would run."

400,"&gt;\&gt;Clubs and bars aren’t an option for me because of religious reasons.

So what about your religious community? church/mosque or whatever? Isnt that the fastest people to find who are similar?"
401,"Yeah, gathering evidence before having The Talk seems like a better way to avoid lies than just straight up asking in this case."
402,"What you went through was traumatic. All in one action you lost your income, benefits, your professional reputation, your career, and if that wasnt enough, you had thoughtless actions of people you thought cared and valued you. People that didnt even stop to consider that no one knew what was happening. And I would definitely pull SIL out of that very clearly as a key person who fanned the flames and directly damaged relationships you had. Your entire worldview just got knocked on its ear. 

Your reaction to be highly defensive and raise severe boundaries is actually pretty normal in this abnormal situation. You felt attacked, and for good reason. And now the people that basically caused you real harm are just pretending that its all good. They never seemed to address their behavior, ask for your forgiveness, or make it a point to show you how they realized how their actions hurt you. They are just pretending nothing major happened. 

Now, I assume if they actually went the other route, the one where they specifically say to you that they know they did ABC and that it was hurtful and wrong, asked for your forgiveness and told you they would work to earn back your trust and repair your relationship, Im guessing you wouldnt be here asking this question. Instead they just moved on like it was no big deal. And that does show you how they value your relationship, and that they dont take responsibility for their own actions. 

Normally, I would say if people asked for the forgiveness and gave a real apology detailing what they did, how it was hurtful, and how they will work to repair the damage they caused, I would say go for it. But they havent. Maybe they will in time. Maybe they are just so embarrassed about their behavior. They should be. But thats no excuse for not dealing with their own mistakes. Perhaps sit them down and tell them that, and see what they say. But if they dont do the full monty, they dont value you. And its hard to realize people you thought cared and valued you dont actually feel that way. It can make you mistrustful of others. So stay in therapy. 

Now, I dont know how old SIL is. If shes 12, I say forgive her. If shes in her mid-twenties, she is in the same bucket as all the rest. Only, for her, she would have to go around and publicly take responsibility for the harm she caused to each person she told. Put her through the ringer. But I doubt these folks are actually going to do this. They just want to brush it under the carpet. 

So stick with therapy. Make better friends. Build your business. Anyone can be a good friend or family member when things are good. Its when things are bad that people really show you who they are. "

Agreed 100%.  The way she's been treating you and the things she's said to you have been extremely disrespectful and hurtful.  It sounds like she may understand that now and feel honest remorse.  It's up to you to decide if you want to give her a second chance.

However, one thing I noticed is that you both seem to put a pretty high value on using money to show love and affection.

&gt; without sounding cheesy, I've spent almost every penny of my disposable income on this girl.

Assuming you two are able to maintain your relationship through her schooling and graduation, that dynamic is obviously going to change.

It hasn't changed her feelings toward me. I bear her no ill will. She's a great step mom. But she'll always resent me for being mom. My kids aren't little anymore but she's starting to put them in the middle and they hate it. Even my ex doesn't do that. But they're old enough to get that she says and does these things because she's not happy. "
411,"Oh hon. 

What it looks like is that you went to their ""useless"" project home without being welcomed. You made an expectation of how long you would stay and did not communicate that expectation. Then his family's plans had to change to accommodate you, with no warning. You got pissed that the family matriarch didn't respect you, (the young newcomer,) and popped off at her about her home not being up to *your* standards. When she made it clear that your presence is unneeded (which it is,) you got more pissed. 

Look, you don't fight with your boyfriend's mom. Ever. It's off limits. She starts popping off and you either walk away or change the subject. Wrangling his mother's attitude is not your place. Protecting you from his mom's shit is his job. He's not doing it.

So what happened in between you telling her their conditions are ""disgusting"" and her kicking you out? Because you use the words enraged and hurt, but you don't include what you said to her after that, just her diatribe against you. However, your actions and the opinions you list here paint you as very entitled and judgemental. Frankly, unless you stood there and said nothing, you owe her an apology.

~~I don't think his mom is innocent here. She sounds like a real piece of work. But~~ you don't come up smelling like a rose, no matter what you're studying in college. It is most likely that you were ~~both~~ in the wrong and are now equally opposed to one another. That being said, let's be very clear on the following: **you were kicked out. You are not welcome in her home. She's never going to apologize and you're not owed one. Don't date a momma's boy if you can't handle momma. If you want to fix this, you need to be an adult, have a huge slice of humble pie and apologize to her for reacting disrespectfully. That's all you got.**

Edit: according to your post history you are a regular cocaine user, so the whole ""I'm a good innocent student with no friends who doesn't party,"" was a lie. Why lie? Totally unnecessary to the point of the post and now you look even worse, as if you were trying to paint some higher morality to sway our responses in your favor.

Edit 2: op and her boyfriend are long-using drug addicts from affluent families and that's probably why his mom hates her.

412,"Nobody ""sees themselves"" drowning their children until it's far, far too late. "
413,"I also lean toward believing this was innocent. OP says the friend isn’t professional, yet he has a nice camera, a bunch of gear, and set up a studio in his home. He sounds like he’s putting quite a bit of money into it imo, like he wants to be professional. And the photos look professional. 

I personally see nothing wrong with a platonic friend taking professional “sexy” photos. 

The assumption should be that he is a professional simply doing his job and building a portfolio. But everyone seems to instead jump to the conclusion that he’s a creep who took advantage of OP’s girlfriend, he and the girlfriend are cheating, etc. I just don’t think that it is a fair assumption to make based off of the information in this post and in the comments.

Does he generally behave inappropriately with women? Do other women seem to find him creepy? Who raised the idea of doing the photos? Has there ever been flirtation or romantic involvement in the years that he and the girlfriend knew each other? Is the girlfriend spreading her lips hustler-style, or simply posing in a sexy/cute manner?

Those are the questions that need answers. I think the immediate reaction is one of jealousy and suspicion, but this legit could have been a completely innocent thing. "

Im afraid she's in a terrible situation and doesn't see how bad it is. they moved to a new state, she has no friends or family there, she is now a SAHM, he won't let her get therapy or treatment and.....this OP just has too many of the 'OMG break up' buzzwords.

And I don't think age or relationship length are relevant in this instance either. Your partner should support your career trajectory and dreams. If your dreams and your partners differ that much, you're only holding each other back from finding real happiness."
419,"Who cares if he thinks you love him or not? If he wanted to be loved, he should have treated you right. You get what you give.

Yes, you have a family to rely on! What’s holding you back from leaving? Get away from him, block him on everything and if you can, change your phone number. It won’t always be easy to stay away from him and you will think back to some good memories and feel like you made a mistake by leaving. You didn’t and those feelings will lessen over time. One day, you’ll look back on this relationship and wonder how and why you stayed with someone so awful for so long. 

You’re a grown woman and you have to worry about getting in trouble? Why would you stay with someone who essentially acts like a shitty abusive dad?

Leave him and get your wings back. "
420,"Right! There are definitely situations where one parent does block the other, but this does not sound like that at all. OP says the dad made the call not to be more involved until recently, not the mom. He could not even muster twice a month, and the mom still is encouraging visitation and not hashing that out.


OP’s friend is with a guy who has not been that interested until it was convenient. That is in the past, and the mom seems to be willing to work it out. If dad does want more time and such, he needs to be an adult about it,  not play games. He also does not need to use this little girl as a pawn.

I think that, what annoys me the most, besides the poor kid stuck in the middle, is this victim mentality dad and step mom have about it. They stepped in after the hardest part, and now want to pretend they did so much, and traumatize the kid by separating her from the most stable person in her life."
421,[deleted]
422,"Yes it is too controlling. You're an adult and could go out topless if you want. He can't tell you what to wear. You're young, don't let an insecure guy control your life. I've gone out with no shirt on around my boyfriend and he has supported me"
423,Dude what... leave her. She’s shown she is capable of cheating more than once 
424,"I think you should lay it out for your girlfriend like you did for us here. If she wants to keep the dog and do what's BEST for the dog, then suggest:

- your girlfriend can move home and care for the dog, with you. 

If she doesn't want to, then at least you gave her the option. If she doesn't feel so strongly about dog ownership that she wants to uproot her life, I guess it's not fair to expect the same from you. "

427,"I once had a woman (mid-20s) with a similar background work for me. She was hired before I came on board. She literally ... did nothing, and seemed shocked when she was asked to do her job. She would take off out of the country to see her parents without requesting time off ... just leave (this was before I was her boss). When I eventually let her go, she was utterly shocked. It was crazy to me. She expected to be able to get paid to sit there and shop online, I guess. So weird. "
428,"&gt; They think I'm too ugly otherwise they would have pressured me to get married soon too.

OP this is not a normal thing for parents to tell their daughter.  It is horrible and cruel.

This is important:  someday, probably sooner than you think, you are going to meet a boy and he is going to tell you that you are beautiful.  You should believe him.   It will be hard to do because of what your parents told you, but he will be right and they are wrong."
429,What they're saying is that as you get bigger your BMR goes up. If she gained weight steadily at 1lb/month then she would have gradually been increasing her caloric intake in addition to the decreased activity. A sedentary 280lb woman burns way more calories than a sedentary 160lb woman.

Guess not :/"
433,"Yeah unfortunately a lot of guys will only help you with the intention of getting more out of you. Honestly imo, it's pretty scummy.

You just need to tell this guy outright that you really appreciate his help that day, but you're not interested in having any kind of relationship with him. Then just stop messaging him all together. Him thinking your ungrateful be damned, you don't have any obligation to play this game with him.

As for telling your partner, I don't see why you wouldn't. Just tell him someone helped you and now they're making a move on you, but you're not responding to him anymore."
434,"That's really not okay and it honestly sounds like your friend took an opportunity to see your girlfriend naked. I think your ""friend"" needs to go. Your girlfriend should also cut him off. 

None of this was done respectfully. A gift should feel amazing to receive. This gift doesn't feel good for you. You can tell her she really overstepped."
435,"Yeah, I googled ""psychosis fibers in skin"" because something about that rang a bell, and all the results were about Morgellon's. I read one and my first reaction was ""this actually DOES sound like what he has."" Except he thinks that it's all real, when the actual disease seems to be a delusional disorder. 

Have a read up on it and see what you think. "
436,This is surprisingly positive and absolutely degrading all at once. Congrats.
437,"For me, that would be a HUGE honking red flag.

This isn't just one of those things where you can agree to disagree. This is about whether or not one can think critical and objectively. He can't. (assuming you want them) I would never let someone like this raise kids. On top of that, it will get worse as he gets older."
438,"&gt; I don’t try and force her to do things she doesn’t want to do

...except house a person in her body for nine months, push it out, and then look after it with precisely zero help from the person who made 50% of it. yeah, you're doing great, champ."
439,How about because it's pretty fucked up to tell OP it's her job to fix a sexual harasser?
440,"Yes.

When the conversation came up i specifically said “you knkw, you can have an open relationship?” 

His justification was there are too few women who would be willing to accept that. Which is hilariously moronic and hypocritical. "
441,"I honestly would have said no to showing him my camera roll without an explanation. Regardless of whats on there, thats just bullshit and OP isn't a child. "
442,"Came her to say this. Listen I’m blunt, I’d be dropping a few “just fuck off now” comments. But before you get there you’re absolutely within you rights to say “I am busy” or “I don’t want to talk to you” and just don’t engage. Anything else gives a hint of you’re just busy at that moment when what you are saying is “talk to you never”. Tell her bluntly and get comfortable making it uncomfortable"
443,"Considering the fact that one of the most educated and hardworking people I know currently has chocolate edibles in her freezer and one of the laziest and most ignorant people I know doesn’t even touch alcohol, I’d say that maybe you’re just hella sheltered and need to get out more if you still think like this. "
444,"So you are out with people she has never met before and you think this is a good time to ""bust her balls"".  Yeah, you need to be more sensitive.  She probably wanted to make a good impression on your friends and you blew it by making fun of her.  There's a time and a place for appropriate teasing and you picked the wrong time."

449,"You weren’t present in the relationship at all and you have the nerve to be mad at her for going to see her family? Maybe if you’d bother to look up from your texts and email once in a while she’d have stayed. Knock it off before she gets sick of it and leaves for good. You felt lonely? Now you know how she felt thousands of miles from home, pregnant and ignored by her husband. Get your shit together, dude. Your job is never going to love you back and you’re gonna wind up alone if you don’t make changes."
450,"yeah, no crap. the above comment offers insight into that mindset, your reply however is not adding anything"
451,Is it possible your mom was the one who didn’t want to get married?
452,"

Are you just looking for a reason to divorce your wife? It's not 1950's no one should have to ""stay together for the kids"" anymore. It's harder for kids with unhappy parents who force themselves to stay together than show their kids what it's like to be in a healthy relationship. 

Relationships are work but they shouldn't always be an uphill battle. You said you married your wife because she got pregnant and you thought it was the right thing to do. That's a pretty shitty foundation and I personally would probably resent someone that married me for that reason. 

"
453,I feel like you need to ask her what she was really upset about 
454,"You need to get to your parents' first, then worry about that. They will be able to help you get medication that will help with the panic attacks. I can almost 100% guarantee that they're sick and tired of seeing you dragged through the mud by this abusive jerk. They will want to help you, first thing. 

You wrote in a previous post that this guy is against pills and throws away any meds you get. You know why that is, right? Because if you're medicated and clear-minded, you'll leave him in a hot second. He's controlling you. He's keeping you sick and keeping you nearby because he's USING YOU.

Get to a safe place. Have your parents come get you. See a doctor immediately for the panic attacks. but DO NOT GO BACK.

You have so much life ahead of you. It'll be amazing. You can do this. "

461,"I'd briefly wondered about a neurological problem. I've read anecdotes about people who morphed from Jekyll to Hyde and it turned out they had a brain tumor. Really fucking scary to think about. I will try to get him to see his doctor but am not sure if my husband will accept the possibility something is wrong. 

I snooped because we have a location sharing app and I was noticing him out in random places. When I asked he'd always say he was running errands but wasn't bringing anything home and I just didn't feel right about it. I didn't find any suspicious texts or emails, just the pictures of this one woman I've never met. The obvious guess would be he's having an affair but if so he's deleting all communications. Or he's got an undercover life as a PI. Hell if I know anymore."
462,"Even more reason to speak up and say something. Cheating is already a scum bag thing to do, doing it while your guy is deployed serving your country is just unspeakable. "

464,"Does he refer to it as “watching” the baby? That bumps up too close to when dads say they’re “babysitting” to me — it’s his baby too, he’s parenting, not watching. It makes me think he sees you as the mom and nursemaid and not a full person. You’re not supposed to have interests beyond him and the kid. Yoga and Pilates are ok because they’re established as safe Mom activities. "
465,Groups like that are gross. You should leave him for having no trust in you. This is a major red flag of things that could happen in the future.
466,"Does he understand that you are not ok with this approach?

As I said before, it might help to talk this through in marriage counseling, because it sounds like it has been a tricky and sensitive subject that you’re not making progress on."
467,"At first I thought this was a joke and you were fake over reacting to something small, but your responses have changed my mind.

It's not that he just wouldn't try or genuinely failed, its that he was going out of his way to lie to you and to sabotage any attempts to make them together. That is weird.

I noticed you said he couldn't even peel them correctly and I'm curious about that. At the least, he should be able to boil and peel the eggs while you make the mix and fill the eggs. Has he eaten hard boiled eggs in front of you ever and had trouble peeling them? If an egg is boiled correctly, it really should be very simple to peel for anyone over age 5 or so. This should have been the first clue that he either was lying or lacks basic coordination."
468,"Teenagers, yes. 

Source: I foolishly threw out a condom wrapper in my parents' garbage thinking it would be normal for them to have condom wrappers in the garbage. It was not. My mom had her tubes tied years before (which I was unaware of). I was 15 and almost started World War 3 in my house."
469,"I would also have a very hard time with this decision. I think, if I were you, I would have him remove himself from your home. Are you willing to bet your 4yo’s life that he won’t do this to your child?

472,It’s not like I never get to do anything he just always has stuff under a microscope. Like the moment he thinks it’s irrational he shoots down the idea. I understand where he’s coming for but I don’t feel like everything should have to be logical all the time either. Anytime I try and say it makes me feel he always says “ that’s something I can’t quantify stay on the topic at hand”. At the end I’m always confused how I end up agreeing with him. 
473,"I don’t want to come off as rude, but it sounds like you just don’t want to be with her. After reading all of this it doesn’t sound like she’s really done anything wrong. 

Sometimes couples do say random things, even if it doesn’t make sense. We’re human. 

And the story with the drawer, well I would just close the drawer. My fiancé does stuff like that all the time. 

As for the food situation, well I mean she doesn’t make as much money as you so I can see why she can’t afford it, however the excuse with her forgetting her purse is pretty sneaky.

I just think that because you don’t love her anymore, these all seem like problems when in reality they’re actually pretty normal. 

Like a lot of people on here said, you know what to do. End it for both of your guy’s sake, because you’ll just resent her throughout your relationship and then she may make a post on reddit about you guys. 

Goodluck mate. "
474,"The number of times you insult him and talk about how hilarious this was is ridiculous. Even if he was playing up the injury, you are acting like you did absolutely nothing wrong. 


You spend this entire post blaming him for you jumping on top of him."

She didn't support you, therefore you don't owe her anything now."
476,"Honestly, she sounds emotionally abusive here."
477,"Just to be the very firm anti-nazi voice I see missing here: seeing your sister would be doing a TRAGIC disfavor to your family out of your own weakness, and letting your children interact with her (or her children) would be damaging beyond belief. She is a million miles away from being worth interacting with, and your time is better spent telling everyone you’ve ever met not to talk to her than letting her be part of your family. This is not a close decision, she is endorsing genocidal behavior and cannot be dealt with as even an acquaintance.

CUT HER OUT. "
478,"You just seem incompatible. In order for this marriage to survive one of you has to change pretty much everything about what they like (or agree to live a life that's in contrast with their likes), and that's just not fair to either one of you. 

I would just bite the bullet and get a divorce, since you're completion incompatible in more ways than one. "

OP, this is ridiculous. Utterly and totally ridiculous. "
480,"If you decide to terminate, you're not obligated to tell him, but it wouldn't be wrong to tell him if you feel his emotional support would help you (or if you'd like him to pay for half of the termination). 

If you ultimately decide not to terminate, then, yes, obviously you have to let him know. "
481,"If you really think his behavior is ordinary than your cousin is basically removing what's making her marriage hard, despite that thing being a person and her kid. 

I think the best option is to see if there is another family member he could go live with since his mother sucks and doesn't want him. Then at least he won't be at a behavior modification school. How old are you? How kind/patient? Can you take him in? (Understand that being kicked out so mom and her new husband has a smoother marriage will understandably probably impact him even if it's too family.) Your cousin could send you (or the other family member) however much money it costs to support him, she'd have to pay that anyway. "

lol i bet it is mate. maybe this is why she doesn't like you? just a guess tho"
483,"Both of these combined just kind of clicked to explain me. I'm very good academically, can problem solve in theory and know a lot of random nonsense but in ""real life"" I'm just kind of daft a lot of the time, don't think things through, miss obvious solutions...somehow everyone seems to identify me as intelligent but I feel like it must be a massive fluke a lot of the time because I can be just sooo dumb xD"
484,"&gt;I personally would stop wearing the clothes she bought me

This sounds really strange to me. I mean, to each his own. But if you apply that same reasoning to other things, they start to get weirder and weirder.

If an ex had bought a computer for you, or maybe a car, would you feel obligated to sell, or throw it away? What if she had paid you a course or even helped you in your college? Would you refuse to work in the area in the future? Or if she had paid for a plastic surgery for, say, your nose? What would you do then?

I cannot see much sense in the act, but obviously respect that different people act differently. I see no reason to stop using an object for the same reason that I see no meaning in the other things I mentioned above, but if it bothered my girlfriend, I would stop using it without much trouble."
485,I don't think most 24 year olds have the experience/clout to demand a transfer to the Huntsville branch but I guess it's possible. 
486,"Honestly, I don't know. We don't know how seriously the friend takes his photography hobby. It's completely possible this whole thing is 100% professional. 

What I'm really finding it hard to believe is that neither stopped to think that it might cross a boundary for OP? 

You have to consider the consequences when the line between professional and personal are blurred. There are comments here from photographers who've taken explicit pictures of their friend's partner and it turned out fine. I would gamble and say that outcome is the exception, not the rule. 

I'm not saying I would break up if I was OP's shoes but I would seriously reconsider if I wanted to be with someone so thoughtless and dumb, as well as reconsider the friendship. 

Also, there's alot of comments here pointing oit how it's really difficult to take naked pictures and how vulnerable the gf was. OP didn't ask her to take these pictures. She chose to do this, and to go about it this way."
487,"I mean, she did try. She doesn’t like it. Presumably you tried watching cooking shows and didn’t like it. Sounds like you need to find a different activity to relax and do together. "

Yes you have the internets permission to do what you want and end it with her.

She might be sad but you feel how you feel. Time to find someone who knows what they really want. "

490,I married that guy and had two kids. It only gets worse. You have to leave now and don't  look back.  You deserve more and you can do it too.
491,"I agree that your husband needs to go to therapy and maybe see a bariatric doctor or clinic. Not for surgery, not right off the bat. But they can help him learn how to read food labels, learn how much he should be eating, what kind of food substitutions are easy to make, do bloodwork to make sure he doesn't have any underlying hormonal issues, etc etc. There are also RX medications that can limit the absorption of fat from food. There are also appetite suppressants, but those are extremely dangerous and he absolutely should not take them having already had one heart attack. 

I'm speaking from experience. I'm a 32 year old woman and I used to weigh 299lbs (at least) and I'm down to 208 in the last calendar year or so. It's an emotional journey. It's so hard. You're hungry all the time. You're used to having food as that comfort. I picked up a vape even though I know it's terrible because I cannot break that hand to mouth motion. 

You cannot make him do this though. He has to want to do it. And yeah, it is extraordinarily daunting which may be part of the reason he feels like he just can't start. I can't express to you how hopeless weight loss feels when you're extremely overweight. You can't exercise because you can't catch your breath (and I'm disabled so it's worse), getting used to eating fresh food sucks because it doesn't taste right. I'm lucky in that I already knew how to cook and enjoyed it so learning to cook healthier hasn't been horrible. 

You should definitely encourage him to see a therapist and coordinate them with his regular doctor to help him. "
492,[removed]
493,"Exactly. Why would you let her talk for an hour about a 5yo saying “oh my gosh”?

OP if you are as close friends as you say, you should be able to tell her to cut it out. You can’t make her stop altogether but you can certainly stop being her audience for it. Tell her you think it’s silly and unfair and you don’t want to hear about it anymore. I get not wanting to be confrontational but geez. "

497,Silent treatment IS passive aggressiveness though lol
498,"Hey OP, some of this post is quite confusing. Let’s assume your gf did get coffee at work with the guy (she says she didn’t, but for argument sake). Would that be a problem? Is your insecurity because you think the guy is good looking, so she must have a crush on him? I will say, if my bf phoned me and out the blue started asking about my relationship with guy X whose Facebook he had looked up, I’d probably be baffled and quite upset, and I imagine what I said would come across as defensive when mostly I’d be totally taken aback and hurt. "
499,"This ^ if you had to explain to him not to pick through your journal, phone, anything; he can’t be trusted. He clearly doesn’t trust you! People know not to pull that crap.

500,"You seem incredibly passive to a fault. Is this your first serious relationship? I am having a hard time believing the two of you are adults... The more I read about your interactions, the more I feel like this post was written by teenagers. You both seem really naive and inexperienced with relationships.

Like, you and your mother's lack of reaction is  one of the most ridiculously passive things I have ever seen.  She just let her keep the jacket?  

And obviously it was intentional or your girl would have at some point realized she had the jacket, been embarrassed and handed it back."
505,"My brother's mother in law has very bad dementia. She constantly loses or misplaces her belongings and then thinks someone stole them (if she even remembers she ever owned the items in the first place). Whenever she comes over to my parent's house, she always hides some of her things in my bedroom (I'm living at home right now). It could easily look like I stole that stuff, but I usually don't discover it for a few weeks. She lives at a special care facility now and often hides clothing in other patient's rooms. Those patients also have dementia, so they think that clothing is their's and wear it. Then she either accuses them of stealing or says something like, ""I have a jacket that looks just like that!""

If OP's mom is starting to get dementia, she could very well be doing this same thing. There's a chance she placed that jacket in the girlfriend's bag, forgot she did that, and became confused. Sure, there's a chance the girlfriend really is stealing an older woman's clothing (but why though????) but that was not the first thing I thought of. 

There's also the chance OP's mom is really devious and is trying to drive him and his girlfriend apart. I've seen it before on r/JustNoMIL. "
506,I'd rather deal with a snooze alarm every morning for the rest of my life than endure this.
507,"Well for 1, It’s ok for you to be upset, it must be frustrating to have her messiness disrupt your space, your routine, your sleep, etc. Just to be fully transparent, I feel pretty sympathetic to your wife. I’m messy and struggle with organization as well and I could see the constant clashing getting to me and frustrating me, especially since some of your qualms are justified but some are pretty demanding as well (like the shower thing..)

But yes, a lot of those things sound inconsiderate, or at the least, frustrating to deal with. I’m wondering, what does your and your wife’s routine look like? She wakes up earlier, she gets home later. The household clashes definitely need to be rectified and I’m not saying she’s blameless but it does sound like she might just be burnt out. The morning tension especially speaks to this possibility because it sounds like she wants to sleep in, hits snooze, wants cuddles with you but is too tired for sex. To me it sounds like she misses you, she misses sleep and she’s strung out. And in that frame of view, you pulling away could be seen as hurtful in her eyes.

I’m not justifying her being a bad housemate, but you should really have an open, candid talk this weekend on how to resolve the household tensions. She definitely needs to build better habits  and be more considerate as to how her mess adds to your work, especially if you are the one in charge of the chores that her mess adds to. If I were you, I’d sit with her, tell her how her actions (reaccounted neutrally) make you feel like she doesn’t consider you, and let her explain herself but demand a change. The current situation you have here is not sustainable regardless of the reason, but letting her express her own views on it will make her feel less attacked and more like a partner."
508,"You're combining too many relationships into one:

To her husband you're a good friend, and he helped you out and now you're paying back.

To her, you're just a renter, and it sounds like she wants to just have the ""pay your rent and otherwise stay out of my private life"" relationship that's typical of landlords / renters.

Solution is to move out, find your own place to rent, and pay them the difference (right now they're getting the fair-market-value-rent + bonus, after they'll get just the bonus).  Vacate the room, they can find someone else to rent it, get the rent from them (and the bonus from you).

This way you can continue your friendship relationship with your friend, and not with her."

510,"In which case I'd say all well and good - mention it in passing that your ex and your mom are friends, acknowledge it's unusual but you're not in touch with her so doesn't affect you, all being well problem solved. Your GF might be a bit insecure about not having as good a relationship with your mom, maybe, but she might be perfectly happy how things are, just play it by ear. But I'd say certainly better to air it sooner rather than later, because if you've been together 2 years and one day say ""oh BTW my ex is in regular contact with my mom"", your GF would be justifiably concerned about why you didn't mention that before, and it makes it a bigger deal than it needs to be."
511,"The only person who has any say over your ex’s last name is (shocker!) *your ex*. It should *not* have been obvious for you to do something about the situation because there is literally *nothing to do* and *no situation*.

When the two of you married, she took your name and made it hers. What she does with it now is no longer anyone else’s business because, again, it’s not *your* last name, it’s hers."
512,"I get you so hard. I can say, and this is cold comfort, a lot of this nonsense stops in your mid-late 30s because you're not as in-demand by creepy types (BARF. I hate that it's either be invisible or be harassed). 

But that's 15 years from now. 

What can you do NOW?

You can talk to your male friends, clue them in and ask them for help. Especially in the group. 

You can volunteer for female politicians and leaders and help change the laws and culture around this. 

You can run for offie yourself!! Even in a lower way like ""Treasurer of College Office"". You can make laws and rules that make it harder on creeps to be creepin'. 

You can speak up and keep speaking up and calling it when you see it--good job on that. 

You can make art in whatever way you can around this and work through it and make something beautiful out of something horrible. "
513,"I don't think you're so much controlling, as you seem to have a valid reason for your feelings.  That being said, you really can't control her. You've asked her to comply with a request and she repeatedly defies you.  At this point this isn't a Thomas issue -- it's a girlfriend issue; seemingly one that repeatedly happens.  You've asked her not to sleep with another dude and she did.  You asked her to not be around him and she did.  You asked her again to not be around him and she did.  


At what point is enough enough for you? This girl really doesn't seem worth all the trouble she's bringing you."
514,"Odd thing to be upset about. You sound like a judgemental guy trying to come off as non-judgemental. And maybe you're not, but I think you should try and figure out what about this situation is actually making you upset. 'Cause it sounds like a whole lot of your problem. "
515,"I made that description up just for this guy. He was also a Christian shoplifter pot- and pill-head. Always asking me to come to Jesus and then walking out of a store with me and bragging he'd nicked cigarettes or candy, scaring the shit out of me that he'd get caught and I'd get in trouble too.

Anyway, ""come to Jesus"" was the only way any coming was going to happen...."
516,"Also, if it was me, I would mention it to my partner.  I'd be afraid it would come up later and then it might seen like I was hiding something."
517,"Yes,  the bloody bastard thing was funny but the private detective thing is creepy. "
518,"Uh, no, that would be a lot worse. What would be moral is if the husband stuck to the fucking marriage vows that he voluntarily took, and stayed faithful to his dying wife. "
519,"That God's going to teleport someone down for her, probably."
520,"You handled it just fine. He may not admit it, but your boyfriend probably feels insecure and he’s taking it out on you. It’s ridiculous to think every time a man pays you a compliment you would have to respond with, “oh thanks. I have a boyfriend!” 

I actually thought you were going to say you went off on the guy on who commented on your body and your boyfriend was embarrassed about the scene. Lol "
521,"This is really good advice.  Story:

I used to have a lot of people over at my house on the weekend.  Generally, we would have anywhere from 8-20 people come over and just hang out, talk, and drink.  Most of this took place on my back porch.

One night, roughly around midnight of a particularly populated night, a much older man comes *through my back gate with a bud light tall boy in his hand*, strolls on up to the porch, and says, ""Whose the man of the house?"" with a big smile on his face.  I raised my hand and he says, ""Well I was just out in my shed stainin' some wood and I saw you guys partyin' and I like to party so I figured I'd just come party with you!""  Which sounds really awful to me because this is a *stranger I've never met that lives close to me that decided it's okay to go somewhere with a bunch of strangers to drink in a house he's never been to.*

Uncomfortable?  You bet!  I just said, ""That isn't a good idea man, I'm sorry.  Have a good night."" He said something else trying to stay, and a friend told him it was time to go.  He was leaving, and then turned around and yelled about how he is polite and lost his manners, his name is Toby, and he'd like to party with us.  I shook his hand and told him, ""I'm sorry, but that isn't going to happen.  Good to meet you.  Have a good night.""

He hasn't talked to me again.  Some nights I feel we can hear him in his shed, staining with the tears of all these passed years, but I didn't have to have a super uncomfortable life with a nosy neighbor.  Just be direct, firm, and polite!  "
522,"What if her friends and family don't want to be in NYC? It sounds like a lot of them are on literally another continent, and it would be a pretty massive commitment to drop their lives to come and proivee the emotional support typical of a parent. 

Honestly, you remind me so much of my friend's husband it's weird, like money (and making more of it) is only the solution to one type of problem and the draining emotions of having a child are not that kind of problem."
523,In the right measure 
524,"Unfortunately, until youre willing to stand up to your family and possibly face the consequences, there are a very narrow margin of people that will be interested in you. "
525,"As much as it's something that I enjoy doing, it's not something that I would like to do longterm. Also, it does get tedious and tiring. 

I'm currently studying engineering and really want to pursue that in the future. "
526,"He's not ""wrong"" but constantly harping on it makes it seem like he's focusing on that just to scare her out of learning. It's a skill most adults can learn to do safely. "
527,It is strange but looking at everything you've said if it's a norm for your friendship then who cares? So yeh you two are weirdly close in terms of bathing together and writing valentines songs but I wouldn't say thats a bad thing
528,"&gt; I think it is also a problem, she is very different than my brother's wives.  They are all unemployed and mostly talk about their kids. 

This is a very important fact that you should probably put in your original post.  Your wife has absolutely nothing in common with your brothers' wives.  Why would you expect them to get along?  I get the impression that when your wife comes with you, you and your brothers probably go together to hang out and she's left with the wives' club, and she's uncomfortable.

If you are trying to make your wife's interactions with your family better, try to include her in your conversations with your brothers, or other people who have similar interests and hobbies as her.  Make sure you aren't trying to push her off to the girls' club. 

But honestly, don't expect more from your wife.  Once a month is more than enough.  You need to make sure that you are spending enough time with your wife and focusing on your life together, which includes spending time on your own shared hobbies and interests. "
529,"Does he know where you live or work?

People can be vindictive. Hell, he could lie, tell her you seduced him, and SHE could show up.

I told a friend that his gf was cheating on him once (I know this is a little different). His gf had confessed to me. However, when all was said and done, they made up, and both dropped me. Her for betraying her secret, him for thinking if I wouldn't keep a friend's secret, I wasn't a good friend.

They got married. Guess why they divorced a year later?

My point is, there is no benefit to you, just a sense of doing 'right'. "
530,"I'd consider that if I hadn't always hated driving in the snow/ice. To me there's literally not a single thing on this planet worth going out to when there's a foot of snow and ice on the roads. 
I've been friends with these people for almost 15 years. I wouldn't drop them as friends, I am just done with them expecting me to put myself at risk to hang out. But I'll all good on friends. I'm one of those people that's perfectly fine with the small handful I have. LOL"
531,"As someone said, now you can somewhat sympathize with what she was going through. That could bring you closer together if used properly. Have you considered couples therapy? "
532,The first shirt thing sounds like the best option. There's no reason for the guy she's sleeping with to get away with it unpunished either. 
533,"Their actions are not yours to decide. All you can control is your involvement. You can support your friend and not this choice, you can tell her you want to be her friend and support her but don’t want to be involved with this situation or hear about it. Or, if you judge her so harshly that you can’t truly be a good friend to her right now, you can distance yourself. Or you can try to empathize and see if there are parts of this you can find understandable. It sounds like you’ve expressed concern and she’s not interested in changing her mind on this relationship right now. It’s possible it will continue a while and then fizzle, or that it will blow up in her face in one of a hundred ways, or that his wife will die feeling loved and one day she will meet this man and it will turn out that they were indeed falling in love and this relationship will bring them both a lot of joy. Who knows? Not you. Your decision is on your involvement with her, only. Stop torturing yourself about the rest of it. "
534,It's really hard to salvage a relationship if you move backwards in it.
535,Jesus Christ. That sounds *horrible*.
536,"&gt;he is actually good - when im doing an errand or getting a massage etc he would watch the baby and never rush me. he would say ïts fine - baby is with his dad''

Dear, that isn't ""good"", that's the *absolute bare minimum*. You deserve more than the bare minimum."
537,"What the hell did I just read? The dealbreakers and giant waving red flags just kept on coming! 

He sounds like a sociopath. "
538,"Tell this guy, ""I'm sorry you got caught up in my aunt's scheming. I'm in a happy relationship and have no intention of changing that."" You don't need to talk to him outside of that.

As for your aunt, just stop talking to her as much as possible. She will never see the error of her ways."
539,Yes. You're asking for something for nothing. You're putting them in a position where they have to start the relationship off poorly by saying no.
540,"What would you be getting out of meeting him? Just a general sense of who he is or are you hoping to create some kind of bond?

Also, I own a four bedroom house and don't have a family."
541,"&gt; If I had been more insistent I am sure he would have backed off. I have never once been successful in refusing him.

Huh. Yes, that's what most women say who have been ""taken advantage of."" If I had just been more insistent... 

So basically allow yourself to be treated like a sex doll, or be denied sex forever. 

You need to be in marital counseling like, yesterday. He needs help for his porn and gaming addictions, both of which could be ongoing. **He needs to be able to clearly articulate what is wrong with your sex life, from your perspective.** If he feels like your sex life is fine, why? Does he feel that women shouldn't be initiating sex? Is he not attracted to you anynore? And remember, if you're doing all the work to save your marriage, you're no longer in a marriage. 

For the future, when he tries to have sex with you and you don't feel like it, ***exactly one ""No"" is all that is required before it becomes a crime.*** And one ""no"" is all it should take for him to back off."
542,"Yeah, he's so wrapped up in his insecurity, that he can't possibly be rational.   Don't take anything he said personal, it's clearly not about you.  

That last bit of blackmail is just his attempt to turn the blame around on you so he doesn't have to feel responsible for his own actions.  Move on with a clear conscience."
543,hahahhaha my husband lied in order to manipulate me HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH those were the good times AMIRITE
544,"No shit. I'm about 6'2 when I wear heels and the guy I'm talking to rn is a little over 6'1. He says all this shit about ""as long as I'm still taller than you"" and ""no I'm glad you aren't (whatever height)"" and it's really bothersome. Normally yes you're taller than me, cool. But I like my heels and it would only be for a few hours and sometimes I may be taller than you, who cares?? My most recent ex and I were the same exact height which actually didn't bother me and sometimes with certain shoes I was a little taller. We didn't care. It makes me miss him more lol. But what is this complex guys have about neeeeeding to be taller?? 

To piggyback off this, 2 inches isn't thay big of a difference. If she wants she can pop a hip and make herself a little shorter. No shame in kind of standing on your toes a little. No shame in looking up to kiss her if you have to! Lying down, height differences are way less noticeable. Anyone can be the little spoon if they want. "
545,"I skimmed the comments and didn’t see anyone else with this thought.

He either, 

1.)  belongs to that group himself, and goes there to get off.  Which is fine.  But he saw what he thought was you and freaked.

Or, more likely 

2.)  he has shown your nudes to his friend, which is douche but common among guys that age.  “Hey dude, look what I’m hitting”..

I don’t find it plausible in any way that the friend thought his friends girl was sending in nudes to a group based on the ends of some hair.  The friend thought he recognized your tits.

Either way, drop this douche."
546,"It's his... Unless you regularly have people over who mess around in your room. You are being way too easy on him here, sit down with him when he gets back and have him explain. "
547,Maybe he pees in the sink 🤢
548,"Hey man. Fellow disabled guy here and I wanted to chime in. My best friend got married last fall and asked me to be in his wedding party. (his brother was his best man). I of course accepted his invitation to do so but was very nervous about it. 

Being in front of a lot of people in my wheelchair can be really nerve wracking but I couldn't not be there for my friend. I was the only disabled person there but no one was bothered by it. 

I was in the pictures of the wedding party but was certainly not in all of them. They can easily take pictures with and without you. 

Trust me...you'll regret it forever if you don't go and I would almost guarantee that your brother doesn't regret asking you and would be hurt if you stayed home. 

I'll leave you with something that I've come to realize and has helped me feel much more comfortable in my own skin when out and about in my wheelchair...other people are way too worried about themselves to be putting any thought into your disability or anything like that. 

Hope that helped in some way. "
549,"&gt;  You do trust him not to do anything right? 

Yes."
550,She’s an adult. Respect the fact that she doesn’t want you to go into her place of work and don’t go. Don’t make it a big issue.

555,"But she's fine with the kid being in the company of someone who has killed someone, and gotten away with it with virtually no consequences through police corruption."
556,"Jesus Christ on a stick, yeah of course it's eazy breazy for you FIL to play nice and pretend like you're one big happy family. He's the killer that got to get away with it. And he's not done torturing your father it seems.

I feel so bad for your father but he might be better off without you if you feel so little about his tragedy. You and your bf ""decided"" that this tragedy wasn't anything really. Good on you."
557,"Wait - couldn't the chores wait til Monday evening or something? Chores tend to be pretty flexible, though they obviously need to get done eventually. And with regard to the work thing - what about taking a bit of vacation time? It still seems like his framing of the entire situation is very primary here - like, ""It's impossible to leave on Friday to make it happen"". I realize that vacation time can be hard to come by, but hell, even taking off Friday at noon or 1 could be a big-time game changer. You could arrive at 9 or 10 pm and then crash. Then Sunday you could leave at noon or whatever, get back home, take chore of the chores on Monday night."
558,The fact that he didn't talk to her first is. If we're giving him the benefit of the doubt.

560,"An entire community that now includes OP, since she found out about the death, and continues to have a fairly close relationship with her FiL (if my understanding of the timeline is correct, the holiday with her SOs family came after the revelation). 

Like, think about what is happening from your dads point of view, OP, he told you about this, what is potentially the most traumatic thing of his young life, and what does he see you do with that information?

You go on holiday with the guy, you start to freeze out your dad, and are now contemplating him never seeing his grandkids.

27 years of being, in your own words ""otherwise so accepting and was a wonderful father while growing up"", gone, in favour of an ""easy"" relationship with the man responsible for the traumatic event."
561,Actually break up and move on. This isn't healthy or normal.

I would be trying to find a new friend group so I don't have to be around them.   


If it would work for you, maybe you should start looking for somewhere else to live while simultaneously convincing your sister/Jack that he should move in and take your room. That will probably speed up the demise of their relationship. And if not, you're not there. "
569,"OP, this! If you're still financially dependent on your mom until you graduate/get a job, then just stall the tattoo process for as long as you have to be under her roof. Veto designs, veto tattoo parlors, etc.

571,"You're not replying to anyone's comments who say that it's not that shady. I think you're just trying to justify the fact that you're upset about this. I think it's a sweet gift and probably not anything with malicious intent on either of their behalf. Don't sweat it so much. Talk to her and if she seems innocent then let this go. Don't go looking for problems, trust me it never works out in your favor."
572,"You need to leave while he's at work. Get all your stuff together. Put all your important papers in one place. Know the location of everything that is important to you. Get your computer checked for keyloggers and spyware, then change all your passwords. Switch all your financial accounts to e-statements. Plan for where you are going to go and how you are going to get there. Plan for the date. Then on that day, put the plan into action. Grab your papers, grab your important stuff, grab as much as you can pack and move in one day. Then leave. If he's not there, he can't manipulate you into staying."
573,"Right. This isn't just a woman he works with, its a woman who actively wants to be with him and who he has a romantic history with. That is not ok for a relationship. So you're not wrong OP. But unfortunately, as others have said, he's flat out said he would rather break up than cool it with her :( And that's probably because he wants to keep her as an option. "

You're right, none of this is normal. Being annoyed/upset/wanting an explanation/wanting a conversation, sure, all normal reactions. She's got issues with you being friends with your ex or similar? Fine, let's have that conversation. But threatening to hit you and locking herself away are **crazy** responses. Does she have a history of reactions this extreme to things?

He used to not be this bad, but since he started a new job working with one of his friends its somehow gotten a thousand times worse. "
577,"I once went to a wedding where the only people I knew were the bride and groom.  So I drank as much as I could and I told as many different stories about myself to other people to see which ones would get back to the bride.

As a parent, I'd like you to just be honest with me. Don't downplay it. Tell me exactly what happened otherwise I can't adress it properly. Let me know that you almost fell on her and almost hit your head on a computer and have a big bruise. Parents are grown ups, don't coddle us, let us know what happened so we can handle it. You don't have to be rude but I'd appreciate someone just being polite and straightforward not handling me and not fully explaining as if I can't handle it. 

Also, if your grandma plays with her regularly warn your grandma (Not to avoid her, but just to watch out for this). Even if they do talk to their four year old, she's four. (Or whatever age if you don't know.) One conversation is no guarantee she won't do it again. "

Even though he was my friend he was actually pretty nasty to me, telling me I was fat and embarrassing to be seen with etc. But then he would call me up in crazy emotional states, want to vent at me about TMI like his anal sex issues, expecting me to be his therapist, venting receptacle, punching bag all in one. And it is SO GENDERED that young women are expected to be the receptacle for this. In my case I was able to just ghost him, but in yours it is a lot harder since you work together. I would suggest just telling Jane that you're not personal friends with anyone from work and you are much more comfortable keeping those spheres separate and just having professional relationships."

They did, and I never went homeless, but it put serious stress on multiple relationships. It really wasn't figured out until I changed careers, and was able to balance location and work in a way that means I can fully support myself if necessary. If this ever becomes someone else's problem, you do not have it figured out.

OP is better off just saying please give me space. I need to be left alone.

This is someone who is having mental problems. It may be ""mean"" but you cannot approach this normally because they are abnormal.

I think otherwise this is good advice. I'd also remove the sorry's. OP has nothing to be sorry about. She is being harassed.

If she continues after you told her to leave you alone then you need to move.

This is not the situation to deliver with a genuine smile and try to be courteous. This is someone that could be a potential danger.

Really what OP needs to do is put aside her need to be polite and friendly and be firm.  Adding flowerly language will not get her what she wants.

Honestly, I'd say something more along the lines of.

""I feel harassed by you. Please stop cornering me in the halls and trying to forcefully engage in conversation with me when it is obvious I am not open to it. When you ran after me the other day it SCARED me. I do not have a desire to be friends with you. I would appreciate it if you would keep your distance from now on. Thank you for understanding.""

There is this notion that being firm, or blunt is rude. That you need to apologize. This is how women get in trouble. Crazy people take any opening you give them. Take any kindness as consent. Which is why you need to be 100% clear."

610,I think that Jacobs lack of support and action  is a deal breaker for me. So will do.  I’ll need help if it gets ugly as I’m slight.  Jacob has right which I can deal with but not sure about Ryan.  
611,"No... don't do that. Even if this strange history doesn't leave bad memories with the bride and groom, others who may not know all of you as well might think you're an unpleasant person. That's what I would think.

Try something a little lighter. "
612,"This is spot on. OP was not wrong, but her friend's feelings are hurt because of her own doing. It's an unfortunate situation."
613,"I had to get the copper IUD because I can't put artificial hormones into my body and a pregnancy could kill me, and I have to say that even though I damn near broke the nurse practitioner's hand when it was being installed, I wouldn't trade it for anything. I was sore for about two days and now, four years later, it's just Eh."
614,"&gt;What can I do to force my brain to develop this missing part of itself?


Why do you think think that you can or should do this on your own? If your body had problems processing certain foods, or if your eyes had trouble processing images from a certain distance, or if there was anything physically wrong with your body that _interfered with your life and relationship_ would you be attempting to force yourself to figure it out on your own through sheer force of will?

Seeking therapy doesn't mean that you're broken, it means that you're actually serious about doing what it takes to make your relationship work."
615,"Wait, so why does her husband care that his 18 year old stepdaughter is moving out?  I would think he would be happy. It doesn't make any sense that her moving out would put a strain on their relationship."
616,"That's really sad. He's a jealous and petty and immature. Not really the best investment for a partner in life. It's your call though. You wanna date shitty people, go nuts. "
617,Speaking honestly I probably should. This is just about beyond my coping skills and the stress is infiltrating other areas of my life. 
618,"Ugh, that was my sister. 3 tried to pass her test, and then 4 accidents in the first 6 months, all of which were her fault, and a few that she lied to my family about. They didn’t understand why I refused to get in the car with her until she came home one night (it had rained a bit) missing a mirror, and claiming someone sideswiped her. It actually turned out she took the thing off against a street post..."

620,"Let her have her little temper tantrum and go to the landlady if she likes, as long as there’s nothing on the lease about no pets at all then you’re fine. She’s being totally unreasonable. I would suggest locking your door when you aren’t there in case she tries to sabotage them somehow?

The sliding into the DMs thing is so weird. Just reduce interactions with her to the bare minimum."

623,"Was this OKCupid?

If so, check the username of the account. If it's his first name and a bunch of numbers after it, then it means he created the account sometime around January/February or later - that's when OKCupid stopped letting people have usernames."
624,"If he's paying the bills, I'm not sure how you can ask him to cut it back.  Can you increase your hours or pick up a second, part-time job, so that he can scale back his on-call status? 

If he really can't cut things back because of finances, then you essentially need to get used to feeling like you're married to a first responder (I have plenty of those in my family) and carve out your together time when you can...at least until finances change for you as a couple."
625,"For context I'm 33 male, I've seen plenty of assholes like this guy.

Like others have said, he's creeping on you. You deserve to feel comfortable at work. Work is often a shitty enough experience on its own, you don't need his bullshit making you dread it even more.

* Remove him from snap and if he asks why tell him you're not interested in communicating outside of work.
*  Bring it up to HR, now is fine if you feel like it or wait to see if stops, up to you.
   * If you don't have access to HR, go to your manager
   * You can tell them exactly what he's done or say something like ""he will not stop asking me for personal communication outside of work after I told him I was not interested in it"".
* Protect yourself, don't worry about him at all, he's 30 years old and knows better, he is deliberately taking advantage of you being a young adult.

This is pretty doom &amp; gloom, you're likely already aware, but in case you're one of the many people society fails to properly prepare for joining the workforce:

It is often the case that reporting inappropriate behavior of coworkers is mishandled and the company tries to sweep it under the rug and penalizes the person who reported the behavior so that you don't spread information that could hurt them. THIS IS ILLEGAL. You have rights that protect you from this but the reality is it can still happen. If it comes to the point where you need to report this guy, use your judgement of the person you report it to about whether or not they will be supportive of your right to work without harassment. Start looking for another job if you think they will not help you but still report the harassment if you don't feel it will endanger you. You could sue the company or report them to the labor board if it comes to that (you should do that cuz fuck those guys but it is understandable to just not want to deal with any of it)."
626,"I found out on Christmas Day that a friend of mine was having a baby. I messaged his girlfriend to say congratulations. She messaged me back the next day to say she'd lost the baby a few weeks prior and thought that everyone knew. 

Having to tell people you had a miscarriage must be awful, I really feel for you."
627,Do not adopt the baby. And do not offer to take care of the baby. Direct her to some social services.
628,"Okay, that only worries me because of the photos he has on his phone. I'd just try and talk to him. If he's embarrassed about the homeless situation then maybe you can still get through to him. "
629,"He was *caught with photo evidence* stealing homeless people’s change and she thinks he “won’t admit to a problem” enough to see a doctor? What fresh surreal hell is this?? 

“Not sure if they’re connected”? He’s the one actively engaging in anti-social behavior, he’s the common denominator, the connection is he’s a sociopath. Jfc I feel like I’m taking crazy pills "
630,"Did she ever have a party phase? 

I use to go out a lot, and I would stay out til 5am most times. My partner, bless his soul, knew that I liked to come alive at night.  
 

Let her get it out of her system. It will naturally run its course and she will (hopefully) stop on her own. I did. "
631,"I think a big issue is that OP wants to put in effort, but the bf, theactual owner of the dog, half asses it. She has asked him about neutering, and he refuses. She is the one walking him and the bf only picks up after him three times a week. She has ended up doing the brunt of the work, while he gets final say over dog stuff, and she ends up implementing it in spite wanting to do things differently. The dog seriously needs to be neutered, especially considering most doggy daycares want that for animals going there."
632,"I love them both, plus I am a huge rabbit and rodent fan. I get what you are saying. A lot of dog lovers just hate cats and let it be known, but cat lovers are just supposed to be quiet about  dogs if they don’t like them. For whatever reason, it is totally acceptable to dislike cars, but people look at you like you are a monster if you voice a dislike of dogs."
633,"But he continuously lied, even deliberately failing all as part of a show, so that he could be lazy. That's not a little lie, that is a calculated, long-term lie that required deliberate effort to maintain. While I agree that he might not lie about big things like finances, fidelity, etc. it does mean he's capable of lying in order to get out of things and have OP do them instead.

OP, are there any other chores he ""sucks"" at?"
634,"You did the right thing. You made a commitment to pay that portion and you held your end. If you hadn't, you could bet your house your siblings never would have gone in on a vacation with you again. Besides, its exactly what you would have had to pay if you had been going on vacation alone. The only reason he even has room to complain is there was the potential for your siblings to eat the cost. Kind of crappy that he even considered that to be an option. 

Honestly, your husband is just being a complainer. It seems like his big issue is that he doesnt want to do anything HE doesnt want to do. And that is just not how a partnership works. "
635,"I would start calling them out every time they say something.  ""There's no need to speak like that"" or ""You know he's working very hard, there's no reason to say things like that"" or ""I'm doing what I feel is right for my baby, but I'll be sure to come to you if I have any questions."""
636,"Clearly he has a life if he has a gf, friends, a job, a workout regime, and apparently a great personality. There is a breed of guy who does game and watch anime in their free time, that’s just a fact of life and that population is growing and growing. The anime’s you listed are considered go-tos by many. They’re nostalgic, they’re easy entertainment. 

Ultimately, though. If it is unattractive to you and makes your ovaries shrivel up, break up with him. But there’s no good reason to change him besides making sure he’s physically healthy and drinks enough water. "
637,"Tell your husband to find a new home for the dog. Give him a week. If he doesn't do it, you do it. This is 100% his fuck up."
638,"This won't do anything for convincing myself it's not sexual, but if it's relevant she usually sleeps in these silk nightgowns that come to maybe midway up the thigh and are really low-cut, with lace and spaghetti-straps not sleeves. I just assumed on the nights he slept in there she wore something else, or he slept on the floor or I don't know. I really don't."
639,I'm a woman and I've had male roommates before. T-shirt and shorts is totally normal attire to wear in your own house when you're hanging out. It's only weird if you make it weird.
640,"I'm similar. Severe anxiety, very much overwhelmed by the daily realities of making in a living in this world. What made it worse was the fact that I did not have a full-time job until I was 28, because I lost most of my 20s to mental illness and wasn't stable enough to keep a job. And starting so late, when everyone else around me - YOUNGER than me - was already accustomed to the demands of daily work was humiliating, grueling, and overwhelming.

It took 4 long years and nearly a second mental breakdown before I said FUCK IT to the big city rat race and moved to a smaller town in a different part of the province.

I'm doing much better now. I'm in a different line of work that I actually like. The cost of living is 25% lower. I found a family-oriented company that actually cares about its employees and wants them to have a life outside of work. The dread still sets in every Sunday night, and I find myself desperately waiting for Friday every week... but I make it through, and I work hard.

The only lingering thing that pesters me is the fact that I cannot make my own work hours and build work around my life instead of the other way around. But that's the way it is for most everyone. You hand over your time to someone else. That's what makes me dread Mondays. That, and the nagging fear that I will regress into not being able to hold a job again, but that's another story.

OP should def see a doctor/therapist about her anxiety, but a big chunk of the problem is that OP just has to grow up a little later than other people, just like I did. Growing pains always hurt.

"
641,"""my ex would have my back financially if I fail, I don't feel you would""

That comment is really telling. She seems to fully expect the world to catch her whenever she falls.  If not you, her parents, if not them... the next person.

You are right to have your concerns."
642,"OP, there is a shocking lack of empathy in the casual way you mention that you forget to feed your dependent! What if your husband ""sometimes"" spent all your money so the two of you couldn't afford basic necessities.

That cat counts on you for all of its needs. You're the adult here; it's your responsibility.

**Feed your cat, OP!!** 

Edit: ""Its"" not ""It's"". Can't let that monstrosity slide!"
643,"Time to move on. You're not happy with the sex (or lack therof) and he is clearly not interested in you sexually. It's more than just his meds. It's simply the fact that he doesn't find you attractive enough to want to be with sexually. It's great that sex isn't the first thing for him, but it doesn't appear to be any priority for him when it comes to you. It sucks you've put some much time and patience into this, but the fact that he went to a strip club and was clearly interested in a waitress, tells me you're just a stop gap for him. He essentially just wasted 4 years of your life."
644,He didn't take it very great the first time..
645,"Thank you.

It does set my mind at ease. I’ve been worrying about it so much."
646,"Nothing to do. It's over. She's decided. She's moving to a new life, and you aren't part of it. Mourn and move on."

This guy sounds insufferable, but I have learned how to argue with these types: pick apart every word they use and pretend it's debate club. Is that how you want your marriage to go? I would think not. "
651,"It doesn't matter.  Those assholes couldn't even take 10 minutes to actually ask you guys what was going on?  Just jumped on the bandwagon....throwing both of you under the bus.

Family and friends are supposed to show love and support.  They didn't.....so they are not your family and friends.

Pardon my language but fu\*k them.  They can reap what they sow.  Actions have consequences, and they need to learn that and live with them.

If they come back begging for forgiveness, apologize, and explain....then maybe reconsider.  People are human and make mistakes.  But short of that...stay the course.

I would let your wife know how much your support means to you, and that she never doubted you.  Start making new friends....that will become you family someday."

654,"If you are able, start researching how early she can feasibly leave home and come live with you. If she definitely has to tough it out til 18, do whatever you can to help make the next two years bearable.

I definitely agree about encouraging her to get a job, if your dad will allow it. Sell it as having less time for the boyfriend and less opportunity for drugs and sex if you have to.

Help her keep any money she makes in an account he can't access. Help her get copies or originals of her important documents like birth certificate and social security card.

Encourage her to do well in school and keep her eyes on the prize - which is freedom at 18. 

Therapy for her, if possible.

If things get super unbearable for her, look into what one has to do to be an emancipated minor. This will be especially helpful if she wants to go to university and go no-contact - he won't be able to manipulate her by withholding his financial information when she's applying for financial aid for school.

TL:DR - make the present as bearable as possible while working towards a bullshit-free future."
655,Don't do it. I moved to another English speaking country to be with someone in similar circumstances and it was literally the worst decision I ever made in my life. I don't want to go into deep detail but I'm still paying for that decision mentally and emotionally decades later. You see red flags. I did too and ignored them. Don't be me. Don't ignore them.

657,"This. 

When the Bank of Mommy runs out, guess where she will turn?!"
658,Absolutely!!! Exactly this. It's not just awkwardness we women have to fear in a situation like this.
659,You have to stop avoiding the financial conversations. You're married you should combine your finances use 1 account and you can both see what the other is spending.  You two are handling finances like you are an unmarried couple
660,"Yeah, I'm stuck at this bit too. It sounds like he's making a range of excuses to avoid having to deal with that - he'd be attracted to you if it wasn't for the depression, now he's framing you as a lot less capable than you are because of your neurological condition. I'm sure he loves you a lot, OP, but I think he needs to seriously think about ""boarding on gay"" and if that's what's affecting your relationship."
661,"Some people just don't think cheating is the worst thing in the world. I can think of a few things I'd be much more upset about if my partner did it, personally, but I know the opinion on this particular forum is very black and white on the issue.

Time to find someone who holds the same view as you if you don't trust her."
662,"If he can date online, you can dump him online. Bye boy 🙋‍♀️"
663,And also that she cares more about his attention than him as a person.
664,"You say your marriage is fine outside of his weight, but I can't believe his weight isn't effecting your relationship in many, many ways. Like, are you even still physically intimate with him? Are you attracted to him on a sexual level? Because not to be a shallow asshole (I've battled my weight myself, so I do have sympathy and tolerance for people who struggle as well), but I don't see how you are being fufilled by this relationship at all. Not to mention how hard it must be to maintain respect for someone who shows no interest in bettering himself and who's actions are ultimately very selfish. If he keeps refusing to change, you need to decide if you want to stick around when he becomes a complete invalid from his obesity who can't even get up to go-to the bathroom...assuming he gets to that point. "
665,not to mention that an artist willing to copy or do the same piece he did on someone else is not only disrespectful but a sign of the artist's incompetence at least morally...  any good artist would be unwilling to do that even with the reason behind it...

668,"See. That's your exact issue. You are already defending the action and rationalizing it as normal in your mind. It's not normal. You were absolutely relentless and badgering her for updates. That is not caring, that is not in good faith and it is going to push people away. "
669,"&gt;  they couldn't afford their new house if not for me

Then they should not be buying a new house. Their poor financial decisions are not your concern. If you would do better mentally by renting a room elsewhere, where you're not besties with one roommate but resented by the other, then you should move. They can find another roommate."
670,"Im trying counseling. We go this coming Monday. Im hoping hearing another persons opinion will shake him up on how messed up it really is. 
Idk though..."
671,"Yeah, hiding it would only protect them "
672,"It's sooner than you think! Also, if you can't do a job, can you volunteer? Go on academic/church oriented trips? Join a new activity group? 


I'm just worried about you having more positive spaces in your life. Try to create as much positive space and human connection over the next 23 months! You got This! "
673,"120 lbs is a lot, but OP says that's over the course of ten years. That averages out to a pound a month, which is not a drastic speed for weight to change. It's overeating by just 100 calories a day, it doesn't sound like it would be related to a health issue."
674,"The solution to this part is easy, put her and yourself on the same personal budget. I'm sure your wife likes spending money on other personal (not the kids, that should be separate) things besides hobbies. "
675,"Obviously she has more issues with the ex than she ever let on.

O know there is going to be people who say that her going behind your back would be a deal breaker for them (and it might be for me too) but I will say that at a minimum, don't even think about getting married until you have had some couples counseling. 

"
676,"Exactly. Guy would have driven right on by if OP had been a 21 year old guy. He saw a young girl in need of help and decided he could use the situation to his advantage. He's a total creep who saw a ""damsel in distress"" and figured he could use the fact that she'd feel indebted to him as a way to try and get her to sleep with him. I would not be surprised if, when OP turns him down, he tries to say she ""owes him"" because he took the time to help her."
677,"First of all, you are absolutely right. It shouldn't be this way. Putting up with creepy men is not the rent women pay to exist in the world. It's wrong.

That being said, there are not a lot of things you can do to make it stop, except deal with each incident as it happens.

You've already learned to stand up for yourself, and that's good. I can't think of anything else except, maybe, give men less chances and less benefit of the doubt. Be louder sooner, if you feel you can safely do so. They may use up less of your energy that way.

But mostly, this is just going to suck, because that's the disgusting culture we live in. I'm sorry."
678,"After getting out of my previous relationship with someone who emotionally abused me and was taking me for granted I was down and I admit a little depressed.
I had very low self esteem, was panicking about the future and felt generally depressed and anxious. 

A friend at work convinced me to try Tinder. I needed a confidence boost and thought seeing who I thought was hot near me, and if people thought I was hot would do me good, so I went for it. 

I didn’t know what I was doing, and forgot to change my distance settings as well as my profile other than a few pics. 

My second match was the most amazing man I’ve ever met and had the sheer luck to be with. We clicked straight away, neither of us wanted a relationship at that point as we’d both come from long term relationships. I wanted someone a little closer to home (he lives about an hour and 15 away) and he tells me he didn’t usually swipe on empty profiles. 

We met about a year and a half ago, and it’s been the best time of my life. We’ve both been promoted, and I’ve found a new found confidence with a man that adores me, and who I in turn adore. We’ve started planning our futures together and plan to relocate to Cheltenham soon. 

I used to be so scared about the future and getting old, now I can’t wait to share all the adventures of life with my man. "
679,"Your last point is very true. Like OP, I have also struggled with standing up for myself and dismissing my emotions in fear of not being the “cool girl”. I’m seeing a therapist now who is helping me recognize my emotions and assert myself. One point she made that I thought was interesting is that there may be a bit of a backlash when I become more assertive, that it will change the dynamic I have with some people close to me. This is what I see happening in OPs post."
680,"Not to mention, friend has now lost time with her closest friend AND the boy she wanted to string along.

OP gave her every chance to speak up when she made her feelings clear. Keep doing you, OP. 

And in the least catty way possible, I might even tell him what’s going on just so he doesn’t get the wrong idea or manipulated by her. People can get crazy when feelings are involved."
681,"&gt; Especially since this isn't the first time questionable behavior toward women has come up with him.

&gt; We both know he has issues

Geez, OP. This isn't complex at all. Your friend is creepy to women. You've known this for a long time yet you've continued to be friends and roommates with him. You socialize with him, which provides him respectability and access to more women than he'd have on his own.

You are complicit in his shitty behavior. If you have a decent bone in your body, you'll end your friendship and your roommate relationship with him, and make that clear publicly. Your boyfriend should also end his friendship with him. You can't force the guy's employer to fire him, don't be ridiculous. But stop protecting him, because you're just making it easier for him to target other women.

"
682,[deleted]
683,"You leave, that's what you do. Choking is the #1 sign that a partner will end up killing their SO. Do not stay in this relationship, your husband is unstable. Call a women's shelter or family that can help you leave. If you need more proof that he is abusive go to loveisrespect.org stay safe. "
684,"and worse: she is comparing her friend's highest to her husband's lowest, now that he is sick and all..."
685,"This is incompatible. 

You went into therapy over your views of weed. I find that says enough about why you are incompatible. You still have very extreme beliefs about pot compared to most of the *world*. 

I’d say get over your judgement of other people’s actions before you get into another relationship. 

Her using weed isn’t what I would call a flaw. It’s choice.  **I’d call your extreme judgement a flaw.**


You can say she doesn’t like it all you want, but if she tried that hard to get you to explore it and did it at a family event, she likes smoking weed man. "
686,"OP, pay attention to this and the other supportive comments. You didn't do anything wrong. If you don't start receiving supportive messages, you want want to look for a team of non-assholes in the future. PS: Don't bother responding to guys who are dismissing/diminishing your experience. Eff them."
687,That's really controlling and invasive. Have you wondered if he's projecting?
688,"I don't particularly mean to pick on you, but comments like these are really frustrating. It's not even specifically because the advice is bad, but because you are making ""my partner doesn't want to have sex with me"" into some kind of insane lockpicking expedition. This ALWAYS happens when men post about this issue. Are you doing enough chores? Are you taking her on enough dates? Are you taking her on too many dates? Are you spending too much time at work? Are you spending too much time at home? Are you giving her enough gifts? Are the gifts thoughtful enough? Are you touching her too much? Are you touching her too little? Are you complimenting her enough? Are you complimenting her the right way? Are you complimenting her in the right tone with the right gifts at the right time when the room is the right temperature and the radio is neither too loud nor to quiet? And there's a full moon??

And when the answer to all the questions is, as in this case, ""I'm doing everything I possibly can to make my partner feel loved, respected, and cherished,"" all the advice flips around to ""Hmm. Maybe you are doing the things TOO much. Ladies love the stoic sorts!!""

Women (rightly) hate it when PUAs treat them like a puzzle game where you just have to hit the right combo of buttons and sex will magically fall out. This ""try the following ten thousand combinations of behaviors. Good Luck Out There"" advice is shit whether it comes from a jackass with feathers in his top hat or from a bona fide actual woman in real life. OP's real problem is that his fiancee won't fucking communicate with him. He's doing his best, and his best is damn good from his description, and she's shrugging and going ""I dunno! haha!""

Again, I don't really mean to pick on you. You acknowledge yourself that you're only guessing, and you're far from the most egregious poster on this thread. But ""guessing"" what OP's wife wants is what's got him into this mess, and he has to guess because she won't SAY what she wants OUT LOUD with her mouth like a grownup. Let's not put it on him go guess his way into lifetime as a sadsack whose wife resents him for reasons which she keeps secret for the next 60 years."
689,"Man, I am having this situation right now. thankfully we have now cut off all contact, 1.5 months after the breakup. 

I'm 24 myself and this was also the first serious relationship I had. He broke up with me, but wanted to be friends. But when I asked for space, he kept asking em questions about moving out. So of course I broke down in front of him from time to time. "
690,"You're not gonna die but clearly you need tons of therapy and an attitude adjustment. Your friends are not asking you to jump out of a plane without a parachute. They are asking you to do something hundred of millions of people do everyday. Stop acting like your issues are normal and not just your issues that you are refusing to find treatment for. If you refuse to try to get better via therapy, dont expect your friends to wait around for you to realize you dont have any anymore. You've made it clear how low they are on your priority list. 

Here's an analogy for you - If I have been raped by a man and now insist that I cannot ever be in a room with a man again would it be reasonable for me to request that all my friends make their husbands leave their home whenever I come visit because I refuse to treat my past trauma? No, because it is not reasonable for me to expect my friends to be so inconvenienced all the time just cause I keep refusing to seek help/therapy for my problems."
691,She deserves to know her man is sneaky and you have proof if he tries to deny it. Screenshots are your best friend but keep that as a last resort 
692,Gotta love those people who try to turn the tables when they're caught.
693,"Attraction is essential but physical attraction isn't the only type. Why do you think people stay in relationships well into old age where they are no longer considered ""attractive?"" Saying you love her ""for the whole package"" but then qualifying it by ""only in the right body"" makes the first statement come off as insincere. To be honest she kind of trapped you, but your answer was shit. If you guys are in it for the long haul there are going to be periods where her body is ""unattractive"" and it sounds like she is insecure about that (like many of us are) your answer reaffirmed that insecurity, hence the strong reaction."
694,If they can’t afford more than a one bedroom place for four people then probably can’t afford therapy either. What they really need is space because it sounds like all family members (children included) are over stimulated by being constantly surrounded by one another.
695,"It sounds like your kids are still really young. Parenting gets a MASSIVE ton easier the older they get. Eventually, you’ll be able to leave them home alone and go do things by yourself. Eventually, they’ll be old enough to spend the night at a friend’s house while you have a night to yourself. Eventually, they will be old enough to do chores effectively and entertain themselves while you nap or sleep in in the morning. Eventually, you will be able to have grown up conversations with them and discover them as human beings. Mine is only 9 but it is light years easier, more fun, and more rewarding than even 4 years ago, and a complete universe away from 8 years ago. Basically, I’m saying, gut it out for a few years and everything gets better. 

Also, if you have access to healthcare, go ahead and get your tubes tied. Better safe than sorry, you know? "
696,"I don't think that it's hard to understand why you didn't say anything, identifying the right thing to do and doing the right thing are two completely different beasts. It's hard to take a step that you know will have dramatic consequences in your life; deep down you must have known how strict your wife really is. I hope that, whatever you do, things turn well for you. I hope that you choose to support your son, and I also hope that your wife comes around, at least to a place of tolerance (I can't imagine that she can be ever truly happy about the whole thing, being that religious)."
697,"&gt;How can I crack this nut? I almost feel like I am approaching a wild horse that I need to tame, and that it is important to take it slowly. At this point, I am at a point with him where I can knock on his door, sit down in his office, and ask for advice in my research. I have never been out with him socially

Dude, please don't do this. Not only is it super transparent but it screams of Nice Guy - only gender flipped. 

You are a grown up adult. Next time you guys are in the same social space, go over, flirt a little and ask him out. Don't play weird games. Don't approach him like he's a ""wild horse"" you wanna tame. If he declines to date you, take the rejection gracefully.

Just because you have a crush, it doesn't mean he owes you anything."
698,"Does he know where you live? Ghosting sounds like a good way to have him show up. 

I'm a big fan of the ghost by the way. 

I suggest next time out drinking look into the local angel shot policy or inform the bartender in another way so they can call police.

Not a fan of aholes drunk with guns in a crowded place illegally. "
699,"If he isn't even taking care of himself, it's very unlikely he will be able to put in the care and effort for a healthy relationship; You will just stay at the place you are now as a couple. Do you want to be in a relationship like this forever? 

Also, while I don't know the extent of his eating disorder, i've dealt with a variety of eating disorders throughout my life and I can say that in the heart of them I would have absolutely chose my disorder over a partner. It's a weird mental battle where I would *want* to choose my partner, but I was so addicted to my ED and afraid to stop that ultimately it was the priority. I'm mentioning this because your boyfriend may be the same way. "
700,"&gt; ""That person you remember never existed. They were a persona I invented to fit in. This is the real me.""

This is something that no one wants to talk about: the feeling of betrayal the other person probably feels, as if they'd been lied to the entire time.  I really can't wrap my head around people who expect a person to magically repress this kind of pain and loss.  It also explains a kind of pain that the transitioning person feels that resembles guilt because they're ""hurting their loved one"" in the process.  It can be a painful time for everyone involved, and it's probably handled best when everyone just acknowledges the elephant in the room with empathy and patience and support for one another.  As long as everyone hangs in there and reminds each other that the love they feel is definitely the only constant and will never change, they can still get through the process together.

That's just my two cents."
701,"Dude you seem to have internalized some feelings about being worthless or unwanted.  Please seek therapy for that, and go to the wedding.  But tell your brother what you heard!"

704,"&gt;I’ve never had anyone get mad at me like this so it definitely gets me wondering that I must have done something wrong to warrant it

You never had to break it off with a blobby tiring demanding jerk before, I guess.  He says he misread you.  That turns out to mean that you have a mind of your own and don't want to be in a semi non relationship like he wanted.  

He's the one opting out of being friends.  Let him."
705,"No. Dump him. He's a gold digger. 

Bringing up moving in at one month and then again at 4 months after being shut down the first time is a huge red flag. 

""Im not ready to live with you."" Should be enough. If its not, its a HUGE red flag. "
706,"&gt;I'd stop having sex with him.

She can try that and hopefully it works for her. I have a different problem than OP and after talks with my husband I stopped having sex for 9mos and it didn't make much of a difference. Just don't want OP to get her hopes up thinking this'll work. "
707,"&gt;I actually just met him 2 months ago.

This is a terrible idea.  You don't really know this guy and you should not immediately jump to living with him at this stage of the relationship.    Add to this there is a big age gap and the red flags just keep flying.  

&gt;i can’t really stay with my family any longer,

Then get a roommate and make sure you can be financially independent of your family.   You can certainly keep seeing Joe to figure out if the relationship will work, regardless of the age gap, but do not jeopardize your living situation by moving too quickly in what's a very young relationship.   I get that the two of you have talked for years but that's not the same as seeing each other regularly.  Give the relationship time and space to grow before you live together."
708,"this is one of the funniest problems ever

if it's a child (10 yo or less) maybe you can tag along for a while so she can be happy. if it's a teenager, the next time he sees her, he should just tell her his name is X and he is not luis fonsi


maybe you can post her letter on social media and tag luis fonsi. if it goes viral everyone will give a good laugh and maybe luis fonsi will see it and meet the girl lol"

713,"Agreed! And also repeat everything back to him like a question when he tells you his side. If it’s not entirely accurate, he might get frustrated and correct you(himself) and you’ll be able to tell if he is lying in any way."
714,"Good for you for following through on your suspicions. Sometimes snooping is justified.

I can't believe he doubled down on his lie. People can be very shitty, I'm sorry."
715,Maybe try asking him if he'd really want to have sex when you don't want to do it and you'll hate doing it? It may making him start thinking a bit more about you and your feelings in this situation.
716,"He’s being petty and controlling.

It’s like not wearing underwear, it’s really not that noticeable unless someone is looking way too hard."
717,how is she not disgusted by her boyfriend making these moves on you??
718,"That's kind of terrifying. 

To put this into perspective from an outsider, there's you, who dissociates during anxiety provoking moments, and your bf who has no control over his anger and is overly aggressive and can't be talked down from his rage. 

Please tell me you see the danger there. 

As far as dealing with him, i'm not sure you can since he won't actual tell you what he wants beyond backing him up. The most I can gather from your posts is he wants you to throw down and fight on his side. 

All of your methods of trying to talk him down won't work because he wants to be angry, otherwise he'd be willing to at least work on it. 

He needs anger management, at least, and if you were to leave him, do so with witnesses present. "

725,"You thought your question was a well-veiled attempt at getting the truth from her, she saw it for what it was – an accusation – and got upset about it. That's on you.

You're upset that she caught on to your jealousy and insecurity, but the fact is you laid it on very thick."
726,"So 35/36 - 18/19, totally normal and not at all weird age gap. "
727,"You need to sit her down and tell her that the current situation with the boyfriend is not working for you. Explain that you pay for the use of communal space and that you don't want him enjoying these things that he does not contribute to. I would set up some ground rules going forward:

1) He cannot come over more than 3 nights a week and if they want to spend more time together they can go to his place. If he spends more than 3 nights a week there ever again he has to pay 1/4 of the utilities (don't let her budge you on the ""He's only here for 4-5 nights not the whole time"" if he overstays his welcome he pays an equal share of the total bill.)

2) He cannot be at your place unattended by her. If she leaves, he has to leave. That way he won't be taking up your common spaces. If you guys come home and he is there without her, ask him to leave. He will have to leave because he is there without his host. If he refuses to leave tell him to at least hang out in her room until she gets home since you want to use the common space you paid for. If you value your friendship with this roommate I wouldn't call the cops but that is an option for getting rid of an unwanted person in your space. 

3) If he eats your food or uses your shampoo/soap/whatever he has to pay for it. It doesn't sound like this is a concern though. 

4) If she wants to have him over 5-6 nights a week and they use the common spaces every night then set up a compromise where you get the common spaces for three nights in a row then they get them for three nights in a row, and then switch, or something like that. Make sure you guys take turns and you get your fair share. 

If she insists on him staying 5-6 days a week then tell her that he has to start paying rent then. Insist on him not being there without her. Also, if she pays utilities from her account this gives you some power since you can refuse to pay 1/3, instead pay 1/4 each to account for his portion. If you control utilities then you can cut off her access to the internet if she won't pay for his portion. If you own the TV and video game console and they continue to monopolize them then you can take them into your room so they can't use them anymore. If they own the electronics there isn't much you can do but I guess you could use a more nuclear option of removing the couch if you own the couch. 

Basically, you need to sit down with your roommate and tell her this isn't working for you. If she is agreeable and reasonable and agrees to no more than 3 nights a week (or if you don't care how often he's over as long as he pays utilities and doesn't use the living space he doesn't pay for) or whatever requests you have then it should be fine. If she is not cooperative then you can escalate to more nuclear options but I don't recommend that if you're friends with her. When your lease is up don't live with her again as she is clearly not the most considerate roommate. 

And by the way, unless you want to let people walk all over you, you're gonna have to be ok with confrontation sometimes. Just prepare what you want to say, write it down if you have to and even roleplay with your GF what her different responses might be. You can do this! "

Someone else can adopt the baby, like if she got married and her husband wanted to be the 'father', but I think that is the only legal way around that. Just FYI."

751,"Read ""Why does he do that?"" by Lundy Bancroft for an answer to the last 2 questions. You may want to see a therapist yourself if you're unsure about your interpretation of events at any point.

I think it's not the anger itself, it's what causes it - if someone's angry because of a desire to control another, then there's no point in ""managing"" that, it's not uncontrollable or alcohol-fuelled rage. Mixing alcohol with it doesn't mean the alcohol caused it. EDIT: so to recap, I'd support abuser/batterer rehab programs. He may be reluctant to use that label as it only happened once but he is one now - he used violent force on his partner in a stable, sane state (alcohol influence is not blackout), not in self-defence."

A good starting point may be some variation of ""You’re right, it IS a Massive Terrible Decision/Thing not to have my mother in my life; now how bad do you think things have to be for me to have made such a choice?""

Paraphrasing from someone wiser than me: for many people who haven’t experienced it, they just cannot conceive of the idea that the parent is not loving deep down, or that the hurt they’ve caused you isn’t just misunderstanding. They imagine a parent who WANTS to do better, but needs your forgiveness and patience to succeed. They can’t imagine a parent whose preferred status quo is to continue hurting you, letting you down, destroying your life, or monopolizing all of your energy. In short, they are picturing someone who might exist, but isn’t YOUR parent, and having feelings about that imaginary person instead of the one who’s actually involved. "
754,Endless passion is a Hollywood lie.  The people who claim to have it are usually the emotionally unstable types who seem to have passion with everyone.

But dude, going to your in laws every weekend is exhausting, and if no one even says a word to you for 3 hours, your booooooooored, and then your an asshole for sitting in your phone the whole time. I’d be so offended and hurt, did you try talking to her during this? Setting conversations up for her? Giving her some kind of in to the conversation? Because if you are just expecting her to go, and even her own husband can’t be bothered to talk to me or try including her in the conversation, I’d be set in never going. Let her go once a month, or when she chooses, AND tell your family that it hurts her when they don’t include her. 
"
762,"Im confused about your situation.  

If you want to live with high expenses in an apartment that she can't afford,  then you have to cover a lot... At her salary she should be renting a room for $500-600 per month with like 3 other roommates. She needs to live cheaper until she gains experience and grows her income. Takes time. Edit If she's budgeting and working on growing income,  I'd see that as a positive thing. If she's not...than talk about that. And decide how important it is for you to be with someone that can really contribute. 

Also,  Im surprised that you're paying her debt off so aggressively.  Do you guys plan to get married??

To me, I want someone that can at least be independent. And I try to arrange things based around that. It sounds like you want her to live at your income level and quickly grow into an income that can contribute to it. Which is fine and possible but might not be what she wants. Or feels is possible given her career prospects. Talk to her about her goals. How she feels about money"
763,"&gt; my wife volunteered a lot of intimate details including how we have sex almost everyday and we’ve talked about the next step possibly being opening it up. She then jokingly stated that her friend and her husband were pretty attractive.

You neighbors believe she is DTF because she told them she was DTF. She got wasted and shot her mouth off and made you look like a fool. You are not going to know who hits on her and when it happens, but she has opened the door and laid out the welcome mat. Personally I would be looking at moving. She will carry this reputation in the neighborhood forever. Your kids are going to hear rumors.


&gt; She just likes to gab about it, because female.

Nope. Not a valid excuse. My wife is a female and would never disrespect our marriage like this."
764,"&gt; It's about her not seeing me as someone she's trusts to carry out her desires when she dies

No, that's not what it's about. The trust issue needs to be worked on but the will is separate. Even if she trusted you completely, she needs to have a will. And her will should provide for her child. She has so little to leave as is, she wants to leave it to her child. You have no legal ties to the child, even if you intend to stay, it's not advisable for her to be irresponsible to prioritize your feelings. You are putting emotions above every logical piece of legal advice ever given.

Seriously, go to /r/legaladvice. They can give you advice on how to handle your own finances as you two discuss wills, and in the process tell you how wrong this is. It's never advisable to leave yourself or your loved ones legally vulnerable to avoid hurting feelings. She needs something concrete. This is the same matter as being offended over signing a prenup.

I also don't buy that it's only about trust because a statement you said earlier was along the lines of ""if I get nothing, she gets nothing"". Very selfish, which I will give you the benefit of the doubt on and say this is possibly a demonstration of the difference between a parent and a non-parent. Even if you provide for the kid, you're not his parent. A parent wouldn't see their child's safety as a problem."
765,"&gt; Her child would get less money if I die first and my assets go to my brother.

Why would you set it up like that? That's a massive slap in the face to her.  That's a TERRIBLE thing to do to her.

&gt; In absence of the prenup separating assets, my wife would inheret everything and could provide a great deal for the child. 

So don't make a prenup. Dude, if you intend to marry this woman, you really need to make her the priority, not your brother. Is this not OBVIOUS to you?"

770,"This.

Shitty people think everyone is shitty because hey, they are, what's stopping anyone else? But they don't want to BE treated the way they treat others, so they start accusing. 

When I was much younger and didn't know better, I dated a guy who got suspicious *every single time* I wasn't available precisely when I said I would be or when he felt I should be.

Stuck in traffic for an extra 15 minutes? Cheating. Had an unplayed VM? Cheating. I didn't want to listen to a VM from my ""other boyfriend"" around him. Nvm it was 99% odds a telemarketer. Ran to the store late for an item I forgot I needed in the morning? Cheating. Friend visited from out of town? Cheating. But he's gay. Yeah right you're cheating. 

I couldn't MOVE without being accused of something.

Want the punch line? 

He was cheating on me. And not only was he cheating on me, he was cheating WITH me on his fiance of 3 years. "
771,I have but one upvote to give
772,"It really is. I'm a bi girl, so I've had experiences of bfs treating my sexuality like it's their plaything. 

I absolutely don't think you're in the wrong for your feelings. He coaxed you into being okay with experimenting under the guise of it being a totally different and unique experience for you that he couldn't provide. Fair. You didn't want him to penetrate her, because that's an experience you CAN provide to him. Also fair. Then he tries to change the rules on you, slowly but surely letting you know that even though he may have had your interests in mind a bit, he couldn't help but prioritize himself over your boundaries. I would (and have for this attitude) throw the whole man out tbh"

That's the thing - for the past 2 months, we've been consistently talking to her about her relationship with C. Each time we bring this subject up, S gets quite defensive, and has told us numerous times that no relationship is perfect, that she's made her peace with C's flaws, and that she's not happy with where she is in life, but she's not unhappy either, and that's she's okay with that and we should accept it. It's never resulted in outright arguing or fighting amongst us, but it has gotten extremely tense to the point where we usually just drop the subject because S is clearly angry and unwilling to talk further. That is why we don't know if we should tell her - we've already been testing the waters, so as to speak, and S has been pushing back every time the topic comes up."

They will come calling once you are own your and employed.  Now you already know they are good for nothing and can tell them to kick rocks.

For dealing with the right now it may be a good idea to talk to your grandmother about it.  She may be able cover more for the camp in the meantime, while you could agree to pay her back as you make more babysitting.    "
784,"What grade are you in?? Report this to the guidance counselor or someone like that. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to be in a relationship with your teacher because they have ""power"" over you, so what he's trying to do is illegal. "
785,"I totally understand what you're going through, because I went through it too. My mom is a malignant narcissist, and would not stop bitching to me about my ex. Want to take a guess why he's my ex? She would go on and on and on. She was so rude to him, and so fucking belittling to him. And I kept her in my life because I adore my dad, and because I wanted my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents.

And you know what? It was a mistake. Unless you want to risk your mom driving a permanent wedge between you and your wife, and trying to do the same thing to her grandchildren, sever all ties with her. This means that you don't get to see your dad, but unfortunately you have no choice here. You absolutely cannot fix her behaviour."

788,"It's because when you repeat it back again and ask them to confirm, it feels like you're setting a trap (and you are). The only reason people would do that is if they already had information that said otherwise, and the liar doesn't want to dig any deeper by doubling down.




""Where did you go?""




To the store.




""Interesting, so you went to the store?""




*Shit, what does she know? Did I leave GPS on my phone? Did someone see me at the bar and call her? Crap crap crap*    ... On second thought, I actually went to the gym for a quick workout. I forgot.

789,"He says in a reply to one of my comments that accepting the drink made her look like a ""typical club girl"" and he ""knows she's more than that.""

791,"Agree, this is the comment I've been looking for. He learns nothing if you continue to stay with him, particularly if this is just the latest in a long line of misgivings. By babying him, he gets away with it. It's sad that he needs help, but he needs therapy, not someone to coddle him and take him back. I've been in a similar situation and can say that my ex benefitted from us breaking up and no longer having me to depend on."

797,"Maybe I'm the outlier here but I don't see the big deal. You are grown adults. Were they good photos? I mean, it sounds like your friend tried to do a good job with them, if it's a professionally bound book and all. She's not any less your girlfriend because a person saw her naked for some photos -- and she definitely didn't cheat on you. "
798,"I lived next door to a ""professional"" photographer who charged college girls to do nude photo shoots.  He had lights and everything! The first thing he'd do after a client left was start running around trying to show people on his laptop.  And he owned the copyrights.   Never a good idea."
799,"You want to work. He showed videos of kids being abused. He manipulated you by utilizing fear. He is also using God to shame you and guilt you into submission. 

He never intended to stay where you live. He wanted to isolate you. Really go over the conversations that took place when making that choice. I’m sure he utilized your compassion to benefit him. Google universities closer to home bet you can find one with his area of study.

Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men
Book by Lundy Bancroft

Do not let your parent know you are reading it. 

Read this article and then delete your search engine. Does it sound familiar? It’s called gaslighting. Bet he does it to you. 


Gaslighting is a tactic in which a person or entity, in order to gain more power, makes a victim question their reality. It works much better than you may think. Anyone is susceptible to gaslighting, and it is a common technique of abusers, dictators, narcissists, and cult leaders. It is done slowly, so the victim doesn't realize how much they've been brainwashed.

802,My therapist told me to not even get a haircut until at least six months after my mom’s death. I thought she was insane but I complied. Recently I took a look at hairstyles I had saved on Pinterest... let’s just say my therapist was right on.
803,"I didn’t say i knew if his teacher was okay with it or not. 

I just said it’s ridiculous to make the assumption about the artist being insulted or not. Tattoo culture is varied and nuanced and sweeping generalizations about what a tattoo artist will and wont do are ridiculous. 

I’m also aware that his piece isn’t flash. I appreciate you bringing up the example, but that’s only *one* example of multi-use tattoo art. Likewise, you yourself do not represent the entire tattoo community. I can  absolutely respect your wishes about your tattoo being copied...but it’s not like you hold the only attitude towards the sanctity of tattoos. 

Of course there’s a possibility the artist wont want to do it, but reaching out and discussing it with the artist is not outlandish. 

OP’s husband should reach out to someone close to the deceased and the artist and be sensitive to their opinions about the tattoo. My prediction is that the artist may suggest some changes to make the tattoo unique and personal while still honoring the teacher.  I doubt it’s the first time they’ve tackled the idea of memorial tattoos and if they’re professional they can handle it tactfully. "
804,"&gt; Could it be that he is going through a difficult time and it's a good escape to think about someone from the past he cared about?  

Doesn't really sound like it. Because of the other things you said about the begining of the relationship and the time you were in a open relationship. It seems like from day 1 the ex-gf was the priority.  


&gt; Could he have built her up in his head to be some dream girl and thinking about that gives him some sort of relaxing fantasyland?  

Could be. Doesn't make it less hurtful and inconsiderate towards you.  

&gt; Or do I need to just accept that I'm convenient and consistent and acceptable to him?  

If you *really* want to be with him, then yes. You'll have to come 100% in terms with it. And I don't mean just ignoring it because that thing will eat you up inside with time. I mean fully accept it.  

Then again: Is he, the guy that is with you just because he can't be with his ex and is thinking about, really *good enough* for you?  "
805,"I agree your husband should see a psychologist.  It sounds a lot like emotional eating and I don't think talking to him will change anything, unfortunately."

What would be hard would be having my kids see me suffer through life being married to someone who doesn’t make me a priority.  What would be real damn hard would be to look back 20 years from now and realize I wasted all those years on a man who didn’t deserve it.
815,"I would definitely tell him when we got to that situation, but I'm iffy on telling him beforehand when we haven't even gotten close to sex yet. But at the same time.. I agree about what u/mikefrombraavos said re the needless tension. I want there to be some sexual tension and not have him be grossed out beforehand, but I also don't want to work ourselves up and go nowhere with it."

(Side note, am bi male but if a male partner hit me he'd be missing teeth within seconds. Are you afraid of him?)

I'm an angry drunk though I've reigned it in. Mostly."
824,"You're not sure you even know each other sober?  Then you have no business being in a relationship with each other.  This is not healthy on any level.  And seriously, the drinking has to STOP.  For both of you.  I don't care how much you 'enjoy drinking' or think it was 'fine until the last year or two'.  Real talk - you're both alcoholics, and you're making excuses for his increasingly abusive behavior.  Neither one of you is fine."
825,"&gt;  The only real discussion is that I have heard is that she is sharing a hotel room with another bridesmaid who is single. So maybe it would be awkward to back out of that agreement? 

Yep.

Could also be that since you two have dated for a short time, less than a year, she doesn't feel comfortable yet to bring you to the wedding. Perhaps after you've dated a little longer, she'll feel more comfortable bringing you to future weddings with her. :)

You can also just talk to her. ""Hey... I felt a bit hurt that you had a plus one to the wedding and didn't invite me. But I know we've only dated less than 1 year and that you are sharing a room with a different bridesmaid for the wedding."""

829,"I think the key here isn't the bluntness of what you say, but the lack of engagement itself. The idea is to have a script you can say at her so she knows you're aware of her presence (people react differently to being brushed off vs being downright ignored, and the latter is less socially acceptable, meaning she'd feel entitled to react in more extreme ways), but gives nothing for her to hold on to as a social interaction. It's about discouraging her by making talking to you unrewarding."
830,"&gt; as I am still a student and I study abroad to boot. 

So stay out of it.  You aren't there and don't have to tolerate the begging.  Do not respond when she begs, say you understand it's hard and that you have to go.  Then hang up.  

Stop giving into her and it will gradually get easier.  Your dad and uncle learned how to do it; now it's your turn."
831,"Could definitely be this, or could be a reeeeeal big red flag of a controlling personality. My ex was deeply insecure and always worried I'd leave him and as a result became more and more controlling. ANYTHING like this just puts my back up about it. be careful OP! "

834,"Frankly, you both sound too immature to be engaged, and checking your ages, yes, you are too young to get married.

Your relationship sounds toxic and unhealthy. I'm not sure if that's because you're so profoundly young, or because it's simply a toxic and unhealthy relationship.

This fight about the tattoo is a symptom of the problem, not the main problem itself.

You absolutely need to back off on the marriage plans, and I urge you to consider whether this is a relationship that you want to continue. "
835,"Nah, friends don't do that."

837,"There is a point where it turns from a ""marriage"" to a ""family"".  And family needs come first.  That includes supporting your wife in caring for your children.

It is also important to understand that a woman's emotions and actions during, and in the month following, pregnancy are going to sway a bit and be different from how they've been previously.  Both from hormonal changes and from the reality of being a new parent.  This tends to impact mothers much more than fathers for obvious reasons and it isn't something frequently discussed with new fathers. "

839,"I disagree, looking at ops comments I think this has everything to do with THIS relationship. Op wants to play tit for tat. That's not the type of behavior that inspires trust. "
840,"I second this. I'd never be able to function trying to get any rest in a situation like that; and a person can only cope with a lack of sleep for so long before your brain starts to partially shut off while you're ""awake"". The more days in a row I get less than 7 hours sleep, the crankier I get. I pity the poor husband. "
841,"So you've been in two accidents, not three. None of your accidents have had anything to do with snow and ice...... It just sounds arbitrary to attach conditions to the weather like that.  You've said it yourself, none of the accidents were your fault so if you trust yourself driving, then you are just as likely to get into an accident on a perfect sunny day as when it's snowing. Maybe look into getting an AWD vehicle to help your anxiety without affecting your friendships."

845,"So..... nevermind the fact you are seeing someone come at night and leave in the morning.... too bad you couldn’t get a picture of the guy. 

So she definitely knows you know what is going on. I would definitely tell the husband then, if she is already playing the defensive roll. Maybe a good ol “I’m not sure what was going on but your wife had nightly visitors and we just thought you should be aware, in case you didn’t already know.”"
846,"Thanks.  I was so brainwashed into believing their manipulative, abusive behavior was normal that it took several epic blowups, a ruined wedding and a secret elopement, among other crap, for me to first realize I was depressed, second, see a therapist, then third, realize that my family was fucked up and to get the fuck away.

OP, if you are reading this, please take action now. Its already a major problem and you have a child. Itwill metastasize and spread into an ugly pit of misery and despair for everyone if you two are not able to work it out."

848,"You said he randomly came home with bruises, yes it could be that he stole change from a homeless person but it's also possible he may have attacked that woman he was stalking. Have you seen any pictures of her after he came home with bruises or do they all predate that incident?

He sounds like he is a potentially dangerous person."
849,"Dodging bullets like Neo in ""The Matrix""."
850,"Nope. If this were an affair, any pictures or texts would probably point to mutual interest. What you describe sounds like stalking, not an affair.          

So he's stalking a woman, stealing from homeless people, getting enjoyment out of seriously screwing over a friend, and lying to you. If these behaviors are extremely different from how he is normally, get him to a doctor right away. If you think he will fight you on seeing one, set it up as an ""annual checkup"" or something like that, but make sure you give the doctor detailed information about the massive behavioral changes, when they first started happening, his reactions to being confronted about them, etc.         

On the other hand, if these are just more intense versions of behavioral patterns he's shown in the past, then I would strongly encourage you to leave this relationship. His actions are foul and vicious. "
851,"respecting him as a man""

that isn't good. It really isn't. I have yet to meet a man who uses this phrase that is not a complete piece of garbage. Your life if you stay with this guy is going to be a constant string of chaos. He'll 'quit' (fired from) jobs on a regular basis because every policy or rule change will be directed at him. Everyone is against him, of course. You guys wont have a social life because he will eventually feel 'disrespected' by everyone and his friends aren't likely to deal with that behavior often. You will never know what will set him off. He'll do things like drain bank accounts or take money that was supposed to be join and justify it to himself. Obviously I can't guarantee these things will happen, but they are what I have seen in my own experience. There are quite a few men here that still have that super-macho ""respect me as a man"" attitude and it doesn't go well for them. people that petty and arrogant do not have stable lives. Everything that ever goes wrong will be your fault, his bosses fault, the neighbors fault, etc."

Basically what I have resorted to doing is telling my Mom over and over I do not like talking to her about my Dad. If my Mom starts ranting about him, I get up and leave. I still have to do it sometimes, but she is  actually starting to get that I am not the person she gets to vent about my Dad to."
857,"Cool, so you refuse to get at the heart of your problem.

She not insane, it's a human reaction but it's a behaviour that might appear again if something similar comes up. It's up to him to evaluate if that's an acceptable risk. 

Edit: Plus we don't know if she got retested to see if she truly had the clap or to see if he gave her something extra to treat."
859,"Absolute dealbreaker. My advice? Tell him precisely why you won't be seeing him again, and let him know that his snooping is entirely inappropriate.

It needs to be taken daily, but it will greatly reduce the chances he ever has an outbreak (which is the primary times that herpes is transmitted). I would also visit your obgyn and see if anything yet exists medication wise that can reduce your chances of contracting it. It may not, but who knows. Minimally, he or she can give you further advice on how to best manage your sex life with a partner who has herpes. 

Overall, I would say if youre really about this dude, and want the relationship, you should absolutely do so. This shouldnt stop you, but definitely make sure he gets the medication to reduce outbreak and takes it. "
868,"I personally disagree.  To me, saying ""I don't regret it"" is the same as saying ""I'd make the same choice again if the circumstances were the same.""  Yes, people do grow and mature and many of us make mistakes when we're young then learn from them and don't repeat them.  However, if that were the case I would expect OP's girlfriend to be saying ""What I did was wrong and I would choose differently if I had to make that same decision today.""  Not that she doesn't regret it at all.  I'd be concerned if I were OP about how fixed her moral compass actually is."

Why go out of your way to potentially separate a family or get someone killed? People immigrate for a million reasons. Many come illegally because they can’t afford to come legally, and they or their children are in mortal danger at home. This applies especially to people from places like Honduras. I could not in any good conscience actively try to get someone who had done nothing wrong to me kicked out of the country.

876,"Generally hiding something that can be controversial in a relationship is worse than coming clean. I don’t think you necessarily have to feel bad about this. The fact that you’re cognizant of the potential for trafficking is personal growth, in my eyes. Life is full of instances where you learn information that, in hindsight, would’ve changed your decision to participate. 

I think rather than keeping this hidden, if the *time* and the *company* calls for a moment of learning you should share your experience and pass on the knowledge! Also perhaps support legalization and the rights of sex workers 🤗 Laws against these types of professions only serve against the interest and wellbeing of workers.

I wasn't sexualizing her or getting off to the images.) 

Anyway, perhaps my point is that I think more details about the relationship dynamic between all parties involved would be helpful in the original post. Also, more about his SO's personality and demeanor could be advantageous.

I used to work in medium of photography primarily (no longer though), and many of my friends and acquaintances that I shot sans clothing in the past had either modeled on occasion and were used to casual nudity, were young and liberal and cavalier about nudity, or from a culture where one's nude body isn't so...privatized? (For example: I've been to a co-ed nude spa in Berlin and when I mentioned it upon my return, one male friend of mine  was shocked at its existence/lack of segregation in general bathing areas. Would I go in America? No, because we fetishize the nude body and I imagine it'd be a harbinger for perverts. But digression aside, different factors could play a role in why she felt comfortable doing this. 


Of course, conversely, as many suggested, she could be gullible and was manipulated by a perverted amateur Craigslist photographer of a ""friend."" If that's the case, yikes! Those classic Craiglist Amateur Photographers. Perverts gonna Perv. "

DO. NOT. MARRY. HER.  You're going to need to see a year+ of healthy emotional behavior before you even consider it. That means therapy and her living her new reality. "
884,"My advice would be to only include her in plans that you'd go to if she doesn't show up- either something you'd like to do on your own, or something where you can go with a mutual friend who can be more reliable. And if you value the friendship, talk to her about ways to catch up that don't involve her flaking on you, like visiting together at her house, or a Skype date, or something."

886,"&gt; This is ripe for helping your daughter develop a narcissistic God complex, if you let that woman continue this.

My concern would be if Eve got herself in a dangerous situation thinking that her ""powers"" will protect her, like trying to fly by jumping off something high or control a wild animal or something.  Young children are extreamly suggestible and (God love them) incredibly dumb, that's a deadly combination."
887,He’s not with his ex anymore... he’s not “letting it happen...” he has no control over what his ex wife says to his current wife.
888,"Very similar. When I was twenty I dated a man in his forties and when I was 22 I dated a man ten years older. 

Both were very very very much like what you're describing"
889,"As a male software engineer myself (in sales for the moment), I would tell you that you shouldn't have to tell anyone more than once. If you're having this conversation twice, then you probably need to be having it with HR. I'm not saying everybody who talks to you is evil. However, it will get out pretty quick that if people over flirt with you that they'll be having a talk with HR. This goes away much faster when everybody else is working with you. A few years ago we lost the best person on our team because she was beautiful and people couldn't leave her alone. I got involved too late. I'm sure your management would feel the same way about you."
890,"Unfortunately nope, doesn't work that way. That's why it's best to talk about basic compatibility stuff very early on. And it sounds like the two of you are pretty incompatible, especially with the sex thing.

I'm curious about how much your location problems are actually related to ""the south"", versus perhaps living in the ""rural south"". I haven't lived in the northeast, admittedly, but I've lived in Raleigh-Durham and Jacksonville, and they're worlds different from the surrounding ""southern small town"" atmospheres. And Raleigh-Durham is significantly more liberal than Jacksonville. But at the very least, you can be a liberal atheist into various progressive stuff, and not stand out like a sore thumb.

Edit: Just saw the comment where you mention living in Atlanta. So my preconception is probably wrong, because unless you're living in some conservative burbs of Atlanta, that's not what I'd think of as epitomizing the rural south."
891,"27 is no longer 'youthful' experience time IMO
If you are not happy then just end it. But know the grass is not always greener on the other side and give it full thought what you really want. If you let her go you will likely not get her back."
892,I didn’t read that as Nate making her wait outside. I don’t call an uber when I’m leaving my SO’s until I’m out the door. Sometimes they show up in 10 seconds. Sometimes it takes a few minutes. I’d rather not be running out the door when I say goodbye. 
893,I'm with yetzer_hara 100%. You got a really amazing gift. I understand the discomfort with your bud seeing her junk but I think the pros way outweigh the cons here. I thin yetzer's analysis of what was likely going through your not-clever GFs mind is also spot on. 
894,its not easy to come out with the fact that you cheated on your husband with your bff's husband and bore his child and kept it a secret for decades. the mother might be thinking her disapproval would be enough to split them so she doesn't have to spill the beans
895,"I mean it makes sense with the parents' ages:

kids at 21 is pretty young for younger people today."

897,"I've been in a very similar situation. I had the talk with him. Two weeks later he asks me if the issues I had were still bothering me. I asked ""well have you done anything to improve them?"" He replied with ""No, I just thought you'd get over it."" I didn't respond and dumped him two days later. He acted shocked and threw a literal temper tantrum. I didn't entertain it and walked right out of the door.  
 
As for the car, it isn't your responsibility to make sure he has transportation. Get the keys back before the break up. Make up an excuse if you have to. Good luck with the breakup. You'll be better off without him. 

Edit: a word"
898,"Urgg! Cheating with a good friend is such a shit move on top of a shit mountain. If you can come back from that, you can come back from anything. 

OP's wound is very fresh, and it's heartsmashing to get hurt by people who supposedly loved you, but I truly believe Karma will swing back at them like the awesome chick she is. &lt;3"
899,"A com/law student, on the other hand, is expected to engage in paid extracurricular activities. 

I don’t even know what this means. Like what?"
900,This has disaster written all over it. Lose her number.
901,"Just how insecure is your BF?

It also feels like he is a bit homophobic. I don't expect that he would mistreat anyone who is gay, but he clearly doesn't want to be associated with gayness.

---

Stand your ground on this. Explain to him that it is a big deal to have to change your name just because he is worried about a little bit of awkwardness. Someone who doesn't know you/him thinking you are a guy falls in the ""who fucking cares category.""

If he can't let this go, you should be really concerned about whether he is the right type of person to plan a future with."
902,"Why did you make this post about his mother when it should be along the lines of ""my abusive shitbag of a fiance mistreats me and his mother""?

You were mad at her for saying she'd ""pray about"" your SO getting violent, but stayed with him? You're placing blame in the wrong spot. Then you do it again with the whole ""she just laughed when he disrespected her"" thing. So what? You're about to marry someone who disrespects his mother. Are you serious? You're enabling his shitty behavior too, so why are you so critical of her? It's not her job to save you from this relationship. It's yours. And then you're pissed at her for offering you food? I think you're either a troll or focusing on her so you don't have to accept that you agreed to marry an abusive sack of shit. She's not the problem. He is. You should leave. Stop heaping blame on this woman and put it where it belongs. 

Oh, and I assure you, the woman is not ""ancient,"" and you'll be there soon enough too. 

Your relationship with your fiance is a shitshow. Grown people shouldn't be having their parents mediate their arguments. That's on you two, not his mother. 

"
903,"Why does your husband have to form bonds with your friends? I understand that it might be nice to hang out with all of them, but they are your friends, they don’t have to be his friends. I am sort of like how your husband is— I have a small group of friends typically, I do not make friends easily, and I don’t usually enjoy large groups. My boyfriend tried to integrate me into his group of friends just as you are. I tried, but I really have nothing in common with them. I don’t mind them but I just don’t really like them. So, when they were having a party, I told my bf to go and have a good time. He did. He stayed way later than he would have if I were there, and had a great time. I don’t know OP, maybe you are trying to force something that doesn’t need to happen. You can have different groups of friends and still be happy together. Just offering a different perspective."
904,let's all talk about what type of punchable face he has
905,"You went to PRISON for her (something that will be in your record for the rest of your life), and even though you did this she still STOLE from you, ASSAULTED you and illegally evicted you.


She has NO guilt over that fact that she is screwing your life, you should feel no guilt of screwing hers. That woman is not, and never has been, a mother to you.


Call the police and report the car stoled, and report the illegal eviction. Throw whatever you can at her and then cut contact, cut her completely out of your life and move on.


Nothing good will ever come out of having a relationship with this woman. "
906,"Trust is important in a relationship, when she was outted in the first affair, I'm sure part of the reconciliation of staying together was earning back your trust right?   Well she started that off with a lie..

Stay with her and she will continue to fuck other guys, if you are fine with that then stay, if not then you can lie to yourself, and have her lie to you about being faithful, or you can leave. "
907,"Can we stop with the 'women have no agency' bullshit, its annoying. "
