0,"&gt;I would also be wary if he brings up marriage and your future now.

Even if he does, I know I'm not ready to plan to get married anytime soon. It would have to go both ways.

I'm going to tell him he's gonna have to find an apartment, even if it isn't his dream one."
1,"I think if Holly was in a relationship with an uncle or her father you'd immediately understand that she was the victim of abuse. I think that's what has happened here. If the relationship started when she was a minor, and her whole teenage/coming of age/adulthood years have been spent in a secret relationship with him then absolutely I feel that she's been abused and while it may seem consensual because she is otherwise normal/healthy/stable/intelligent - she's also never been given a chance to do anything different.  It's a really big secret that she shared with you because she trusted you. I wouldn't see her as a dirtbag with no morals - I'd see her as a victim of abuse.  Would you kick her out of the wedding if her abuser was a different family member?  
  
At the end of the day you need to do what you think is best for you and your life - if that's ending contact with Holly then tell her that you enjoyed your time together but you can't continue friendship with someone who participates in adultery and thank her for her grace in understanding.  What she chooses to tell other people is up to her. You can't control what other people say or do.  "
2,"Unpopular opinion here possibly... 
I would not suggest doing this unless she says something to you first. Speaking as a woman, it is so uncomfortable for someone at work to express interest when you’re just being nice. It makes for an uncomfortable work place. I’m the person at work who is always smiling and always nice, and I work with mostly women; however, out of the few men I work with I would say 50% of them have mistaken my kindness for something else and it is SO uncomfortable. If they noticed me with other coworkers they’d realize that’s my norm; I’m just friendly.


Keep talking to her and being her friend, but unless you start seeing how she acts with other people (male and female) to see if it’s just personality or not, it’s best to not make any assumptions or moves. "
3,"Ding ding ding! We have a winner! I was cheated on by a guy who did exactly this to me. Girl needs to get out of this situation, see her doc for some std tests, and find a guy who is proud to be with her. "
4,"Troll her? The laboutins thing is hilarious - casually bring up with her a newfound interest, like mastering grilling, and when she inevitably brings up her amazing steak at the next meeting tell her you've just decided to embrace the vegan lifestyle. Tell her about your new video game hobby, when she brags about fortnite or whatever say you're going screen-free for a while. If she insists on copying and trying to out-do you, send her on wild goose chases which end with you rejecting whatever the thing is. Eventually she'll probably move on to someone else, or grow up a bit. This is likely petty and silly advice, but it might make it funny and more bearable. "
5,"When someone really loves you, they find ways to fit you in their life, even when it's not convenient. He's asking you to leave him alone but still be in a relationship until it's convenient for him - that's not a very real or healthy relationship.

Let him go, break up, you deserve better. "
6,This isn’t fun for you. At all. Stop playing with him. Both of you can find other people to play with. That way he gets to win his very important winning thing and you get to just enjoy playing a damn video game.
7,Wouldn't put it past them to forge their sigs either 
8,He deleted everything that made him look bad! 
9,Have ADD. Can confirm magnetic lockbox saves my ass from calling AAA on a regular basis. 
10,"My guess is he's an angry console smasher. Mom is covering for him because what else would the parent of an enormous baby do? She thinks she can just string along until the end. Court filings usually cost less than OPs damages and if she wins (which she would) they'd pay all other associated court fees. It seems like a dumb thing to do, but the people that do this do it repeatedly and to generous, trusting folks. They need to learn a time consuming and mildly expensive lesson about responsibility."
11,"Right?! I mean, I’ve known some non-confrontational people, I can be pretty non-confrontational myself. But this completely takes the cake. 

No one in their right mind leaves an unwanted guest in their place and leaves town for several days and just hopes it turns out well. "
12,Please do not let a single day in your brother's life affect the rest of yours. Don't go.
13,[deleted]
14,"Based on OP's post history, I think you're right. He previously posted about being angry that his wife had selected a new doctor for herself without his permission. He also posted that she started playing a song in their car and singing along without asking him first, which made him angry, so he scolded her and ejected the CD; when his wife's feelings were hurt and she stopped engaging for the rest of the car ride, he was angry with her for disrespecting him with ""the silent treatment.""

Honestly, I'm getting some abusive relationship vibes from OP."
15,"In another post, he also referred to his wife’s anxieties about him leaving his job to start his own business as “untruths” which is pretty damn gross and minimizing. "
16,"He's a thirty year old man who got into a relationship with a teenager. You're starting to grow up and realize that he hasn't been growing and likely won't, which is why he probably went after a young partner. Move on."
17,"&gt;I feel like he should understand I'm not gonna stay with anyone for 2 years just because they look like a fictional character.

I came to say the same thing. Nobody says *""I was attracted to his personality on first sight""*

Tell him that the character and him look similar but if he wasn't the kind of person he is, you wouldn't have passed the 6 month mark with him, let alone 2 years!

Would you say he has many insecurities abou himself? Aside from this I mean."
18,You are supporting a guy who is 10 years older than you.  And it looks like you will be supporting him for the rest of your life if you stay with him.  Is this the life you want to live?  
19,"Grounding is ludicrous at this point in her life. So are things like taking phone away, curfew, etc. She's an adult. She will not only resist any attempts to discipline her like a child, but it will not help her learn what she needs to. She needs to feel adult consequences for her actions. Like a warning that if she doesn't quit stealing from her dad, trashing the house etc. she will be kicked out of the house. She gets into a bad situation, her dad won't be there to bail her out. And so on. "
20,"This is probably a good idea. Make copies and give a physical copy to the next officer that shows up. ""So today marks the fourth time in the past...""

You could probably take it a step further and request they speak with the neighbor about it. Again, armed with your physical tally of all the times the neighbor has called the cops on you unnecessarily, the officer may feel it's warranted he do so."
21,"What are you actually trying to accomplish here? He obviously wants to break up, this is where the brutal honesty comes from, and of course it is also very hard for him to make that final cut after 7 years of being together. Falling for another woman, blaming you, saying bluntly that this was a mistake and feeling incredible anxiety are completely typical symptoms of someone trying to get out of their long relationship, knowing it will radically change their life and also feeling a mix of guilt, fear, general sadness and more. 


Anxiety isn't the cause of why he isn't happy anymore, anxiety is the symptom. I know you are both adults, but you are making it hard for him by ignoring what he is telling you (pretty much everything except the actual words ""I am leaving you""). I think that both for his sake, and even more, for your own self respect, you need to leave him."
22,"People grow up a lot in the 10 years after high school.  Consider couples counseling to help the two of you either getting to a better place in your marriage or negotiating a constructive divorce.

Make better plans for both of you,   Is your wife working?  If not, she needs to get in the job market.  And if at all possible, you need to finish your degree."
23,"&gt;been together for almost a decade now

I think of it like cheating. One incident of beating is one too many and there is a good chance it could happen again. 

Just like you shouldn't give someone who cheated once another chance, you shouldn't give someone who hits you once another chance. "
24,"She was 16 and he was 26 when they started dating.  He cheats on her and they can't afford groceries for the children.

The tip of the iceberg is an understatement."
25,"&gt;during a fight a few months ago he said that she was more beautiful to him than me, she was more his type because ""tall, athletic blonde and of Scandinavian descent "", whereas I'm short, slim with boobs and hips and a full-on German/American/French mutt. He said he'd rather have sex with her and that I was just slightly too ""flabby"" and she could have been a model .

This isn't a little rocky, this is the kind of stuff that haunts a relationship.  Male or female, there is no reason to ever say this kind of thing to someone.

Then he sits next to you while he look up his ex on instagram and locks himself in the bathroom when you push to know who he was looking up?  That's insane, immature, selfish behavior.

You're not overreacting, but you're focusing on the wrong thing.  You're making this about whether or not *you* are good enough but you should be making it about whether or not *he* is good enough.

I don't think you should be with him."
26,"\&gt; She said she was unsure of what to do so she decided to spend the money I lent her on rent. 

She knew exactly what she was supposed to do, she was supposed to return the money you lent her for a specific reason.  She simply decided not to do that, there's no confusion there.  You can keep asking her for it every time you have contact with her until she either relents or stops answering your calls, texts, emails, etc.  But honestly, it is not likely she will ever pay that money back and she is not your friend if she doesn't agree to pay you back.  "
27,"&gt; then a long message about how it makes her uncomfortable that Matt and I hang out once a week or so, and she hopes I'll understand and stop seeing him unless it's in a group setting.  

I would not respond and send the message to Matt.  It was not her place to approach you about their relationship problems.  If she has a problem with the friendship then she talks to Matt about it; honestly the fact that she approached you makes me think she did talk to him, but that didn't go the way she wanted."
28,I wouldn't move in with this guy. there's still time to find a new place
29,"I do not think it was an accident that you guys ""fell"" into traditional gender roles. I wonder how much push back a busier girlfriend with higher domestic expectations would have received from your boyfriend.

Has he talked about getting a family friendly job or just subcontracting out his parenting efforts to his mom and whomever else?


You guys seem to be in the privileged class that can afford to be picky about life's pursuits. If his pursuit of choice relegates family to the back burner, it is not an accident. You weren't surprised by gender roles. "
30,"&gt;Every fiber in my being just wants to forgive her and move on but I can’t help this nagging voice in my head that tells me that no matter how hard I try to help or how hard I hope that she will get better I am just going to be stuck in this loop of her depression and anxiety.

This is because deep down you know, no matter what you do you cannot fix her problems for her. No matter how much support you give her, you can't make her depression or anxiety go away. 

She has to take steps to deal with those things herself. You can help her take those steps but you can't do it for her. 

Also if you do consider breaking up, try not to worry about how it will negatively affect her because you have to think of yourself in that situation and how staying in the relationship will negatively affect you.


"
31,"You're right in that a woman with his exact personality type and skillset and intuitions would likely have more trouble doing what he did.

But even though this kind of career path is probably more accessible to men, it's still a minority of men who actually have the right blend of soft skills to pull this kind of career leap off. So it's not necessarily fair to state that he's not ""clever or intuitive"" when the evidence from the story suggests he probably is. 
"
32,"&gt;then suddenly it’s midnight and she’s doing the laundry she didn’t do

So you could have found out that you needed to do laundry beforehand. Seems to me like she's the type of person that won't ask for help even when she needs it. You are going to have to do more without her asking for it. It is as simple as that.

&gt;I should add that a lot of the tasks that she gives herself are things I can’t actually help with and don’t know that she needs done

Time to learn and put in that little bit of extra effort ;) Could be something she has no control over. Seems like something you knew about already as well

\[EDIT\] I'm a guy by the way. All the people living in a house should do equal amounts of chores more or less. Just have to try hard enough. It's honestly hard at the beginning. Then it just turns into habit. Its just easier on everyone in the long run."
33,"Yeah, who has $200k in a savings account? How the heck did this guy amass this kind of money with the head he has on his shoulders? "
34,"In response to edit 2, he's married as fuck or has other women in rotation. 

EDIT: oh wait, he's probably reading this shit as it goes. Hey buddy, right here 🖕 honestly you've been fucking gross and I'm really excited for all of it to catch up to you. Let's hope no one sends your wife a link huh? Don't worry, every girl you cheat on and with will see through you eventually."
35,This could be a real medical issue. My mom incessant talking ramped up over the course of a year and it turned out she had a brain tumor. Encourage him to get a full work up done.
36,He's leaning forward looking at his phone ~~one~~ on the floor as he poops. 
37,"&gt; He has nowhere else to go and he hates his family so going back home isn’t an option.

What the fuck would he have done if you weren’t in the picture? Does he not have friends? An advisor who can help him figure it out? 

This is really not your problem. If he’s so hard up for a place to stay he can damn well treat YOUR place with basic respect. Since he refuses to do that, he needs to make other arrangements. This relationship is not working out and frankly sounds like it was doomed from the word “go.” "
38,"So I'm sort of wondering what country this is. I'm an American who grew up in the Middle East and I can imagine that she might be experiencing some degree of culture shock, and that what you're seeing is merely a symptom of that. Anxiety, discomfort, general claustrophobia. That kind of thing can pretty much shut a person down. I don't know, obviously, but you sure do seem willing to jettison a marriage over what sounds like depression or some like issue. But what you're focusing on is housework, which is just a surface manifestation of something else. It seems a little cold, honestly. Maybe you should look deeper."
39,"Tell your mom! I can only imagine how (rightly) furious she would be. He is still 15 and can be disciplined and reprimanded! He needs to learn now that that's NOT okay, or he will continue to make people feel uncomfortable throughout college and the rest of his life. "
40,"&gt;So later I'll casually say, ""Hey, how's it going Mike, how was school?"" And he'll be like, ""Oh we didn't go to school today mom woke up late"" and he'll act like that's totally normal.

What the everliving fuck, why are you with this woman?"
41,"I think if the feelings are already there and you two have an established friendship already, adding romance to it is a bonus. I do sense that you’re scared and you believe you’ll ruin it, but my mom always told me that if you keep telling yourself somethings going to happen then it will.  Paranoia does this to you and gives you the worst outcome because you’re already inclined to think it’s meant to happen. 

You like him, he likes you, and he’s already your best friend. Your partner should always be your best friend. I say try to let yourselves be happy and give each other a chance. "
42,"JFC, I just read through all of the comments, and based on that, I’d guess that around ~80% of people who replied did not read the entire post. To recap what OP wrote:

- The baby was planned and wanted by both OP and his wife.

- She begged to be a SAHM and voluntarily quit her job.

- She won’t go back to work because she doesn’t want to put their child into daycare. Based on this piece of information, I think it’s fair to assume that she doesn’t want anyone besides herself and OP watching their child, which automatically excludes the possibility of date nights, weekends away, both of them going to weddings and funerals, etc. 

- Yes, she has PPD. She’s been in therapy for 18 months.

- They’ve tried couples counseling. From what OP said, the counselor tended to validate his point of view (for lack of a better phrase). Based on how these situations typically go, his wife probably thought that the counselor was “taking OP’s side” and biased against her, so she refused to continue going. Still, OP said they’re going to try again. 

- Despite the fact that OP’s wife is clearly very unhappy, she wants to remain married in order to not lose the lifestyle that OP’s career (the same career she resents) and income provide for her. 

- Oh, and let’s not forget that she’s unilaterally removed sex from the marriage, even going so far as to be disgusted when her husband gets turned on by the sight of her naked body. 

I’m not unsympathetic to first time mothers, especially those that leave their jobs to stay at home and raise their children, and I fully understand how that dynamic very often creates a significant imbalance of emotional labor. However, no matter how common that is, it’s not what’s going on here. OP has basically sacrificed his life, needs and mental well being to try and accommodate his wife. What, exactly, has his wife done to make this situation better? 

This is really no different than any of the multitude of posts where one half of a couple is suffering from a mental illness but refuses to get help. What is the general consensus in those situations? Leave. Divorce. Dump. Which is exactly what OP needs to do here. Sure, he can try couples counseling one more time, although it’s seriously unlikely that the results will be any different. "

44,"OP, please read this post. Not too many anecdotal instances of this are gonna be found and I'd say that this one to pay attention to. Don't let yourself be fooled by manipulation and emotions. Intuition, red flags, and now this person who experienced a very similar situation are all telling you the same thing. I am sorry cause I know it will be hard but you don't wanna be associated with this, it could ruin the rest of your life. "
45,"I've started to mention it every time, but each time different officers show up.

I should maybe make a list of events to show the next time they show up? "
46,"Honestly, why do you think she'd regret an abortion? 

&gt; The result was positive and she burst into tears when she saw it. We took more tests to be certain and all came back positive. She's absolutely terrified at the moment and isn't sure whether she wants to keep the child

&gt; She's panicking about what she's going to tell her friends and the school, and she thinks that her life is ruined.

She's 15 years old. I don't know a single 15 year old who is or was ready to be a parent, or believed being a parent at age 15 is/was the right choice for them. Your daughter certainly doesn't seem excited at being pregnant, she sounds absolutely terrified and full of regret. She does not sound like she wants to be pregnant and she does not sound like she wants to have a child.

I understand your daughter is scared of her options - either she has a procedure that has a lot of negative connotations around it, or she gives birth to a child. But giving birth to a child at age 15/16, whether you raise it yourself or give it up for adoption, is absolutely life-changing in a way that having an abortion isn't. 

&gt; we haven't tried to sway her in any direction.

Maybe you *should* start to sway her. Your daughter is a *child*, and she needs *guidance*. Maybe she secretly wants an abortion, but is scared of the reaction from you, or is scared to make the choice herself. Maybe you should say to her, ""the choice is yours and your mother and I will support you whatever you choose, but we believe terminating the pregnancy would be the best option for you. What do you think?"" You don't have to force her to have one, but you should be honest that at her age, an abortion would be the best option for her situation. She has the procedure, her life carries on as she planned it, and no one ever need know she was pregnant. He friends don't need to know, her school doesn't need to know. 

I honestly find it very hard to believe that your daughter would regret having an abortion at age 15 *more* than she would regret carrying a child to term and giving it up for adoption, or becoming a teen parent.

She is pregnant, but she's still a child. You are her parent. Start giving her some actual constructive advice instead of leaving this life-changing situation entirely in her hands. 

"
47,"Tell him and his mother that it has been well beyond a reasonable time frame and that they must pay for a replacement PS4 and controller to replace what they lost.  Get documentation and txt messages conforming this.

Additionally ask them for reference numbers and RMA details from Sony.  I suspect they never sent it in.  Sony is usually really good about warranty repairs and there's a good chance they just sold it hoping you'd forget about it.

If they refuse or try to give you a story again, push back hard and threaten to go to small claims court."
48,I didn’t even think about that what a simple solution 
49,"I know why you went against her wishes to throw her a shower.  It was sweet and well-intentioned, but you really shouldn't have.  There are other things you could have done to show your support than to throw her an unwanted party.

I think if I were in your shoes, I'd apologize to Dallas for not listening to her when she said no.  And I would validate her feelings by saying that the shirt and her friend were highly inappropriate, but remind her this will be something the two of you will likely laugh about ten years from now.  "
50,"It doesn't sound to me like you blew it at all - something happened, and you actually *communicated* with the guy about it. Obviously maybe there could be issues with how you phrased things or how you approached him - but what you did sounds reasonable to me. Things are weird/sad now because this happened, but I don't think it was your fault. Sounds to me like there aren't any big warning signs from your husband in terms of incipient abuse or whatever, so who knows where this lady was coming from. Could be that there was overlap between you and her and she's salty about that.

One thing I think you could do better on is at least being cognizant of what's going on financially. Being a SAHM is totally okay, but putting all the financial knowledge &amp; decisions on one person isn't a very smart in the long run, IMHO. I think you should probably have an idea of how much he's making at his jobs, vs how much you're spending on rent and whatever else."
51,Get a burner phone where you pay to load minutes. It'll be super cheap. Leave your other phone at home when you don't want to be tracked. That way you'll still have one in case of an emergency. 
52,"Move out, but still live cheaply. Taking a little longer to pay off debt (which is not too crippling of an amount) will be worth your mental health."
53,"Something about this is rubbing me the wrong way (you know, aside from the fact that you assaulted your husband and seem fixated more on the fate of your marriage than the fact that you committed domestic violence against him).

All you're doing at this point is apologizing because of how bad YOU feel. You apologies probably mean nothing to him at this point... not because they're insincere, but because they don't really do that much. The damage can't be undone by words. In fact, you regularly apologizing might actually be a burden and an unkind thing to do. When you're constantly apologizing and begging for forgiveness, you're putting the burden on someone else  to make you feel better about things. It's really unfair that you keep going to him in hopes that you'll feel better.

You need to take some kind of action, and also give it time. Stop pestering him with apologies. You need to be DOING things, not saying things. Get into counseling - individual and marriage. Get back to trying to act normal outside of therapy. You need to establish a pattern of trust and emotionally grounded behaviour. If you keep reminding him of your emotional volatility, you'll never actually demonstrate the behaviour that would encourage him to trust you again. The point isn't to trick him, it's for both of you to fake it til you make it. Some normalcy in your lives will help.

Also, when you beg for forgiveness, you're being selfish. The purpose of an apology is to own your mistake and to let the victim know you know you wronged them and wish you hadn't hurt them. Apologies and forgiveness aren't for you, so if you keep following an apology with a plea for forgiveness, that's the height of selfishness. That is for him to give to you, not for you to beg of him. He doesn't owe you forgiveness, or to, yet again, lend you his ear as you apologize. You are making emotionally taxing demands on a spouse that you hit. I know you feel bad, but keep that shit to yourself when not deconstructing it in therapy (or at least tone the frequency and selfishness down several degrees).

ETA: You might even want to tell him that you'll back off apologizing. If you just suddenly stop he might feel that you're no longer remorseful. You could say something like, ""DH, I want you to know that I truly am sorry, but I will stop apologizing. I realize continually doing so isn't fair because it might make you feel like you have to say it's okay, or to help me feel better. I don't want to put you in that position because IF you trust me again, it will be at your own pace and on your own terms."""
54,"This is what it smells like to me. He had a conversation with a woman in his field that tittilated him and now he’s wondering if he’s settling. Unfortunately, he was dumb enough to say it out loud. 

If she “took it the wrong way”, he’s had many opportunities to tell her what he actually meant. Unfortunately it seems that she interpreted it correctly, he just doesn’t like that she’s upset about it. "
55,"Did you see the news story about how a man sued his ex-girlfriend for doing something very similar, deleting the acceptance from his dream school, and won $375,000?

You should talk to a lawyer. Her behavior is absolutely criminal and the kind of thing that could massively, negatively affect someone's life. Depending on the job situation, she may have cost you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of lifetime earnings.

This isn't ok and you definitely should not let her off lightly."
56,"I don't think it's inherently awful, and if you thought it was funny too, that would be great for everyone involved--but I can tell you for sure that I'D be humiliated, and ruminate on whether my boyfriend's friends respected our relationship, whether they specifically did it because they think this would be a better couple, etc. That kind of thing is why I'm not in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend, who absoluuuutely would have done something like this and frankly had the kind of mean-spirited friends who would not-so-secretly think it was funny that it would undoubtedly cause a fight in our five-year relationship. I'm with someone who takes our relationship seriously now, and so do his friends. My point is that in your case, whether this particular slight was intentional or not, this could easily be symptomatic of a greater mismatch.

Also, hope you were busy and that's why you couldn't go on the trip. Because it would blow to be in such a serious relationship and not be invited on a clearly co-ed trip to Vegas."
57,"Right.  The underlying tension here is that they're trying to cobble together a marriage while avoiding just signing the papers.  If you don't want to combine your lives, don't.  But things like home ownership and dealing with kids will be harder.  You can't logically divide rent/renovations/the annoyance of a lazy college dropout in your living room."
58,"I'd stress the kid's upbringing in this comment. I grew up with that resentment between my parents, when they had moments of slight love once a year I considered it weird and not normal as a kid. Now I think my marriage will end up the same and it takes work to get the thoughts out of my mind. "
59,"Not even only Americans, in the Caribbean it's mandatory to study Spanish for at least 3 years in high school and I've met a surprising amount of people from Asia who have learned Spanish. So you honestly never know who knows what and should be conscientious about what you say in general when it comes to language."
60,"WTF. Is this guy a joke. 

I would end the relationship right there and then. And when people ask why its over, tell them he was demanding a $6k watch. "
61,"OP,  please make sure your mom cannot get access to your bank account or cash because then she can take it."
62,"Holy shit, this guy is a monster. And he called you overweight? At 6ft/165? I'm 5'8"" and 150; I looked like a ding dang skeleton when I weighed 135!

You have to realize he stopped living for the two of you a long time ago. You need to live for yourself. It's not selfish... it's self preservation, my friend. Best of luck to you. Don't back down for anything. You can do this.

You're only 25, you have so much life to live! Don't waste any more on this loser."
63,"We all know it wasn't a joke. You tried to mask your frustration as a ""joke"". Don't get me wrong, it's fine to be annoyed, but don't lie to him. Tell him that you don't want to continue work at home."

65,"Don't sign a thing and make sure that whoever is running the complex are aware of what's going on. Tell them that they plan on moving and no longer pay their rent. There should not be any ramifications for you and your husband, as long as you continue paying your share. "
66,"You need to abandon this “hands off” parenting approach.  Her grades seem fine but it seems like there’s bigger problems.  You found weed in your 14 year old daughters room and basically left it to her to deal with, same with finding out she’s pregnant.  She’s fucking 15 years old.  She isn’t an adult.  She is a child.  You’ve confused her advanced educational status with emotional maturity which just isn’t the case for someone that age.  Take some charge and be more involved than just being supportive of whatever she decides.  "
67,"It sounds like he’s trying to get you to dump him.  Or maybe, while he’s been dating this girl (because that’s exactly what he’s been doing, not flirting, DATING), he’s been feeling guilty and now he’s telling you so that he can keep doing it without feeling guilty.  You don’t actually say in your post if he says he’s going to stop doing it.  Instead you ask how you can stop feeling insecure about him dating another girl.  I think you should feel insecure about it, get mad and dump him."
68,"If it happens again, cause a scene. Women, and especially young women, are socialized *not* to make a scene, and this is a real problem. Predators thrive on people pretending not to see.


If he pulls up beside you, shout at him to leave you alone. Yell that you're calling the police. If someone else is on the street with you, look directly at them and tell them you're being harassed and you need help.


I get that this is, for many young women, a really difficult thing to do. But you will be safer in the future if you learn the skill - yes, skill - of causing a scene now. "
69,"&gt; Birthdays are when the cracks in bad relationships show

This is kind of true, isn't it?  If your SO literally cannot celebrate your birthday in a way meaningful to you - one day a year - there are way bigger issues here. "
70,"Honestly, thats what i was wondering. It is immature for her to keep acting as though the job comes second tp her random whims"
71,"Sounds like he’s just intimidated by you, feels a bit inadequate in comparison, and is trying to make himself feel better by putting you down. I dealt with this in school too - I worked really hard, did well, and some people just fucking hated me for it, no matter what I did. A friend of mine also experiences this. He’s very successful (because he works hard), and it doesn’t matter how nice he is - some people just really hate him. Just keep doing what you’re doing, avoid the brother where ever possible, and tell your boyfriend to shut down the weird sarcastic comments from his brother."
72,"If she doesn't know what she wants, then she doesn't want you. End of story. You're her husband, not only was she willing to betray you and jeopardize everything you share, her affair goes beyond the physical into the emotional. You need to be getting proof of her affair any way you can and speaking to a lawyer ASAP. 

I understand that you have a million questions, some of which may never be answered, but first and foremost you need to look out for yourself. Your wife is not the person you thought she was, and while that is a hard pill to swallow, it does not mean your life is over. You matter, your feelings matter, you are no one's second pick. You deserve better than that, you deserve a partner who loves you and puts you above all others, not a partner who fucks around then expects you to wait in limbo while she decides whether you're worthy of her. Here's the thing OP, she isn't worthy of you.

Go hang out with friends, get your shit together, talk to a lawyer, have a good cry to let the hurt out then start making moves to separate yourself from this person. Closure is something we have to create for ourselves."
73,"I guess it depends on what a good marriage is to you. I always believed that a good marriage is based on trust, care, honesty and integrity.
The same goes for friendship.
Especially in the eye of difficulties...

After my standards your marriage and friendship doesn't seem so great.

But maybe in your book a good marriage is based on other things. "
74,"He got really upset that I brought up the ultimatum and said something like, ""I would never bring up separation in a fight."" ""I can't believe you are threatening our relationship over this."" I told him that is just how serious I am about this insecurity and we need this if we are going to get over thus bump. He said he will go but he never thought I would do something like this. It just makes me feel like I am over-reacting, you know? I can't keep questioning myself."
75,Who the fuck is OPs girl and why does she have such a solid support system who knows her so well and loves her so much
76,My therapist talked about this and it’s trauma bonding. And it’s not always a good thing to be in contact with the person this much because it often just continuously brings up the memories and fear and they feed off of one another instead of healing properly. I’m not saying they should be totally over it by now but it sounds like they haven’t made much progress. 
77,"You're intimidated, but look at it this way:  He has an 11 year head start on you.  There's nothing stopping you from being at his level or higher when you're at that stage in your life.  Additionally, if you're in the same field, he can give you advice and connections so you can be more successful sooner than he was.

Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.  Just because he's good at things doesn't mean that you can't be good at them too.  Try to be the best YOU you can be, rather than trying to be your brother."
78,"&gt; you might both be interested in cooking

It sounds like they've tried cooking together and she says she hates it.

But OP if you *haven't* cooked together, then you've kind of shot your girlfriend's cooking learning in the foot. She was excited to learn to cook, does that mean she likes your cooking? I would use it as an incentive to help her learn, at least enough to be your sous chef. Lots of couples don't both cook, or don't both cook with equal weight and decision power. You don't have to eat fast food, but for the time being you will need to cook more for yourself if you don't want to eat fast food. It's also okay if she does some shopping for meals, helps extra on clean-up, and you're the cook. Figure it out and open your mind up to solutions *other* than her cooking."
79,"You say you have pictures of your family out in your apartment, and yet he didn't know that they're black? Obviously parents are not the first thing you'd mention to a guy you're seeing, but don't you think you could have mentioned it before showing up to a dinner?

Literally anyone in his position would be surprised when they showed up, and it sounds like he struggled to recover after initially telling your mom she was at the wrong table. Honestly, something like that would send me into a shame spiral too. He may have handled it badly, of course, but it's hard to blame him for fumbling out of embarrassment after that initial moment. 

You don't think you set him up for failure at all? "
80,"What type of drugs was your husband taking to allow him to climb trees with a mangled arm, dislocated limb and broken finger? I mean I understand high pain tolerances, but yeah. Climbing trees usually requires the use of arms. 

I'm only saying this because your husband was either high and/or a moron. Regular people, even if they don't wanna go to the doctor immediately take a rest and say, ""ok I'm injured. I'm gonna do some self-preservation and go sit down somewhere for a bit"". I think even 12 year olds can have common sense not to goad someone with a mangled arm into climbing a tree. He did that himself to impress 12 year olds and he's a moron for doing it.  

I was seriously expecting this thread to be about his love of extreme sports and my advice would be for him to take out life insurance/income protection so as to provide for your children.

My father spent some time in hospital recently, he met a man who fell off a damn chair trying to whack a spider. That man is now a quadriplegic. That's how simple it can be to damage yourself and I'm an avid skiier too. Climbing a tree with a mangled arm. That's being a straight up moron. "
81,"Nope. This is classical predator behaviour. It's all deeply unsettling. I mean, who on earth spends their time thinking about whether or not a child can have an orgasm? What does that say about a person's interests and knowledge basis?

Obviously you need to get the hell away from this (future? current?) sex criminal. I think the bigger question to explore right now is what on earth you can do with this information to protect the children and teens around him. Does anyone have any constructive suggestions about who to inform and whether or not anything he's done could be noted formally in case he offends in the future?"
82,"This makes me think

&gt;and at the time was actually sleeping with a few of my GFs friends

sometimes to understand somebody you should look at their friends.

It looks like her circle (and her since shes aprt of it) its kinda ok with cheating. And her disrespecting your boundaries multiple times doesnt help her cause. I think she likes the a attention and doesnt respect you."
83,"&gt; She used to live with her mom (his ex- they’ve been divorced over 10 years) but had to move out bc she is toxic and not a very good mom. 

That's pretty damning."
84,"Are you absolutely sure that she's going to her parents' house? It seems like she might be intentionally picking fights so she can leave. Whether she is actually going to her parents' house or not she's definitely being, in the least, extremely immature. At the worst, she's manipulating you and really messing with you. Either way it's inappropriate and I think you should ask her to stop. How are you ever going to work through anything if she never stays to do that with you?"
85,So from what I’m understanding- your step brother made  passes at you without consent (correction: assaulted you) and you’re uncomfortable in what’s supposed to be your safe space? Not okay! I know you don’t want to make waves but your safety and comfort AND CONSENT is the priority here. I don’t want to scare you but these could be just the beginning red flags. Talk to your Mom. Talk to another blood related family member.  This disgusting boy needs to learn his actions are wrong and that you are family. Nothing good can come of this situation if you stay quiet. You don’t want to get hurt!  
86,"Pick up a book on 'assertive communication'. Basically you express your point of view, while also respecting the rights and beliefs of others.

Sitting next to is fine, but you don't need to ignore her dumb display because it's impacting you negatively. ""I feel like you are trying to tell me something"" or ""Can you please stop what you are doing? I am trying to listen to the speaker"". "
87,"*”His room is disgusting, he barely cleans himself (i had to remind him to clip his toenails because they looked like talons the other day), he leaves lights and fans and tv's on, he leaves dishes and trash laying around, and I actually had to step by step show him how to scrub a bathtub and rinse it to make it clean after asking him to clean part of the bathroom if I cleaned the rest...”*

He may need a mental health evaluation. He sounds a lot like the son of a colleague who’s been diagnosed as schizophrenic.  It might not be as bad as that, but he clearly has some sort of mental health issue(s). The correct medication might make all the difference in the world. "
88,“The 7 principles for making marriage work” is a great one that I have found personal success with. 
89,"Would also suggest that this might be less to do with the present and more to do with ongoing stress of covering the gap in income coming out. 

What is op's wife's love language?  Finding that out might help op figure things out. "
90,"One aspect of this that I don’t think guys get is women have been socialized to believe how clean/organized the house is is a reflection on THEIR worth and value. That’s obviously straight up untrue and a result of misogynistic societal messages, but it’s there and present for a LOT of women.

For you, waiting to do the chores until it’s convenient isn’t a problem. Laundry not being done might be annoying if you want to wear something that’s dirty, but ultimately it’s not a big deal and waiting a day or two isn’t stressful. For a lot of women, waiting to do chores is JUST AS STRESSFUL as doing them right away, because if you don’t do them you have to deal with the guilt and anxiety about *them not being done*. 

So I think you have to meet her in the middle on this. Yes, she might have an unhealthy work ethic, and it might help her to have a conversation where you make it clear you don’t care about x being done so frequently ... but ultimately *she* might care, because she might not be able to shake the societal guilt she’s grown up with her whole life that her worth is connected to these things being done. And if that’s the case? The way to be a supportive partner is to *help her do these things*, even when it’s not always super convenient."
91,"&gt; Pretty regressive 

He left up a couple posts in r/Reformed. I come from that kind of background, and they generally believe that husbands are the chief decision maker for their family, but they often also believe (if they are “complementarian,” which is a fancy word for Patriarchy-lite) that a husband is responsible for his wife’s spiritual growth (I.e., he gets to treat her like a child for not conforming to his ideas of how she should behave). This sounds like EXACTLY what OP is doing.

(For whatever it’s worth, being a Reformed Christian doesn’t NECESSARILY mean having these beliefs. They’re just very common. I am so glad I got out of that world)"
92,"That's um, an interesting hobby he has... I really don't think you have to force yourself to be okay with this. I get the feeling you're trying to fit into the ""cool girl"" stereotype by not being controlling and being totally fiiineee with him excessively following hot strangers and sliding into their dms for ""friend reasons"". LIKE this is weird behavior for a man in a happy relationship and you should be weirded out"
93,"Whelp found your issue, you talk to Jan more in group settings than your own wife.  That is why she is having issues.  

Also remember yes its always good for you to have someone else to talk to, and obviously men and women both need someone to talk to, but yea, women are extremely aware of how much attention, focus, communication, etc, that you give someone.  I recommend more so a 90/10 balance (may seem extreme, but for now, its really necessary).  "
94,"You're a hero. I'd def talk to the VP and see what their thoughts are. The right thing would be to remove him from the club all together for harassing a team mate.   


Pretend your not embarrassed. Strut through there like he's the one who should be embarrassed (cuz he should). Whatever repercussions happen for him is his own damn fault for harassing you. If he becomes even more creepy, you have A LOT of people who have evidence that he's been a creep in the past. "
95,"If you wanted to be treated right,  would you go ask the person who treated you like you were crap on their shoe repeatedly over a long period of time?  No,  that's the last person you'd go to for that if you were a sane human being.  Not to mention that nothing was keeping you from treating her well the first hundred times you had the chance.  You just don't want to treat people right unless they force you to by leaving,  and that is neither normal nor acceptable.  This is why you need therapy,  or she'll just be the first of a very long string of women who will run in the opposite direction from you. Put your overinflated ego aside and focus on what's good for you,  at least."
96,"I agree. I had an almost emotional affair once. The moment I realized I was getting too close to another man, I told my boyfriend (now husband) and cut the other guy out of my life completely. Yes OP's wife works with that guy, so it's a bit different, but she should have ended any personal non-work associations with him right then and there. She hurt you OP, sure she apologized, but she took 0 steps to right her wrong. It sound to me like She came clean to alleviate her guilt, not to make things right. ""Actions speak louder than words"".

I'm sorry, OP. This is a crummy situation, and you're right to be upset. 

Edit: oh shit, the comments below are right. She works with HIS wife! Damn. For the sake of her coworker and her coworker's relationship with her husband, she should have let them be. This is pressure building in a pot."
97,"Yea it definitely is not one of those polite answers that explains everything. But everyone is different (some people are social butterflies and other are hermits) and we of course won't always understand one another, but we should let people do things their own way.

I don't think there is any clear way to put it. It just....is."
98,"That is a ridiculous excuse.  Can she not see how easily it could be turned around?
  
""You see honey, she was a virgin, so we only had sex a little bit, for demonstration purposes, so I could explain to her what it was like.""
  
She wouldn't fall for that logic, and neither should you."
99,"&gt;Is my son or my marriage more important?

You seriously need reddit to answer that for you?

You should never have agreed to move before your son was at least 18 and done with high school. Okay, he shouldn't have held a party, but what the hell do you expect from a 17-year-old who's been left on his own?

Your son's father sounds like a complete shitshow as well. Why are you leaving your son to stay with someone who's neglected him for years and who doesn't even want him?

&gt; If I stay here I’ll have nowhere to live and my husband would probably end up divorcing me eventually as he’s in the other country now. 

If your husband couldn't wait a year for you then he sounds like a complete jackass. 

I feel sorry for your son. Every adult in his life sounds selfish as hell. 
"
100,"&gt;My job means I work long and unsociable hours. Dating is hard work and complicated. I'm not easily going to find a partner who is comfortable with me living with another man, considering the obvious bond that we have with each other.

Definitely not if you're not looking in the first place. Start looking. You're 25, not 50.

I would also suggest you seek or find some other sexual outlets, just to get out of the headspace that he's the only option. Buy a fun toy, or get on some apps and find some casual sex."
101,"If you think his children ran away from him, and that the story begins and ends with that text message, you're crazy.  If you think there isn't a very dark and serious reason the father of a minor has not contacted the police after not knowing that Minor's whereabouts for a MONTH, you might be stupid too.  Kids these days, indeed."
102,"Please do an update post when you can, this is a very interesting situation.

I would just be straightforward with her, if she threatens anything, call the police "
103,God damn. Why do guys not understand this concept? No one wants a picture of a random guys dick. 
104,"She doesn't want to listen to you and friendship is a two way street. What does she add to your life? You don't owe her your friendship and if she won't change or listen to you, there isn't much point in playing pretend friends. If she respected you she'd at least be more open to your ideas. 

I would probably cut contact but not before being totally honest. It sounds like too many people in her life have enabled her rather than give her the truth for all the reasons you've held back. "
105,"My brother had his first wedding on the other side of the country, during my finals week, and on my birthday. Needless to say I did not attend. I say skip it."
106,"This reminds me of the Achewood comic ""Humorous Baby Onesies."" I'd recommend looking it up but I'll describe it below.

Essentially, the character with a bad childhood buys some onesies as a gift for a friend's child. They have funny but are in bad taste, with slightly sexual/morbid sayings on them. His girlfriend is shocked and upset, and asks what he wore as a child that he thinks these are acceptable.

He sort of blinks and the memory is shown of him as a baby, dressed in a Wonderbread plastic bag tied with an electric cord, crying on the floor while his parents ignore him."
107,Thanks for the advice. Yeah I can trust my uncle
108,"ok, barring the masturbation thing- not that he's asking, I know many people who 'masturbated' around ages 5-8 without realizing what it was- this is super duper weird, and you should listen to those alarm bells going off in your head. "
109,"He equates necessary household chores to back scratches.

Adults don't request rewards from their partners because they do some cooking and cleaning.

The guy is insane and needs to be dropped."
110,"Say no. If your relationship improves in the future, you can change your mind; if not, your son can decide when he's 18 whether to meet his grandfather."
111,"This seemed obvious to me as soon as I read it.

Roommate has broken PS4 and borrow's OP's working PS4. Now suddenly, roommate's PS4 is working and OP's is broken.

Weird how that works, huh?

Any way, it doesn't matter at this point. Roommate and mom are both adults. They should either give OP a working PS4 or cash to buy one asap. 

OP should be contacting roommate's mom directly as well as roommate's sister if that doesn't work. This is officially a problem and unacceptable that it has dragged along this long."

113,"I would *call* the club VP, and talk things out. They may have removed Bobby because he violated club policies, or made you uncomfortable. They may be able to work with you about how to avoid Bobby at the club, or (fingers crossed) let you know he won't be there at all."
114,"&gt; I don't want that for my mom. I want her to be with me.

Then you know where your priorities stand. Your mom is more important to you than your husband. It might be a few months or a few years. You really can't say. If you do move she becomes your responsibility and you won't be able to leave. Maybe consider a nursing home where you live instead of her hometown.

&gt; Like any couple, especially one that's dealt with pregnancy loss, we have our hard moments. There's silent dinners, nights where we aren't even in the same room, times when we can't bring ourselves to touch each other.

This is not like any couple. It makes me think you guys have long stand communication and relationship issues."
115,"As a preventative measure for the future, don’t give your mom so much information about your life. 

Mom: “where are you interning?”
You: “oh, a media company”
Mom: “which one?”
You: “oh, a company called X, they have lots of magazines and I’m not sure which one I’m going to work for primarily yet.”

Or

Mom: “who’s your boss on internship?”
You: “it’s this funny guy (tell long story about boss without using boss’s name)”
Mom: “but what’s his name?”
You: “why do you need to know that?”

If your mother is on a need to know basis she literally can’t do this kind of nonsense because she won’t know who to call. "
116,"Then just get a shower, pack and leave. Stay with a friend, start over. 

There's no way this will become a healthy relationship. Betrayal aside, she decided to have 'one more night of fun'... There is absolutely no reason to assume she's gonna stay faithful after this. Save yourself the heartbreak.


Also keep in mind: She's ready to *marry you* while keeping this from you. She's ready to literally steal your life away on a lie."
117,"He lied about this girl before and actually had OP fly to see him before he told her.  He also hooked up with this girl before and lied about it.  He asked because he thought you might be over it.  This is pretty goddamn shady.

Did he dictate the condition that he ""he needs to be able to maintain his friendship with this girl?""  I know why he needs to maintain his friendship with her, and so do you.  This is not an overreaction, and your BF is an idiot.  You know what's going to happen if he sees her.  "
118,"By your own admission, your ex has been an absolutely terrible parent, what makes you think he'll change his ways this year?"
119,"The crazy part is, his dad did the same thing to his mum and his family acted like it was all fine and dandy... some of his family members have been very angry with me and frankly, I don't give AF--I am not going to put up with this shit. I will NOT repeat what his mum did. Get mad all you want, but I am not going to stay with someone who does that. I have more respect for myself that. And he already gave me one STD... apparently from that ex-witch... "
120,"&gt;s pretty rare on this sub that we get someone who's objectively, totally, 100&amp;#37; in the right--but you're there. She has no business complaining about this for any reason.

Oh man, you made both of our nights. Thanks.

I'll try and let this blow over, but she's definitely put herself in the position where I now expect an apology. "
121,"Hey OP, something that stuck out to me was when you mentioned you got her a gift, “we already have one that works just fine”.

Can you say exactly what the gift is?  Maybe she wanted something for HER, and it kind of sounds like you got her like a vacuum cleaner or a toaster.  Sounds like she had a different expectation of a gift.   
"
122,"He got me nothing nor have I asked for anything but I’ve already got him several things. All I would get was a plain thank you.

Deep inside I was expecting at least some flowers or a bar of chocolate. He can afford things, he has a good paying job as well. But never have I demanded or asked for anything


I’m very thoughtful so I thought he’d appreciate the little things I get him but apparently not. 

I’m now having second thoughts and am thinking of leaving him.

"
123,"Your third point isn't extreme at all--one of my closest friends was widowed while pregnant with her second kid because she was married to a guy with a similar attitude. I've seen OP's worst nightmare, and it really, really sucks. Every moment of those kids' lives comes with a reminder that their dad isn't there with them because he just thought climbing things was so much fun.  
  
He needs life insurance, OP! *Needs!*"
124,"When I was 12 I ""dated"" a similar 15 year old. We weren't actually dating, but how middle schoolers ""date"". I broke up with him after about three days but we continued talking. Here are a few really weird instances that stuck out to me. 

This was during the age of MySpace. He would always message me about how my pictures gave him a boner and said he jacked off to them every day. I didn't know that this wasn't normal, especially since my pictures were nothing more than innocent webcam pictures 12 year olds took in 2009. 

He texted me once asking if I would take him back. I suggested he try dating an older friend of mine (she was 14) and he said he prefers girls under 13. 

There were more incidents but this one was probably the worst. The day I met him was at about 6 in the morning. My best friend and I had pulled an allnighter and we were walking around the complex she lived in. He lived there too. My friend knew him and we started talking to him near the clubhouse. Exhausted me fell asleep on the curb and my best friend let me sleep while they were talking. She woke me up and we went back to her house. The next day, he texted me saying that if she wasn't there, he would have taken advantage of me. His exact wording. I'm so, so glad she was there. 

Remember how I said he was 15? Later I found out he was lying and was actually 18. I recently got curious and googled his name, he's on the sex offender registry. 

OP, follow your gut. Red flags like that should never be ignored. "
125,This x10!!!! Had a neighbor at my parents plant bamboo in the little community garden without telling anyone because it “looked nice”. Few years later and they are still battling that hot mess. 
126,I would divorce my husband if he said it was okay for our 9 year old son to have sex. That insane. Get your shit together. Raise your son with some god damn morals. 
127,"Good lord...you split every cost 50/50, and do all the housework AND do all the emotional labor? Girl...ask yourself what it is that you’re getting out of this relationship because from the outside it looks like you do all the work, lose every argument or even discussion and get hardly any support or care from this man. Is that what you want your life to look like? Because it will not change if you marry this guy."
128,"Another thing, yes, it's been a long time, but for her she kind of just found out. He's had time to process and accept and whatnot, but for OP it's ""fresh"" information - and he ought to remember that. "
129,"Is there a woman at work that he is overly friendly with? Is there a couple at work that he is jealous of? Those were my first thoughts.

My second thought is that your husband is an insensitive bung hole.

Therapy would be a wise choice, even if it is just you."
130,"Am I the only one that thinks it's crazy to just rule the new guy out? No denying your ex is shit, but I wouldn't just assume it was him, based on the new guys words."
131,"That sounds so rapey. OP needs to realize the gravity of it. I read somewhere online something similar and the guy pretty much raped his sister and threatened to tell their parents.

It was just very bad. Tell her now."
132,I had a man do this to me. Im so non confrontational he stayed for 4 weeks and when i took it to my leasing office they said i would have to evict him and have him sign off on it. KICK HER ASS OUT NOW. Send someone by and if any one is inside call about a break in. 
133,"What caliber are the comedians you’re looking to hire? Do they have websites / ways to contact them professionally? Do they have references from other paying gigs? Etc. If so, I would tell your friend that while you love to support her as a friend, you can only recommend entertainers that meet established criteria for your work events. "
134,"If you do this, OP, be specific. Dates, times, quotes, accurate details. Nothing beats letting a bad, abusive employee get themselves fired through the truth of their own actions. Don't be petty or vindictive - you don't need to, log what she did, be professional about it, and she'll get herself fired on her own. 

You don't *need* to salvage this work relationship. This woman sounds bad enough that your workplace will be better off with her working someplace else. You, your coworkers, and your patients are all suffering through her actions. ""How can I salvage this work relationship?"" is the wrong question to ask. You can't. Get her fired. Report her actions to HR or whatever the equivalent is in your hospital (or someone above both of you if it's a small medical practice), accurately and honestly, and let them handle it."
135,[deleted]
136,"Oof... That’s tough. I really don’t think OP should fire him while his wife is dying of cancer. Just imagine what that conversation will be like between him and his wife, OP. Please find another position for him or put him on some sort of reduced duty if only to prevent a loss of sales. I know you’re running a business, but the guy and his family are already in a crisis. I don’t think a few sales and some awkwardness in the office are worth ruining this guy’s life and putting his poor wife through even more misery."
137,"I've noticed in both of OP's posts the examples of John's talking mention his wife.

&gt;  
&gt; **YEAH ME AND MY WIFE WENT TO TOUR OF ONE A FEW YEARS BACK AND I'LL TELL YA...** 

OP I totally get if you fire this guy because you have a business to run... but I think he needs help. Would you feel comfortable meeting him outside walk JUST to talk?


Maybe if you dedicate one beer to listening to him he will back off while at work? I really think he needs to see a professional though. Would you feel comfortable recommending some services to him, or talking to him about this?


Or before firing him, would you feel comfortable sending him on a 1-2 week paid sick/mental health leave?"
138,"A+ A+ this this this

If he was actually good the fact that you suck wouldn’t make a difference. But you’re an easy excuse for him to get annoyed with, so he can shift all the blame. You see it all the time in games it’s just... usually not personal because the blame game won’t last past the game itself, unfortunately you’re in a relationship with this one so it will.

He wasted 15 years of her life, knowing that he wasn't going to provide her with what she needs in a relationship. I know the girlfriend is also to blame for staying so long, perhaps she vainly had hope, but still.

Your almost 30 year old friend is dating a 20 year old. I would not be throwing rocks into people's glass houses here when it comes to judging maturity. 

I know it feels really good and easy to blame the 20 year old girl than your grown ass adult male friend for being an a-hole. But let's be real here. Nobody is making this guy do anything he does not want. Stop putting the blame on other people. "

What the fuck? His family seems a special kind of nuts. I also don't want kids and am not religious, so is my fiance. We can see there are legal benefits of marriage which is why we are getting married, that and we just want to. Your right it is bullshit to say you guys can't get married because his family's beliefs. This guy needs to learn how to stand up to his parents, he is too damn old for this shit.  I would be mad as hell too if I were you. I hope you can take the rings back. This guy has some serious issues if proposing is his idea of what to do when mad at his parents. Like just wth"

Also, is this someone you still want to be friends with? He sounds like a jerk. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve had less &amp; less interest in hanging out with people that don’t treat their romantic partners with respect. It’s just such an unattractive quality in a person that it makes me not want to be friends with them. "
151,"Nope. You need to get over yourself. She liked your gift, used it for 6 months, but it was never the thing she wanted in the first place. You “assumed” that instead of getting what she wanted ( or giving a gift such as a gift card to help buy an Apple Watch) that you would get her something similar. 
Your heart was in the right place, you listened to what she was asking for, and then you disregarded her opinion and bought her something else that you deemed “ just as good”.
It wasn’t the same thing, next time, if the thing she wants is out of your price range, then get her something to help get her there or something else entirely.

152,"This! It was an intense learning experience! Have her write a letter to her future self now while it's all fresh so she remembers what she learned.

OP, I hate to break this to you but she already has a mother and is obviously really close to her as well. And you're not even married to her father, your relationship with him could end at any moment. You can't suddenly be ""mom"" to her. You can't expect a child to who lives and has a good relationship with her mother to suddenly view her father's girlfriend as another mom.  It's not wrong for you to want to have a good relationship with her but don't force her to accept you, she's just a kid. You're being extremely insecure that now you are even competing on being a mother figure with her own BIOLOGICAL mom who she has a perfectly good relationship with. It's not like has no mother figure or her mother is mean to her.

Also, leave him if you suspect their relationship is too close for comfort. You need to talk to him about this."

I think your wife is reverting to her life before she suffered the loss of her child. It's like she can imagine it hasn't happened yet because she is 16 again. Since she is a writer it is easy to make up what her life would be in another time and place. It's roll-playing in real-life. She has developed this as a coping skill for her pain. Of course she needs therapy and grief counseling. Suggest either she go with you as a couple or you will go alone. But if you go alone it will mean she doesn't want to married anymore. Don't mention the catfishing."

I used to BEG my mom for a nose job to get rid of my “Jewish nose” and she eventually caved and said that if I still wanted the procedure at 18 or 20 then she would support me. By the time I was old enough, I had learned to love and accept my nose the way it was. This might not be the case for your daughter, but it’s certainly a possibility. "
161,"You should talk to your dad about getting emancipated. If anything, your mom is the abuser and should be charged with child abandonment. Leaving you home alone for days at a time so she can run off with the boyfriend that could be your older brother is bullshit. 

Your mom would lose child support if you went for emancipation and you need to prove you can survive on your own, but there has got to be some weird military laws here that can protect you. talk to your dad, and talk to a trusted adult who isn't your mother or the boyfriend. What they are doing is wrong. Track sounds like it could be your way out of your mom's house (think college scholarships), so are your grades. Do not let her do anything to destroy that.

Your biggest problem is your dad being deployed because the military basically won't let him have full custody unless he is stateside for the rest of your minor hood, but that odes not mean there is not an argument for emancipation, especially if your dad is willing to help with the rent. A really background way of doing this is your dad rents an apartment in his name, then subleases it to you for say $1 and you now can support yourself fully in the eyes of the court. 

again, talk to your dad, the consult a lawyer or r/legaladvice"

Sending someone out to tighten a handle will be super low priority for whoever schedules maintenance, so you can wait for the maintenance staff to show up, and have the loose handle stress you out every day, or if you have a simple tool kit, you can tighten it in less than a minute and not spend any more mental energy on the topic. I use my small tool kit for small things like that pretty routinely - it is the difference between doing something in less than 5 minutes and having a simple task take up an afternoon because you don't have basic tools like screwdrivers or wrenches."
166,"This sounds very manipulative to me, and it doesn't sound like he'd fight fair in a custody battle. You're definitely not over reacting. You need to decide whether you want to fix things with him, and if so you need to sit him down and find out if he truly wants to. Having parents who fight like this is so horrible for children, he sounds like an awful coparent and surely there's not many things that top that as deal breakers."

You are not wrong for desiring a formal commitment and your reasons are absolutely fine and not brattish or selfish. You want an acknowledgement of your status and “girlfriend” at this stage is just plain inaccurate. You want commitment which makes sense considering how much time, effort and emotion you have invested in this relationship. You are raising a child with and for him. This is not an unreasonable desire. BUT. Expecting him to read your mind is unreasonable. Telling him what you want is the only solution to your problem. "

This does not involve being an asshole by constantly using a language the people around me do not understand to shout at them.  I sometimes slip with a word or two, but I would *never* just go off on someone, outside of a telemarketer, in Japanese.  It's beyond just rude, it's a sign that your brother is a raging asshole.  People in Japan probably think he's a raging asshole too if he considered being an asshole acceptable behavior."

They also had like 14 children to help but was fully expecting to pay it all themselves. And I guarantee it was the youngest daughter who made most the plans, ect because they didn't speak English. It was over 300 people.


What you do OP, is take your hands off. Offer X amount of money for this, maybe reserve the venue or something but because she has specific expectations, you're going to disappoint her no matter what.

Quite honestly, if anyone did that to my kid, I’d be moving out.  "
180,"Initiative is what's key here.

She could point at what needs doing, but she shouldn't have to do that. That's stressful for her and infantilizing to him. A conversation to hash out a plan would be a great way to move forward.

I admit I am guilty of what OP's girlfriend is doing and I regret getting so angry. I lashed out because I felt resentful and saddled with chores - not only because I was doing most of them, but because my boyfriend would say ""if you'd just ask me"" or ""tell me what to do."" And he meant it: he'll basically do anything you ask him to. After living together for years and watching me do chores, my feeling was ""how do you not know some of what needs to get done around here? and why do I have to tell you to do it?"" We've moved past it and it wasn't OK for me to blow up about it, but that's exactly why I was frustrated and upset: lack of initiative. 

I hope these two can have a calm discussion about it and that OP takes it upon himself to do more without being asked or told. "
181,"Hijacking the top comment, because this is important and other people saying it are buried far below: /u/limitlessjitz, you need to get this woman out of your apartment asap! In most places, once you ""live"" somewhere for 30 days you have tenant's rights. Meaning you can't just be kicked out, and instead have to go through an official eviction. Meaning another at least 30 days of notice. And court and law enforcement will be involved. And it could get even more messy than that.

You need to tell her unequivocally that she needs to go. Tell her you will call the police to have her removed. If she tries to call your bluff, it's time to stop bluffing. Call the police and tell them you have someone in your home who is refusing to leave. Get her out before she gets her 30 days!"
182,"This is it right here. OP should be proud she accidentally brought this into the open. I would be happy to see more people who get creeped like this doing so right away. The shame is all his.

No.  He does not have to bring work with him on your HONEYMOON!  That is a worthwhile hill to die on in my opinion.  Tell him you feel like your relationship has taken a backseat to his previous job, and now his graduate degree and that it is having a negative impact on how you view the relationship.  Your honeymoon is supposed to be all about you and your partner, nothing else.  If he brings work with him that's a huge red flag that you will never be a priority to him and he will always put work above you.  "

185,"So here's the thing--you probably can't do this inoffensively, because he's going to take offense. But that's his problem, not yours. When he starts in on a story, say ""I am on deadline"" and turn your back to him. Stop engaging. Put on headphones or close your office door. 

""John, I can't talk to you.""
""John, I have to finish this.""
""John, I'm busy.""

These are your go-to phrases. If he starts saying that you are mean or whatever, be boring. ""Yup, I'm mean. Now, I have work."" Your boss has TOLD YOU to brush John off. Do it."

Sounds like he's pretty used to it. Trust him here that he's all right. Maybe send some positive reviews to his company about him to counteract her negativity.
&gt;he’s gotten in the habit of dropping me off a starbucks when he comes in, which is unexpected but very, very welcome.

Ask him if you can buy him a drink sometime. Even if one or both of you isn't single, you can kvetch about Janelle and make this friendship a little more solid. I would bet you're already a ray of sunshine for him in comparison to Janelle."

Then what in the world does ""live life fully"" even mean? Color me skeptical. 

Anyhow, think long and hard about what a break would entail and what boundaries you would want if there is a plan to get back together. An open-ended break with no boundaries might as well just be a breakup.

192,"Right? I have no idea how people have tolerance for a romantic partner with such a low threshold of self sufficiency. He’s not a toddler that needs to be constantly entertained (not entered whoops!). He’s a grow man and should be okay to be left to his own devices without needing to lay a guilt trip or manipulate OP over being alone. 

Edit: ENTERTAINED Y’all. Don’t get me on a list hahaha "
193,Imagine you walked in on him and he was singing “I just met a girl named Maria...”

195,"that's true. and they do seem to have a (possibly slightly unhealthy?) relationship in which Amy is the replacement sibling for the sister that died.

199,"This is your child. I think it'd be very fair to say firmly, ""When you're visiting I don't mind you taking him to church, as part of your father-son experience. But I won't be taking him or letting your parents take him.""

Since you are custodial parent and it doesn't sound like your ex has any real rights to your son, you'd also be within your rights to say no church at all, even when he's visiting.

202,"&gt; I should mention some of the reasons he’s weird with time is because he plays two different sports and is originally from a town two hours or so away which he visits frequently. I don’t think he’s married.

I’m not convinced. That might be something he’s just telling you as a cover for a SO he has somewhere else. Given how many promises that he’s broken, I wouldn’t trust anything this guy says.

204,"Said this in another comment, but apparently it bears repeating:

Professionally, Dan/Danielle presents as male and uses male pronouns. So when I say “he will be a valuable reference,” my usage is correct because of this distinction. If I were to use female pronouns to discuss him in a professional setting, I would be effectively outing him in the workplace. I’m not going to tell a prospective employer to call “her” because that would be outing. It’s not as black and white as you seem to think it is. We work in a niche industry and these details matter.

207,"It's also NOT easier to let the kid do what they want anyway.  You'd be making 10 different things to eat every meal, and they wouldn't eat it anyway.  They'd never brush their teeth or take a bath.  Every night they would be up complaining about stuff until literally passing out on the floor.  That all sounds a heck of a lot harder than just setting the rules in the first place and ignoring them when they throw the occasional tantrum about it.

Kids adapt fast to structure and rules.  They might occasionally put up a fight about it, but if you are firm and consistent, they will quickly accept it.  I remember a post a while ago about a mom who had a 5 year old that had never slept alone.  She had been cosleeping since birth, and she said that he literally would not sleep without her there.  5 years of that.  Her husband finally got sick of it and said it needed to change.  When they put him in his room, the kid kicked and screamed at the door for maybe an hour before falling asleep on the floor.  The next night, he just went right to his own bed and went to sleep.  5 year pattern, and it took all of one night to correct it.  Not even one night, like an hour of complaining.

Kids adapt.  If you make it clear that the screaming and complaining aren't going to get them anything, and are consistent about it, they stop doing it (mostly).  It's the ones who GET stuff by screaming and complaining that keep it up."
208,I agree! They are certainly both very beneficial to each other. Charisma is something that cannot be taught or learned. It's just who you are. I certainly don't want to insult OP. Her frustrations with her treatment at work are valid. But focus on what the problem is. And it's her frustration with her professional situation. That's not her husband's fault.

If you two can't talk it out alone, counseling is always an option so someone neutral can help you guys open up through this and give objective input. "

I wanted to forgive and trust him again.

That said... the whole 'worth it to get free' is exactly what all those women who were screwed in the divorce said.

You have poured so much effort into this relationship and he's treated you with contempt.  You've given him *years* of your life.  The *least* of what he owes you is an equitable division of assets.  You don't even have to be the one who does the heavy lifting.  Leave it with the lawyer and get on with your life.

Do what is right for you but be very aware his 'deal' is just another way for him to show his contempt.  Do you really think he hasn't been planning this from the start?  He knows he can just treat you badly and wear you down and you'll roll over.  Minimizing stress and avoiding conflict is admirable until it allows people to take advantage of you.  

Get out but do it on your terms- not *his*."
217,I agree. It sounds like he is spiraling into some kind of manic episode or some kind of emotional breakdown. He spent 3 full minutes talking to an empty room. That is not normal behaviour.

Along those same lines, it might not be bad for you to look for a support group for people with disabled family members - both of you deserve support and empathy and resources to deal with these challenges.

I would deal with this by allocating time for him and being purposefully calm and pleasant to assure him that I'm okay and have things under control. Limited communications aside from the pre-planned meetings, as yeah that could be stressful, but you don't assuage a person's concerns by snapping at them or ghosting them."
225,"&gt; I just wanted him to like me

I know just about every person on this planet can absolutely relate to this feeling. But sometimes it can be a difficult lesson to learn that you don't have to sacrifice your privacy and your conscience and your comfort to please someone else. As someone who spent a lot of time wanting to be the ""cool girlfriend"" I hope you understand my advice- that it's not worth it if it makes you feel icky. And another guy will come along who doesn't make you feel icky."
226,"The most important place to start is to separate actions and how you feel/who you are.  If you act kindly and considerately, then whether you are actually feeling the love should not be relevant to your wife.  But one issue might be what YOU think is the proper level and type of kindness to be shown may not be identical with your wife's - and she has to accept that whatever she thinks is NOT the gold standard for conduct and she needs to discuss to be able to discuss these things without getting angry or imposing on you her values. 

But if you are not instinctively empathetic or neural-typical on social interactions, you have to train yourself to notice people and to think about what they need - whether it's just simple words of affirmation or condolence, or some real effort/sacrifice on your part.  You say you want to move in this direction, so use your eyes and mind.  You might also want to consider what you say, because you can wipe out a huge effort for other people by being callous in something you say.  Know what to say and when - and what never to say.

Good luck!       "
227,"My son is 13 and I’m probably the most permissive parent ever. But no way IN HELL would I let a 13 year old stay out til wee hours on a beach. Let’s face it, in terms of life experience or even teen experience, 13 is a baby. Early morning unsupervised ragers on a beach is advanced level, for when he is older. If your wife is so concerned why doesn’t she offer to host a pizza party at home and he can invite some new friends? They can even stay up all night! Adults can butt out but still be on the premises. "
228,"Great post, and great advice. I’m honestly shocked that more people ITT don’t understand that this scheduling conflict isn’t a personal attack on OP. Weddings can get extremely complicated to plan, and getting everyone a date that fits simply isn’t possible most of the time. "
229,"&gt;My issue I guess is that in the two years we've dated, I've already moved up with my career, while he has plateaued (he's still in the same job and position since we met

Two years isn't a lot of time. You're expecting far too much from him. Most people need to work several years before they can expect to be even considered for a promotion.

&gt;a job that he isn't using his bachelor's degree for).

Sadly, that's ""the new normal"" unless you're in engineering, nursing or some other specific, specialized field.

&gt;I gave up asking him about job searching because he got really upset about it. 

As someone who's been through the ""dead end job"" rigamarole before, I can tell you that harping on him for not job-searching is one of the *worst* things that you can do. Working a dead-end job is soul-sucking and demoralizing as all hell. Having to go through the stress and frustration of looking for better employment in today's job market in the little time that you have to de-stress from said job is even worse. Having a significant other (or parents, friends, etc) hanging over your head with constant prodding about it is *even worse than that.* 

The best thing that you can do is to be there to support him in as positive a manner as possible. The more that he feels like he has a solid support network, the more likely he is to take the initiative and try to search for better employment. 

&gt;I guess I'm just frustrated, since we live in together in an apartment, and right now I'm covering the majority of the bills. I feel like I'm just not getting the help I need.

Is he covering a portion of your shared expenses proportional to his salary? If you truly love him and want to be with him long-term, then that should be enough. You're probably never going to find an SO where your salaries and expenses line up 50/50, and you need to recognize that he's contributing to the best of his ability. (If he's not contributing *at all,* of course, then that's a completely different story.)

&gt;This was all made worse because a few months ago my SO began listening to a comedy podcast, and since then his attitude became increasingly negative. When we are at home at night he runs down a list of all the bad things his coworkers or boss did. He seems to have completely lost any ambition in the last 6 months, and is always blaming someone else or ""the system"" for why the life is so bad. Honestly, he has become a depressing person to be around.

He's right, though. ""The system"" - that is to say, our rigged economy - *is* responsible for so many people being stuck in dead-end and/or precarious employment situations. And, frankly, he's right to be angry about it, because it's an infuriating situation.

Have you talked to him at all about it? Perhaps if he felt that you understood where some of his anger and depression was coming from, then that might help him be happier around you.

(Full disclosure: I also listen to the podcast in question.)

&gt;You don't know how ridiculous I feel writing this, but I need advice on how to ask him to dump these negative things from his life and find his ambition again.

Talk to him with a sympathetic ear, try to understand him, and for God's sake, *don't* engage in blaming or ""personal responsibility"" rhetoric. Let him know that he has your support and that you're always willing to help him should he need a crutch to walk a mile or a shoulder to cry on. Again, he's far more likely to want to improve when he has support.

Other than that, though? Your boyfriend is a *person,* not a job. If you really are committed long-term, then who cares what he's doing to pay his share of the bills, so long as he's trying to do so?"
230,"It pains me to read this post. There is not a single redeming feature to this train wreck of a relationship you're describing. He prefers to spend time with anyone else but you, is annoyed and fidgety when doing something with you, could not care less if you hurt during sex and lays all the responsibility for ""fixing"" everything on your shoulders. He gets to keep his sarcasm and putdowns and - sounds like - cold contempt, you get to agonize over everything to the point of sickness. Wow. 

You definitely, DEFINITELY need to disclose your ED to your therapist, that's quite a piece of information to hold back from them. Do not worry about bursting into tears in their office, that's like the most normal thing in their day, every single one of them has a thing of Kleenex on the table, what do you expect that's for?

I would advise against couples' therapy at the moment, instead encouraging you to work on stabilizing your health and rediscovering your love and trust of yourself. You deserve a million times better than this twisted charade of a relationship. Wish you all the best."
231,"I just realized. His friends were *encouraging* this. Meaning they see the potential for your boyfriend and Sarah to be a *couple.* Meaning they also have no respect for your relationship.

Yea no. Don't let this go."
232,"Karen is terrifying. He needs to tell his supervisor RIGHT NOW, because Karen could screw him over very, very badly."
233,You don't need proof to leave him. This isn't a court case. You know what you saw and you know why he was on there. I'm so sorry he did this to you.
234,"I feel like we need more information. I can’t say yes or no to if the behavior is controlling based on what you wrote. What kind of things do you feel you need apologies for? The fact that you have to ask for an apology in the first place signals to me that a) she doesn’t know it’s something that bothers you, in which case you need to communicate that to her and one would expect her to apologize on her own, b) if it is something that happens continuously that you have discussed is a problem, and she doesn’t apologize, then she just doesn’t care about your feelings about the thing, or c) you are controlling and asking for apologies for minor mistakes that most people make and would seem relatively harmless (for example, forgetting to take the trash out or something idk) and she’s gotten tired of having to apologize for everything and walk on eggshells over the years to the point where she doesn’t care if you accept her apology or not anymore. 

As a side note: I don’t think it’s fair to say “I was raised this way and this is how I do things so she should do it this way too.” "
235,"Absolutely. I lived with a guy who would demand apologies for the slightest thing. Like, accidentally pushing a pencil to the floor or touching one of his belongings. Everything I did was a sign of ""disrespect"".
   
Meanwhile, he'd find a way to blame me if he broke something that belonged to me.
    
My apologies were also never enough. I'd have to come up with a plan to be less ""clumsy"" or whatever, which was also never enough, since there was also some *underlying* problem he felt was the root of it. 
    
After getting the lecture enough times it's hard to think of anything other than throwing your hands in the air and ask what it is that they want to hear, because there is obviously only one correct answer."

237,You need to do what’s best for you. This guy isn’t in the right place at all to be in a relationship right now. 
238,"THIS! The whole time I was reading the post I was thinking “does... does she really not know she’s the side chick?!” 


Sorry OP. "
239,"How about this instead:

240,"This is very very true. I am intelligent and capable, but a perfectionist. I  am also creative and overflowing with ideas and I see both the big picture and the details. However, the long and short of it is I often get stuck in  inertia, and as such haven't got very far in my 45 years. People say don't do things half-assed, but if you are someone who overthinks (like me, and maybe OP) it can be worth taking to heart that ""its better to do something imperfectly than nothing perfectly""... or something along those lines, and many other similar sayings, including yours.

241,"lol, true. maybe  one day we'll be able to edit tweets and Reddit titles. "
242,"🙋🙋🙋 Me me me! LOL

Best thing we ever did for our marriage! 

We're in our fifties and we both snore, and I am hot-natured and have to have the fan, while he is the opposite. "
243,"This a textbook example of the phrase ""Talk is cheap"". He's only ever promised you what you wanted in words, he's never actually followed through or given you what you wanted."
244,"&gt; whereas I’ll wait to do stuff when it’s convenient 

Let me guess--this time never comes"
245,"&gt; Maybe ask her to stop with the vibrator for a week or two and see what happens.

I would resent the fuck out of that and tell him absolutely no."
246,"I think the point is, if you don't trust him to the point of going online and creating a fake profile to see if he's on there, and then plan on talking to him through the fake profile to see if he's actually using it, then you're definitely in no position to marry him and you should save yourself the time and ridiculousness and break up."
247,I think she's secretly hoping that he isn't actively using the account or messaging girls
248,"&gt; What do I do?

You run, baby. He’s chasing tail when you’re not around (and when you *are* around) and especially in a long distance relationship, trust is everything. 

He’s shown you he’s not trustworthy. Believe him. "
249,"I think you're jumping to divorce too quickly. It's only been a couple of months. Rough times are part of marriage, and life in general, but if you can get through them your relationship will be even stronger. If it had been \*years\* that would be different, but you don't have to throw your marriage away over a couple months worth of crap. 

Firstly I think you have to stop asking her permission to do stuff and just hire that maid. You can afford the help, so go ahead and book one. Focus on practical solutions to your problems at the moment and see if things improve.

Secondly I think you should take some time to reflect on why you married her. What did she bring into the relationship? What good times did you have together? You must have felt strongly about each other to marry despite her family and for her to move countries for you.

Can you take some time off work to have a little holiday together? Or even spend more time together at home?

Edit: as for hobbies like rock climbing, she might feel less nervous if you go with her."
250,"Hm. OP only responds to people who seem to agree with him, will not answer any follow up questions and, looking at his post history, it’s a lot of the same! 🚩🚩🚩🚩"
251,"Yea, that's shitty behaviour. Did you speak with your boyfriend about that? Ultimately he should step up and tell her to speak the language everyone understands. If he doesn't do that he's honestly an ass.


I'd never exclude my girlfriend by speaking a different language even though we could all speak the same. That's just messed up."
252,"Dude your post history detailing your hookup plans for this week contradict this post. Just break it off. 

I read your replies, great you canceled do you want a gold star? Break up with your fiancé if you are scheduling dates. There’s nothing to decide about anymore. It’s done. "
253,"&gt; emotional safe word

I think we (or at least, I) would really like to hear how this works"
254,"I’m a jerk, but id probably say “you used to be cute, too, grandma. What happened?”"
255,"OP I'm going to agree with this other persons comment too. I was at a bit of a loss as to what to suggest, but I think this person came up with a really unique and intelligent idea on how to maybe do your due diligence as the parent to support your daughter's choice and at least give the guy a shot by trying to understand him instead of letting some sort of awkward wall build between him and her parents because they simply have a bit of trouble hearing him audibly.

Edit: can I just say that your post in general touched me a bit and I really do think it's very genuine and kind of you to even have this concern. I feel like most parents might take a different route so it's just really refreshing to hear this genuine concern. I can only hope to be a parent as good as you someday!"
256,Hoping to get reassurance for doing something she rightfully feels shitty about.
257,"I have a similar life situation, and as the person like your husband in this scenario, I imagine there is more than a little resentment.


Your MIL treated BIL better because he needed her more, not because she loves him more.
That is an extremely difficult idea to grasp when you feel like you’re second best even after doing everything right.


Your husband will need to accept that parents never truly treat their children equally, and we can’t expect them to even though we wish it. 


Let your husband have his feelings, but don’t let them ruin your child’s family. They still love him, you, and their grandchild. You can tell him that you understand how unfairly he was treated, and that its painful. His struggles were less than his brother’s and he can be proud of himself for never having anyone pity him or needing to be saved. Remind him that his family still wants to be involved in other ways, detail the loving things they have done for you. Then, let him decide if he’s hurt enough to cut them out, or if he’s ready to let it go. Comparison is the thief of joy. Time to choose joy."

If they can't respect that, then they aren't really your friends, and you should tell them that. "
260,"It's a one way street because she entered into a committed, monogamous relationship with him. If she doesn't think she can happily abide by what he needs in a relationship, she's more than welcome to leave him.  

Is this even a real question though? I really struggle to imagine that if your partner cheated on you and said ""I don't consider cheating a big deal"", your reaction would just be ""okay, fair enough."""
261,"I mean I don’t necessarily think it’s a “fuck you.” It’s basically “we want to get married in a beautiful place, and if seeing us get married/taking a vacation is worth it to you, you can come.” For some people, that’s worth it. For others, it’s not. And that’s okay. But people aren’t obligated to have a local wedding for the sake of their family and friends. Their friends and family aren’t getting married. The couple is."
262,"God, he confessed the moment he had you locked down. What a POS."
263,"To me it depends on the time you spend on video games, if it’s more than 3 hours a day, maybe she feels lonely and she feels like you don’t give her enough attention. If that’s not the case, well that’s kind of mean. Playing video games makes you happy, why should you stop? Not everything we do has  to be productive."
264,"It doesn't seem like she doesn't get it from what you said. She understands, acknowledges it, then asks for you to spend the extra money anyway. How shitty are these friends you're worried the other two will drop out of a fully funded flight just because you won't shell out almost double for a new addition's plane ticket? Look at your life, look at your friends, really reflect on what you're doing with these people."
265,"If you pay the bill and are over 18, your parents have no right to check your phone. Change the passcode- when they ask for it, tell them that it's illegal for them to be invading your privacy at this age "
266,"Hey, hear me out, please.

I, a woman, am much like your partner. I don't particularly care about marriage. Part of not caring about it means that if someone I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with told me it was important to them, I'd do it. 

To me, marriage won't change any aspect of my relationship if I'm already with someone I've decided I want to grow old with. (I should probably mention I don't intend to have children, so that simplifies things.) But if it was important to that person that was *that* important to me? Yeah, I'd marry them. 

Have you tried telling him you want to marry him in X time, instead of asking when he'll marry you?"
267,"Don’t feel bad for thinking about your career. At the end of the day, where would you rather be, police officer or some dude who helped this chick out once?"
268,"Honestly when she said he described himself as 'rational' over emotional that painted an extremely clear picture. Typically that means that others' emotions are founded on caprice and aren't worthy of concern, but his are worthy because he's only motivated by unshakeable logick."
269,She probably sees fixing things as a man's job and expected her bf to always come to her handyman rescue. She sounds like a brat.
270,Perhaps he’s using talking as a way to shut off the negative thoughts and feelings of loss that his home life has caused. He sounds insanely lonely. Maybe have your boss suggest to him that he see a therapist or a grief counselor?
271,"Tell him that if he thinks you owe something, have them come for it in small claims court.

The truth is, they have zero legs to stand on. So they never will.

I can't for the life of me figure out why you are still in this relationship."
272,"&gt; I don’t blame her. I gained a lot of weight because of some medical issues and lost my hair all in the last two years. I don’t like it anymore than she does, but there’s nothing I can do about it.... I already hate myself


It sounds like you are trying to force your wife to admit to a loss of sexual attraction in order to use her to ""punish"" yourself. 


Let me ask you this: why is it important to you that she says something that will hurt her, that will hurt you, and that will solve exactly nothing? Why do you really need her to say ""I don't find you sexually attractive anymore""? Why do you need to hear her say that?


Women, I believe more than men, need the mental/emotional attraction more than the physical. Yes, physical matters. But the mental side matters just as much, if not more.


You've got a lot of negative emotions swirling around here, a lot of defeatism, and some bitterness. Now, this may all be totally valid - I don't know what's going on in your life. But I do know, just based on the way you talk about yourself here, I'd probably dry up faster than the Sahara too if that was the attitude I was living with on a daily basis. "
273,"&gt; “I don’t care about the number of pounds you’d gain but once you don’t look skinny anymore I’d have a problem”

"
274,"am a guy, but I'm inclined to agree with your BF. She likely had barely eaten in days, then dropped some tequila, saw you/him being all happy/couply and then had some more tequila. "
275,"Honestly, I didn’t want to scare you because this can all be pretty rattling. I’ve been a women’s sexual assault advocate for 3 years (for college aged women) and I usually wait for them to acknowledge what’s happening to really start using trigger words. You didn’t “give in”- you were put in an awful situation and your fear was  taken advantage of. Maybe speak to an Aunt or someone you trust first? That way you can both approach your mother together. I know it can be frightening but know you’re not alone and this is the right thing to do. You deserve a safe space. Pull your Mom aside, let her know what’s going on and how you feel. Baby steps but please go to a friend’s house or something! You don’t deserve this. "
276,"&gt; I don’t want to lie and take the blame, but I don’t want to just put her like that.

She doesn't seem to have a problem doing the same thing to you.

Frankly, what she did was gutless and cowardly.  Rather than just be straight up about her decision to live her life as she wants as an adult, she acted like a child who got caught with her hand in the cookie jar and lied to save herself.  That's a crap way to treat a partner."
277,I have the biggest justice hard-on right now.
278,"The next time she does that, say ""Erica, you know those were sexual assaults and I find it revolting that you keep telling people about my 'wild past' like it wasn't me being molested as a child."" You may need to practice, and it may be really hard to say, but it's worth it to stand up for yourself, and for every other person in the room who was assaulted.

Erica is a jerk, and she's trying to make herself look good by comparison somehow. Don't let it pass. Be No Fun Nancy about this. And think about whether you and Erica are really friends. I think she's not acting much like someone who cares about you."
279,"no way. Now there's two Buckys. THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND

282,"His post makes it kind of clear he is flexible. He takes breaks early for walks for example. He needs to be extremely rigid for a long time and tell her every time she interrupts him that he can’t do it. Every. Single. Time. 

She knows he can do these things because he has been doing them. "
283,I guess you guys are right. Even my mom would ask me “i haven’t seen you with flowers or anything.” My mom thinks its strange and would probably thing it’s really strange when she finds out I’m the one buying gifts all the time
284,If she can’t even protect her own daughters from a man she knows is a creep I unfortunately wouldn’t expect her to do anything regarding your situation. You need to find a new job.

287,"Leave him a dime and a note, as well. ""She wasn't a dime so I left you one.""

Just to let him know you *really* know."
288,"Yep I’d phrase like “oh my god, honey, you’ll never believe what happened today! Dylan called me and told me that he thinks that Flora is having an affair and you’re the main suspect. I told him that’s ridiculous, and to not push his marital insecurities onto us.” 

And see where the conversation goes from there. "
289,"Lawyer here. Absolutely in no circumstances should OP recommend that he get a physical or seek any medical attention, ESPECIALLY if you’re considering firing him. That could open up a world of legal liability with the ADA even if the guy turns out not to be disabled. "
290,"&gt; how many times has he told her in the morning or the night before, ""Hey, I'll do dinner/walk the dog/clean the living room tonight when I get home, so don't worry about that!""?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My bet is he's not doing that frequently, or this wouldn't be an issue.

Or he did say this but failed to follow through.  I've heard a zillion times in my house, ""Oh, I'll take care of X"" only to find at 9pm that it's still not done.  And after this happens again and again and again, eventually you learn that if you don't do it, it doesn't get done.  So might as well do it early and get it out of the way, you know?"
291,"""Your existence mattered more to this stranger than it did to your boyfriend.""

OP, the reason you get a bad feeling when he goes out to drink with 'the boys' is because deep down, you knew there was something wrong. This isn't the first time this has happened and it's likely not the last. You are worth more than this relationship."
292,"I don't really think there's anything confusing about what's going on. She met somebody else, she broke up with you to date him. It sucks. You should go no contact."
293,"Well, the most important thing is that you two actually agree on a timeline for engagement. Did you actually confirm he would propose PRIOR to the move in October, and more specifically PRIOR to the notice you gave?

Sounds like you two need to have a solid conversation on deadlines, and ring types if you haven't yet. "
294,"Be real, how would you feel about your bf hanging out with his ex fuck buddy alone once a week"
295,"I don't think you're crazy, but I can see his point of view. Usually when you give someone who's over-protective or over-intrusive a technological way to surveil you, then the surveillance escalates.

So it's a fairly rare family where the teenager gets technological surveillance, but not abusive questioning about every detour they take on the walk home, or every friend they talk to, and also rare is being able to step down the surveillance when you're of an age where it's normal to have more freedom. When you go to college, are you expecting that you'll get questioned every day about where you spent the evening?

The fact that the wrist band is lockable, is an extra step into icky territory, because it's assuming that you might be evasive, rather than trusting you to let it report location accurately.

The more usual deal is the cellphone with ""find my phone"" or other such tracking on, and the parents take away the phone and crank in the curfew, if you don't leave tracking on and answer promptly. That can be scaled back a little more gracefully - once you're at college, not answering becomes a possible option, and you can make a more normal excuse about it."
296,And they started dating when she was around 17 and he was 25. Women his own age would not deal with this crap.
297,"thanks, i didnt think about it but its a good idea to take some screenshots and save just incase she say i am lying or denies it. i think i will get out while shes at work or something, i still havent decided."
298,"Okay, I need clarification. Are you saying that your mother only has a few months to live, or that she still may live for years and that your husband isn't okay with you staying with her for more than a few months? Because those are two very different things. He should be perfectly willing to deal with you being gone for a few months to deal with end of life care for your mother, but if you're talking about an indefinite stay that could stretch on for several years, then I think it's entirely reasonable for him to consider that unacceptable. "
299,"I think you need to have an honest talk to your sister about online predators. Yeah, it may scare her but its better she's scared, aware, and alive, than ignorant. What if ends up meeting one of these guys who are pretending they're kids? What if she getstaken by one if she gives her home address, or her school info? 

Clearly your parents are going to allow her to continue to be online unmonitored so she needs to be smart. When I was first online at 12 my first experience was a disgusting old man who basically cybered with me. I didnt know how to tell him to stop, I was scared, and I felt bad being rude. So I gave short responses, and just hoped he'd go away eventually. The next time I was online he messaged me again immedately, and I just didnt respond, and learned how to block him. Then when I was 13 this man who was 36 convinced me the only way to make his cancer better was to give him my virgintiy, and tried to push me to meet him. I called my best friend crying not knowing what to do. Yes, I was that naive. And I almost did meet him which is the crazy part. What would have happened to me? I may have not come out of that alive. 

My point is if your sister is going to be online she needs to know what the deal is. She needs to see articles about what happens to kids like her, and needs to be aware of what online safety is. She needs to know that men your dads age can be bad people, and will take little girls and do bad things to them. She needs to know to not talk to people and give out her info, and that if she is uncomfortable she can talk to you. Its very important she's got some tools to defend herself, because without them its terrifying to think of what could happen to her. "
300,"Yes, you are completely overreacting. You just wrote pages’ worth of venting about how your BF isn’t attractive (to most people) but how hurt you are that he commented that neither of you are the world’s most attractive people.

I’m a woman who is part of that bottom 10% you mention — too ugly to ever have had a date, let alone a BF. Insecure women of average attractiveness are a perpetual thorn in my side — you are attractive enough to have a BF (and presumably to not face other types of discrimination - jobs, healthcare, etc - on the basis of your appearance, and you’re upset that your BF doesn’t won’t maintain some illusion that you’re in the top 1% of hotness? You’re actually questioning your relationship over *this*? You have no idea how good you have it."
301,"Said kindly ""Sorry, friend, it's Couple Time tonight - we'll see you Wednesday!"" (Or whenever you next want to hang.) or ""Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding - we meant that we were heading home, it wasn't an invitation!""

You need a polite spine and the ability to be a broken record with boundary pushers."
302,"Could you elaborate on how nothing happened, yet she almost slept with this guy. Because if that's her mindset then you have all sorts of reasons not to trust her even without the blatant disrespect if her sneaking this guy in to your home and lives.

There are people so self centered that to them it's not cheating if they didn't get exactly what they wanted or received a highly specific thing. No penetration,not cheating, no oral, not cheating and one I've seen a few times on this subject. I didn't get off so it's not cheating or that bad."
303,"„Otherwise I would have to return to working in the office, which means I will get a lot less time to spend with you and our daughter and I can’t see you both in my lunch break.“ "
304,"My grandparents celebrated 60 years a couple of years ago. They invited us all to a lovely dinner at a golf club. My grandfather held a speach about their marriage that made us all cry. They invited us. They paid for it.

Honestly, if you can't afford a big whatever it is don't have it. Easy. "
305,That'll only work if the SO is on her side.
306,"I was gonna say, two months and he’s already looking for the exit?

This woman uprooted her *whole life*, moved to a new country, has no friends nearby and is coming to terms with the final nail in the coffin on her relationship with her family. That’s a goddamn LOT. 

Jesus, OP. Do you even know if the counselors available are any good? They can vary wildly by country/region and mental illness still isn’t an accepted “thing” in many countries. I don’t know where you are, obviously, but maybe do a little research and have some patience with this woman. A couple months of clothes on the floor is not enough to dump someone who just gave up everything for you. "
307,"Tell your ex. This isn’t to protect him at all. He may be a piece of shit, but if he goes around without knowing, then there are other innocent women out there who might get it from him. If you tell him and he gets it taken care of, then at least you have protected them."
308,"I agree, but I'm not actually sure it's the girl who has been sexually abused by an adult. I hope OP doesn't get defensive about this, but I am very, very, very suspicious that the husband has been exposing the son to sexual material and encouraging this. 

Also the fact that it took place in their home... I would definitely want to know if the husband encouraged this to happen."
309,"I think part of this is considering whether this person is being inconsiderate, and also being comfortable speaking up for yourself.


If there is something you're attending, say: ""We need to leave in five minutes to get to X on time. Do you want to have that boxed up?""


Forget for a moment that it makes you feel awkward - how do they respond? Do they seem to mind when you reminder them like that?


&gt;I honestly hate feeling like I have to manage someone to get places on time. 


For what it's worth, this is a totally fair/valid thing. It's a form of emotional labor. BUT, every person will have their faults. No person is going to come without some kind of quirk you'll have to manage. How serious is this to you?


Side note: I notice you are using they/their pronouns. I am using she/her because you have 26F in the title. If you'd prefer I switch, I will edit my responses. 


Edit: changed pronouns"
310,Could your bf just let them know that you suffered a lot of trauma as a child and taking pictures is still a huge trigger? He could convey how serious it is without being specific? Would that maybe work?
311,"Rpers are all about pushing dominance in their romantic relationships.  It isn't necessarily about the kid not being his (except on a principle thing of ""I need a guarantee because all women are hos"") but \*ambushing\* her out of the blue and demanding a test puts her on the defensive, keeps her walking on eggshells.  Keep your woman down and under your thumb.  Tell her she needs to lose the baby fat faster, tell her about the new hot girl at work, etc etc."
312,"4 months together, 22 years old and a pressuring OP in public with her friends around?

 Comments like “Talk to him, you’re gonna get through this” are underreacring. This is highly manipulative and they are both so young, especially OP’s BF. I’m also 22 and never have I ever seen a guy in my age ready for marriage, especially after 4 months of dating. The pushy manipulative proposal is a perfect example.

OP, you can back out if you need to do so. Your friends’ opinions are not important there. This is your choice, not theirs. It will affect you long-term, not them. You said that backing out will hurt your BF’s feelings. Did he care about hurting yours when he proposed to you in a public event with your friends around to push you into saying “yes”? No sane or mature person would do this after 4 months. Choose which one he is (multiple choices allowed)."
313,"Sometimes you have to be realistic. You can be honest with her and say 'You know we don't approve of him, he is abusive and this is toxic, but you dating him takes a huge toll on everyone that cares about you as well. He is someone destructive who hurts everyone associated with you and for my own happiness I can no longer be associated with him. I hope you can also finally break free of him as well, you don't deserve this.'

This isn't an ultimatum. It isn't demanding she do anything. This is the reality that you find the relationship tiring and for your own peace of mind and wellbeing you are going to keep your distance from him.

Watching a friend repeatedly throw themselves against the jagged rocks of a broken relationship is hard. Eventually you realise there really isn't anything you can do, that you are destroying yourself just being present if not outright enabling. At what point do you just say no more and move on? Maybe this is that time. "
314,"I think there's also some weird sexism stuff, or at a minimum some gender-based anxiety, happening here. The bedroom thing in particular. Mom being gone probably makes him fear he won't do right by a daughter, plus he also seems to have some old fashioned ideas about men and women. Combined, this means he is distancing himself. "
315,"I guess the question becomes, does OP take a proactive approach to sharing/offering to do chores?  If OP just tells their partner they are willing to help in generalities, but their partner needs more structure then it's on OP to state what they will do and when they will do it so their partner isn't worried about doing it.  And then actually following through with what they stated they will accomplish. "
316,"""Hey Laura, someone is offering up a VIP ticket but I feel weird taking it as you've already done me a solid, is it okay with you?""

Some people might be offended, others wouldn't care... so ask."
317,"Leave it unsaid. 

Trying to dishonestly backpedal it isn’t going to accomplish anything useful.

He probably suspects that there was some truth in it, but why is that bad? Because it lets him know that you like him? Trying to take it back suggests that you don’t view him in that way. That sounds worse."
318,"Been here, done this.  Lost all respect for my ex.  Lost all inclination to desire to speak or be in the same room.  Just got to a point mentally where I didnt want to be there anymore.  Had to make a decision whether I wanted to work this out or not.  I chose to not.

I heard a lot of chatter from her about broken promises and this and that.  What I never once heard was anything around love.  Needs, wants, and desires?  A lot.  Love?  Not once.

A lot of the counseling I got was about my kids.  Dont you want to try to work it out for your kids?   My conclusion was no.  No, I do not wish to continue modeling this horrible, one sided, relationship in which I am no longer a willing participant.   The relationship had become like the scene from Office Space where the guy says 

&gt; every single day I am a little bit unhappier than the day before.  Which means every day that you see me is worse than the day before.  It is literally the worst day of my life, every day.

I refuse to continue modeling a poor relationship in front of my kids.  I moved on and found someone.  I have much better knowledge about who I am and what I want and what I am willing to work on, as does my new SO.  

There is better out there.  

I look back and cannot understand what was going through my mind back then. How did I ever think that person was decent or worth my time.

"
319,"When she says stuff like this, ""No actually it doesn't. It comes from your desire to be right. If I came to your home and talked as you did, you'd have lost your shit by now.""

IF you want to be petty and take the gloves off, add on, ""And in my case I would be right.""

But yeah stop inviting her ignorant ass over."
320,"I feel you. My mom planned out my 18th according to how she would've planned hers, had she gotten one :/ Didn't want to have it but enjoyed it overall. At least if you get this party with your relatives coming, you might get some gifts and money and you can spend that throwing a smaller party with your friends!"
321,"\&gt; I really need him to grow up. It's to the point I dread any social gathering involving booze because 80&amp;#37; of the time something like this happens.

Your boyfriend sounds like an alcoholic asshole.  If he's drinking to the point of blacking out almost every time he's drinking that's a huge red flag  If he becomes violent almost every time he blacks out from drinking, that's a huge red flag.  If he's cursing at your 8-year old cousin over a game of Go Fish, that's a red flag.  He's not going to magically change overnight into something he isn't just because you want him to.  This person is who he is and he's not going to just grow out of this.  If he keeps treating his friends the way you described they are going to ditch him as a friend sooner or later and you're going to be the one stuck with him and dealing with the fallout.  You should probably get out of this relationship before he turns that anger and violence towards you.  "
322,"Your husband should be the one to deal with his mom, but i'm concerned that he got upset *with you* over this. When people are keeping a pregnancy secret, women often have to lie about why they aren't drinking, so you did what you had to do, and to me it was completely innocent. While saying you were hungover may not have been the ""best"" option, it was a convenient excuse that didn't lead people to question you. If your husband should be mad at anyone, it should be his mom for not believing him when he said you weren't drinking and that it was just a cover, and for being so quick to judge you."
323,"\+1 to make a plan to GTFO, +1 to getting some therapy

At 16, you should be old enough to get a part-time job; if you think you can balance this with school, I would highly encourage you to do this. Having some savings will allow you to do things like put down a deposit on a rental (once you're able to move out), or to buy a car all on your own. *Do not* let your dad bully you into handing over any portion of your money; until you are 18, he owes you a roof over your head, food to eat, and clothes on your back. You owe him *nothing*.

Regarding therapy; you seem to have a good head on your shoulders, despite your dad's abuse, so you may not feel therapy is a priority. This is okay. Therapy is very much designed to help people with the following issues:

* I am having Feelings and I don't know why
* I am having Feelings and I wish I wasn't, but I don't know how to get them to go away
* I find myself repeating a behavior and I don't know how to stop

So although you might feel like you don't need therapy *right this minute*, definitely be on the lookout for the above situations. Often the damage from growing up in a violent household doesn't necessarily present itself right away, and only really shows up a couple years after you've gotten out."
324,"This guy told OP her desire to wait to try to get pregnant until after he was done with grad school was ""ridiculous and meant that [OP] wasn't a supportive partner."" How is calling her ""unsupportive"" here *not* painting her to be the bad guy?"
325,"Your friend's boyfriend was in the wrong. I understand that your boyfriend was being antagonistic but he didn't make the altercation physical. That's on Adam. 

Your friend has no right to dictate to you that you should dump your boyfriend - that is your decision alone. However, if I was you, I would be having a conversation with my boyfriend asking him why he had been so antagonistic towards Adam. Adam may have been lying (his strong reaction supports this) but your boyfriend could have handled it differently. "
326,"I actually do have a boyfriend, I just haven't been spreading it to people at work since they have a tendency to be UBER nosy.  I'm looking at ""Chris"" right now and he hasn't said one wrong word to me since we talked."
327,"That's what set it off for me. I was pretending to be asleep one night during one of her ramblings when I started to get suspicious her state of mind was changing. She just kept talking l, acknowledged that I was asleep but had a full blown convo with me in her head but out loud. "
328,"I got him a cute neck tie and cuff set and I get him little things everytime our “monthsary” comes up. He said those things I get him ($30 hats, $40 ties etc.) are cheap

331,"If you really are friends with Zack then you need to start acting like one. How is Ana a good person exactly? It seems like she's doing everything she can to make Zacks life miserable. Stop telling her about every group hangout, kick her out if she comes around uninvited. Hang out with him one-on-one a little and  support him. I personally would also tell him, just because he needs to know what kind of friend this other guy is. 

They could have fucked somewhere else. There's no excuse for that."
332,"You’re not wrong at all. He hasn’t brought up marriage, which is your prerequisite for moving in together. It also seems to me as though he isn’t taking your ‘no’ seriously, and hoping to weasel his way by claiming he doesn’t have another choice. Stick to your decision. If you let him move in before you’re ready, you’ll resent him. "
333,"I agree. Does your wife not see how unfair it was to cut one son out of the inheritance completely? I would focus on that angle with her. It’s not rightfully your money. It may be legally your money, but not ethically or morally. How would she feel if her parents left everything to her sibling and cut her out?"
334,i agree but don't punish yourself to punish someone else. don't let her take away those real feelings you had towards those creations you made. but yeah sorry bout the family. sucks.

337,"His demands are pretty unreasonable, but it's more concerning that the way he's addressing the situation is to make demands, accuse you of having sinister ulterior motives, and issue ultimatums rather than try to have a productive conversation. If you cave on this issue, I suspect that he will find something else to be mad about and the level of control he wants will only increase. "
338,This is wonderful. I fully throw my vote in for “this is how you should dump him OP”. 
339,"Okay, for starters, everybody goes through this awkward ""WHAT DO I DO?"" thing in a relationship, you're just going through it a little later than average. That's ok. What you're experiencing is normal and like with anything new, you'll get the hang of it with time and experience. Now that said...

&gt;but I don't feel comfortable sharing things with him because he feels judgmental at times

&gt;He just wants me to be myself, but I feel like ""myself"" is not what he wants.

It sort of sounds like you might not be in the right relationship if you can't share who you are without facing harsh judgement."

343,"That's some cold hard truth. Turning thirty did play a role in me drawing the line and asking her to leave. But I definitely need to demand better for myself, as you put it. Thank you."
344,"So if I'm understanding this correctly, one of your daughter's primary caregivers is repeatedly telling her stories that leave her shaking in terror, despite knowing exactly how it affects her?

This is psychological abuse. OP, I know that is unpleasant to hear, but please, for your child's sake, hear me out. Your husband is abusing your daughter.  I don't know how purposeful he is about it, because maybe she's asking for these stories, or doesn't seem terrified right after he tells them, but *her reactions later should be enough to make him stop permanently.* It is NOT NORMAL for a parent to continue telling stories that make their children wake up screaming. Most parents go way out of their way to protect their children from exposure to frightening things.

Your daughter needs your protection. That's the absolute first thing that needs to happen, before counseling with him, before talking it out- your priority must be her protection. You need to get in that room and stop the stories before they happen. If it comes to it, camp out in her doorway with the baby until he has to go to work. IT'S THAT SERIOUS. If he was hitting her in the face every night before he left for work, would you intervene? Of course you would. This is a different kind of abuse, but it is abuse nonetheless, and she needs your help.

Secondly, you need to consider how much you value this relationship, because the reality is, your husband is terrorizing your daughter, refusing to listen to you and take the very simple step of not telling her scary stories, and then leaving you to deal with the repercussions. These are huge red flags. I would, at the very least, demand that he go to counseling. These things are unacceptable. Please don't accept them."
345,"Omg! When I was younger I had nightmares that there was snakes in my bed - I grew up in rural Australia so probably a legit fear. So my Dad would come in and kill them with what I thought was fly spray (it was probably any number of household aerosols, thinking about it) and I'd be right. So cute and worked on me! "
346,"I was in your bf's spot. My girl, as much as I love her, would tempt a saint to violence. She's a bit worse than your bf's daughter. They're just insane at that age. My bf felt as you do, ""why can't you fix this?"" It caused so. much. strife in our house! I felt defensive because she was an angel as a young child so I felt this was my fault, my bf was judgemental, and the world thought she must have had a terrible life to be such a nut. 

I had to kick her out. I came here to cry, got REALLY harsh wake up calls before the mods decided I didn't deserve help from this sub (they sent me to the parenting sub for a damn 18yo), and then I took the advice and did it. Well, my daughter gave me an opportunity to do it by acting the fool again, but I did it. 

My entire world crumpled, I still cry all the time, but I now see that my kid is going to work, starting to solve her problems, and is slowwwwwwly starting to grow up. It's not the college and sports life I thought she'd have, but it's a life and not jail or dead. The key thing was just what you said - she did it as long as she could get away with it. "

357,"It would take a lot for me to forgive this, she knew what she was doing. She knew there would be no way you would ever even meet this guy let alone invite him to your home. If the roles were reversed and it was you bringing a woman around you had an almost affair with, this sub would be tearing you apart. 

By the way, I'd be suspicious they aren't having an affair. I had a friend once who became a couples friend with his affair partners spouse just so he could spend more time with her. "
358,"I don't know how things work where you live, but I'd go to the police station and talk to one of the officers about the best way to handle it.  Maybe your friend would wake up if a cop shows up at his door to tell him that they've had a couple of complaints about him driving drunk and that they're going to be watching for him.

If that doesn't work, they by all means, turn his ass in before he kills himself or more likely, some innocent people in another car."

361,"Honestly, I feel you guys are rushing into things way too fast and you have some serious issues that aren't going to magically go away. First, sexual incompatibility is 100% a legit reason why adult relationships fall apart and you're in danger of ending up resenting this woman if things don't get better on the physical intimacy front. Go to /r/DeadBedrooms to see what your future could be like. 

You also don't seem to have an agreement on a life plan together and that's another red flag. 

Love is not all you need to make a relationship work and at the very least, I'd consider postponing the wedding and getting some premarital counseling before signing a legal contract with this woman. You guys have plenty of time to get married and you should work out the kinks first before tying the knot.

It is better to lose some money now on postponing a wedding then losing a ton of money later in a divorce. "
362,"&gt;the attention and the pressure from her parents messed with her head, and it's something she hasn't forgiven them for (although she does love them). When we had a child of our own she was determined to let her have a ''normal'' childhood

You've gone too far the other direction.

&gt;We know that she has a boyfriend, Scott \[15M\], and we stay out of what happens between them.  
&gt;  
&gt;we would never get involved in what happens between her and her boyfriend

Stop being so hands-off! I understand wanting to respect your daughter's independence, but she is FIFTEEN! Fifteens are not known for their great decision-making ability, so I'm astounded you so entirely left her and her boyfriend to their own devices and are *now* shocked its resulted in an **unwanted** pregnancy. 

&gt;That's something only she can decide.  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously the decision she makes will be hers alone  
&gt;  
&gt;The choice is hers alone

STOP making it hers alone! STOP treating your daughter like she's an adult who's fully empowered to make a decision that could affect the rest of her life. Jesus, you're treating her like she's some 19-year-old who's concerned about how an unintended pregnancy is going to impact her uni degree, or a 22 year-old who's concerned about balancing a baby with a budding career. She's not, she's FIFTEEN. She's a CHILD.

There are times when you need to treat your 15-year-old like a young adult, and times when you need to take the reigns. This is one of those times. By NO means am I saying you need to force her to have an abortion against her will, but you absolutely should outline it as the best option for her, in which she can continue her life as she has planned it.  Stop acting like the choices are as benign as deciding between university courses. You're acting like her carrying to term a pregnancy and raising a child is a foregone conclusion, and you'll just roll with the inconvenience. NO. Carrying this child to term will have HUGE emotional impacts on her for the rest of her life, *far* beyond whatever impact having an abortion will have.

Having a child, whether its' adopted or not, will essentially change her life completely and irrevocably. You honestly sound like you're ignoring this, and its absolutely negligent of you to act like all her options (abortion, adoption, parenthood) are weighted the same.

For the love of god, *start* acting like a responsible adult. Start encouraging her to strongly consider abortion. If she is resistant, then suggest adoption as an alternative. But actually step in and parent her!"
363,Tell her that if she wants to change the flight that is on her. You aren't her concierge. She's being ridiculous.
364,"This isn't COMPLICATED. He's just a loud selfish blow-hard asshole when he's drunk; and presumably pretty much one when sober, I'm guessing. What you do is not marry such a person, but given that you did, he needs to cut down his drinking and start apologising for his appalling behaviour. That's a good start, anyway. "
365,"This is a typical deflection technique.  You say to him something he has done to hurt you/upset you and he escalates it to be something ridiculous to draw the focus away from it.

The way to deal with it is to not reply""no no no thats not what I meant I meant.... "" and then downplay what he did, you need to instead say ""no, that's not what we are speaking about I asked you to not reveal personal financial information to other people without my permission which is a perfectly reasonable request"".

I would imagine he does this a lot....."
366,"This is a very common procedure for Korean people, who view plastic surgery very differently than Americans. It's considered almost as normal as makeup, which is also essentially a way to alter or enhance a person's appearance. 

That being said, I'm not a fan of that perspective on plastic surgery. Being Korean, I can say the culture has very different views on personal appearance (e.g., it's not completely uncommon for cis men to use makeup). It's not my cup of tea. However, I wouldn't say it's inherently bad. It's just a different culture. 

I would just be supportive, regardless of whether she decides to get the procedure or not. "
367," She has a lot of chutzpah asking you to cancel your birthday celebration so that she can go to someone else's birthday celebration.  Nope! You have plans already, so sorry.

370,"There's this double-edged sword with sex, imo. Guys (generally) don't last long enough for women to get off from penetration. On the other hand, if a guy lasts long enough, the sex can get a bit boring or painful.

375,"There's two big concerns here. First, you need therapy foryourself because whatever is going on, you aren't coping well at all. You need better and healthier coping skills. 

Secondly, it is super duper common for trying to conceive to tank your sex life. Some people will suggest that this may be because he doesn't really want a kid, but while this is possible it's common for problems to occur even in couples where both want kids. Knowing that you're trying to accomplish something while having sex can put immense pressure on someone that makes the sex less fun, can cause anxiety that impedes arousal, etc. He may have essentially formed a mental block with regard to sex. He may need individual therapy but couples counseling may be a good place to start here. In any case, it almost certainly isn't about you or how attractive you are."

The song thing though is a little concerning. If she's still ruining moments for him on the regular like this, and can't see his dog as a dog and not a reminder of her....might be some leftover feelings there. I would ask him about it and honestly, do some rethinking whether you want to be with a man who still has so much mental space reserved for an ex. You guys are new, and maybe he has baggage but the fact this relationship with his ex ended a couple years ago and things like this still happen is a red flag."

384,"So I had a shitty childhood riddled with neglect and abuse. I'm known amongst friends for being empathetic and considerate generally and I like their kids.

But I also put my foot in it all the time because my 'normal' is so abnormal it's like opposite land. I may be in therapy and doing well with my Complex PTSD but every week I discover something I thought was actually fine about my childhood was in fact horrific.

So I've told what I thought was a hilarious story about my mum repeatedly threatening to kill my pet rabbit if I misbehaved, asked a friend why she didn't use the fact her kid was in hospital to go on a mini break and talked about stuff I thought was everyday only to discover it made other people cry.

I just didn't have any frame of reference that good parents don't threat their kids' pets or abandon them in hospital like mine did. I also had no frame of reference that other people didn't know that some parents do that kind of stuff and get more upset by you saying it than it having actually happened.

It's like being divided by a common language. The 'normal' people speak British-English and I speak American-English and I have no idea suspenders mean a piece of raunchy underwear to them rather holding your trousers up or that fanny is your vagina not your butt. 

I'm accidentally insulting and shocking people but I have absolutely no idea why because I have no idea there's another version of my language. And the creeping realisation that I'm upsetting people and don't know why is triggering my childhood trauma where I don't understand why my parents treat me this way I don't think I deserve. 

And that trauma response makes it hard for me to relate when someone finally tells me about the other type of English because it threatens to crack the hard shell I've been using to hold myself together at a pace I'm not ready for. I've been in therapy for three years every single week and I still can't even articulate the shit I lived through so when it gets exploded into my face unexpectedly I just shut down and shrug and go 'I did it' because considering the difference opens a can of flesh eating worms.

Add in that I grew up in a totally different culture to the one I live in now during a literal civil war pre internet and pre cellphone and I honestly don't understand at times why a kid can't take the bus these days or needs to be helicoptered so much.

If you want to avoid awkward situations for you, offer to translate between the two languages. Be your friend's social guide and don't put her in a situation where she is the outsider again not understanding the social mores like the unkempt neglected kid she was where everyone else was raised by parents and you were raised by wolves.

She's doing the best she can by the sound of it but she needs parenting now. My partner and friends often have to tell me 'nope, that's not normal' or show me how to do something like be hugged. Children who are severely neglected aren't socialised young and have to play catch up later and it's hard work. 

People judge the shit out of you because they only see the surface roughness and not the polish you've practised or just how far you've come and it's super stressful to be around. I drank pretty heavily in my 20s to deal with it and to 'let' people blame it on me being a party girl rather than judge me for being abused and neglected and not one of them.

Second, six years to complete half of what your classmates did isn’t frugal. When will you finish? Six more years of part time work? That’s potentially eight years of lost full time earnings.

389,"I have been a telecommuter for 5 years and I manage a team of telecommuters. This makes me crazy. You need to let your wife know that working from home is a privilege.

If your wife wants to continue to see you an extra 3.5 hours a day, she needs to chill out. 

I know some telecommuters have a system to let their family know when they are available, but I honestly think that is silly. If it is normal work hours, I'm not available. Additionally, my husband and children can tell when I'm on a call. It's not rocket science. I will give them a heads up if I'm going to be on an especially important or long meeting, as a courtesy. If they really need me they can text me or slip me a note.

390,"I've actually read a bit about the primary differences between men and women in work (especially office and computer work). It's been about 10-15 years since I've read the article, but it said that men are much more willing to say they can do something and figure out how later (confidence in their ability to figure it out as they go) than women, and often exaggerate in interviews. Women are more likely to note their exact abilities, never ""lie"" and that this may be one thing that holds us back in male-centered workplaces.

I have done this myself, even though I'm a woman. I have agreed to do jobs where I still needed to learn some of the skills, especially if there was an orientation period or I had some time before the job started to learn things. I worked designing websites and later teaching how to do so without formal training (late 90s/early 2000s). And to a certain extent I have to continue doing this to advance. There is no training in management in my field, so I just had to sort of shrug and say I could do it because of X experience in the past the first time I applied for a supervisory position.

2 is a bigger issue.  You can't expect her to put the same value on ""cooking"" as you.  Not everyone enjoys cooking and there is nothing wrong with that.

You may think she is being strict, but she is being very fair (and to some, very lenient!).

As for your birth father. Your mother was telling you in fair detail how abusive he was towards her. She gave birth to you at 15 and the only ""age"" she gave you for him was ""a few years older"". Sounds like he was old enough to legally old enough to buy his own alcohol if he was drunk all of the time, putting him over age 21. At the very least he was over 18. Your father sexually abused your mother and likely tried to trap her, on top of all of his drug and alcohol abuse. She escaped so he wouldnt turn his abuse onto you when you were old enough. There is a high chance if he continued on this path, that he was jailed for being a sexual predator.

Believe me, I understand the time crunch.

Stop saying awful things to each other. I know you can't control him. Realize where you are headed, and take the initiative to not escalate. It isn't you talking, it isn't him talking. It's tiredness, stress, hunger, fatigue, all of those things. Walk away. Talk when you can be calm.

As far as books to work on the relationship, I'm partial to the 5 Love Languages. There's a little blurb online, but the book goes into it in detail. Try to get your husband to read it too, and engage you with it. It will require a little reading time, but acting on what it says doesn't necessarily take a lot of time.

You have 2 kids, surely your time is limited? Your house is a mess? Finances are tight? Why not spend your free time cleaning up the house or making things easier for YOUR PRGNANT WIFE? 

We only have one kid, but anytime my husband goes out while I watch the house at night, I am doing him a favor. A big solid. It should be something he needs for his sanity, not just a passing whim he had. He will be expected to return the favor. And he needs to discuss it with me first.

If this is the case, then you both have some responsibility to share. You mentioned you were clean **a couple months ago.** Between then and now you had unprotected sex, and since chlamydia can stay dormant for a while, there is a chance that you were responsible for passing it onto your boyfriend.   
If this is the case, then you need to both think about why you lied. I can completely understand that waiting for test results and limiting condom-less sex can be difficult for a couple exploring their new relationship, but it's not worth it. If this is truly the case, then you both were dishonest to one another, and you **didn't** get tested before you two slept together.  


**NOW IF I WAS MISTAKEN AND YOU DID GET TESTED BEFORE NEW BF...**  
Then yeah, this is on his head. It shows that he put his sexual satisfaction over your own safety. Getting a test is safe and easy and he really doesn\`t have any excuses.

If this is the case, you need to have a discussion about the problem as a whole, not just the one instance.

&gt; I am disappointed of him and horrified at BIL's behavior, and don't know what to do about it?

I'd suggest talking to your husband about it. About how you feel, about how he feels, etc. He may be doing this out of loyalty, he may be in shock and just acting on helping. You need to figure out if your moral value framework and your husband's align - this is a great time to figure that out. You also need to consider what to do about protecting your own child(ren)?

As for the posters splitting hairs about whether it's cheating or not, pedophilia or not - regardless of what words are used - it's a horrible, immoral thing to do. That you can decide is not compatible with your own moral framework and that protecting your daughter is paramount and decide not to have anything to do with him.

As for legal issues, you are not a court of law firstly - you can decide what you allow or not; and secondly found not guilty does not mean innocent (see OJ Simpson) as the ""statutory rape is OK until proven in a court of law"" posters are so busy arguing."

Sit him down and say “look, you’re right. I do need a hobby. But right now I spend X hours a week on chores. I need you to take X hours on so I can have some free time. How would you like to split up chores?”

It’s not a negotiation on whether or not he thinks chores are what suck up enough time so that you don’t have a hobby. He might try to spin it that way. Stay firm and tell him you need a partner. And a partner does chores. Why does he get dinner around his bike schedule? Why don’t you get dinner some nights based on when yoga is? You spend three hours commuting? He should spend some of that cleaning if he doesn’t have a similar commute.

He’s being an absolutely terrible friend and given that it sounds like you’re a very caring and generous person, you can do way better than having this jerk be in your inner circle.

456,"Nothing makes my vagina clamp shut like a bear trap faster than neediness.  If he sulks and pouts every time you close the bathroom door without inviting him in, this might be a fundamental incompatibility issue.  I honestly don't know how you've lived through 10 years of this, but it sounds like you're hitting your limit and now it's literally affecting your work, so it's time to deal with it directly.  

I suggest that you sit down with him, **not** at a time when you've butted heads over this issue, but when you're both calm and rational, and talk about it.  Tell him what you need, and how it makes you feel when he lays guilt on your shoulders.  When he says ""why don't you want to be with me"", tell him point blank that you're worried about him, that this level of co-dependence is not healthy, and that it's damaging your relationship and you need to do something about it before it's too late.  If he's not willing to listen to you or consider your feelings as well as his own, then you've got a real problem here.  "
457,"&gt;A. Do I just have to deal with this?

No...but it's not going to go the way you think. More on that later.

B. Is it ok to make my own meals on ""her"" nights?

Yes. You guys created this system of her night vs. your night -- you can just as easily dismantle that system and create one that works better for you. 

C. Is there a way to change her?

Read that again. You shouldn't be looking to change the person you plan on marrying. She doesn't like cooking. Some people don't. It can be a frustrating experience for some. So, I'm going to give you a chance to maybe reword or expand on what you mean by ""change her,"" but in general, no. Accept her as she is, or you're setting yourself up to resent her for not being what you want her to be. 

I do the vast majority of the cooking in my household. My husband can cook, but I genuinely enjoy it, so I handle the lion's share. I make our grocery lists and plan our meals with his input and based on what's on sale, in season, or I have a coupon for. And since I do most of the cooking, my husband usually puts food away and loads the dishwasher. It's a balance that works for us. 

You have to find that balance with your fiance. That might mean something like what we do, or it could mean something entirely different, but you have to work together as a team to address your problems. Come to a point of compromise that works for you."
458,"You said this girls a good friend to vent to, but then get upset your wife is venting to someone else? You also said that there were things you did to your wife a year ago that she's still upset over, so does she have a reason to not trust you?"
459,"Ultimately she wants to hold a little baby who she won't be around to help actually raise. She's asking you to take on a *lot* of work (and risk, if your marriage won't survive the hardship of a newborn), for the chance to hold a baby.

There are better ways for her connect to a future grandchild, even if she never gets to meet them. Write letters to her future grandchild, record video letters, put together a short booklet of family stories, etc. There are, sadly, many parents who have had to deal with this same issue of facing *not being there* for their children's future milestones, and the internet should help you come up with other ways to channel your MIL's love that doesn't require such a sacrifice from you."

463,"So, just a little advice on this type of woman.
It's not a good idea to drop your girlfriend for her.

If anything your girlfriend hasn't done anything wrong by you and certainly hasn't lead you on

Why is she so interested now?
It's because you are no longer a suitable back up plan if your taken.
Hell she might of enjoyed the attention she got  knowing how sweet you were on her, but now you've got someone new she can't feed off the attention boosting

If you dont like your girlfriend that much do her a favour and let her have someone who is completely smitten with her but mate dont be surprised if this chick thats waited and had plenty of chances doesn't stick it out with you 


There are some individuals that just simply get off on the challenge and the game involved in that much of a power play too

Pick your posion wisely, I suppose"
464,"Don't do it, man.  You should have bounced the moment she told you her real age.  Not only is she way too young, but started out by lying about it?  Yeah, don't walk, run the fuck away."
465,"Wtf.
Honestly, you should have mentioned something to him. It probably took him off guard the entire time you’re with him and you never mention that your family is black? This entire situation is WORTH talking about and mentioning, you can just say “Oh, btw i’m adopted, my parents are black.” END OF CONVERSATION unless you want to answer questions. Your boyfriend is a dumbass though, BOTH of you are at fault. He shouldn’t give a flying shit, ask questions,  or make a huge deal out of it but he did. You should’ve mentioned that shit and the PTSD shit. 

Both dumbasses.

Really burying the lede here, dude. It's not typical for a couple in their mid twenties to take a SEVEN MONTH sabbatical from fucking. "
472,"Yeah, that's the kind of thing that screams 'I have a developing mental illness' rather than 'I lack social graces'."
473,"This is deceptive. She's lied by omission.

I wouldn't trust her."
474,"I don’t think your dad knows how to handle this situation. Do you have any female relatives you can talk to? An aunt or grandmother? You can also try talking to him, tell him you’re still his child and still need him to look after you."

476,"Between this, the original post and your other comment I have lost track of how many times I muttered ""What the fuck?"" 

Honestly at his age I don't think he can really be fixed from this. You should probably just cut your losses and find someone that is not a loon. Go back to school like you wanted and don't put your life on hold any-longer for him. If you already getting depressed and stressed from him holding up your life plans after a few months imagine how bad it would be if you actually married him. He is this damn indecisive and bluntly underdeveloped emotionally, why change your plans to meet his (which he will probably just change again on a whim) "
477,"Maybe, but there are Cubans of many races, including white. Latino is not a race. "
478,"If all that therapist did was advise you to let it go, they're not very good at their job.

What has your husband does to help you let it go? Did he apologize after he came clean? Has he asked what he can do to make it up to you and help you feel secure again? Or is he just trying to gloss over it all so he doesn't have to feel any discomfort? "
479,"I don’t think it matters. You’re a reasonable person, she clearly isn’t. I don’t think the letter could be used to cause you harm in any way. But she could twist words, use it as ‘proof’ to family that you’re whatever she wants to call you.  I just doubt the letter will be read and she’ll say anything other than ‘I’m the injured party in all this’ which in my experience is very frustrating."
480,"You want your house to yourself for awhile. Be firm on that. You worked hard and saved to earn it. Don't let his laziness or cheapness guilt you into it. You have your own timeline, don't compare yourself to others. Plus this would change up the power dynamic in still a fairly new relationship. Be firm and tell him you are done discussing this and that your mind has been made. Tell him he is disrespecting your feelings by continuing to drag his feet and bring this up. "
481,"This isnt about you anymore, I fear. Your friend is enjoying the attention but still trying to play the good friend card, I would simply ignore it. Once you voiced your discomfort at her little scheme she should've listened to you.

482,"""I find that discussing work in progress really interferes with my flow - but I'd love you to read a later draft"""
483,"&gt; Last year the gf and I met in person and it didn't go over well (in fact, police ended up being involved because of the way she acted towards me, and she was physically rough with my daughter). 

&gt; Since then his gf has been acting up, getting upset over the length of my phone calls with my daughter, attempting to cut out our communication with her all together, coaching my daughter with what to say

This would have me seeking full custody, personally. Keeping the girl away from unstable, manipulative, violent people and a father who is either unwilling or unable to protect her is hardly a punishment imo. "
484,"Wow, I did not know so many women shared the same frustration. I literally broke up with my boyfriend because he was so lazy and I was so stressed preparing for exams and doing all the chores. He just stood there watching me clean the floor and that was the last straw. I am not his maid."
485,"This is abusive behavior. It's beyond ridiculous and beyond what any normal person would do. You need to get out of the relationship, because it's only going to get worse. 

Also, turn it around and read what you wrote from the perspective of a female dealing with a male. You'd be horrified and afraid of what he's going to do to her if it continues. It should horrify you in your situation, too."
486,"Lmao ""monogonormative,"" Poly is completely irrelevant when the bf is clearly monogamous as outlined by the fact that he explicitly told her kissing other girls wasn't okay. If she wants to be poly, she can date someone who is poly or is okay with her being poly. But she broke her bf's trust, and no matter what kind of relationship dynamic you have, that is never okay."
487,I think that's what I am going to do. I texted an old HS friend he has never seen pics of to ask if I could use hers for my profile...
488,"You are not ready for marriage if you can’t sit and talk about marriage. What the actual fuck, you’re going to leave the guy of your dreams before talking to him about it??!! Sit down and have an adult conversation about what both of you want. At the very least if it doesn’t line up you can leave knowing you’ve done everything possible."
489,"But she isn’t saying that TO him, so it really isn’t the same"
490,"&gt;I told him that he is not remotely engaged in my subject and I understand why. It’s not his passion, but I’m fine with that. 

I would imagine that this factors into how you feel, because you don't have someone in your field either, but you'd never say this to him. I also think that him following you during that first altercation worsened things because instead of giving you time, he just doubled down on everything and now he won't work with you on it. 

I think you're right to want to go to counselling. Telling your new wife that you feel someone would be 'a better fit' is a pretty big screw-up, I'm not sure why some people are rushing to minimize it as something 'small'. That's not small at all. 'I'm sorry but you took it the wrong way' isn't even an apology, it's flipping the situation and putting the blame on you rather than acknowledging that he screwed up. 

I wouldn't feel bad for insisting on marriage counselling. I will say that maybe you brought out the word 'separation' pretty quickly, but it's also pretty clear that for you this really shook the foundations of your marriage and if that's really how you *feel* - that you'd want to separate if this isn't fixed - then it was vital that you convey this to him. Maybe tell him that. 

I hope that he listens to you and accepts some responsibility for this issue rather than deflecting. "
491,"Nope. No. This is *not* acceptable behavior. You've made your boundary clear and he continues to try to cross it. 

Either you two are incompatible or he needs to stop."
492,"There’s no “trying” in this situation.  Run as fast as you can.  I promise all of his negative dangerous behaviors will get worse.  If any positive attributes remain, they will not outweigh the abuse he’s dishing out.
There are no maybes and no trying here.  He will definitely get worse.  He’s a classic abuser.
Have you discussed this with your family or friends?  I suspect he may try to turn you away or isolate you from any support system you have in place. 
Also, get into therapy ASAP.  
Professionally I’ve known hundreds of people (a few personally, as well) who sound just like you and it never turns out well for the abused person.  In some cases, it ends tragically.  
You seem genuinely sweet and caring.  Please get help and get out.  You deserve better.

494,"Please listen to this, OP.

I'm married, and my husband is totally on board with the idea that we should share the household responsibilities and has always believed that. He in no way wants to put all that burden on me. And STILL, he grew up in a family with traditional gender roles and has actually had to learn (/is still learning) how to truly take on those responsibilities in a way where I don't have to tell him what to do. (And we don't even have kids!)

This is a guy who wants to equally participate in household life and responsibilities, and it's still frequently a struggle. How much harder will it be for you, when your future husband is actively telling you he has no interest in equal participation in childrearing or household responsibilities?"
495,"Honestly, this guy sounds like a nightmare. Look up love bombing, and the circle of abuse. You seem to be dismissing your very real concerns because you have anxiety, but you should trust yourself and get out now."

497,"&gt; Latino is not a race.

498,"“Win” was my husband’s word and she would absolutely run over us if she could. She was 10 at the time and it was a power play. We were having difficulty getting her to eat dinner. She’d refuse to eat when food was on the table, then an hour later she’d complain about being hungry so her dad would cook what she asked for.  One night she and my husband went through a few rounds of this. She didn’t eat what I’d cooked, then was hungry later and asked for pizza so he made it for her, but then she didn’t want that, she wanted pasta. He made that but she changed her mind and wanted soup. Even he agreed that was ridiculous but he figures as long as she’s eating relatively health food (which she’s drawn to) then what’s the big deal. I see it as straight up manipulative because she knows he will drop whatever he’s doing to cook her something. She also knows she can blow off her bedtime if she tells her dad she’s hungry. So in an effort to solve this problem, we decided to plan out dinners at the beginning of the week. We all agree to the menu. We each get a day of exactly what we want and then four days of compromise meals, but nothing on anyone’s “won’t eat” list. So the spaghetti and meatballs dinner was day three, I think, a compromise meal. She decided even before it was served that she didn’t want it. We pointed out the white board with the menu, reminded her that she agreed to this, but she insisted she wasn’t hungry. However she later said she wanted the day four meal instead, so I think that’s what was really going on. Anyway, I stuck to my guns and told her this was the only meal she was getting that night, leading to the meatball standoff. 

I feel like it was important to establish who gets to make final decisions in our house. In general I take her preferences in mind whenever a decision needs to be made, but when push comes to shove, I’m the parent and the responsibility is mine. As far as dinner goes, she was involved in menu planning so it wasn’t like she was being forced to eat something she hated. The menu planning works well for us now and she eats the spaghetti and meatballs just fine when it comes up in rotation. I don’t agree with a parenting style that includes kids as equals with their parents. They’re not equals and the kid needs to understand that. It’s not fun to be the “no means no” parent and it’s definitely not easy, but it’s important imo. There have been times when my kid has made a well thought out counter argument to my “no” and she’s changed my mind, but she knows that just saying “pleeeeease” never works. 

Btw when she was nine she made a really impressive presentation on why we should adopt a brother for her. She found a website with kids in our state awaiting adoption, looked through their profiles, picked one a year younger than her who she thought would be a good brother, found a solid but inexpensive bunk bed on Walmart’s website, came up with a list of things she would give up or share with a brother then prepared a little speech on why it was a fantastic idea. It was detailed and truly impressive, but we had to say no :( The girl has skills. "
499,"&gt; By then, she’s already done any other stuff that needed to be done

Except for the laundry, apparently. 
Look you can't just throw your hands up and say well, you didn't tell me to do anything, and all the things I need are already done so I guess I'll watch tv. You could've done that laundry. ""I'd rather she does less"" is kind of a weird way of making it her fault. You can just tell her ""I'll take care of dinner tonight"" or ""I'll walk the dog when I get home"" or make a chore chart. Unless she has insane standards of cleanliness I don't see why you can't step up and do your part."
500,"""I don't have the \*time\* to explain my job to you, ugh, you just have to listen and understand!""

He should be THANKFUL that his wife is interested enough to ask questions. A lot of married couples hardly talk about work or aren't interested that much."
501,"Because best believe that when he finds a girl he does think is good enough for him, *he'll* surely be the one keen to introduce her to his friends and family, see her as often as possible and show her off on social media.

&gt;Then he just throws it away in a second

Oh girl, I know you can't see it yet but he's done you the *biggest* favour. When you find a man who actually cares about you, you'll look back in shock at what you tolerated and be thankful that you didn't waste more than a year. 

In reading this post, he's become aware that his BS is not washing anymore. That you actually expect him to follow through on the empty promises that he had no intention of fulfilling. I'm not convinced that he won't try again because you're like a toy he doesn't want but doesn't want anyone else to have either but you need to know your worth. We know you deserve better than this, your family and friends know it and deep down, you do too."
502,"The scanner he uses to process the packages he takes out and brings in has a connection to his dispatch office. They know what time he arrives and departs, it prints out a report every night for every driver, so calling his manager does nothing, she's only wasting her own time and the managers time. You also have a window, not a set time. Typically windows are an hour, say 7:30 to 8:30, so he arrives at 8. Once he has delivered and received any packages at the location he is free to go, even it's at the very beginning of a window. He never has to wait, that's him being kind, he won't get in trouble, again she's wasting her time.

Here in Indiana couriers make $26/hr topped out. At fedex you top out within 10 years, but typically much sooner than that.  And again, that's fedex which is non union, ups is probably much quicker.

She's really only stressing herself out for no reason. If he really wanted to complain about her they could always pull that stop off his route and give it to someone else, seems like it isn't worth the bother to him."
503,"And by ""work through it,"" he means nagging you until you give in, right?"
504,"I'm gonna call it. This is harassment. They are emotionally manipulating you into a role you did not agree to and obviously feel uncomfortable with. How crucial is their professional recommendation? Is it worth dealing with this situation for potentially years to come?

It’s not a coincidence that you’re “unintentionally” not eating and then binging and then worrying about weight gain.  This relationship is triggering it. 

His dealbreakers are his dealbreakers and he’s entitled to them, but your dealbreaker should be that anyone who triggers ED thoughts or behaviors should not be around you, period.  "

510,"You set such a low bar and clearly stated that it's important, and yet he failed.

Sorry, but he's just not a keeper."
511,"How much have you spoken with him about this? As a Type-A myself, I'm often saying to my spouse and people around me, ""Oh, you should do that thing"" far more often than I should. This is often because people with this sort of personality tend to make the assumption that everyone is as _driven_ to make a success of their career and to have that appearance of success to others. Sometimes, people just don't care that much about that, and _that's fine_. 

&gt; He's also mentioned he wishes we were a power-couple, rather than just himself being a success.

This is where it becomes problematic. You mention that you want to do something else, but aren't sure what. That's okay -- he can maybe help you find something; you can talk about what _you_ like, and maybe you can go and try a few things out-- take classes, go to meetups, whatever. But that leads to the question: is this about money or is it about fulfilment? Because you could do something meaningful and fulfilling without ever making money for it, but your post indicates that he doesn't care so much about you being fulfilled as he does about you playing a role. That's an issue. "
512,"This might be her way of say she doesn't want to be a ruthless ex that's bent on excommunicating her child from her ex's family.

She's saying, ""Yo some shit is going down right now, we don't know each other well, but I want you to know that that I don't want what is going on with me and your brother to effect a future relationship with your niece.  I just want to play it cool.""

I'd read the room for a while.  Send her a perfunctory message saying you're sorry things aren't working out between the two of them and hopefully when the dust settles you wish them both a better future, a good relationship with your niece, and thank you for reaching out.

Then lay low about it while things work themselves out and worry about how your relationship with niece will go after your brother and his ex have established their co-parenting plans."

He was only casually dating you for a few months and now you are deciding his future for him, against his will.  Yeah, I'd hate you too.  

I mean... Like I said, yeah it's your right to keep the baby but Jesus fucking Christ... Why the hell would you expect him to be supportive of it??

Just move forward.  Have your kid.  If you need or your baby need financial support, file for child support. He will be legally forced to pay or have his wages garnished.  You'll be fine.  "

520,"HSV 2 is transmittable via childbirth, it’s possible your mother or father or even someone further up the chain had it and it was passed down the family tree to you. That said it sounds as if you should not be with your current partner - there are ways to mitigate HSV 2 transmission during intercourse, including anti-virals which can help counteract HSV 2, not having sex if you’re showing symptoms (though this is not to be relied upon as HSV 2 can transmit without manifestation of clinical symptoms in the traditional sense), and frequent condom use. The fact your current partner would rather deny you all sexual contact for circumstance you did not inflict upon yourself is absurd and frankly insensitive, and if educating him on the matter does not work either due to his own phobias or willful ignorance you may want to consider leaving."

527,"It is emotional abuse. 

I do chores because living in a house mandates chores be done and I like a clean space. I do chores because I am an adult and that’s life.

I do things for my boyfriend that he could do himself like refill his drink or tidy up around his place because it makes me happy to make his life a little easier. He’s got two kids with him part time so the chores pile up faster than my house where I live alone. And when I help him we can both relax together more quickly. 

But the key is it makes me happy to help him. And if i ever ask he’ll do the same things for me. He doesn’t demand, require, expect that I do anything for him. We do these things because we’re adults and because it makes us happy to help each other. 

OP, your dynamic is dysfunctional. Sure, as the stay at home spouse you should do more of the housework but that doesn’t mean you have to be his slave. "
528,Tell her she needs to step off. She can hold her opinion but it isn't her kid.
529,Make sure she has zero access to your birth control. Seriously - we’ve seen stories here where a MIL has sabotaged the BC.
530,"&gt;Almost every single time before sex, she tells me ""is this going to take too long?"", or ""I dont like to do blowjobs"" after doing for 15 seconds. 

Poor guy...

&gt;She comes from a Catholic family and would love to get married and have children ... and I do not want to marry or have children.

Since when did you know that ? Because why in the world would you stay with someone who has completely different objectives in life than you ? 

Throughout the whole post you said many negative things about your girlfriend. At this point, im pretty sure you don't love her anymore but you just stay because it's your comfort zone. "
531,"Her HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER? how long have they been ""friends""? A lot of this sounds like grooming behavior.... And it makes me worry what happened before. Definitely doesn't sound like a friendship. More like an emotional affair or actual affair."
532,"Omigosh... when her parents find out, be prepared for a cps visit... "
533,It's okay that you can't shoulder this alone.  A lot of people can't. But it's not okay to force your SO to hear gory details about things that would make ANYONE uncomfortable because you need an outlet. A lot of departments have recommendations for therapists who are used to hearing about the details in your line of work. They are specifically trained for this kind of thing. If you want to stick with this line of work - and that's something you really have to think about - you should really consider trying out a therapist.
534,"I think he definitely would, he knows about everything that happened to me. He's always on my side when this happens, gently asking his family to back off. This used to work pretty well, but now that we're more seriously dating and talking about marriages his family has been pushing more for pictures since I now go to all the family events. There are also some weddings coming up and it would be weird/rude if I didn't go, and they will definitely expect me to pose for the formal pictures with everyone else. But he doesn't really know how to explain it to them without disclosing my history."
535,"Yes.

You have children. You need life insurance. He can't get life insurance for a reasonable price if at all, while doing these activities.

Also, wtf, climbing hundreds of feet (or 15 feet!) into trees with strangers kids is such terrible judgement. Those kids would be extremely hurt or killed by a fall. And he is de facto responsible as the adult on scene."
536,"Your 30s really help you see people for who they are, so you don't fall in love with a person's ""potential"".

I drank a lot in my 20s due to unresolved issues and it would NEVER have occurred to me to talk to a loved one like that.


She is a mean drunk because she is a mean person. 

She just hides it better when she's sober.

Good on you dodging that horrid bullet OP.

This could have gone so, so wrong.
(Think you in jail on false charges)"
537,"&gt;And once you start working in these kinds of places, and doing really well, you have a good chance of ladder climbing, become maître d’ or manager, and you can make a decent living. 

This! I don't want to get into specifics, but I got my current job (making the most I have ever made, in a professional office setting - a law firm) because I took a lower-paying security job in the same (upscale) office building and started making friends and contacts. Take the job!"
538,"I'm sorry to say that, but I think you are overreacting. If she apologizes only when she did a bad thing, she probably understands that she caused you some pain or whatever and it's obvious that she won't do it again. Why she has to extend the problem and give you a full report like she is a child? You are both adults and if it's obvious that she is sorry, there's no need for you to keep digging and nagging about it.  She is right, it's up to you to keep overreacting or get over it. 

The truth is that for me is hard to apologize as well. I believe that when I say I'm sorry to my SO, he knows that I'm truly, deeply sorry and I'd never do this again, without digging into details why I did it or why I won't do it again."
539,"I second this. Doesn't even need to be a house. Encourage him to start an investment portfolio so he can ""start building their future"". Encourage him to see a financial advisor and plan it out. 200k shouldn't be sitting in a saving account anyway. 

Point is, get most of money into locked up investments that cant be easily liquified. "
540,"I have ADHD. I lose my phone and keys in the house on a regular basis. I have a very simple rule, however, which has prevented me from locking myself out of my car or house. 

**Always lock house or car with the key**. 

That's it. At the moment of locking, the keys must be physically in my hand. Even if I am absolutely, 100% sure that I just clipped the keys on my belt or dropped them in my bag, I always, always, always take them out and have them in my hand with my eyes looking at them before locking. 

Have a sit down where you explain to her how disruptive this is, and ask her what she plans to do to resolve this. "

542,"&gt;My wife gets upset when I point these things out.


Does she have a way this will work out? Like financially? Does she have a plan?


&gt;I think I sound like a man from the 50s


You sound like a very good father and husband, almost too much of a pushover actually. A man from the 50s wouldn't be cleaning, putting his wife through college or caving in on her wanting kids too soon. 

&gt;I want to add. My wife likes to shop a lot.


Starting to sound a *lot* like a pushover.


You're getting used. You're cleaning until 2AM while your wife is a stay at home mom? 


You're in debt because of her shopping and then decided to have 2 kids because she wanted them.


So now she has the kids she wants, the shopping she wants and now she also wants an education? 


Dude you're getting used. "
543,"I would have forgave the friend for forgetting if she didn't pressure Dallas to take a picture with the shirt. That's when the friend went from forgetful to being an ass. Because tbf its easy to forget the details of other peoples lives, if the friend wasn't friends with both her and the dead wife. It makes sense that it would slip her mind but to not be mortified after it comes out and then press for a picture is beyond rude."
544,"Thanks for your reply - it feels completely childish to me too. My wife is trying to hold the line on the budget but won’t cancel. Her folks are not in the best health, so she doesn’t want to have regrets if something were to happen."
545,"Well yeah, but you have to have that conversation with the hospital staff. They are more than willing to be the “bad guy” for you, I’ve done it plenty of times... but you HAVE TO COMMUNICATE."
546,"why delicately? She's taking advantage. repeatedly. tell her straight. Show her the maths. it's not remotely fair.

She doesnt get the big room ""because extra responsability"", then get to push the responsability onto you. 

I bet you wish you hasnt renewed with her. 

"
547,"She could very well tank YOUR career because of your boyfriend's lack of boundaries. You will be linked to a man who appears to sleep with students... and you're still a student. If he doesn't fix this, break up to save yourself."
548,"Nope. Not okay. At all. This is gross, unprofessional behavior. "
549,"Yeahhhhhhh... when I read the title, I assumed that a) they were arguing about things that actually matter, not Netflix, and b) that she was calling her parents to vent or complain or sort out her feelings. I mean, telling your parents about every argument you have with your SO is never good, but it’s not an uncommon problem. Needless to say I was quite surprised to read that she’s running out of the home she shares with OP, in tears, driving to her parent’s house and staying the night. Once a month! That is in no way a proportionate, rational or reasonable response, and it’s actually quite concerning. 

What also stood out to me is that she told OP that he makes her feel inadequate but couldn’t articulate how or when he does this. Of course she can’t! That’s because OP doesn’t do *anything* to make her feel inadequate. The real problem is that she believes that she’s not adequate. She probably has really poor self esteem, not to mention no ability to regulate her emotions or self-soothe. Why? I have no idea. But I would *love* to know more about her childhood/upbringing and her relationship with her parents. 

ETA: I wanted to go back and check the ages. They’re both 26! OP’s girlfriend needs to get herself into therapy yesterday. The dynamic between her and her parents is not healthy for a 26 year old woman, and it’s really troubling that her parents are enabling this behavior. I’m not saying that she’s a bad person or that OP should dump her or anything like that. I actually feel badly for her, given that she’s still so dependent on and enmeshed with her parents. 

Therapy can definitely help with these sorts of issues, as long as the individual recognizes that there is a problem, wants to get better and engages with the process. That being said, they’ve only been together for two years, so if I were OP, I would set a limit on how much more time and emotional energy I’d spend on the relationship if she’s not 100% committed to working on this issue and not making tangible progress."
550,"That lie it's so bad it's almost funny. If what he said is true, he should be hospitalized because that level of memory loss indicates severe brain damage. Weed and depression are not going to make you forget making a tinder account.

He's trying to find someone new while keeping you on a string, and playing you for a fool with this ridiculous ""I forgot"" story.

This doesn't have anything to do with any suppose it mental illness he may have. He absolutely disrespected you. Don't waste anymore of your time with him."
551,Skip the wedding and focus on your festival.  You were long committed to the festival before he announced his wedding.  Send him a nice card with a gift and maybe look at scheduling a visit with him and his new wife in the near future.
552,"I can only guess, but if he constantly initiates sex maybe she starts pushing away any touch because if she allows it or touches, she is giving him the wrong idea that they will have sex and then he's disappointed. "
553,"I do't know what to feel. I feel outraged at his behavior and about my husband jumping to his aid without flinching. Although now that you have explained all of this I realize that maybe I would have done the same thing for my parents, or my sister, if they had ever committed a crime for which there is no doubt.

I don't know exactly what to do or feel."
554,"Ya this makes no sense?? The price of the apartment doesn’t change by how many people live there. If the apartment costs $2000 then it costs that much no matter how many people live there. If 4 people live there, it’s cheaper *per person* but other than that, nothing changes. If anything, you moving in should have made it cheaper either for everybody or at least for your boyfriend (i.e. you two now split whatever he was paying them before). 

Edit: I’m talking just about rent. Utilities are obviously a thing too, which might go up with more people but not that much more and even then, you’re now splitting it between more people, so it should **still** be cheaper. Like think about it from a numbers perspective: Say their utilities cost $200 a month (random number) and you moving in means that it increases to $250 a month (which I think is probably an exaggeration on how much it would increase), now, instead of the 3 of them paying $67 each, the 4 of you are now paying $63 each."
555,I assume her car must be relatively old if it let's you lock it when the key is in the ignition. 
556,"You're right - if she's on his accounts she has exactly as much rights and access to his money as he does. While yes she could fleece him and run off, I'd imagine she's more likely to stick around for the long haul. Or else she's just conventionally insecure / clingy and he's gone way overboard. The very fact that he's asking you to keep it secret means he KNOWS it's sketchy as fuck. But he's an adult and can make his own choices - all you can say is that you're concerned that he's not making good ones, and then let things play out however they're going to. Express your worries, but ultimately not your circus, not your monkeys. "

559,"""And I shouldn't have to endure your relentless attempts to manipulate me into doing things I don't enjoy. Yet here we are. You deserve a partner who wants to do anal with you, and I deserve a partner who respects my boundaries. We're incompatible. It's over."""
560,"Those phases of “being wonderful” are not the “real him”. They’re him trying to gloss over the nastiness. She has no idea what he’d be like without his abusive mentality. His entire treatment of her revolves around those periods when he’s being vicious. The over-the-top “wonderfulness” wouldn’t be necessary without those. 

And it gets worse after a child is born. Newborns can cause strain even in healthy, loving relationships - but they turn abusive ones into a waking nightmare. Because now he thinks she’s good and trapped, and that sense of conquest mixes with his jealousy of the attention required by the baby to create a Molotov cocktail of aggression. "
561,There are funny pranks and then there are mean and cruel pranks. This is the latter. Your boyfriend is just an asshole.
562,"""I don't want a baby shower."" ""No, you really need to have one, because that's what I want.""

""I don't want to wear this shirt."" ""No, you really need to wear it, because that's what I want.""

I hope this isn't a theme in her life.

OP, what the friend did was shitty (forcing the shirt on her). Review how you are behaving towards your stepmother and be considerate towards her feelings. If she says something about her wants, then that's something to respect. If you see someone trying to steam roll her, speak up instead of standing by and regularly check if  you're not doing the steam rolling."
563,I was thinking he was acting out too. You’re leaving him; why should you care if he has a party?
564,"OP, look up Gypsy Rose Blanchard "
565,"This! What the hell, he's in silver and believes he could gain about 1000 rank on his own without OP. Then how is he even silver to begin with?! I think OP should take this great opportunity to really reflect upon his character, because he sure is showing what kind of person he is. "
566,"Dudes a 42 year old, he's 20 years older than you.


I'm guessing he doesn't really value you for your opinions no.. I mean, you're dating someone who could be your father. Did you expect to be treated equally?


Also, he sounds like an ass. "
567,"OP, your mom is protecting you.  Your father was a drug addict and even her being 8 months pregnant with you, was not enough to make him sober up.  It is also very likely that he was abusive.  When you are older you can go look for him, but for right now you need to trust your mom that she did the right thing for your SAFETY.  People don't up and leave their hometown and family support unless they are running away from something or someone really scary,"
568,"Why does he feel that he needs to even ask for a paternity test? And why at the first birthday? Why are you not outraged that he feels he needs one? And my question to him would be why did he feel the need to wait until first birthday? If he feels he needs one then why not get one right away?

Honestly this makes little sense and kinda feels like he is trying to fit in where he probably doesn't belong. Unless there is a reason to believe the child might not be his."
569,Which she’s trying to find a way to do by asking for help. 
570,"First, don’t let anyone tell you that you have “Daddy issues.” That makes it sound like this is your fault, and this is not your fault. 

It sounds like this is his hamfisted, shitty way of trying to make you more independent? If that is the case, maybe a sit-down with him where you explain that yes, you are a teenager now and you need less help with SOME things, but the way he is behaving is making you feel like he doesn’t want to be around you. I really sympathize with you, my dad pulled some of this shit too. 

You are asking him for support - emotional and practical support - and the unfortunate truth is that a lot of men are just not given this kind of support as they grew up, and so they don’t know how to provide it to their children. 

Ask your dad about his childhood. What kind of emotional support did his parents give him when he was a teenager? What did they help him with? Is there anything he wished they would have helped him with that he had to do on his own? Maybe opening up a conversation about these things will help him to feel empathy for how you’re feeling right now. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. "
571,"Not to be mean but... if you can’t afford therapy how are you going to afford another child? If you feel you can afford another child, I think it’s a question of prioritizing spending money on therapy and not that you can’t afford it. And you should prioritized therapy so that you can deal with this issue and move on."
572,"The stuff that he's listing in the OP - making dinner, cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, walking the dog - are all things that more or less have to happen. Doing less would be a great option if she was killing herself with scrubbing baseboards and deep-cleaning the bathtub every day, but there are some things that legitimately need to get done."
573,I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who thought about my sister like that. It's extremely gross 
574,"I see that not everyone is having the same reaction as me, but I really think that this is not a great sign when the two of you have not been together that long. It seems like as soon as she figured out your income, she arbitrarily decided that you should pay more and making comments about money. 

First of all, you absolutely *do* have a defense to statements such as 'we're supposed to be a team'. You've only been together six months and you're still figuring things out. You're getting to know each other and working out what sort of balance fits the two of you. 

The way I would phrase it is that you want to make sure the two of you are on the same page. Tell her you're on a budget and like to make sure that you're living beneath your means. Tell her that you want to have savings as you're not sure about the security of your job (and be firm if she tries to pooh-pooh this and say you're sure to find something). 

If you want things to be 50/50 or 70/30, whatever on tabs then tell her - and remember that in a relationship the two of you need to be able to communicate with each other and not hide stuff because you're worried about hurting each other all the time. Obviously be courteous, but you could easily do something like ask 'can we split this?' before a meal, etc, or even bring it up before the two of you leave. If she keeps doing it, say 'hey, I actually have a budget, I'd like us to start splitting this more often' and open up that discussion. You could even do it now. Accept that it might feel awkward because often those first discussions about finance do. "
575,"I think you can try to find out if this is some kind of abusive or groomed relationship first.

She may be reaching out to you in a subtle bid for help.  If you just leave her behind as a friend, that would be letting her know that even her self-proclaimed best friend wasn't able to help her.  That could make the things that the step-brother say to groom her seem even more true.

Now that's not saying this is what's happening, but I do think it's something worth checking out before writing her out of your life.



"
576,"Yep. As a girl who has had a bf do this in social situations, it feels shitty. Talk to your wife more. Who cares if she’s quiet? Engage her. You’re married. You can talk to her. "
577,"&gt; TL;DR just found out wife cheated during bachelorette party and dont know what the fuck to do. she going to wake up soon

Leave, at least you found out now before you got married"
578,"LOL what rock do you live under where this is shocking news to you? women get raped, sexually assaulted, cat called, and generally BOTHERED every day, all day, relentlessly. 

If I don’t have headphones, I can’t walk. Hearing the shit men yell at me makes me ashamed to me a woman sometimes. 

Edit to be constructive: after youve wrapped your head around this, talk to your other male friends about it. TALK ABOUT IT. Tell them it’s not okay. Help all of us, not just your girlfriend. "
579,"He's killing the culture of your company. I used to work with a guy like that (I wasn't his boss) and they eventually just let him go. During conference calls he would just talk in the middle of someone else speaking (including executives). He would literally ruin every phone call. So when it was time for cuts, he was the first to go. You've taken the right steps to address the situation but his behavior isn't changing."
580,"You said she was immature for not sitting her father down immediately and talking about it and instead asking for help online, I’m not sure why you’re going on a tangent about how much her father loves her. Regardless of his reasoning, he’s doing a shit job of parenting her and it’s not at all out of the box for a *16 year old* to not have the emotional depth to understand the nuances of his actions. 

Also, while I understand what you’re trying to say just being a father doesn’t make someone a good person in the same way just being a mother or a sibling doesn’t. Plenty of people have extremely toxic family members and just being a family doesn’t erase the damage or mean someone should continue interacting with them.  

ETA: I reread the OP and nowhere does she claim that her dad hates her, she hates him, or that she wants to throw the relationship away. I think you might be projecting here."
581,OK I'll keep it in mind.
582,"I mean, my point is... how many times has he told her *in the morning or the night before*, ""Hey, I'll do dinner/walk the dog/clean the living room tonight when I get home, so don't worry about that!""?

My bet is he's not doing that frequently, or this wouldn't be an issue. He should be actively thinking ahead rather than coming home and complaining that nothing's left for him to do. Why would she wait to do something she has no idea he's planning to do?"
583,"I find it interesting, that almost every post here where there is some kind of breakdown in communications, personality clash or life-goals clash, its always early 20's F, early-mid 30's M."
584,"&gt;  want to do it with dignity and pride and I don't want to be the person that dumps someone by text, but he doesn't have time to see me or even call, even at a time like this.

Call him and if he doesn't answer leave him a voicemail. Why should you spent more effort on ending it than he spent on being in it."
585,"Ok and also, if he is sleeping with that many different women in the SAME WEEK as you, I am worried about your health. You could catch something really nasty through him! "
586,"Oh, girl. Stop being so gullible. You know he's lying."
587,"This is what I'd like to know. All crafts/skills need constructive criticism. I'm wondering if she ignores the booing and takes OP's feedback and support as being too much of a positive. Surely after being booed and heckled, she'd have to realize SOMETHING in her content isn't connecting. "
588,"From a legal standpoint I think your therapist gave some bad advice.  First off, it's only a loan if you agreed to pay him back.  How much, when, and it would be specific.  That is the type of onus the court would ask for.  Did you ever agree that this is a loan and not a gift through text message or email? 

If this was all verbal, and you start paying him, that in of itself is enough evidence that you owe him something.  Don't pay him!   It would give him tangible evidence in court that you owe him money. 

Legality aside, this is a common tactic parents use to try to exert control over children that are now legal adults.  He would have to go to a courthouse, file a lawsuit, produce the evidence that you owe him a debt, drag his daughter into a legal litigation, convince a judge, go to court, and risk losing his relationship with you forever by doing so. 

*Hint: he's not going to actually do that.  He's threatening you to exert control.  Ensuring control over a child after suddenly losing one, if your brother was his son.*"
589,"What I'm gonna say here may be harsh. My Mom is similar to your Mom. My Mom will repeat back that Nazis/homophobes/racists/misogynists are bad, but coincidentally every man she has seriously dated was a racist homophobic misogynist. (Well, one dude - my dad - wasn't a misogynist at least.) 

Eventually I realized my Mom is racist, too. ""As long as he doesn't think that way about *me*"" is what she prays to herself to sleep at night. I've been with my SO 5 years. If he started spouting that neo Nazi BS I wouldn't be able to see him with anything other than disgust and pity. Your Mom hears him say this tripe and not only thinks ""still bangable"" (sorry, OP) but, ""still *romantically loveable.*""

""Mom, you can date all of the Conservative or Republican men you want and I will happily call you Mother. I don't care if you date men I disagree with politically. However you must also know this; as long as you find Nazis or Nazism attractive and respectable, I will not acknowledge you as a parent of mine. As a courtesy I also caution you- do not bitterly break it off with this man as some sort of misguided act of martyrdom to gain back your child. I will see clearly in your heart that you pine for a man with blood-thirsty and brutal ideologies and refuse you again.""

If I could go back, that's what I'd say to my Mom about it instead of the stuttering mess I spat out."
590,"I think OP also needs to realise that the world isn't necessarily fair and based on merit. The business world assigns a lot of value to confident decisions makers, regardless of the quality of their decisions or even their decision making process.

Middle management roles are overwhelmingly focused on hitting targets and dealing with short term issues. This is independent of business specialism. If you're lucky, and find a situation where the basic running at the level below you more or less hits the targets, and the level above you sets the strategy, someone like OP's husband is set. All he has to do is manage the people, meet the targets, and fight the fires. By all accounts, it sounds like he's actually pretty good at this.

It is neither OP's nor her husbands fault that the world rewards this more readily than it does technical specialists, which is what it feels like OP is trying to build for herself. "
591,Lol agreed. She’s probably like “holllly fuckkkk... this fucking guy?!”
592,"All the information you posted is actually irrelevant. You have a job, this is part of your job, shit happens and need to be dealt with. 

That's it. It's not your job to make your jealous baby of a boyfriend feel secure. This will not be the last time you travel. He can either support you or find a GF with a different career. Dear God it is 2018! "
593,"I agree. Thank you for the remark on waiting back, all these comments are making me freak out, as they should, but at this point I might as well wait to get back to be safe, I already fucked up.

I honestly dont know how I left her in my apt. I wasn't thinking straight. I can cut back and come back Sunday and solve this before it gets out of hand. Thanks for the straight dope."
594,"Your mother cannot “make” you do anything. Tell whoever you’d like. She might become upset, but you need to tell her that you are an adult that can make their own decisions, and she has to accept that in order for to have an adult relationship with you. Don’t lie anymore. "
595,"I've seen some of those videos that you've mentioned, actually.  I'll find some and show them to him next time it comes up. I think your approach is reasonable, thank you."
596,"First and foremost his behavior was disturbing and inappropriate during your date. The way he acted *was* creepy and ""rapey,"" and the fact that he used those very words himself without provocation tells me that he *knew* he was being pushy, rude, creepy, and borderline assaulting you. He just didn't care.

Beyond that, you owe him nothing. IDGAF if you still have to see him at events/with mutual friends, you don't owe him any communication, and the fact that he's coming on so strong and still harassing you/trying to move your boundaries so he can still talk to you says that **if you give him an inch he will take a mile.** The only way to deal with people like him is to **go completely no contact.**

Stop responding to messages. Block him on all platforms. Let the word out among your mutual friends that he has been harassing you and that you don't want to go to events/parties where he will also be. If you end up at an event with him by circumstance, ignore him. If he comes up to you and tries to talk (and he probably will) then loudly and forcibly say ""GuysName, I have made it really clear that I don't want to speak to you again because of your behavior earlier this year. You are making me uncomfortable."" Then walk away.

Don't cave to pressure from him! He may call you all sorts of names, accuse you of being heartless, rude, that you're making assumptions about him, he'll tell people you're a liar or that you're spreading rumors. These are all tactics to get you to respond to him/communicate. Even an angry response or a ""stop talking to me"" is a victory for him. Just ignore it. Idiots like him always out themselves as idiots, don't worry about doing that job for him.


**EDIT**: copied my response to a comment from OP below, where she's worried about being sen as causing drama/making waves:

1) Never, ever worry about ""causing drama"" when you are protecting yourself from another person. HE is the one causing drama through his actions, not you. HE is the one making things difficult because he's a creep who doesn't respect women/your boundaries. Separating yourself from him does not mean you are ""causing"" this, he ALREADY caused this through his behavior. So many women don't report sexual assault or feel uncomfortable calling men out on their shitty behavior because of they are afraid of being seen as ""causing drama"" and making waves. Fuck. That. Noise. You telling the truth should never be a bad thing. Anyone who can't see that shouldn't be in your life.

2) Anyone who doesn't believe you when you tell them you were harassed by a man (and a man who very obviously is harrassing you) is someone that you need to seriously re-evaluate calling them a friend. Friends believe you."
597,"Adulthood is taken, not granted. That said if you're living at home there's only so much you can push back on - if you're dependent on your parents for money, etc. then they control your life. The only big picture solution is to move out - if you can't or don't want to, there's not much you can do yet.

That said, you can open an account without him knowing. Sure he might find out, and he might not like it, but so what? If he kicks you out over it, the problem resolved itself. You can't live your life based on what will make your parents happy or sad - it's YOUR life. They won't agree with your choices, but they're still your choices to make. You say they won't ""let"" you get a job. What would they do if you got one? Kick you out? Maybe think if it's worth it. Be unhappy? OK, that's their problem, not yours.

I'd also take issues with his ""if I dropped dead"" comment - sure you'd struggle, **because he's not helped you become independent**. That's him making you dependent on him, not him raising a functioning adult. And bluntly you probably would survive - you'd get a job, find somewhere to live, and start being a functioning adult.

He can come up with all the arguments he likes, but he can't force you to do anything. Open the account and don't tell him. If he finds out or you want to tell him, don't add him to it. He can pout, he can argue, he can threaten, but he can't **make** you do anything. I'd also say it's more controlling to make the purchases for you and limit your access to funds, but he won't listen to reason so that's a futile approach. Just because he could be even *more* controlling than he is, doesn't mean he's not being controlling already.

So in conclusion you don't convince them. You just do it. They may well not like it, but they'll have to accept it, because what's their alternative? "
598,"Dude, properly invested you live off the interest, then it never runs out and you can donate it to whoever you want when you die. Investment interest is way more than bank account interest. But you need a financial adviser to give you some sage low risk options so you don't blow it."

Also, can't forget “yours wasn’t anything special"". 
I don't know her life, but every single year I spend with my SO is 
""special"", mostly because we make it that way. That she doesn't see that is concerning at least.

This really seems like something much less reasonable than most commenters are making it out to be. 

I absolutely agree that the priority should have been the sentiment and the gesture but it's clear to me OP is trying hard here while it seems very much like wife is trying to make him behave himself the way that is best/easiest for her rather than in a fair or reasonable way."
601,"I'm not trying to assume anything about op, but from seeing enough of those threads for a long enough time, a big through line is the younger girl HAS no friends to give her a daily lecture. 

They seem to often be isolated, introverted young women and a lot also put in their posts that they're struggling with depression or other similar problems. I'd say maybe like.. 60-70% mention mental illness.

It's just interesting what patterns you see emerge with these posts by following over time"
602,"&gt; . But EVERYBODY in our circle knows about the proposal and the engagement and it's not like I can back out. 

Of course you can. You return the ring and tell him you are not ready to be engaged, and you feel *very* uncomfortable that he pressured you into it with a sudden public proposal.

When people ask, you say, ""Actually, I returned the ring and called off the proposal. We're still together, but I am not ready to be engaged right now, and I felt really put on the spot with a public proposal. I really wish he had spoken to me about it beforehand.""

&gt; Plus that would hurt my fiance very much. 

He'll live. By putting you on the spot with a public proposal (after *four* months), he is either completely clueless, or deliberately put you in a situation where you would feel pressured to say yes. At this point, worrying about *his* feelings (when he completely ignored yours) should be the least of your concerns. 

If he's a good guy, he'll feel hurt but he'll recognised that *he* screwed up. If he tries to make you feel bad for rejecting his OH SO ROMANTIC proposal, then you know his intentions aren't good."
603,What I am wondering is how you put up with this for ten years and how is it that you haven't managed to explain your need to have alone time in those ten years???
604,I don't think you should worry about your mom and step father's marriage and you should talk to your mom.
605,"Honestly? Since talking to him hasn’t worked, I’d just go into whatever room you’re feeding your baby and lock the door. I think it would send a pretty clear message that this is “alone” time for you and he is not respectful enough to join you until he can keep his hands to himself."

607,"The moment I saw ""big cock"" I figured he was the missing stair. Sending those screenshots to everyone was a mistake, but fuck it, it was a magnificent one. 

If you're dumb enough to send shit like that and take a hard no as ""playing hard to get"", this is the kind of thing he deserves. Put it in the open, and don't hide it away. Don't apologise for calling creeps out, cause they can get away with so much because women stay silent to spare their feelings. Why? It's predatory, it's thoroughly unwelcome, and they should feel shame and learn how to interact properly."
608,"We all think it’s weird that you had the discussion with David in the first place, AND that it’s weird that you brought it up with Isabella.

609,"The fact that this hasn't even occurred to her as a solution, or to him as a reason as to why she has no free time, suggests that this relationship is perhaps not as 'excellent' as she says it is. "
610,"Can concur. Sex can be a lot of work, and if you expect penetrative sex every time that can feel like a lot of pressure to perform for some women. Especially, getting  into that headspace of wanting to perform well for your partner. 

once in a while, a quick and easy way to orgasm without all the work just feels nice and relaxing. 

She was trying to be discreet.  Let her. "
611,"After reading the comments, I have to admit it’s pretty clear I have some misconceptions about therapy and need to rethink. I have a coworker, a LEO, who tried therapy and got nothing from it. I think I’m letting his bad experience color my perceptions. Thank you for your response, I will definitely be looking into this. "
612,"No, but it could be postpartum depression or anxiety that has completely spiraled. This woman needs counselling on her own and medication to get her moods and thoughts under control. I feel very bad for her and I'm sure she's just as miserable if not more so than OP. I'm not excusing her behavior in anyway, and she definitely needs to own it, change it, and apologize for it, but I went through a similar (but not as extreme) phase after I had my daughter. Seeing a doctor and treating my PPD/Generalized Anxiety Disorder fixed a lot of the strife in my relationship with my husband."

615,"Refuse to even discuss another child until this is processed, OP. And make sure you have secure birthday control."
616,"That's a recipe for disaster. Ask him if he's on board to let the kids fail school because they don't want to study, or to let their teeth rot when they don't want to brush their teeth. And getting ill is totally fine since they won't want to go to the doctor. Seriously, your husband sounds off his rocker. At least if you end up divorcing, they'll have a parent who gives them stability 50% of the time, instead of having your husband undermine you 100% of the time."
617,"That's absurd. She already had sex with the guy. She's been texting him for 4+ months. 

That decision was made. She's just upset she has to deal with the consequences."
618,"The grass isn't greener over on the other side of the fence, it's greener where you water it. You're watering it over by your coworker by having an emotional affair rather than watering over by your fiancée and talking this out with your fiancée and possibly doing some pre-wedding couples counseling. Of course things look more pleasant with your coworker, that's where you're investing your emotional energy and make no mistake, your fiancée is not forcing you to do that. You need to sit her down and talk to her about all of this."
619,Your wife needs to butt out. Her kid LIED. That trumps new kid awkwardness every time. And her interfering would make life very awkward for their relationship. She needs to back off. 
620,"&gt; I put on headphones and just tried to ignore his complaints that he can't sleep but he doesn't give up.

Do you live near friends or your parents? Is there a backup place you can go? I know it sounds extreme but I'd give him 3 chances. Each time he doesnt listen to your no, you LEAVE. If you have to leave 3 times (and after each tell him, remind him, ""I've said no and if you don't stop pestering me and disrespecting my no I will leave"") then just cut your losses and break up. He sounds like a handful tbh. "
621,but does your dad wake your mom up in the middle of the night tho
622,"&gt;my wife's pregnant. When we do have sex, I have started becoming angry and rougher than usual

...is no one else chilled to the core by this?"
623,"It's absolutely true she's putting you in a bad position here. There are really no good options.


You can't go with her now, that's obvious. You can't give him your ticket, that's obvious too. You *could* rescind the gift and go with your girlfriend, but that will almost certainly bomb the friendship. I have a feeling Elsie is going to need all the friends she can get soon enough; there's no way this relationship is going to end well. 


I think if I were you, I'd give her her ticket as the gift, and offer to sell Hank yours. You didn't buy her two tickets for her birthday, you bought her *one* ticket for her birthday, and bought one ticket for yourself. Frankly, I'd be petty and mark the ticket up to compensate you for the trouble, but that's up to you.


Here's the thing about emotional abuse: it really, really fucks with your head and your sense of normality. Now, I'm not sure Hank is abusive. But it sounds like he's at the very least possessive, jealous, controlling, and attempting to isolate Elsie from her friends and drive a wedge between them. 


Elsie is treating you this way because you're *safe* to treat this way; Hank is not. That's deeply unfair to you - absolutely. That's a shitty thing to do to you - absolutely. Elsie owes you an apology - absolutely.


But, even with all that in mind, if you've known Elsie for over a decade and are that close, it would be compassionate of you to try and understand her behavior in the context of fear. Not necessarily fear of physical abuse, but this phrase stuck out to me:


&gt;""you must have known how this would look to Hank”


That's a pretty chilling phrase, isn't it? And I'd bet he said something similar to her, too. You must have known how that would look... in other words, it's her job to constantly be on the lookout for things that Hank will take badly, and if she messes up, there will be consequences.


I don't know. Maybe I'm totally going off the deep end here. But I got bad vibes from this all. I understand why you're so upset. But I just don't think this is a tantrum. I think it's darker than that. Hopefully I am full of shit and have no idea what I am talking about. "
624,"They are both nurses by definition but an RN requires more education and has a larger scope of practice than an LPN. An RN is supposed to delegate tasks to the LPN (""give orders"") and manage the LPN's assignments. Also, the RN can have her license affected if the LPN makes a mistake. If the LPN is abusive to the CNA's, it is absolutely the RN's responsibility to correct it and if no resolution can be reached, report to the director of nursing. Everyone is a member of the care team and what is best for the patient is primary. If the LPN is doing anything to detract from patient care, she should reprimanded. Management of LPNs and CNAs is taught in nursing school because ultimately the RN is responsible for the patient. Hope this helps. "
625,"I get her viewpoint. If you have children, especially newborns with weak immune systems, your family would be putting them at risks. By not treating infections and possibly contagious illnesses you are putting others at risk. "
626,[removed]
627,it could very possibly be related to that - i think sometimes it can make him feel a bit excluded as he doesnt speak the language apart from a few words here and there that he has picked up over the years. my level in the language is conversational whereas the children are fluent so they have used it as a bit of a secret language as they know it is the only one that myself and my partner dont understand completely (we both speak the other language they speak at conversational level) 
628,"Oh god, please try this one OP and then tell us his reaction. I am sure it would be entertaining. "
629,"This is honestly the wrong attitude to have. If you invest this money wisely and live off of the interest rather than the principle, you can set yourself up for life and likely the generations ahead of you as well.  True wealth is when your money makes you money. 
"
630,"We have a tight social circle of around a dozen people in our group.  Some we see more than others, but we've all kind of been together and hanging out continually for around seven years now.  He's cut himself from all but one person in that group now.  And some other stuff came up yesterday that could lead to them being cut off too.

I just don't know what can be done.  He's pissed everyone off in so many ways that we don't really care to see him at the moment.  And with her being so venomous, I feel like anything we'd try to steer him right would just backfire. "
631,"You could also call her and tell her ""I am inviting JUST YOU, no plus one"" on the day you know the invite will arrive."
632,90% sure OP is in a gay relationship in a country where they legally cannot get married.

634,"It might be illuminating to take a glance at his post history, where his belief system is more clearly explicated. Pretty regressive."
635,"I'm a sober alcoholic as well and this would get really old fast. I know she means well, but you're not some sick puppy that needs to be coddled. You sound like you have a good hold on your sobriety right now. I would sit her down one more time and tell her how this makes you feel. It would make me feel embarrassed and like a debby downer. It would make me feel like every hangout with her and her friends that your sobriety is the spotlight . You should be treated like everyone else.. I would let her know that she is highlighting to everyone your choice for sobriety and IDK about you, but I don't like my opener being - ALCOHOLIC OVER HERE! IDK I would be very uncomfortable with how your gf is handling things. "
636,You actually put love and thought into this gift. It’s great. Don’t worry.
637,"OP, are you really into this guy?

He seems like he wants to marry / move in because it's convenient and he can take advantage of your financial situation, and you don't seem too thrilled about a future with this guy."
638,Why are you the one who's supposed to be making sacrifices when you're deeply bothered by the idea of tiny houses?
639,"Oh come on, he's *evidently* married, how much more of a hint do you need?"
640,"\&gt; It irritates me that Danielle seems to want to co-opt my very real and  personal struggles with sexism for identity reasons, but I haven’t told  her that.

So..my SO has a friend who calls himself pansexual. He's always going on and on about how discriminated against he is...

The dude hasnt EVER dated a man. Never been out in public with a man romantically. He exclusively dates women.

When invited over to hang out with me as well after they had dinner ""Oh, I dont know if I can handle a straight white male right now""

first off...this dude is white. second off..IM ACTUALLY PANSEXUAL. I've been thrown out of places, beaten and called a faggot, disowned by religious family... half my relationships have been homosexual.

This dude cant separate ""people dont like my douchy personality"" from ""people can't handle my gayness!""

There's not anything I think you can do to change their mind..they've built an identity around it and they'll lash out at anything that threatens it.  they're just as close-minded as any right-wing nut you'll find. for surprisingly similar reasons.

Plus now if I try to call him out on it, or explain my point of view I become the fag hater, somehow."
641,"&gt;His daughter is biracial and I get the idea that she just will never view me a mother figure and doesn't like the fact that I'm white but I don't know if this is just my extreme insecurities talking.

That's probably true and it adds another dimension to your difficulty in the relationship.  

The bottom line though, is that your boyfriend really isn't ready for a new relationship.  He hasn't figured out how to balance his responsibilities as a parent with growing a new relationship.   I agree with those who say you probably want to end this now before you get really hurt."
642,"sounds like op is in the uk, where you have to find someone considered 'a professional' to sign off on your passport photo to verify your identity. in reality this just means someone who has a salaried full-time job rather than e.g. billy who usually takes your maccies order. most people i know ask their teacher or doctor."
643,This is sad because it was an accident but there is a chance that he decided that he doesn't wanna have to deal with that if you guys haven't be together for long ...
644,"Exactly - even if he was *just friends* with the girls, **why would a 30 year old man be friends with teenage girls he doesn’t even know?**"
645,"I think you are putting words into her mouth unfairly.

'our sex means nothing to you' is pretty presumptuous. Has she ever behaved unimpressed and blasé?

If she has behaved like she's had a religious experience or at least a spiritual one: then belive her. Your sex life is meaningful for her. "
646,"If her reaction to you telling her how you felt about what she did was to downplay her responsibility, dismiss your feelings, and find a way to make it about how *you* were wrong, then maybe your marriage really is over. Not because you said anything offensive, but because your wife has become a mean person who doesn't care about how her actions make you feel."
647,"Tbh I think he is so disconnected from the relationship that it won't matter how you break it off in the end. The break up won't have a huge impact on him.. at most it will be a small inconvenience to him. Life hardly gets into the way of a workaholic.

edit: grammer"
648,i would complain to the police department honestly and of course break up with the abusive partner.
649,"Those texts are so gross. I could understand that maybe she's dealing with a lot more than just controlling at home (some kind of abuse), but the texts about him not being able to take it back and she was promised those tickets comes off greedy and entitled. He bought her ONE ticket to go WITH him. If she doesn't want to go/can't go without her boyfriend, not try to swindle OP out of the one he bought for himself."
650,"Yo. I went through the exact same thing except it was my cousin. I was horrified because she was 12 at time and wearing underwear that I had paid for out of pocket and WAS NOT meant for a 12 year old to wear. I felt super violated and had no idea what to do. Even though I was 19, you bet that went straight to my mom because that shit was above my pay grade to handle. She in turn talked to her sister (my aunt) and it was handled immediately. 

Talk to her mom. Let her know it’s uncomfortable and embarrassing for you to bring up, but you want it handled. I’m sure she would be horrified to know her daughter is taking something as personal as underwear without your permission. 

Still get the heebie jeebies thinking about it "
651,"&gt;I did have another short term guy I was seeing between my last annual and when I started dating him, and we didn't always use protection. So I was worried that I could have gotten it from him and passed it on to current BF. 

So am I understanding that you had unprotected sex with someone else between the time you were tested and when you had sex with your new boyfriend?

Because if that's the case, you told him that you were clean and you didn't know your status. It absolutely does not excuse him lying to you but you didn't tell the truth, either."
652,"Definitely agree. OP, from the sounds of it, this woman has literally spent her full life raising kids. Regardless of its fair or equal, or even if it hurts your husband’s feelings, she’s entitled to move on to a new stage of her life. "
653,"All he is ""afraid of"" is that you'll gain independence and leave him. 

Do it. This is financial and emotiona abuse and you have so many options that you could enjoy if only you get free of him. But he'll fight you every inch of the way. So go see a lawyer today."
654,"&gt;Why if the injury wasn’t a big deal did he share it with you?

Yeah - some of what I'm getting out of the husband's behavior isn't thrill-seeking, it's *attention* seeking. The ""ohhh I'm so injured but don't worry about me"" routine reminds me SOOOO much of the martyr mom/aunt ""ohhhh yes I slaved over this dinner even though I have a terrible migraine, but don't worry about me, just enjoy your meal"" move. Plus, even if he hadn't been injured, I have to question what kind of 27 year old adult feels the need to impress 13 year olds like that.

Looking over this story, basically the whole trip stopped being about OP and her parents, and ended up revolving entirely around OP's husband and his stunts and his injury. As a one-time incident that might fall under ""shit happens"", but I've also known the kind of person who just ""coincidentally"" has a huge crisis every time the group attention isn't centered on them.  

I dunno. Maybe I'm being overly harsh on OP's husband. But I think examining if these stunts are an unhealthy way of seeking attention might be worthwhile."
655,"Thanks, this made my mind up."
656,"Housewarming presents aren’t supposed to be mandatory. She is incredibly entitled, that’s not the right way to respond to a gift."
657,"Snooping in relationships is awful. 

Snooping to find child pornography and exploitation before someone knows the police are onto them and can delete it is, I think, justified. 
Digital photos can contain encoded data about the time, date and location of a photo that could save a trafficked child. His chat histories could warn a parent before their preteen is violated. I think the ends justify the means. "
658,Yep tell your Dad - he doesn't deserve this crap.
659,"I dont mean to salt the wound, but

&gt; She told me they stopped talking at the end of that week because she met someone else.

This means *she* ended it. He fully intended on continuing with her for longer without you ever finding out.

I think if you both want this to work out, you need solo therapy, he needs solo therapy, and you both need to find a new couples counselor. A good therapist wont tell you to just let it go, theyll help you come up with personal tactics to help you move passed it. "
660,"I’d start off by suggesting that she visit her doctor and rule out any medical cause for this forgetfulness. It’s highly unlikely that there’s anything wrong with her, but at least you’ll have a clear conscience when you tell her that you’re not helping her with this any more. 

Maybe she’s doing it on purpose. She might want you to prove that you’ll drop what you’re doing and run to her. Or she might thinks it’s “cute” that she always needs you to rescue her. 

Or maybe she’s just scatter brained. But, even if she’s not doing it intentionally, it’s not your problem to fix for her. She needs to commit to some sort of routine when she gets out of the car to ensure that she hasn’t forgotten her keys. After I accidentally locked myself out of the car a couple of times during a stressful time, I switched to locking the car from the outside with the key. It couldn’t  be in the ignition, if I had to have it in my hand to lock the car. "
661,"&gt;On one of her pictures where she was riding a bike, he commented ""teach me how to ride!""... he knows how to ride a bike.

He wasn't talking about riding a bike. He was suggesting that he be on top of her.

You are the girlfriend he is settling for temporarily."
662,"Neither of the examples you gave paint you in a bad light, but definitely paint HIM that way.

For one, if he didn't want to walk over and listen to the pharmacist give instructions, he should have sat down and waited for you to finish and let you communicate the information to him. Instead, he asked you if he should come over and it was absolutely reasonable of you to suggest that he does come over, as he's been known to nit-pick in the past and might have a  question for the pharmacist that you didn't think to ask.

For two, he's a godamned adult. If he tends to sleep through his alarms, he can set a second one. Or ask you to come check on him if he's not awake by XX time.

It sounds like he probably has some communication/anger issues that he likes to take out on you."
663,"Well, you're not going to be happy.  Getting a visa and leaving your family would be very difficult but you CANNOT deny your heart's desire. You may find some happiness in your current life but it is dull next to what you could feel if you were living as your true self.  I won't pretend to understand your difficulties but i can confidently tell you that your plan well not work and until you are able and willing to be true to yourself,  you will only be so 'happy'.   

I wish you luck in your endeavor. "
664,"Honestly dont tell anyone, it will change your relationship with everyone.  

If you tell your bf you will never know if he stays with you because he loves you or your money.  Wait until you are in a long term, preferably married a few years before letting it be known.

Just invest it very wisely (conservatively for now) and dont trust anyone especially your local friendly investment advisers, seriously they will be like sharks with blood in the water.  

Maybe do some basic financial investment training so you know when you are being told bs or not.  "
665,I wonder how comfortable the other wife would be if she knew about this almost affair.
666,"Husband is probably oblivious to Flora's flirting.

""OMG you're soooo buff. Do you work out?""

""Uh thanks. I run and lift a couple times a week""

""Wow. That's soo cool. What's your gym like? Do you get all hot and sweaty there?""

""It's a really good gym for the price. They've got a lot of good machines, and if you go anytime outside of 11-1 or 5-6 there's never any wait.""

""It sounds so awesome. Can you take me sometime?""

""I think I'm out of bring-a-friend days, but if you want I can ask if they're still doing a $10/month no-commitment special"""
667,"Your wife is right to put her foot down. It's nice and pretty normal to swap costs for things like dinners, holidays, vacations, etc. But you shouldn't be paying your parents back for doing things that they agreed to do, like paying for school, or things that are expected, like helping you after your accident. She is putting a monetary value on your relationship. Don't play that game. "
668,"Your boyfriend is immature and overreacting. You DID say I love you too, and he refused to believe you. Plus, if you don't want to say it a bunch in front of your parents, that's ok. Giving the silent treatment while upset is not ok. "
669,"It's not hard, you just get to remove her from ""friend"" to accuaintence and if people ask you can tell them ""She disrespected my relationship, that's all I have to say"". "
670,As they do. That’s why I quoted :).
671,"&gt;Girl wants me to stay living with her after cheating on me due to our business, her kids and our friendship.

Why do those things matter so much to her now, but they didn't matter to her when she cheated?

I encourage you to grow a backbone, find your self worth, and move out/move on with your life."
672,"&gt; or she's the side chick.

Or someone else is the side chick and he doesn't want her to know about OP."
673,"&gt; ""I would never bring up separation in a fight."" 

He doesn't take you seriously because you brought it up in a fight. So don't, and bring it up again while calmly sitting him down. Use your words to show him you're serious."
674,"""Granny... what kind of memories do you want to leave me with? 
Because almost every time we see each other, you call me 'ugly' ...and make me feel upset with you.  Do you want that be the last thing you ever say to me? ""

Then leave the room.  "
675,"I think you know it's time to break up. Sharing your private pictures with his friends is a **serious** breach of trust. To continue doing it after you confronted him and then lying to your face about it, even worse. This isn't something that can be talked about and solved. 

When you show shitty people that you'll stick around when they treat you like shit, that's who they will continue to be.

You deserve better, go find better. "
676,Thanks everyone. I'm just going to ask him about everything in a non-confrontational way and guage his reaction. We haven't really had any problems in our 7 years of being together so that's why I'm a over-reacting a bit and he is quite friendly with Flora.
677,"So, you paid more than his rent for half of his space? This bouncing around is not good for you, stay with your parents' offers, without being in their home. Your BF seems to not keep your welfare as a priority. He's 30 and can't keep 1 small room not disgusting? Being a little messy is one thing, but it shouldn't cost 3 days to clean up. Who owns the dogs? The roommates seem intent on loading you with bills, so you were right to gtfo. 

From now, your bf comes to you and he does his half of the chores. If he wants to give away money, he can, but you don't owe him. "
678,"Jesus, seriously. This guy is repulsive. "
679,"Hi there - I'm a 19F who plays a lot of the same games as you, although I have been gaming for most of my life. Your boyfriend is, quite frankly, being a total asshole, and you need to address it before the problem persists and gets even worse. Playing video games with your SO both competitively and non-competitively is a great way to bond; it isn't fair that he takes the fun out of it for you. In fact, not only is he taking the fun out, but he's degrading you. It's horribly rude, and you need to bring it up. If he sees that it's okay to act like this while gaming, why would he not start to act this way in other areas of life? I would basically tell him what you told us in this post: that he makes you feel horrible due to his harsh and vile attitude and comments, and that it needs to stop immediately. If the problem persists, I would stop playing video games with him altogether.

I play Overwatch almost every day, and I'm a diamond tank/healer main, and let me tell you, your boyfriend is NOT that much better at the game than you. The difference between high silver and mid gold is so small. He is going out of his way to insult you and act superior, when really, he has almost no leg to stand on. If he really cared about your gameplay, he would try to help you learn the characters you wanted to play (like Winston), instead of forcing you to play the traditional ""girl"" characters like Mercy and Moira (not that they're anything wrong with playing them - so long as it's your choice!). If you ever need someone to play comp with or give advice on how to play tanks, I'd be happy to play! :D Just PM me.

Tl;dr: You need to address the problem with your boyfriend before it gets worse. He also has no leg to stand on when it comes to insulting you, because your skill level gap is so small. Feel free to PM me if you'd like to play a few games of OW/PUBG, or if you'd like gaming advice."
680,"You are not over reacting. Reading your post I was absolutely horrified on your behalf. 

Your partner grossly violated your boundaries and betrayed you. He needs to learn how to stand up to his fucking parents. 

If I were in your situation I would absolutely tell his parents. They purposefully violated your boundaries and deserve to know that and feel guilty enough where they won’t do it again.  "
681,"This is helpful, thank you. 

I'm rather wondering if it's the latter, that maybe your wife is seeing something that you aren't in your interactions with Jan. "
682,Can you give an example of what she does to upset you? 
683,Omg..  I haven't laughed this much for a long time.  too funny
684,Dude you are being so intentionality vague in every comment and your post that it only makes you appear suspicious in my eyes. 
685,She’s going to be pregnant within a month “accidentally” if he doesn’t kick her to the curb. 
686,"Yup. My friend's husband started telling me how unhappy he was with his sex life. Turned rather quickly into, well you must be unhappy with yours too because both our SOs are British and the Brits are cold fish, right? I left before he got the the part where he suggested we soothe our woes together by banging. I am not friends with anyone in that circle anymore. OPs husband sounds like a tool."
687,"He doesn’t have to like it. As long as he is respected as a stepparent, he has to get over this himself. It could be some disconnect in not being bio-dad, perhaps he’s resentful that you have to pick up the parenting slack. But these are kids. It doesn’t matter who is doing what, it matters that it gets done (at this point). 

He’s annoyed. He’s irked. Maybe there’s a whiff of discomfort surrounding this heritage, maybe not, but the fact is he’s entitled to feel however he likes. The mistake he is making, is that he assumes that his uncomfortable feelings require a solution from you. And they just don’t. Sometimes we have to navigate hard things, especially in a mixed family with stepkids. 

“Can you tell me why you’re struggling with this? I want to support you but we need to ensure it isn’t at the expense of the kids’ development. I want to work on a resolution together.” "
688,"Most of our finances are seperate.  I'm sure there's a lot there, but I'd also just rather get what I put in and get out as fast as possible.  

I'm moving into the guest room for now until I talk to a lawyer.  Thanks for the advice!"
689,"You can't be upset with her for the behavior of other people. She didn't ask for this guy to call her at 3 a.m. so don't punish her by being upset, that's controlling and insecure behavior that will ultimately push her away and make her resent you. "
690,"This. Destination weddings are really just for the couple. They are kind of a fuck you to anybody but the most immediate family. Unless you run in wealthy circles you can't reasonably expect more than 10 people to show up.. 

OP stay home tell bf you can't afford it AND can't afford to lose the time at work. 

Also life pro tip don't buy plane tickets for weddings on a airline that has change fees. I had a relative cancel a wedding and everybody was out a lot of money on non-refundable tickets, except me. Southwest FTW. "
691,"You wouldn't take your pants off for months, that's a huge neon flashing sign of a damaged self esteem. That is not even remotely normal. Please go to therapy, you deserve to feel better. "
692,"&gt; He’s not a toddler that needs to be constantly entered

:o"
693,"I was married to a Colombian American for 10 years... it’s culturally normal and take it as a sign that they really like you and are happy for your bf.  Sometimes if I felt I was getting overwhelmed by stimulation I would step into another room for a few and relax while they continued chatting. They didn’t find it rude because they knew I’d come back after decompressing and that it wasn’t a slight against them.  His nuclear family consisted of mostly introverts anyway. 

I’d just communicate how you feel to your bf in a way that he doesn’t take it as an affront to his family... it’s ok to decline food (bc they LOVE to feed you... service is a strong love language there)... and try to take their affection in stride. :)"
694,"I guess he's always been like this or similar.

Mom passed away :("
695,I don't think you quite understood that comment. She is telling you who SHE is- someone who prioritizes her chances of being with her crush over the relationship she has with you. She's deliberately hiding you from him. 
696,"It's crazy to think how many posters on here were okay with what the wife did. Now she's escalating by gaslighting OP, and minimizing her actions while taking OP's daughter away and telling OP that they need to work out a time for him to see his own daughter. 



"
697,"The way OP wrote everything reminds me 100&amp;#37; of an ex who was this same way. Like this guy would have absolutely written this post if he could. I said the exact same things he says his wife does because I was just completely frustrated with him and the situation and how I always felt I had to tiptoe on eggshells with him. Unless OP's wife has cheated or done something really egregious and that's what he's asking her to explain herself for, I lean more towards this being condescending and possibly controlling behavior."
698,"She needs to be reported, what she’s doing is beyond wrong and you don’t need to continue paying her to sexually harass you. Find a new therapist, but don’t dump this one until you report her to the licensing board in your area. She’s a predator, don’t walk away without protecting other potential patients. "
699,"3 hours after you had sex - not immediately after.

To me, masturbation is a release and has no reflection on my partner. Sex takes longer than getting myself off in a couple of minutes.

If he were masturbating exclusively and turning you down when you wanted sex, then I would think it’s a problem."
700,"He's definitely the ""Oh your boyfriend doesn't let you have friends?"" type."
701,"Agreed! It's not that he's necessarily involved with anyone else *right this minute*. But he wants any hotties he meets to be able to look him up online and see a single guy. 

Guys like this want women to be like beer on draft, where they can just open the tap any time they want and get a drink. They freak out if the keg's empty. (And they always have one eye out looking for the next keg, because they are *very* thirsty.) That's why he lost his mind when his supply went away. Now that he has the supply secured, he can take it for granted again.

I promise there are men out there who don't treat women like consumable goods, but like people. You'll meet them after you ditch this thirsty fellow! At which point he will freak out and beg again, because MAN is he parched. But you're wise to him now."
702,"Given that she’s not protecting her own kids from this creep, I doubt that your boss is going to protect you either. Perhaps you should consult a lawyer (or even make a start with r/legaladvice). But I would also look for a new job. Your boss is an enabler."
703,Yeah and I highly doubt his illness forces him to swear at his spouse. That's just asshole behavior.
704,"Yes you should tell her. This woman is a predator and your brother isn't even an adult yet. You should not be losing respect for him, since he is falling for the trap of a person with much more life experience who knows how to 'play' a young guy."
705,"Nah, flags are too revealing, these are red full body suits"
706,"I mean, he's known OP 5 years and been friends with Amy 25 years, plus he and Amy went through a huge loss/tragedy together. That brings friends close."
707,"It sounds like he's the one who isn't managing his time effectively, since he relies on you to provide him with free time by doing his chores for him.  I'd recommend you stop doing that.  

Stop shopping for him, stop cleaning for him, stop cooking for him.  When he complains, quote him the local going rates for housekeeping, personal shopping, and personal chef jobs in your area.  Receiving payment for all the (currently unpaid) work you are doing would probably be enough to replace your per diem position.  Then you could stop that job and use the free time for yourself.  "
708,"If I remember right, without an outbreak it's pretty stupid to test for herpes. You can get false positives if you've had chicken pox, test positive for both if you have just one, and most people who show the virus in their system will never experience an outbreak."
709,"She’s doesn’t trust you, she’s catty, and jealous. Soon she’s going to give you the ultimatum of stop being friends with Tay or risk losing her. I don’t want to be the one to say dump your girlfriend, but in situations like these, that typically ends up being the outcome. Someone gets dumped. "
710,"It gets creepier when you do the math and realize that at 32 he was picking up a 21-year-old.  Yeah, this guy is 2 steps away from ordering a mail-order bride."
711,"I am 99.99% sure this guy is not 11. He's probably a 40-60 year old child predator. Typical boys at around 11 years old do not have an interest in talking to 9 year girls, and they surely do not ask for pictures and demand for their home address.

Please please PLEASE sit your sister down and talk to her about this. She is still a child and needs guidance and protection. Speak to her as an authority, but ""treat"" her like she is an adult. She will probably get upset about a lack of privacy and become resistant towards your concerns if you come off in a condescending way. If she feels that you are coming from a place of concern while viewing her as an independent person, she is more likely to listen to you and take your words seriously.

There are too many disgusting creeps out there. Good on you for being a good older sibling. "
712,"Sounds like it was something for the household and not a personal gift.

&gt;“we need a new one.” "
713,"Okay then I’m going to do the friend lecture...  If you’re dealing with anxiety and anorexia perhaps you shouldn’t be thinking about adding children into the mix.  You need to get yourself to a good place first.  And I hate to say it but if you have been dealing with anorexia then, depending on the severity you may not be physically well enough to have kids.  Get yourself to a happy, healthy place and then look around for someone to have kids with.   

And this guy... oh honey...  you should choose a partner who you know would be there through the worst of times with your child.  This guy is barely offering to be there during the best.  What if you baby was born with a disability?  What if you had twins?  What if he lost his job?  What happens if your child is exceptionally gifted and needs special schooling and support?  

The truth is that no parent has the answers to how they’re going to cope with those circumstances.  We just don’t know.  It’s not possible - so you pick a partner who will be at your side to help you figure it out.

And the Mum coming to stay for six months thing....  she’ll be in her 60s at least so be prepared to have vastly different ideas on how to be a good parent to your child.

You’re 21 - go out have fun, find a good therapist and think about giving the ring back.  "

715,i have been practicing mindfulness and meditation for several years but sometimes come across something that reframes it all for me... imagining my intrusive thoughts as a toddler yelling POOP for attention is a game-changer. thanks!
716,I like the idea of having a frirend over. This is what I must do when I get back. 
717,"&gt; Should I tell our mom and let her handle it?

Do you want to burn any bridges with your sister for the next couple of years? Because this is how you burn any bridges with your sister the next couple of years. Just tell her you found it, you're not going to ask questions but she can come to you if she has questions/concerns. "
718,"I totally get it's a point of pride for OP not to mention she's adopted. They're her real parents as much as anybody's. But the interaction when her mom first came is exactly why you need to mention it. You have to be totally oblivious not to realize 99&amp;#37; of people would not automatically assume, 'oh, my GF of 7 months must be adopted and this must be her black mother.' Meeting an SO's parents is stressful to begin with, and setting someone up like this is a recipe for disaster. The PTSD aspect makes it even worse she didn't mention it. The adoption aspect becomes important when it's something that can't be talked about openly without potentially hurting her mother—he would have had no way of knowing that.

Obviously the BF made incredibly cringe-worthy comments, but it was a collective fuck up. I would just try to move on"
719,Get her to therapy before this turns into some weird Munchousen by proxy situation.
720,"Nope, get out. Your husband sounds like he's gotten waaay too comfortable. They're a safety net for him but you need to put your foot down.

He may like having mummy &amp; daddy in his grill 24/7 but you need to make it explicitly clear that you cannot live like this anymore. 

Tell your parents and whoever else that you appreciate their concern but that you don't need babysitters. They clearly aren't that concerned with your mental health if they want you to remain in a harmful environment.

Put yourself first. "
721,A devout Christian that is divorced and barely present in his kid's life. Sounds like a peach.
722,"‘It’s ok sweetheart let’s FaceTime daddy and he’ll sort it out’

Then when he comes home after a night shift he gets to ‘hunt monsters’ with ‘monster spray’ then camp out in the cabins at night to prove that it’s safe."
723,"You came on way too strong and weren’t able to gauge the situation well. You were not in a relationship with her and should have treated this as a first date. Would you immediately go in for a kiss on a first date and state that you expect to share a bed with her? Her whole body language indicates that she was uncomfortable. Women are socialized not to be rude so she was probably trying to figure out the best way to exit this situation. You definitely shouldn’t have gone for a kiss so soon or insist that you have a “big bed” when she CLEARLY did not want or expect to share a bed with you. At the first sign she was uncomfortable or shifting her body away from you, you should have adjusted your behavior to help her feel more relaxed, like reassuring her she doesn’t have to drink if she doesn’t want to or that you’d take the couch. Next time instead of thinking “this girl is so gorgeous what can I get out of it” think about how a young woman might feel meeting a guy for the first time and how you can make her feel like there’s no pressure for her to stay or be intimate if she doesn’t want to."
724,"A. You can ask her for a reasonable compromise. If she hates cooking, fine, but if you don't like fast food, maybe she can make sandwiches, pick up a bagged salad from the grocery store, or keep some reasonably healthy, low-prep frozen foods in the freezer or cans of soup in the pantry. Maybe you can agree to fast food once a week or once every couple of weeks instead of every time. 

B. Sure. ""I don't feel like Subway. Go ahead and pick something up for you, and I'll throw something together for me.""

C. Probably not? If the issue is that you just think she's living incorrectly, then you shouldn't try. If the issue is that you're doing more household labor, have a chat about how you can balance that out. "
725,"&gt;I finally took his clothes to the cleaners yesterday and they have a one day turn around so he only needed an outfit for today. This is the part that IS my fault. I had put one of his shirts in a basket with my undergarments to be washed on a delicate cycle. I forgot to do it. I realize it sounds like I’m making excuses here, but I’ve been working a lot, I do everything around the house on my own and had quite a few extra things to take care of in preparation of our move, also on my own. He has other shirts to wear but this morning this one would have looked best with his outfit.

You don’t have to beat yourself up for forgetting to wash a shirt. It seriously isn’t a big deal. Everyone forgets to do stuff around the house sometimes.

&gt; When he asked for it, I checked the laundry room and apologized for forgetting to wash it. He said, “I’ve been wearing filth for a month and I can’t even have a clean shirt?!?” 

That’s a really inappropriate thing for him to say, particularly after you had already apologized. 

Does he not know how to work the washing machine or something? If wearing this one special shirt was so important to him, then he should have washed it himself (or at least physically checked to see if you had washed it the night before). 

It’s totally normal to drop the ball on housework sometimes. Literally everyone does it. What’s not okay here is that you are apparently in charge of all of it, and also that he’s nasty to you when you make mistakes. He should be pulling his own weight, and he should also understand that you are only human and will not have everything perfect for him all the time."
726,It seems like he's here only to get more skills on how to control her just based on which comments he's replying to. 
727,"Your boyfriend sounds a bit like a pompous asshole honestly - he only respects people with higher education and a high salary and he's essentially trying to gaslight you into believing that's the only way to be ""successful."" There are many people who don't have the resources to go through higher education and are still successful. If I were you, I would definitely leave him because I absolutely can't stand that line of thinking.

You shouldn't think you're worthless in a relationship just because of your job or salary and your partner shouldn't be reinforcing that idea. "
728,"&gt;Public shaming for being a creeper isn't the worst thing in the world. 

Honestly it should be done more often. I get that it might be awkward for someone in that situation to put it out there like that, but at the risk of letting that type of behaviour slide it's only making the problem worse. I'm not trying to blame the victim but I don't think there should be a stigma attached to getting creeped on like that.

"
729,"Ugh yes. Whenever I hear someone talk about how pregnancy is so beautiful, etc. I roll my eyes. The heartburn never went away; I never got heartburn before I was pregnant, and now I have a three year old and hate myself after I eat something too acidic. Once I hit the last trimester, I was hot *all the time* - and I'm usually freezing, and it was the middle of winter. The fatigue was so bad I could barely stay awake some days, and I could tell that I was being irrational and hormonal but couldn't do a damn thing about it (which of course made it worse because ""why am I crying over this? this is so dumb? why am I so dumb?""). Not to mention being as big as a house and having every acquaintance, plus plenty of random strangers, suddenly think that they got to dictate what I was/wasn't allowed to be eating or doing.

That was a rant, sorry. But I totally agree; the mystique of how beautiful and magical and great it is to be pregnant/have a child does women a huge disservice."
730,"I stopped having time for ""secret relationships"" around the 10th grade. If they don't want anyone to know you're together, there's going to be a reason, and it's not going to be a good one. My money's on a girlfriend in the other town he keeps visiting (without you, of course), but even if it's something else, it's going to be something like he thinks you're too ugly for him, or not smart/accomplished enough, he's bored on Thursdays, or he's just using you for sex.





Hop back on tinder, this one's a dud."
731,"I agree that she was over the top, and crossed a line in talking about your family that way and bringing up a potential break-up like that...

...but she’s had a horrible infection FOR A MONTH! She’s at her worst! Regardless of whether your actions impacted her illness, she’s really really NOT WELL right now. Presumeably she has new antibiotics that are probably making her feel worse, instead of better on day one. If there’s ever a time refrain from analyzing exactly how she handled communication about something that you largely agree with... this is the time."
732,I just feel terrible for OP.  Wish he divorced her before his career took off.  Let alone the complete manipulation and mental abuse that she has put him through.
733,"This is going to be awkward no matter what. Tina sounds like she is just not getting the social cues and is probably super lonely. It’s really hard to make friends outside of work. It’s really hard to make friends at work. To potentially have no friends and to live alone would be pretty terrible. If the culture is to have company gatherings, I personally would go to a brief happy hour or something with the group, because it could immensely positively impact this woman’s life (you never know, she could be a lot of fun outside of work). But it’s your decision not to and it’s fine.

Keep the chatting about out of work activities non existent. There is no good reason why Tina should know about this activity that you and Jen are going on, especially since you know that Tina is going to hint. In her head it may be really hurting her feelings, even though it shouldn’t. 

Hopefully Tina finds Bumble BFF or meetup or something.

734,First post about condoms to make me say Aww.
735,"Nooo, you did no such thing! You need tools to hang pictures on the walls and curtains/blinds on the windows. You needs tools to put nicer knobs on the closet doors and the bathroom cabinets. It's a cheapish fix that really brightens a place up. 

She may be too inexperienced to know these kinds of things but that's no excuse for her behavior -- her rudeness, her lack of grace, her bad manners when you were kind enough to give her a gift, then to carry up all her boxes. This is a serious character-revealing moment. 

How serious are you about her? If you're really smitten, you should take some time to think critically about her behavior. You sound like you have been charming through this. She does not."
736,As a gal who married someone ten years older than me I am finally realizing this 😒

738,"The main reason why I think your mum has increased her uptake is because she HASN’T been receptive to any attempt to securing the pills or figuring out what is really been going on. 

If she accepts your suggestions then she has to face head on that it can ONLY be her. You have been an addict in the past so you have a better insight than us - it’s easier to blame you in her mind than it is to face the reality that she is addicted to the pills. I don’t think she is intentionally alienating you but it’s the side effect of her rationalising the situation in her mind - unfortunately you were previously an addict so you were the easiest target in her mind.

She has never been like that because she has never been addicted to pills until now."
739,"If you’re not emotionally involved, great. Still, if your pregnant wife is being hormonal or insecure and wants you to dial it back, you dial it back, bro. Don’t admit to anything you haven’t done, but do what you have to to make her feel safe right now. "

741,"My cousin was basically OPs wife 15 years ago.  Her child is scarred for life and completely socially stunted after having spent so many years being told he has Asperger's (that no one except her ever saw any signs of) and having pills crammed down his throat that he didn't need.  He seemed like a normal kid back then, now he is an adult who will never be a functional member of society."

Besides, she is only trans in her private life and still presents as a man and uses male pronouns in professional settings.

Wagging your finger at people for perceived slights is nit picky and obnoxious and does nothing to encourage inclusiveness."
744,"Did *you* read the post?

He just said it was her family's house. That doesn't mean there isn't a lease or that their finances aren't co-mingled.

750,"I’m not sure she’s being money grubby as opposed to feeling like a chump? It sounds like she shared her inheritance with OP completely, and is upset that instead of sharing it with her, OP wants to share his with his brother. 

The house alone is probably worth more than OP’s inheritance so she may just be feeling like a schmuck for treating her partner like the top priority when it came to her inheritance and now finding out that OP’s brother, and not her, is OP’s top priority. He has this chance to essentially pay into the relationship in the same way she has and he doesn’t want to. It’s for noble reasons and I think OP’s instinct to share it with his brother is a good one, but I wouldn’t assume wife’s feelings are coming from a money grubbing place. "

753,"If he started doing this recently, I think he should talk to his doctor. "
754,"I once led the charge on a similar life change with my partner at the time (not a tiny house but just as drastic of a change that involved selling our home and almost everything in it). He went along with it and didn't communicate with me that this was not something we both wanted, but to be fair I deep down knew this was something I wanted much more than he did. I was SO fixated on the novelty and romance of this lifestyle change that I was super selfish and didn't take his discomfort seriously. The result was that he did not adapt at all to our new lifestyle, quickly grew to resent me, and while our relationship would have ended anyway for lots of reasons, my pushing this big change hastened the end in a really unpleasant way.

That said, you need to communicate to him that you guys are on the same side. You both want the freedom of owning your own land and building a home. You are open-minded to the idea of living a less conventional lifestyle. Be positive and focus on the goals you have in common here. Then be clear as day that a tiny house is NOT an option for you whatsoever. Present alternatives, including trailers, earthbag houses, whatever is doable for you but still meets your joint goals. If needed, write it down in a letter or suggest a couple of meetings with a couple's counselor just to get on the same page. He needs to feel like even though this one aspect of his dream won't be happening, the bigger dream will be."
755,I’d give up on getting him to change his mind. Only have the baby if you are okay with doing it on your own. 
756,"Yeah. Sorry OP, but this wouldn't even have become an issue had you listened to her wishes about a baby shower, instead of planning one because you just wanted to. Why couldn't you have just had a little celebration at home with the three of you and her kids? I don't mean to be harsh but you were just as inconsiderate (although well intentioned) as the shirt giver."
757,"OP, you cannot stay in this relationship because you’re worried about hearing an “I told you so.” Your boyfriend has 0 respect for you. An “I told you so” is far better than being with such a pig for the rest of your life."
758,"The moment people realize what she has she's going to get sudden lawsuits popping up in front of her face. Telling people you won millions is like putting chum in a tank of sharks.

She will always wonder if her BF sticks around because of the money. OP, your relationship with your BF is too young to handle this kind of information. Definitely start paying equal split expenses instead of proportional expenses (say that you made a wise investment and it's enough for you to carry more financial burden). But otherwise I wouldn't say a thing about the money to him until you figure out your housing situation and have most of the money tied up in investments.

759,"It's because he has no social life that he doesn't understand.  
  
&gt; He has no friends he hangs out with  
  
Does he not get along with his colleagues at work?  
He likes fishing. Did he not meet people/make new friends during fishing?  
  
Anyway, tell him straight up that you want some alone time and that he should respect that.

Edit: your partner comes across as kind of needy/dependent on affection(?) I wouldn't be surprised if he keeps texting you during work hours."
760,"If I was your girlfriend, I'm not sure if I would get over this without you cutting off your terrible friend. Because if I was your girlfriend, when your friend said ""OP is likely to cheat,"" I would have a VERY difficult time believing that this didn't mean ""I know OP is a cheater because he's cheating on you with me teehee."" Dude, I don't think you understand how bad this looks to your girlfriend. Especially because you tried to shush her halfway through the sentence...you really fucked up, both with how you acted in the moment and in allowing your friend to make these comments many times in the past. If I was your girlfriend and you were like ""well it would be hard to stop being friends with her,"" you'd be extremely single and I'd pretty much assume you were indeed cheating with her."
761,"You know it's not normal for your boyfriend to be a jerk when you give him things, right? Yeesh, he sounds like an asshole.

You can definitely do better."
762, another tell tale sign of serious manipulation. That's not ok and you deserve better. 
763,"I know, it seems so ridiculous! But she’s acting like an obsessed ex girlfriend!  Lol...it’s all I can do to not make a “Fatal Attraction” joke."
764,"I saw one for sale in my area today. $60,000 for 280 square feet. Oh god, no. I don't ever want to get to the point where I have to decide if having a piece of mail is going to be too much for my home."
765,"I have to wonder what he is referring to here:

&gt; He said he's compromised so much for me, that I have to do the same for him. I understand it, I really do.

That makes him unwilling to do long distance for 6 months max. Either he is completely unreasonable and selfish and there isn't actually anything he compromised or there is a lot of stuff unsaid in your post from your history together that makes his stance much more understandable.

I feel like most couples would be fine with LD to take care of a dying parent at the point they are in hospice and truly dying for a few months, though not the ""lol whoops they lived another decade"" kinda deal. So I have to wonder why he isn't willing to let you go be with her for a few months. Has she had '6 months max' before/multiple times or something?"
766,"Also, have you missed the whole #MeToo thing?

Think of it as

767,If I was the girlfriend in this scenario I would have probably ended it just because of this friend. She's clearly into op yet he keeps her around and wants to apologize to her? She can have that mess 
768,You should explore why you felt like it was okay to treat her like a human doormat. Give her some space and work on yourself/make reparations for treating her like garbage for two years.
769,"I mean, that's  theft. Proving it is the problem.

If you can't prove it, you can't get much in the way of help. You can get small claims, but it's your word against hers that the money she spent was the same cash that was yours. You might convince the judge that it is though. 

Otherwise, you're screwed. Even if you call the cops and there's enough evidence for them to arrest her, you aren't getting the money back, or the car."
770,"&gt; He might be getting a bit of an ego boost perhaps

I think you nailed it on the head here. It's his first ""real"" professor position and he's probably flattered by the attention. HOWEVER...

&gt;she started stroking his arm, something he did not stop.

If he doesn't set boundaries with his students then it's almost guaranteed to snowball into a problem that will eventually end his career. He's young *and* he's new. He's going to be heavily scrutinized if and when the rumors begin. This girl has already made a passive aggressive comment about your relationship in regards to the professor/student forbidden relationship. That signals a bit of jealousy, and jealous people can be vindictive.

In my opinion, you're focusing on the wrong issue here. Your main concern is the flirting, but you should be worried about how his reputation is going to suffer if things get out of hand."
771,[removed]
772,"Yeah, I am not a fan of super strict parenting, but this is *very* hands off. Even the stuff about studying (she will get a nasty shock in college when she realises she actually has to study and do assignments and she hasn't learned *any* good study habits at all! Many kids can coast through high school and get good grades, but most of them struggle transitioning to college.)

And it'll be doubly hard for her to use her smarts to do well in life if she has a baby this young. OP might think he's setting her up to be happy and free, but he may be setting her up to struggle *really* hard in adulthood.

Please rethink your laissez-faire parenting, OP, and actually give your daughter guidance, and some structure.

Edit: also something occurred to me is that teenage pregnancy is riskier than say, pregnancy in your 20s. Teens have higher risks of high blood pressure during pregnancy, preeclampsia and possibly postpartum depression. It is not something a 15 year old should ideally be going through - their brains are nowhere near finished developing. If she is really opposed to the idea of abortion, then that is that, but if not, it is the most rational choice in every way."
773,"I wonder if he’s decided that the relationship is over but is too cowardly to actually do it himself. He’s definitely pushed all the emotional labour onto you, as if you have any to spare in the first place. 

I think you should do this by text, if only because that seems to be your only option. I would keep it short but honest. Something like:

“Boyfriend, I’ve just been through a really horrible week and you offered little to no support. Given how disengaged you are from me, I think it would be best if we broke up.”"
774,Exactly. OP is not paid to be on call! 
775,"Honestly, it sounds like you two are having two different conversations. 

He's not trying to say that your views aren't important or that you shouldn't discuss politics; he's saying that he's more immediately concerned about your marriage. He's telling you that he thinks you aren't dedicating enough time to the family unit; of course he's not going to participate in discussions with you when you are actively disregarding his opinion.

Arrange one night a week where you spend time doing something with your husband that doesn't involve politics at all, whether that's a movie, a walk in the park, cooking a meal together, anything. Do not use social media on that night at all. Spend time talking with your husband about concerns, feelings, family, hobbies, other stuff aside from politics and start to maintain your relationship outside of political discussion. He is your husband, not your audience."
776,"You're not wrong per-se, but you know, you could be more empathetic with his GF. You know your intentions but she doesn't know anything about you, I think it's very weird that talked to you about this, this is something she needed to discuss with her partner.

Anyways, If I where in your situation I'd just try ti be friendly with the GF and maybe talk to her in person to ease any tension there might be. Maybe stop hanging out in person for a few weeks and then maybe the thrree of you could meet up and talk. It's annoying I know but do it for your friend, plus, it'll make her trust yiu so it's bettee in thw long run."
777,"It's worth the time and money to find a good therapist.  It seriously changed my life.  I see a lot of similarities between your and my situation.  What it's worth, we'll be celebrating our 15th anniversary soon and I'm so so so happy with everything.  Good luck. "
778,"This is not your problem to solve.

She has her standards, and she is not finding any dating candidates who meet those standards.  She can choose to either maintain those standards, knowing that the dating pool is limited thereby, or she can choose to alter her standards in order to have a broader pool of potential dates.  

But that's all up to her, and none of your concern.

If you want to remain friends with her, then simply do not engage on this subject.  If you do not want to remain friends, then move on.  But either way, leave her dating life and choices to her."
779,He's actually staying at a hotel room and not talking to you over this? Does he do this frequently? Is actually discussing issues like an adult too complicated for him?
780,"Yeah... OP please report this to police, at best he's a creep, at worst he's a serial killer. And I wouldn't confront the man either with your father, brothers etc, this guy could be dangerous for all you know... I'd also see if you can get pepper spray and/or an escort from school to home in case this creep escalates his behavior. "
781,I think what you are feeling is natural. It's really hard to totally remove yourself from this situation when you feel like all you do is work your tail off. But I bet had you been a fly on the wall during Charlie's interview you might have been impressed. Pulling that kind of stunt off takes serious skill. You make it sound like his soft skills are at 100% You also make it sound like they're a major reason why you love him. He may be extremely cavalier but I'd imagine his charasmatic style makes him well like and an effective leader. 
782,You need to end this relationship for good. Your gf doesn't seem to respect you. 
783,"&gt; I say “I’m sorry for X, and I recognize how much pain that caused you. I’m going to do a, b, and c to make sure X doesn’t happen again.”

If she truly doesn't understand what's upsetting you or why, she can't really apologize in the way you'd prefer even if she's willing to try. It's pretty much impossible to think of ways to make sure that something doesn't happen again if you're clueless about what you're trying to avoid. 

I think some examples might help. If the conversation goes something like 'I don't like wet towels on the bed' and her reaction is 'well, I can't see why that would bother anyone, sorry though' it's different from you being upset about more vague issues/things that are open to interpretation like 'I feel you're not giving me your full attention' when she feels she is (true or not).  


"
784,Why are you still with someone who clearly doesnt care about you anymore?
785,But nobody wants to see it!
786,"I can see both sides here. Honestly I'm surprised, I thought this was gonna be all about him harping on race based on your title, but from what you described it seems that it's just adoption in general that fascinates him. Pretty much of all his questions were about adoption, not race. Also, while his reaction to your mom was rude and *possibly* racially motivated, I could also see myself snapping at a presumed stranger who just came and sat themselves at the table without saying a word, if I was having a bad day. I would be like who tf is this person who obviously doesn't know us. Clearly he was expecting a white woman which I think is understandable since you never disclosed that you were adopted.

I agree you don't owe anyone an explanation about your parents' reproductive story, but I'm sorry you do have to expect that your boyfriend of 7 months is going to be surprised and intrigued when he finds this out. I feel like you're taking your principles there to the extreme a little. Sure, most people don't need to know, but it might be nice to mention it to the person currently closest to you. It's not a big deal, or anything you need to ""disclose"", or info you owe your boyfriend, but it's a little strange to completely omit that, and then spring it on him at dinner. I guess that's fine if that's what you wanna do but you can't really be upset if he expressed interest. THAT SAID, I want to be very clear that his interest went over the line of acceptability.

So again, I see both sides. I think his behavior was rude and his questions were really over the line and excessive, but I guess I'm saying I don't think he's got racial hang ups like you seem to be implying. I just don't really get that feeling, but then again I wasn't there, maybe there's a reason you think this is racial. I think this warrants a discussion about how he made you uncomfortable, and if he apologizes and doesn't do it again, then let it go. However, if there were a few choice comments that truly disgusted you (like asking about your mother's infertility) then you are well within your rights to break up if you so choose."
787,"I would go get tested immediately. There is no explanation worth hearing. “Hey dipshit, reimburse me for STD testing,” is the the only thing worth saying to him. "
788,"He's 27 and has done *nothing* with his life thus far. He simply doesn't have anything to show for years of adulthood, which means he will never be financially successful to a great degree. When asked how he got his start or what he was doing in his early 20s, he'll have nothing to say. He's build no platform, cultivated no network. He wants to stay at home and be taken care of by Mommy and daddy. That's the end of the story. 

A 27 year old only dates a teenager if there are things so profoundly wrong with them that they're fundamentally incompatible with women their own age. They're also creepy as shit. This dude is a loser and a dud. Definition of scrub. ""Always talking about what he wants then just sits on his broke ass."" Do you want scrub? No, you dont want no scrub."
789,"Yea... OP and her friends sound mean, or the stereotypical “soccer mom” who had kids and all of a sudden the world revolves around the kids.

Since when are Santa stories, in PUBLIC, weird? Does everyone need to tiptoe around playing pretend with strangers’ kids? 

Who cares about her stories about riding without a seatbelt!?? I’m sure in some parts of the country they still do this, in fact! I’m not sure it’s some horrible crime. I’m sure lots of kids in the country are continuing to grow up riding in the back of a pick up.

On vacation I once rode on the top of a humvee, in the desert, with obviously no safety belt. Am I a horrible person too? 

No offense to Op but imo her entire story was full of over reactions.
And if these are the WORST examples she could think of....give me a break.

Op, the world doesn’t change just cuz some people had kids. And tbh I think it would be better for MANY kids of today if they were treated less like delicate glass and more like humans."

793,"She’s very right, and reading all your comments here I’m surprised she stayed with you as long as she did and kind of sorry for her that she wasted her time and didn’t get out sooner. No offence but you sound like a pretty crap boyfriend."
794,"And as someone who dreams of working from home, if my spouse ruined it, it would ruin the marriage because I would resent the fuck out of them.  I would probably consider seperation before going back to outside work if they couldn't pull their head out of their ass.  "
795,"I'm usually someone who believes men and women can be friends, including with exes, etc. I also tend to think jealousy is based on lack of trust and/or insecurity.

However, I agree, her behavior is sketch and it gives an indicator of her intent."
796,"this\^ seriously, OP! That was kinda effed up."
797,you could say... a very merry unbirthday huh
798,You are completely in your rights to not conceive on your MIL’s schedule. The tough part will be dealing with pressure from her and possibly the rest of the family.

807,"All the points in this comment chain are good - and I just wanted to add: 

OP your husband does not seem to care about his own personal, physical well-being, or your emotional well-being. Both are concerning, but I'm worried for your three year old. 

Does your husband stop your daughter from engaging in equally reckless behaviour, or does he encourage it? If she had hurt herself similarly would he rush her to the ER or would he be distracted by climbing trees then as well? Will he enforce helmets, seat belts? 

At the absolute very least the two of you need to have a conversation about how you'll be handling basic safety measures with your child, but I really think there's a deeper issue here."
808,"I was in the Navy, and everything you said rings true for me.

My wife has accused me of taking new jobs at random three separate times. But each time was a calculated decision over several months (or a layoff), which then resulted in me looking for a new job, that then pans out over the course of several more months.

Yes, we talk about it, but she never takes it seriously, then I have a new, better paying job ""out of nowhere."" I don't believe in staying loyal to one company; it's not the 1960s anymore, nobody is going to give me a gold watch after 20 years. She sees staying at one job as stability, I see it as limiting my income potential.

I'm actually looking at jobs right now that could result in getting a 50% raise. I'm keeping my wife in the loop every time I apply to something new or look at a new area to relocate. She will still come to me in a few months and say she had no idea I was even looking, and why would I, what's wrong with the job I have?"
809,"I feel like the people in this sub use the word 'confront' way too often when what they really mean is approach and discuss. There is no need to be confrontational at all, especially in this situation.

You need to tell your husband that 'Dylan' has now called you on several occasions saying that he believes that he and Flora are having an affair. Tell your husband that someone told Dylan that they saw your husband kissing Flora, that Flora has condoms and has been checking hotels out, and that you have confirmed with your calendar that you know there is no way he is doing this but that you are telling him because you are being bothered by the calls and accusations when you are confident he would never do that.

I say to phrase it this way because it sounds like you know your husband isn't cheating, there is no reason to approach it like he needs to defend himself, because he doesn't as he has done nothing wrong. 

Do not go on a stake out, talk to your husband. I think it would be best if he limited contact with Flora for the moment so her husband can move on to the next suspect. For all you know she is using your husband as a target for her husband to focus on while she is messing with other men."
810,"&gt; I asked her last night .. do you still want to marry me.

This ... doesn't sound like a proposal. At all. What do you mean ""still""? Were you already engaged? Did you do anything like buy a ring or formally ask her? If not, this was just as low-effort as your entire relationship. I'd be insulted, frankly — like this is just something you said because you felt her pulling away and wanted to use some kind of carrot on a stick to lure her back in, without actually having to do anything like change (or really propose to her). Just empty words.

Looks, it sounds like she's checked out, and with good reason. You took her for granted and that's the consequence. This may be too far gone to save. You put your friends/yourself first and allowed your mother to call the shots about the trip (which is absurd).

Learn from this. You're way too old to be letting your mother control you or tell you what to do or not do. Anxiety is legitimate, but if you can't do things like travel, you need to be treated for it and learn to manage it. It sounds like you're way too afraid to ""leave the nest"" and that's unhealthy at your age. You need to gain independence before you can have a healthy relationship, so start there and work on that.

&gt; I assumed she was too in love with me to ever leave me. And I really do love her, despite how my post sounds.

Honestly? It doesn't sound like you do. Maybe that's why you've been so apathetic about the relationship and lazy about spending time with her. You need to be honest with her and with yourself. I've always felt like, if a relationship is important to you, you're willing to put the effort in. If you don't, how much could you possibly really care? If you only want to change because you think she's going to leave, you're not truly ready to change. That should have occurred to you before it got to this point."
811,Agreed. OP you are in a toxic relationship with a person who doesn’t respect you. Leave him.
812,Who cares what others think. If the marriage ended on good terms and you guys have no problem remaining friends then nobody has any right to say a word about it

818,"Something to consider...

Perhaps your wife is taking it as a slight against her (and her family) that as soon as you receive an inheritance your first instinct isn't to solidify your financial security within your marriage... like what she did with the house.

**It sort of sounds like she's realizing that you have different priorities.**  Where when she gets a windfall, her first instinct is to invest in your marriage and the two of your financial future... she may be shocked to find that your inclinations don't match up with hers.  And after the shock of that realization wore off, she got mad.  Because how DARE you just give away $70,000, when she has been investing in the two of your futures.

My husband and I currently live in the house my parents 'gave' me.  It's constantly in the back of my mind how poorly we'd be doing if we didn't have this house.  If my husband received $140,000 as an inheritance, I would absolutely look to be investing that money in our future... especially given the history of one-sided financial contributions up until this point in our relationship."

Secondly, FUCK what they say. Looks fade. You're dating him and he obviously thinks you're attractive, or else he wouldn't be dating you most likely.

Thirdly, you don't need counseling for this. You're 29 and you should be well aware of yourself, how you look, and what you're capable of, what your strengths and weaknesses are, etc. 

There's always someone who will be better looking than us. There's someone better looking than his ex, and looks are a subjective quality anyway...

Just enjoy your time with him, don't worry about it. 

Edit: ALSO he's 35, so he's probably more concerned with more important traits like personality, money management, mental stability, etc. Things that make a good wife/mother/partner. He's at that age where he should be (if he's smart) evaluating his choices of partner on aspects other than her looks. "

844,"You get to decide who you want to be friends with and who you don't. 

Frankly though, I think you're being irrational and utterly unfair to your wife, who was entitled to seeking advice and having advocates *for her happiness and health* even as you were suffering too. You say you hid your depression well. It's hardly shocking that these friends didn't respond correctly -- to information they did not have. 

The information they did have came from your wife. I can understand being hurt by this knowledge, but what this information really should cause you to reflect on was what your wife went through during this time as well. How profound must her suffering have been for those who cared for both of you to tell her to leave? Pretty fucking profound. 

You should talk to your wife again. You're getting your back up about these friends not recognizing the difficulties you were facing at this time (the difficulties you were working hard to keep hidden from them) but what I see here is your failure to acknowledge the seriousness of your wife's situation. 

I'd recommend you work on letting this go. You aren't required to be their friend if you don't want to be, but you should remain open the possibility they gave good, loving advice to your wife during her time of great pain as well. And simply be grateful she followed her own judgement. "
845,"I typically don’t comment here, but I thought I’d offer some perspective. Your kid is 9mo, right? 

I’m barely 13mo out and I still don’t have my mind or body back. Your wife sounds a lot like me. Postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety hit me so incredibly hard when my son was born last year. It manifested in such a way that I was angry and snapped at my husband all the time. I felt like I was a disgusting blob of flabby skin, and I was still breastfeeding so my hormones were not level at all. 
I felt like I did most of the baby care and house care, so instead of speaking in a calm and rational manner to my husband I got mean. The first year after baby comes is one of the most difficult years you will ever experience. What worked for me, was realizing these mood swings were not normal and I talked to my midwife. I started going to a support group and got on meds. Honestly, it stil isn’t the best 13mo later, but our relationship is better. 

As for sex, I don’t know how her labor/delivery went, but even though mine was relatively “easy” things took a while to completely heal. I sometimes still get random pain and sex feels different from before baby. Also, if she is anything like a lot of mom she may be touched out. Having a little barnacle cling to you all the time really makes you want to have your own space. 

I get that this is a frustrating position to be in. Hopefully you guys can have a productive conversation! Remember, you two are on the same team. "
846,"&gt;We think Jan inherited something from her mother (look at them moms again, passing down genes and behaviors). I didn't know until I talked to my wife (Jan told her previously) that Jan's mom has dissociative identity disorder. So there may be some other identify or behavior emerging when Jan is around me.

That's a huge reach. She's just a woman with a crush, no need to blame mothers or pathologize things. "
847,"Pay close attention to what's being said here. A lot of people are trying to say that whatever is going on with his girlfriend, the problem here is firmly on him. Nobody is going to directly address claims that she's some kind of monster and help you find a way to break them up, because there are several sides to every story and we don't know who's actually making the problem worse in their relationship, but what we can address is that your friend has a serious issue with himself if he's losing his social life and opportunities. 

If he's become so unlikable, t sounds like you're not going to miss out on much but money if he backs out of this trip. I hope if you can't recompense in some way that you learn a strong but unfortunate lesson about investing non-refundable gestures in people displaying these kinds of warning signs. 

But you should make it clear to your friend that he's losing out on things, and ask if there's a problem, make it clear exactly what this mess cost you, and what it potentially cost him. Give consequences. *""This trip cost me XXXX, I won't be doing anything like this again until you can make your own decisions in life again. Something seems wrong. What can I do to help you feel better again?""*

Come prepared with some resources, find some counseling services in your area and get some pamphlets, find out their intake process ahead of time so you can ""sell"" the idea a little easier. It can be intimidating especially when you're already depressed and have little self-confidence. And let your friend know that you want him to get better so you can enjoy life again together.

Let me make this more abundantly clear: **DO NOT MAKE THIS ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND.** Don't mention her in relation to this problem. Don't point fingers. Ask questions but not leading or passive-aggressive questions like ""Is she controlling you?"" 

When someone has a shattered self-esteem and is in even a slightly toxic or abusive relationship, they often cling to that relationship because as odd as it sounds, it's all they feel they have or deserve, and if you attack this person's SO, they will retreat to that person, all her accusations that his friends are trying to get between them will be confirmed or so on.

People don't leave unhealthy relationships until they reach a turning point in themselves. Maybe he has to lose all his friends. Maybe he has to get tired of feeling a certain way every day. Maybe he needs medication and help for depression. There are a lot of things going on here at once but only your friend can make his own decisions. He might not realize this right now, that's why he's *allowing* someone else to make decisions for him. "

No, hes goving you more motivation... You yourself said that you want a skinnier version of you, if that's how youll put it.

Talk about burying the lead, OP. Your stepfather thinks a cat tree is worth cutting you out of his life forever. That cat tree means more to him than you do. (Actually winning an argument is; the cat tree is just whatever he's arguing about at this moment.) Let that sink in. Really. *Think* about this and connect it to why you avoid confrontation at all costs. 

If you're so willing to ignore and neglect your fiance's boundaries to appease your parents, who clearly are ready to cut you out of their lives for a cat tree, get some counseling to deal with this. Stop being afraid of your own anger and their manipulation. "

867,"While there is a contingent of baby-crazy people out there who will vehemently disagree with me, I will say this and hope you take it to heart: 

Your spouse needs to come first. 

You were together before any kids came along and you'll still be together long after your kids have grown up and moved out. No matter how much attention your kids need, no matter how hectic life becomes as new parents, both of you will need to make an ongoing effort to continue tending to your relationship *as a couple*. That means dating each other, doing nice things for one another, making time to listen to one another and provide emotional support. It means being affectionate even when you're tired and touched out and refusing to let your sex life fall by the wayside. If your parents and in-laws are nearby and happy to babysit, then don't be afraid to let them so that you can spend time together as a couple, even if it's just relaxing at home together. 

As an added bonus, making your marriage your top priority will be good for your kids. They'll grow up in a household with parents who provide an example of what a healthy, loving marriage with spouses who prioritize and respect each other looks like, and that will make them better able to find it for themselves as adults. They'll also grow up with the understanding that they aren't the center of the universe because the household doesn't revolve entirely around them. "

871,"As a manager of an older employee who loves interrupting others, is very stubborn, can't follow direction, and requires a lot of micromanaging, I understand your frustration. While I like to think 59 is still pretty young in the grand scheme of things, John's mind may be starting to decline a bit, particularly given the death of his wife. Please exhaust all options before firing him, as it sounds like he's actually a good salesperson and overall friendly colleague. Maybe you can make some small accommodation for him, like moving him to a more secluded part of the office where he cannot overhear other conversations.

If you cannot accommodate him in any way, I would at least give him the benefit of one final, stern warning, and make the consequences clear. Maybe up until now he has thought these are just suggestions or opinions. Be explicit: ""John, I have discussed with [the boss], and he agrees that this is a big problem. You need to stop doing the following things [outline specifically what he needs to do]. Failure to improve will lead to termination—that's how much this issue is affecting the team. You're a valuable member in the office, and it would be a shame to lose you over things I know you can improve.""

If you're heading out to lunch, and he won't shut up, don't let it bother you. It actually sounds kind of funny! Just say bye and walk out. It doesn't seem to bother him that he's talking to himself for 3 minutes, so don't give it too much importance. 

Approaching old age, losing your family, friends, and your health even, can be a lonely journey. Seeing everyone at the office, and feeling like a productive member of society might be unimaginably valuable to him. My employee enjoys his work, is always on time, reliable, and he is the most positive and genuinely nice person I've ever met. So long as he's not totally destructive of business (he's not), our team is willing to make a few accommodations for him, which sometimes include all of us doing a little more work. The way we see it, it will all come out in the Karma wash. Best of luck to you! "

874,"I’ve grown up with people like Charlie, and I understand it would be easy to hate and feel extremely bitter but it’s easier to admit that your husband has redeeming qualities to him. 
He wouldn’t have gotten past the interview if he was hopeless, and he wouldn’t have gotten promoted or kept the job if he was as stupid as you give him credit for. 

He sounds really intuitive, and someone that makes decisions on feeling and intuition rather than planned out courses of action. 
Which in this case has done extremely well for him, and me barely knowing the guy feel happy for him. 

I think the problem you should be looking at here is more the relationship you have with your husband and feelings of resentment you have with him. You sound extremely bitter, I might understand more if this was a sister but it’s your husband and you should not be holding feelings like this for him. It’s toxic and will most likely ruin your relationship in the near future "

I’ve been in an abusive relationship. I’m not unsympathetic. However, given that counseling is off the table, as OP said, there’s really not much more she can do to make this a healthy relationship. Yes, yes it’s very sad that OP’s husband had an abusive childhood and all that, but for Pete’s sake, dude is 33! He doesn’t get a lifetime pass to be a manipulative asshole and use his wife as an emotional punching bag because his mother had BPD (well, according to him, anyway). 

He’s well past the age where a person should take responsibility for himself and his behavior and stop blaming a shitty childhood. That’s just an excuse at this point. Ultimately, he’s never going to change, become less abusive, learn to communicate respectfully, manage his own emotions or truly mature and grow if he refuses to do the one thing that could actually help him to make positive changes in his life and relationships. 

Tl;dr: OP, you need to cut your losses, take this relationship as a learning experience and ditch this guy, or else accept that this is what your life and relationship will look like, because he’s not going to change. "

887,"Something to add to this, and OP should explain to his wife, is that when you have the ""perk"" of working from home, one of the downsides is that you need to work harder to prove that you are still worthy, and doing your job.

Too many business need you to be there from 9am-5pm, and as long as your body is there, they aren't really judging you too much on the amount of work that you get done.  If you are very efficient and get it all done by 2pm, you can't just take the rest of the time off, you need to be at the office.

When you work from home, not only do you still need to look to be ""available"" if they call you at any time, but the quality and quantity of your work usually needs to be higher.  If you miss a deadline, they are seriously going to be questioning how much work you are actually doing.

Another suggestion is that even if she's in the next room, if she has a question for you, text it to you (just like if you were at the office).  When you have time, you can answer that, or come out of the room to speak with her."

I read your previous post and when people asked you why you were breaking up over a five month trip you said:

&gt; We've done long distance twice before and decided that it's a deal breaker for both of us. 

If there was something more to this, like someone(you) cheated/had an emotional affair/did something sketchy, I'd understand why she felt upset that you completely misrepresented the situation.

Anyway, this is just the internet and no one knows you, so use that to your advantage. It's ok if updating this post helps you vent and let off some steam. In fact, it's much healthier that you comment or post in forums when you feel like talking about this subject rather than write to your ex(me, and probably most people, have been guilty of doing such a stupid thing one time or another).

It *is* your mom's fault. Your mom emotionally neglected your sister for her entire life, and now that she knows why, she believes the neglect she has gone through is deserved.

915,"&gt; my partner can speak odd words here and there but wont

Everyone commenting that your children need to be polite and use a common language are correct, but this is partly on your partner. He's been with you for 6 years; the children have been speaking this language for those 6 years too. He hasn't bothered to learn more than a few words, and has only recently expressed to you that he resents the children using it? That's shitty. And as others have pointed out: he's the adult here. Your children are 9 and 10. They're going to be thoughtless and even rude sometimes. That's normal. It's your job and your partner's job to meet them where they are and to be the adults. You gently telling them to speak English in your partner's presence is a good example of that. Your partner not wanting this language spoken at all in your home is not. "

/u/BestFriendLovesMe123 that wedding needs to be *cancelled*! He's in love with another dude; it's fraud for him to marry his fiancee without her knowing. And will be all the more painful when the marriage doesn't work out like she hoped.

Imagine 12 years later, after birthing two babies she finds out her husband is active on gay hook up sites?

&gt;Should I mention this to his fiance?

Give him the opportunity to do so. If the wedding draws near and he hasn't, then tell him yourself."
917,While I agree that counseling would help... that might be hard to manage if they’re already struggling to make mortgage payments. I’d recommend he continues job hunting and wait until securing the new job for marriage counseling if it’s too much of a hardship now. 
918,"PREACH! The world could always use more heros, not whiny DPS mains"
919,"I think the mistake was compromising your career over his in the first place. I feel like now you'll resent him and he has the financial upper hand in the relationship.

If I were you I'd broaden your job search, maybe you could sell your art/skills online so that you don't have to move? Maybe you could do this as a side job while working a day job as a waitress? I would say don't compromise for his comfort again, you need to do what's best for you."
920,"Don't hurt her feelings just say:

""I'm really excited for you to join us, I don't have enough in my account to book the flight you want at the moment, so here's the details. Let me know when you've booked it. It's going to be awesome. Can't wait, see you soon."""
921,"&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I need tangible proof that I’m appreciated.&lt;&lt;&lt;

I honestly don’t think a ring is going to make you feel any more appreciated honestly, I think there are other issues here."
922,"See, you say that now, but mean sumbitches have a nasty way of hanging around for way longer than you want them to.

If he's gone short-term, then your problem solves itself, which would be great. But you have to plan for the long term--and long term, your dad is going to want to see your kid. If you don't want him to, it might be time to say, ""Dad, I don't particularly want you in my life and I don't really want you in my child's life either."" He's welcome to rant and scream and rave about it, but grandparent's rights are a myth and you don't have to listen."
923,"My previous job had me traveling quite a bit to the point where I missed birthdays, anniversaries,  etc. We also moved across the country at one point and three days later I left for six weeks and left my wife and daughter to unpack and get settled while I was in another state.

My wife always understood that it was part of the job and eventually I'd get to a point where I didn't have to travel as much. She understood and was grown up about it. That's the cost of having a career, if he doesn't understand that he needs to figure it out because it wont work otherwise."
924,"Is it possible that after this vacation she came to a greater understanding of you and Jan's friendship? Like before then, she may have assumed Jan had a 20% kind of picture of you as a person. But throughout the week she realized that Jan knows you much better than she previously thought, and that realization is messing with her head? 

Most of my and my partner's close friends are people we've known for at least a decade- takes awhile to get to know someone really well. If my partner had a female friend of ten years that knew alot about him I wouldn't be sweating it. But if it was a NEWISH friend who suddenly seemed to know a ton about him I could see where the feelings might be coming from."
925,"Ok, so he's gone full weeb. You never go full weeb. 


Just wait, it should pass soon enough. 


Also get some videos of him for science. It should be fun blackmail material in a few years."
926,Not necessarily. She might just be dumb. 
927,"Emotional affairs can be just as, if not more damaging to a relationship than a physical one. IF he's telling Amy things he never tells you and opening up to her in ways he doesn't with you, there's a good sign this is an emotional affair- either way, the important thing to take from this is that you would like your husband to be as open and loving with you as he is with Amy. Talk to him about this. "
928,"Your friendship will likely not endure once both of you find someone else.

So it's now or never. Make a decision."
929,"This is very important. The fact that you are doing this will be a huge selling point on your right-out-of-school-resume. Going to your brothers wedding won't make as much of a difference in his life, as going to the festival will in yours. "
930,"God that's mysterious. Does she mean there was something unethical about them getting together, like one of them was with someone else at the time? Or is it like a class/caste/race thing where their relationship is looked down on by their families? "
931,"So have you jerked off in the shower just because, you know it would be convenient and quick?  Do you think she’d get up in arms about that?  Do you consult her every time before you masterbate to get her permission? Because I am going to bet not. 

Sometimes women just want to do it alone because it is quicker, less sweaty and it’s all about them and not having to worry about someone else getting off.  And she knows which spots to hit and for how long without having to explain it. 

Sorry, it’s not about you so do not get your feelings hurt. There’s a time and place for sex with your mate and there’s also times when you just enjoy a solo trip. Does not make it wrong. "
932,[deleted]
933,Honestly this is the BEST housewarming gift and it’s also a pretty common one.  I would have been THRILLED to get this.  
934,"Can you be a little more specific? Like a cleaning device? Kitchen tool? 

Literally any kind of genre of gift, because it seems like the problem is what you gave her, if she already had one and “we need a new one” which indicates it’s a gift for both of you, not just her. Or else its kinda useless to analyze your post "
935,"&gt;I'd be ok doing long distance if she understood that I don't like messaging or phone calls

But without messaging or phone calls, or frequent in person hang outs (since it’s long distance), then there no longer is a relationship, LDR or not. No wonder she doesn’t want to do that—messaging is like the very bare minimum of an LDR."
936,"Yeah seriously, “ok let’s be long distance, but without the calls. Or messages! Or sex!”

So...strangers?"
937,"It sounds like you're doing the best you can, for now. Stay civil but impersonal, and do as much as you can to avoid contact with her. Disengage at the first sign of drama and make clear that updates and cute pictures and other things that are a favor rather than an obligation will stop if trying to do something nice for your ex makes your life difficult. 

If he chooses to let the girlfriend mess with his arrangement and make it too unpleasant for you to offer things above and beyond your custody agreement, that's ultimately on him. Whether it's because of a girlfriend or something else, that's actually a problem you've got with him, not her. It's his job to set his priorities. The Why isn't your problem or something you need to be thinking about. 

I'll bet she's acting the way she is because she's hearing endless stories about how every problem in his life is being caused by you and you're an awful abusive person who did X, Y and Z, but then he's also invoking hints he might not be over you to keep her insecure when she's not doing what he wants. He seems like the passive party but based on her reaction to your first meeting, I'll bet he's pulling all the strings, using you as a story character to mess with this girl, and then standing back watching the game of ""let's you and her fight over me"" play out. "
938,"Came to say the same.

OP what your in-laws did was absolutely shitty and you have every right to be angry at them for ignoring all of your plans and boundaries. That said, I think you might be taking all of the trauma of your birth experience and pointing it at them &amp; your husband.

What I'd do now is find a therapist to help you work through that trauma and speak up to your in-laws. I'd say, ideally with my husband but solo if necessary - 

""I/we need you to understand that your coming to the hospital after being explicitly asked not to contributed to the stress, anxiety, hurt, and disappointment of my/our birth experience. It was very important to me/us to have time alone after the birth to bond as a new family. We need to make it extremely clear that when we have another child we do not want any visitors until we call and invite you up. Please do not buy plane tickets and book a hotel so you can be here 'just in case', as that will put pressure on us to invite you before we are ready.""

When she mentions coming to help and take care of your daughter just say ""Thanks but we've got that covered."" 

I'm so sorry for everything you went through. One of my deliveries was pretty awful and for several years I had no memory of the first few hours of my child's life, which broke my heart. If I'd also had unwelcome visitors hovering around, holding my baby when I couldn't, and generally ignoring me and everything I wanted... well I can't even imagine. They can't be trusted not to get ""excited"" and steamroll over your husband again so just keep them away! "
939,"It hasn't always been like this, but we've moved cities a few times and his friend pool has dwindled down to nothing, and he doesn't know how to make new friends. His co-dependence has just been getting worse and worse and I'm just starting to hit the end of my mental strings."
940,"Take the initiative Literally announce your intentions to take care of some of the chores, so that she doesn't have to. 

In my house, I don't really like him indoors to do my laundry, because all care labels may as well be written in Greek to him. So I say ""Have you got any whites you want washed, because I'll put on a load when I get in tonight"" which means he knows not to worry about it, but he also doesn't feel bossed about. 

You should not wait for her to do tasks. It is so much harder for people with higher standards to relax them for people who don't care so much. If you want her to do less, you need to do more. an environment that's not up to her standards is likely to be another source of stress. "
941,"I don't normally advocate ghosting anyone, but I think this guy sounds really manipulative and if you talk to him it just gives him a chance to manipulate you into staying longer. You don't need this in your life, and I PROMISE you that there are better people out there to be dating. He's not the love of your life, he just feels like it because of oxytocin. A little distance and you'll wonder wtf you ever saw in him. "
942,"Just say NO. You're his mother, and I think if circumstances were different and the Grandparents were more involved; maybe... But no. And if they ask for an explanation, you don't need to give them one. And don't let this be an excuse for them in the future to be apart of your child's life. They may and just stand strong. You're doing what's best for you and your child. Also, not wanting to let your child go to church with people who care about him when it's convenient for them doesn't make you negligent. If they think that, I definitely wouldn't want them around. "
943,"Nah, don't. As a gardener, I have a pretty specific idea of what I want planted in-ground, I bet he does too. A potted plant, on the other hand, is a sweet gesture and doesn't alter the actual garden bed."

I just thought of this same thing. I am contacting a friend right now to pass by and check up on things."
945,"This girl has some serious issues. Tell her that her behavior towards you and your husband has been disrespectful and inappropriate and cut her out.

&gt; Mostly I want advice on how to shut her down with the abuse comments.

Don't bother. Just ignore her for the rest of time. She will not stop shit talking you. She's insecure and she's not doing it out of concern, she's doing it to make your relationship seem inferior to hers."
946,Or anxiety has hit late at night and they've been dwelling for hours and hours once the distractions have cooled down 
947,"Never let her plan your wedding. Go to this shitty party and grin and bear it, and imagine how much more horrible it would feel if this process repeated itself for your wedding. Feel lucky that you got this sneak preview of how she acts about big parties. Now you know that if the time comes for you to get married, you cannot let her have any input."
948,"Yes, these are different circumstances entirely. Hell, I’m only 53 and the thought of babysitting an infant or toddler, even part time terrifies me, and the thought sounds exhausting. 

Eventually, a gal likes to get out of the kid rearing business. Let your husband mope for a few days, but if he doesn’t get over it, then he needs a come to jeebus talk. 

Also, never arrange your life with the expectation  of a third party following through.  That’s just a recipe for disappointment. "
949,Have you.... asked him? Had a conversation about it and timeline? Proposals shouldn't be a surprise. You need to communicate to him. Invisible timelines are dumb. Just talk to him like a reasonable person.

951,Age gap: red flag #1.
952,"Same. Always have.

It always irritates me when people think make-up is only for seducing men. That doesn't even make sense. Do only single-and-looking people wear bright lipstick? No. What a dumb, completely unaware thing to think."
953,"I love a delicious grilled steak with a baked potato,  some green beans, sauteed mushrooms, and wine. I'd choose that over almost any meal. 

But sometimes I just LOVE a hot dog.  So fast to make,  minimal cleanup,  and tastes great.  

As much as I love a big steak dinner,  I just don't have it in me to prepare a meal like that,  and eat that much food,  and clean all of those dishes every night.  "
954,"I can tell you, as someone who’s done the “I told you so” walk of shame multiple times, your parents will be more proud of admitting your wrongs than not. I doubt they want to see their child get cheated on.

1. Ending the friendship.

Don't apologize, you did nothing wrong. That said, words aren't going to be enough to reassure your girlfriend anymore, only actively removing someone who disrespected your relationship is going to work."

959,"Check out the book Not Just Friends by Glass, or the book What Makes Love Last? by Gottman. You can also checkit the Gottman institute website for articles on betrayal and affairs.

The most important thing here is not get get defensive, even though that's a natural reaction. Tell your wife you need her to explain what unacceptable behaviors she's seeing. Ask her what she needs to make things better. It may not be about your friendship so much as your relationship with your wife. How much do you prioritize her, focus on her, spend time just with her? Also, consider couple's counseling here."
960,"She was already harrassing you before the diagnosis, and she’s now using the diagnosis to double down on her harassment. This isn’t about her cancer, it’s about wanting a grandchild, and she’s selfishly using her illness to emotionally blackmail you. 

As others have said, she has no right to demand grandchildren from you. 

But think about two additional things: 

1. Are you sure she really has cancer, and that the outlook is as bad as she says? Verify her claims before you believe them. Somebody who will harass you for a baby may be willing to do a lot of other things too. Check out r/justnomil for lots of examples. 

2. If this is all true, you and your husband are in for a gruelling, exhausting, stressful and expensive few years. Supporting a parent with terminal cancer is really fucking difficult! Endless appointments, paperwork, phone calls, errands, assistance, SO MANY bills, housework help, on top of the huge emotional toll of seeing a parent suffer and decline to a shell of their former selves. And then when it’s all over you have to deal with their funeral, their estate and their belongings. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 

Do you and your husband really want to deal with all that and also have a baby you don’t feel ready for?

No matter what the truth is, this diagnosis is another thousand reasons NOT to have a baby right now. "

963,"That was the bachelor party we had for my best friend 15 years ago. We arranged a ride to Dave and Busters, had a lot to drink, played games, went back to this place, did some more drinking and played nerdy board and card games. 

I also think it was more like, ""yeah! Our buddy is getting married!"" than ""this is your last night of freedom to do what you want!""

He's still happily married 15 years later, just last week, he and his wife celebrated with a trip to the coast and fun couple activities that involved seeing lots of different marine wildlife. 

I don't think we would've had as much fun going to a seedy strip club or hiring a stripper to come to his house, and the fact that this was a stepping point to being a happily married husband is surely a part of this successful marriage after all these years. The adventures don't stop when he got married; they just changed slightly so that he gets to celebrate them with the person he loves most in the world."
964,"I partially disagree, but you make a good point.

This is true:
&gt;You're transitioning into being a professional,

&gt; It's a time in your life when you need to show how you aren't a flake and how reliable and fabulous you are in all things work-related.

I disagree that:
&gt; it would be very unprofessional not to go to your festival you did all that work on.

As long as she tells them well in advance and trains someone trustworthy to cover for her, it's not unprofessional to put a sibling's major life event over work (particularly volunteer work, as this seems to be).  And the idea that it is, is a big part of the reason we have issues with work/life balance in America.  Learning now to set those boundaries would also be valuable.

Really I don't think there's a wrong answer to this one as long as it is communicated early and handled well.  (Obviously saying she'll show at the festival then taking off after the 1st half hour to make her flight to the wedding would be the wrong answer.  As would saying she'll be at the wedding, but getting tied up with work at the fewstival and no showing for the wedding.  But those don't seem to be on the table.)
"
965,"My brother, I hope I am extremely close to, scheduled a destination wedding that I could attend.  It was costly (parents probably would have paid for me) but my wife was also very pregnant, couldn't fly, and I didn't want to leave her alone for a week so pregnant.  

So I missed it.  I sent a video speech (I probably would have been best man) to play during the dinner and obviously gifts.  I made sure I was involved in all the other celebratory stuff ( Jack and Jill, reception for people who couldn't go), and all was fine.  

Good friends and family know things don't line up always. Good friends and family can tell when your intentions are good vs bad.  He will probably know you can't make it because this thing is important, rather than you simply not trying.

The ooooooonly thing that makes this kinda waleak is that you did at some point say it was okay.  It's possible that interpret that as ""I'd rather not miss my event, but will if I have no choice"".  So as long as you clarify your decision early, I don't think will be a big deal"

970,"He’s ruining everyone else’s work life. He’s a grown man and shouldn’t be behaving this way at the workplace. Although his situation is unfortunate, he still doesn’t have the right to sabotage the office. 

Perhaps a deeper discussion could be had with him, and more time for consideration could be given before he is fired. He still is bringing tangible benefits to the company if he is that good of a salesman. 

But if the conclusion is ultimately made that this guy is just a shitshow and the company can’t deal with him anymore, OP is not responsible for making sure he is “okay”"
971,Yeah at this point I should probably consider dropping her as a friend. But it’ll be hard since we have the same friends

973,She wants actual proof before blowing everything up.
974,"I am so, so sorry OP. For the loss of your daughter and for what’s going on in your marriage. 

I hate saying this, but I’d consider saying “get help or I cannot do this anymore.” Losing a child is traumatic- I cannot possibly imagine the pain. Your wife is hurting you greatly, it seems, through her inability to process her grief. She’s escaping from her pain instead of confronting it.

Ugh. I feel like this is horrible advice, I just don’t know what to say or what to suggest you do. "
975,"A “strong sense of righteousness”?  Your wife is a frustrated, insecure bully with low self-esteem who has resorted to attacking children.  I think you process it by stepping back and letting the chips fall where they may.  She did this to herself. "

977,"&gt; With this gang’s **immature mindset,** wouldn’t they find it more amusing if two of the dudes got fake married? 

I don’t think the poster personally believes that same sex marriages are funny. 

I think they’re trying to highlight to OP that if the friend group finds the *unlikely* pairing between BF and Sarah to be funny, than wouldn’t a pairing between two heterosexual males be even *more unlikely* and therefore add to the (immature) humour. 

Which goes back to the poster’s last sentence about reasons that no one wants to explain. Like maybe the friends think the BF and Sarah should be together for real. "
978,"OP if you take anything from this thread, please just read through this comment and think through every piece of advice it lays out. You can seriously mess up your life if you aren't careful with such a large amount of money."
979,"Have you talked to your Dad? Does he want to stay married to your mother? Does she want to stay married to him? Is he a good partner to your Mom, outside of the cheating?

I assume she may not be able to engage in sexual activity, so if your father doesn't want to leave her, he's trying to stay sane and stay married by getting his needs met elsewhere. This would not be a bad thing if he had come to an agreement with your Mom about it first.

I can only imagine how much it has hurt your Mom to have her ability to function in daily life stripped away, but there are two people in their relationship and if she can't have sex with your Dad, and that's the reason he cheated, perhaps she should consider making it official that he's allowed to get his sexual needs met elsewhere. You know their relationship - if he's an otherwise good husband and loves your Mom, wants to continue to be married and take care of her, then try to support them in working through this.

Your mom is in a very tough spot and shedding sources of support will not make it any easier on her."
980,"&gt;how do I ask him in a way that makes him never do it again?

Even the hint that you have seen him leaving his feces around should have been mortifying enough to snap him out of this. There is no magic sequence of words that will make him into a functional adult. He knows he’s shitting on the seat and he knows you know it. HE DOES NOT CARE."

985,She has no sense of appropriate boundaries because OP's boyfriend is responding to her advances. It's his job to set boundaries and he's very clearly signposting for this girl that he doesn't have any.

She needs to work on herself, this has nothing to do with her guy, she's her own problem.

Everyone mooning about how OPs husband must have awesome charisma and leadership skills and blah blah is just contributing to this assumption of competency problem.

993,"&gt; That's something only she can decide.

HAVE AN OPINION DUDE. 

You do not need to force her, but you DO need to lay out exactly what the bare minimum requirements of parenting are, and you need to take her to a women’s clinic to have them discuss her options. If she wants to carry this pregnancy to term, she needs to make sure she’s on top of her pre-natal health. If she decides to abort, she needs to know when the legal deadline is, and what to expect during and after the procedure. There is so much information that she needs right now and she’s frozen. That’s where you come in. 

She is FIFTEEN. Not twenty-two. She is utterly dependent on you. She can’t even drive. Help the poor girl, for god’s sake. "
994,"As someone who's close to his age, I think it's really immature to gawk at Instagram models. It's something high school and some college aged boys do, but we've all seen what a great body looks like and it really gets old.

The fact that he's openly looking at them in front of you is odd behavior. Maybe's he's trying to assert his independence or something, but it's pretty abnormal."
995,"This requires therapy. You can't be the one to constantly extract her wants and needs from her, and constantly second-guessing whether she really means ""yes"" when she says it will be endlessly draining and lead to you both to be unhappy. 

This is something it's good for you to be sensitive to, but it also isn't your fault and isn't something that you're capable of fixing. It's also not a framework for a healthy, sustainable relationship. She needs to either make strategies to express her true wants and needs to you, or she needs to seek help in order to build those good habits. "
996,"And that better way would have been to post the screenshots to /r/creepyPMs, so we could all see what a douchey asshole Bobby is.

But publicly shaming Bobby to his peer group will probably prove more effective at curbing his shitty, shitty behaviour. Just less entertaining for us. "
997,"Agreed. I am a straight woman, and if you were reading my group chats or texts, you would find some intense stuff between me and my best female friends. Particularly once we were in our 30s, we just flat-out use our words and express our deepest feelings. I'm actually way *more* circumspect with people I'm romantically interested in. I protect myself with more layers with boyfriends, for a pretty long time. My bestie who I've known since I was 13? This is literally a text I sent to her yesterday when we were freaking out about the state of the world: ""OK my girl. Deep breaths. I'm holding your hands and you're holding mine and we know who we are and what we believe and what we're willing to fight for, and there's nothing they can fucking do to us that would change that."" What I'm saying is, we can get melodramatic and really fucking weird!!! I'm not even going share what she said back to me!!! But I for sure don't want to sleep with her, and I'm 100% sure she's not looking to throw over her husband and son and date me. Women can have intense friendships that are utterly separate from their romantic lives, and defining every intense friendship as an emotional affair wildly misconstrues the function friendships should serve in your life. I only sleep with one person at a time, but I don't get all my emotional support from a single person, because it's healthier not to. 

So maybe she is or was sleeping with Anne. I don't have a crystal ball. But I didn't see anything I'd find conclusive in that email to say ""Oh yeah, they're banging."""
998,"Why in the world would you not greet your mom when she came in, giving your boyfriend a clue? And you didn't feel the need to tell him **ahead of time** about your out-of-the-ordinary family? 

You totally set him up to fail and then just watched it happen. 

You don't *owe* anyone anything, but this is your boyfriend for crap's sake. Cut him some slack.

ETA: This reads like you were testing him, whether consciously or subconsciously, which is really uncool."
999,"Seriously...  Not your kid, not your problem. If your girlfriend wants to chase her tail and keep enabling him to be a slacker, that is their perogative.

Stop trying to parent him. He's an ""adult"" and you are his mother's boyfriend (of only a year).  You are not his dad, nor are you at all responsible for trying to educate your girlfriend's adult son on how to be a functional adult. These problems did not spring up overnight and trying to make other your own personal mission in life to fix this broken person (who doesn't see any reason to change) is only going to make everyone resentful and angry,"
1000,"My boyfriend doesn't love the music I listen to but if I want to play it on a car ride he let's me vibe out to it for a bit like that reaction is so fucking weird to me.

That reminds me of my old roommate who had to dominate everything."
1001,"It's hardly a healthy relationship either way. People don't just get up and walk away after a slight disagreement?
"
1002,"I really wouldn't.  He may be looking forward to planting certain things himself, and anyway, it's not your yard.  If you want, though, I think you could say to him when he gets back, ""Let me know if you ever want to plant some flowers in your garden together - I'd love to help!"""
1003,"This would be my suggestion. A password protected site is important when you have nosy parents. Back in the day I used Livejournal, but if I were a teen now, I'd def use Google Docs."
1004,"you can have whatever emotional reaction you have. but 3K does not entitle you to X number of dates, so put that out of your mind right this second. unfollow this guy on twitter, you aren't doing yourself or him any favors not moving on from this. and his twitter feed is not amazing enough to explain you still following him. move on. "
1005,"You need to contact adult protective services and be assigned a social worker. Nursing homes also have social workers. Start calling, and I’m so very sorry for your loss. This must be incredibly difficult. "
1006,"I think then I'll echo other commenters who think it's worth getting his testosterone levels checked out. However, you two first have to get on the same page that this is an issue at all, because right now it sounds like he doesn't *want* his sex drive to increase."
1007,"I do not share marriage problems with friends and family because of the bias. Rarely will you get good advice. It also ends up coloring their opinions of your SO, and if you end up working through your issues their opinions are permanently altered. "
1008,"I think you're right, especially because it's so clear to me now how badly he manipulated me throughout the relationship. Thanks for the advice :)"
1009,What is this bullshit passive-aggressive method of communication you two have? Perhaps address the issue in direct words instead of dancing around the issue.  It seems like the washer episode is the least of your problems right now. 
1010,Gross. I hope you take all these red flags for what they are and dump his ass.
1011,I hope it came with a fake divorce too. 
1012,"I don't think he can go after your dog if you bought it and paid all the bills etc.

And I think you should still look into his finances - it may be admirable to just want what you brought in but it's also years of your life that he was able to reach higher because he had your support. Take what is owed to you. It is yours."
1013,"I took it very differently. I was imagining she thinks him buying her the tools means he doesn’t want to help her or is trying to distant himself.

It’s a stretch, but it’s the first thing that came to mind."
1014,"“Ex husband, I’m sorry, but I’m not comfortable having that conversation with you”. 

If he’s having issues with the new GF, then it’s on him to see a therapist or couples counselor. Not your circus, not your monkeys anymore. "
1015,"&gt;Well now I really blew it because I actually told him about what happened

So effective adult communication is blowing it now? "
1016,"I've seen plenty pregnant women with eating disorders come through various pregnancy and mom groups and it can be quite triggering in itself (though for some, it can be freeing). With someone like him it would be a nightmare."
1017,"That's gross. My brother somehow leaves a dribble on the seat after he goes and I got fed up with cleaning it up that now whenever it happens I go find him and tell him the lysol wipes are under the sink and he can clean the toilet seat. One time he was like ""Why can't you just clean it up?"" and I went off on him. 

He's 16 so idk if that explains things. I think teens just get gross around that age for some reason."
1018,Right? A little poop on the toilet seat is nothing in comparison to this gigantic turd.
1019,Absolutely 100&amp;#37; this and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
1020,"That right there is your problem. 

It is very rare for one person to get it all right and the other person to get it all wrong. Usually what happens is you're each part-right. For instance, maybe your action would have been the best one most times, but today it was the poorer choice because X. Or your choice would have been the right one if you were trying to achieve A, but today it was more important to achieve B. Or maybe they're right that Z is normally the better choice, but today you chose Y due to an extenuating circumstance. If you go in assuming you're probably both part-right and the way to get back on the same page is to clarify any misunderstanding in the middle, you will go about it very differently to how you seem to be going about it today. "
1021,"&gt; This is her fourth affair since 2014 

&gt; **This is her fourth affair since 2014**

&gt; This is her **fourth** affair since 2014 

&gt; This is her fourth affair **since 2014** 

Do you really REALLY need us to tell you to finally end this charade and move on with your life? Have some goddamn self respect dude. Find a divorce lawyer by next Tuesday."
1022,"This. If the rumors start to spread about Karen your relationship is going to be looked at a lot differently and your boyfriends professionalism the same. Your relationship might be accepted by all the department heads and the Dean of the College he works for but if they start hearing that the reason why Karen is complimenting him so much is because she has a crush on him and or the other students start whispering about them having an inappropriate relationship they might say ""Well, he's dating BFProblems so clearly he has an issue with not having unacceptable relationships with the students."" He's gotta shut that shit down now."
1023,"He waited until you two got married to tell you he cheated on you ! Seriously. That way if you break the marriage up it would be your fault, not his. "
1024,"Same. That was incredibly invasive of him to ask and for you to tell. Jesus. 

And for the record, I didn't start masturbating until I was at least 20 (now 36). I think it's much more common for guys to masturbate in their pre-teen/teen years than girls. Obviously girls do - as they should - but it's probably not AS common given that women are shamed for their sexuality from a young age. Maybe it's different now with social media/feminism, but when I was in high school there wasn't Internet or social media so who knows."
1025,"This sounds very, very much like post pardum depression gone untreated. A big step in earning his trust back, if it's possible at all, would be to start treatment and counseling immediately and apprise him of that process. "
1026,...What clinic only tests for viral infections? Do you mean it was only an HIV test? Most places don’t test for herpes. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are 2 of the most common STDs and are tested for during any standard panel... 
1027,Honestly that’s not a lot of money. Especially living somewhere with a high COL. it’s not unreasonable that you pay for more dates but it should be a discussion and agreement that you both are comfortable with. If she’s pitching expensive vacations that require you to be the sole spender that’s 100% a bad sign and something to be leery of. 
1028,"What did you tell him?

I would show him this thread, just so he can see that it's unanimous agreement that he's being an idiot"
1029,"&gt;That's something only she can decide.

In the end of course she has the final call, but at 15 her brain isn't mature. She will need guidance. "
1030,"If it were me, I'd go out to my car and call the delivery company and explain that your boss is a lunatic and that nothing makes her happy, that Deliverybro is an excellent employee and a true asset to their company. 

Then I would try to find another job and when you do, make sure Janelle's supervisor knows why you left. "
1031,This is the best advice in this thread.
1032,"Seriously. Damn. By the wife's logic my credit card company should just go ahead and charge me for the $400 boots I fantasize about but would never in a million years spend that much money on.

And I'm calling bullshit on the wife. No way has she never fantasized about some hot movie/tv star. I do that 10x more than fantasizing about anyone I know or have been with. She needs to call the thought police I guess since she wants to be the warden of OP's most private mental pics."
1033,"You’re just gonna have to be boring, then.

You can’t really stop them from talking at you, but you CAN stop responding in ways that keep the conversation flowing. One-word answers, blank stares, lots of “huh,” “that sounds tough,” and “how interesting.” Don’t offer input or advice, don’t play therapist, don’t ask questions. Just nod along until they tire themselves out and then leave the room. 

You won’t be living there forever. Focus your energies on becoming independent as early as possible. Zone out when they overshare and keep your mind on school/work/friendships. Your parents will pay the price for this treatment later, right now you need to focus on yourself. "
