0,Yep. I scrolled back up to reread the age and winced.
1,"I don't think the two of you have a future. Focus on your baby and stop trying to be a family with someone who doesn't want to be one.

Because if he did want to be a family, he would have done the work all along."
2,"Honestly it sounds like OP is just mad that able twin is marking out independence for himself. She's clearly resigned herself to a life as enabling babysitter and who wouldn't be envious of someone who gets to live life for themselves.

OP didn't even mention if she's in school, or what her life is like outside of the handicapped twin and trying to be a people-pleaser for the rest of the family. Probably because that *is* her whole life. "
3,"No, the states actually crack down on this now, and the penalties are actually punitive, not just a slap on the wrist. For example, revocation of the delinquent parent’s driver’s license and even jail time. This is because single mothers (and fathers) who don’t receive child support are more  likely to need and qualify for government benefits like food stamps and Medicaid. If there’s a perfectly able-bodied parents out there who should be contributing financially, the government saves money if it can get them to offset all of some of that cost. "
4,"Also why would you want any lawyer Daddy chooses.
  Why should he be privy to your business matters?"
5,Stop being such a doormat and listening to her excuses. She doesn't respect you or your relationship. She has also made it clear that his feelings matter more than yours. It's time to break up with her dude. 
6,Never run into a burning building. You alerted who you could and got to safety. Totally acceptable reaction.  
7,"Sounds exhausting, having to slowly drag your partner into adulthood. Kudos to you for sticking to it. Personally, years of my life arent worth wasting trying to capture some probably false memory of what they were or could be. "
8,I figured there must be some other celebrity named Billy Corigan that i didn’t know about
9,It was three times!!! The gall of this guy is astounding. 
10,"By asking about the caption, she may have been trying to get you to ask her to send the photo so that she wasn't just randomly sending you a photo of herself in a bikini. It may have been her kind of testing the waters to see if you were interested in her and if you had asked for the photo is may have been like a signal for her that you may have been interested in her or a way for her to be more flirty with you."
11,"Hmm. It's early days. Is it possible she's talking so much because the relationship is new and she's not comfortable enough to be quiet with you? Some people find silence awkward in the beginning of a relationship and think they have to be ""on"" all the time.

If you like her a lot apart from this, why not try letting her know that you enjoy just being with someone quietly sometimes (as opposed to saying ""hey, you talk too much"") and see how she responds."
12,"I can't help but pick up the scent of a manipulator. 

The red flag for me is the present is not generously given, but being obligatory, and motivated by the anticipated 'guilt mongering' behaviour from the SO. Narcissistic?

I'd advise to try to have a conversation about how her behaviour makes you feel. Good luck!"
13,"I was your husband.  It took all I had but I finally filed and got out.  

Good luck.  But I’m afraid the damage was done a long time ago. "
14,"Your bf is wrong, selfish, and controlling. 

First off who cares if cousin isn’t close with you, you live with your SO. But whatever, her etiquette failure isn’t the focus here. 

He is going on a trip. It will be fun. With family. 

You are going on a trip. It will be fun. With friends. 

If he can’t see why his stance is ridiculous, that’s his issue. Go. Enjoy."
15,Or just really enjoyed being alone and not answering to anyone.
16,"This! It's the thought that 'if he can treat someone else well enough, why couldn't he do it for me' type of inadequacy. 

Just know it has nothing to do with you, and he is just a shitty person and suuuuper manipulative. 

Ignore him, and focus on yourself and your new bf. :) "
17,"Here's what struck me the most:

&gt;he'll never forgive me for cheating, and he doesn't trust me. He thinks I'm being irrational and throwing away a good thing. 

A relationship with no room for trust or forgiveness is *not* a good thing to begin with.

I had a toxic friend yell a similar line at me once. ""How could you throw this away?""

The answer was, ""I didn't. You did. I'm just putting the lid on the trash can.""

Edited to add: regardless of who did what in OP's relationship, BF's trying to maintain and preserve it the way it is (which makes them both miserable). That's no good for either of them."
18,"Dude, her dad has been downright nasty to her regardless of the mom. Actively cruel about her life."
19,"What struck me about your post was that as soon as he mentioned not wanting to go, you went into full-on attack mode to try and beat him into submission rather than have a good faith discussion. You tried guilt tripping him, and then when that didn't work you accused him of being a bigot, and then when that didn't work you accused him of not really loving you. None of those are acceptable ways to communicate with your partner. 

If it's truly a dealbreaker for him to support LGBT rights but not want to personally go to a pride parade, that's fair enough, but resorting to the type of emotionally manipulative BS you displayed in the argument to try and bend him to your will is not okay. If you had instead tried explaining why pride events have the atmosphere they have so he can understand, or telling him why it's important to you to participate in events, you might have gotten somewhere, but getting pissed off and throwing around accusations and attacks was never going to lead to any result other than this one. "
20,"Same with Poo. My name is ____ and I prefer to be called that. Okay thanks. 


Or hey coworker, can we keep this working relationship professional? I prefer to focus on my work and not work throughout the day. "
21,"This. No one gets to tell you what matters to you. If it matters to you, then it MATTERS. "
22,"Bad losers tend to be difficult and pissy in so many areas of life. When he loses and fails in LIFE, he'll always blame other people, instead of taking responsibility (Google ""external locus of control""). NOT good traits.

^dtmfa"
23,"You're indirectly financing his trip with his parents by paying for his work hotel bill.  That's 300 dollars he should be forking over, not you.  "
24,Yep - I’m surprised I’m the only one in this thread that’s laid out the fact that he gets per diem as a reservist on training if he’s traveling outside his local commuting area.  I’m getting the sense that he’s planning to pocket those funds without telling OP.
25,"What is the income disparity? What are the large bills? Do you split everything including food?

Many couples split rent based on income, others don’t. That is totally up to you as a couple. 

Can you move into an apartment or house that she can more easily afford?"
26,"We're the training wheels girlfriends! Seriously though, why is this so common?"
27,"&gt; I'm exhausted and getting more and more resentful because she won't even discuss it with me. Every time I mention she shuts down. Either she says she doesn't feel up to it and cries and accuses me of mistreating her or she gets angry and accuses me of ignoring her pregnancy and the effect it's had on her. Nothing is ever her fault; I'm always the bad guy.

It seems like everyone saying OP needs to be more understandable seems to be ignoring this part too. If I had a partner that put all the blame on me like this whenever I tried to discuss something, that would be awful. Avoiding communication, accusing him of abuse, (possibly) using crying as manipulation, yikes."
28,"I think the fact that you call someone shallow and immature for having their own sexual preferences *is* immature. You can't force someone to like you, period."
29,"&gt; My landlady...smokes directly beneath my bedroom

She's not going to change her ways at this advanced age, and **she is the landlord**. 

Nothing you can do about it, short of moving. "
30,"&gt;As messed up as it sounds, throughout this whole relationship, I've always thought of ours as ""Practice for me when I get in a relationship with a girl I REALLY want to be with.""

That is, in fact, *supremely* messed up, and you're using her. I'm not sure whether or not the content of your character or being a good person is a priority for you (I'm guessing maybe not) but you've been lying to her and it's not OK. "
31,"and that's totally reasonable, in families where one of the adults isn't *insane*. I have many friends in blended families who do the same."
32,"I’m thinking this is a fetish thing, but the why doesn’t matter. Either way, this is so violating. Hair is so personal (to the point that forced haircuts sometimes count as assault) and sleep makes people so vulnerable. He put his pleasure over your bodily autonomy, because you were asleep and couldn’t say no. I couldn’t ever trust him again."
33,"YES these collection bins are a lifesaver, especially with kids. ""Mom have you seen XYZ?"" ""Idk check your bin."" When it gets full I dump my husband's bin in his home office. He can sort it out from there, and if not, well, his office door shuts and I don't have to deal with it. "
34,"Why would you even want to reconcile?  She's left you for another man, after betraying you, sneaking around, lying about it, and abandoning care of your child.  Even after getting caught, she's done 100% everything exactly wrong for a marriage to have a chance of surviving.

Don't be a doormat.  
"
35,"&gt;What would you do?

Get a time machine, go back a month, break up with your shitty girlfriend, prioritize your poor fucking kids and not sign anything."
36,"Meet my eyeline, Jim!"
37,"All you can do at this point is decide what to do about the baby.  You can abort, put the baby up for adoption, or be prepared to be a single parent.   If you decide to be a single parent, you will have 18 years of him bouncing in and out f your lives, most likely.   "
38,It's one thing to be friends with someone and another to move in together with them. This sounds very unhealthy for your friend but there's not much you can really do.
39,"It's not about the women. Your problem lies elsewhere.

&gt; Then my friend told me that he ""really likes her"" etc... so I just cut ties with her and let them do their thing. She told me she made a mistake and didn't want me to leave her, but the situation got really weird and I was genuinely uncomfortable and wanted to move on, so I did.

&gt; She came over again the next week, but one of my friends directly made fun of her to her face... Berated her pretty heavily for no good reason... I didn't think to really stand up for her at the time, I was kind of awestrucken and am pretty timid.

&gt;  another one of my friends hungout with her the other night and shows off to me about how she snaps him all day. 

Your problem isn't just that your friends are assholes who disrespect you every chance they get - though they definitely are, no mistake about that. It's that you're *allowing* these assholes to disrespect you every chance they get.

&gt;  I'm starting to think they told her some nonsense about me and slandered my reputation with her.

All they need to tell her is that you act like this all the time. Because a lack of self-respect is unattractive.

So:

1. Dump your shitty fake friends. All of them.
2. When you make new friends, let them know when they're crossing the line.

"
40,"I am somewhat surprised by all the comments here. He didn't do anything wrong by having sex with anyone prior to their relationship; however, he probably should have told her that she would be meeting previous sexual partners. Are there any women they met up with that he didn't have sex with?? Not everyone is comfortable with being friends with exes. They might not be compatible. That's okay."
41,For one kid..they must live somewhere very expensive. 
42,"This.
OP, you're honestly better off without your (ex) boyfriend.  

Personally, based on your description of this girl's behaviour, it sounds like your (ex)BF is building things up in his head.  I wouldn't be surprised if he tries to pull you back in, in a few months, because he hasn't managed to convince her to date him.

If or when that happens OP, remember everything he's done.  You are far too good for him."
43,"I get she was abused...but that has nothing to do with her cheating on you. She doesn't value you or the relationship. Also, she wants to be single but is afraid to be alone. Break up."
44,"That is pretty odd, I'm now wondering if she's doing something she's embarrassed about, like only being able to use her home bathroom or something. Unfortunately I'm out of ideas otherwise so sitting her down and explaining how this is making you feel is the probably the best way to go. I will say though that she seems to be consistent at least and it's not just you she's not doing lunch with."
45,"That's fair, but also it has been a decade. I don't expect to go out and have a tattoo of your ex's face/name a week after a break up. But 10 years? At that point you're dragging your feet. "
46,"Dude, your wife is deployed in Kuwait, and you work an overseas job where you are only home a total of 70 days a year? That is too much for a marriage to take. You both need to take a long hard look at your careers and marriage and find a way to prioritize actually living together with your children in the near future. "
47,"Yep, he said she likes to spend the day grocery shopping and cooking *on her days off*, so I also assume she has a real job and contributes to finances. I honestly don't read her as being manipulative based on what OP says, but I do think she has some mental health issues, and she definitely needs to learn to deal with criticism. "
48,This is when simple diffusion would really come in handy
49,"My boyfriend last minute couldn’t make it to a friends wedding so I had a female friend
who was acquaintances with the bride come in his place. Perhaps he can ask a male friend or a friend you are more comfortable with to come in your place ONLY pending that you can’t make it? "
50,"&gt; You seem unduly interested in trying to change how your mutual friends perceive your wife.

DING DING DING! He thinks she's a big fat liar and it drives him crazy, so he wants to make everyone else see what he's seeing. The problem is that what he's seeing probably isn't very accurate to reality. I'd bet good money that he's come to resent his wife for other reasons, and now suddenly her tendency to embellish bothers him to the point that he actively tries to make her look bad in front of her friends. This guy stopped being on his wife's team a long time ago."
51,"I’m being contrary, but what if she knows her cooking is awful?"
52,"No, it doesn't. If the final head count is 100 people, the cater purchases food for 100 people. They plan for servers to serve 100 people. They charge for food and servers for 100 guests. They get paid for food and servers for 100 people. If only 99 show up, there is no additional cost to the caterer. They don't have to order more food, they don't have to pay more servers. There is no extra expense to them, and there is nothing additional to pass on to the customer.

People who don't show up are a reality of event planning, and the caterer has already incorporated that into their planning."
53,"Ok, I am going to be that person and tell you if you can't easily decide between the two of them the answer is **neither**."
54,"No, he likes her this way, because she’s the failure and he’s the expert. She’s constantly begging for forgiveness and he likes it."
55,"Okay. I'm going to try not to project here, but I had a very similar situation with a boyfriend and here's my advice: they are not just friends. 

Sure, maybe there is nothing physical there. Sure, he may not have any real feelings for her anymore. But she has feelings for him. 

I truly believe that men and women can be friends, even close friends. However, I think it is borderline impossible for someone to ever JUST be friends with someone that they were in love with.  

Her excuses for why you shouldn't be hurt (i.e. They were kids, he's hung up on another girl, etc) are deflective and have nothing to do with HER feelings. It's blame placed on him or circumstances. The only acceptable answer is ""Honey, I want only you and am committed to you and our relationship 100%"".

Everyone and every relationship has boundaries. You are allowed to have those boundaries without feeling like you are forbidding any behavior. But crossing boundaries have consequences, like eroding trust. If you don't set and enforce boundaries, she will feel free to continue behaving in a way that jeopardizes your trust and your relationship. 

My boyfriend carried on an emotional affair with an ex girlfriend for all 3 years of our relationship. He hid behind ""we are just friends!"" the entire time. I think he even believed it himself, but he was in love with this girl. She wouldn't have him because of distance, this, that and the other thing. He never made a conscious effort to get himself over her. They never lost contact and neither of them ever respected any healthy boundaries. 

She is telling you how she feels and what she expects your life together to look like. Listen to her when she tells you that you don't understand and decide whether or not you can live with playing second fiddle.

In the end, my boyfriend ended up confessing that he was in love with this girl and that he believed she was his ""destiny "". She still wouldn't have him after we ended because she was too young to commit (still in college, we were in our mid-twenties) and that now that he was single, she wasn't as interested. Pretty fucked, right? 

We had built a home together, we were very serious and I supported him emotionally and financially. He couldn't let go of nostalgia long enough to realize what a mature relationship was like. After the split and the subsequent rejection from her, he came back wanting his life back.

You are not a hotel room, you are a home. You are not a placeholder. Someone will think that you have good bones and will want to move right in. Don't settle for someone who will trash you because they aren't in it for the long term.

"
56,"Just counter with, ""Oh honey but that's men's work that needs a mans touch! It should be easy for you just like doing the women's work should be easy for me."" I mean, bringing home the money is his job according to his idea of gender roles right? 

It's really crappy OP that he's allowed to struggle and be stressed but you're not. "
57,"&gt; like every one says..happy wife, happy life.

This is a gross and patronizing phrase. And if you really wanted to make your wife happy, you'd have done your share of chores around the house without making her ask you repeatedly. "
58,"I think maybe you could have been a bit more reassuring. Of course you're right that things change over time (look at divorce rates), but when she's processing that you're attracted to men and brings up her fear that you might leave her, you kind of reinforced that fear and then dismissed it.

In another thread you expressed sadness that she may throw away 6yrs over this, but you basically said to her that you might throw it away 10yrs down the line. Or, at least that's how I imagine she took it to mean. I think she could probably do with some reassurance right now. If she took your words the same way I did, she's probably devastated that you don't seem as committed as she probably thought you were to the relationship a few days ago. If it is that, I reckon some loving communication would help her process this a lot better. You're right, being bi doesn't make you more likely to leave - she could probably really do with hearing that a bit more, and that you're in love with her, committed to your relationship, etc."
59,"This OP, you are eating up more of her time to win time for yourself. "
60,"Yep, we teach people how to treat us by what we're willing to tolerate.  "
61,"I don't find their behavior to be polite, as you claim in your title, in the slightest. Just because they're not out-and-out mean doesn't make their behavior any less asshole-y. It's bigotry, prejudice and homophobia, it's not polite or kind.

This is the person you have built a home and a life with and they refuse to meet her. That's blatant disrespect. While being angry and bitter isn't going to help, it's OK to not be OK with that. You don't have to be so damn understanding of their bigotry.

Honestly, if I was with someone for that long, had a home and pets, and my partner continued to tiptoe around the issue with their family, I'd be eyeing the door. If my partner wanted to marry me but wouldn't tell their family, I'd be eyeing the door; I would never be OK with being someone's dirty little secret when I was not the problem. You can't make these people accept your partner, but you also don't have to continue to walk on eggshells about this. Your partner should come first. It sounds like it's well past time to take a stand on this and be open with them. Whether they deal with it well is beyond your control, but keeping quiet shouldn't be an option at this point.

If they are unwilling to acknowledge your partner, it might be time to start limiting contact with them. And I would not attend family gatherings where my partner was not welcome. Right now they're essentially making you choose between them and your partner (at least while you are with them), and you are choosing them. You need to take a hard look at your priorities here. You should have your partner's back on this."
62,"Nope, it’s more likely to be autism, given her verbal communication difficulties. All the other symptoms are VERY normal in autism too."
63,"&gt; She doesn't weigh herself no matter how many times I tell her it's essential to keep a log and make sure you're progressing. I am in decent shape at 205 6'2''. I have fitness goals - I need motivation as well, and her laziness is really having an effect on me.

Here's an important point: **SHE IS NOT YOU.**  If you aren't attracted to her because of her weight then by all means leave.  But just because she doesn't keep a log or even if she doesn't care about her weight at all doesn't mean she has to.  People lose weight and get fit all the time without your ""essential"" log.

Sure, it'd be nice if she took better care of herself but only she can do that.  If this means your incompatible, then you need to tell her so and go."
64,"""wants to make his millions before we can start a family"" - gah, why would you even want to have kids with a guy who's got such an unrealistic view of the world?"
65,"So she's lonely because she doesn't see her friends much, and compares herself to you because you spend a lot of time with friends.  She talks about doing something about this by going out with a friend, and you are hurt that she'd rather spend time with someone other than you?  Am I understanding this right?  I'm glad you don't want to stop her from going because that would probably be damaging both to her and to the relationship.

Personally I'd manage the feeling by making an effort to meet her friends, if possible.  Turn them into real people instead of vague threats, and reassure yourself by seeing that the energy of their interactions is platonic.  You can also be honest that you are happy she is going and being more social, but feel a little anxious about it and would appreciate it if she could reassure you by letting you know when she's done at the club - that way you know she's thinking about you and isn't too drunk to remember her agreements (*if* she agrees to it)."
66,Norway. You get full pay for at least a year if you or your child is sick. 
67,I feel like you are making a mountain **into** molehill. I would be seriously questioning why I was with this person. He is old enough to know cussing at people isnt effective communication. I also get the sneaking suspension that this is an overdue or near due essay that's been procrastinated and now he's taking his frustration out on you. 
68,"Not to mention, the single life kinda starts to suck as you get older and your friends start to pair off. All of a sudden, it's harder to find someone to go to the club with because your friend who previously loved going out wants to stay in with their partner; another couple you know is attached at the hip and they do everything together... People suddenly have less money to spend because they're tied up in relationships so you can't just go on a spontaneous road trip because they can't afford it. Not to mention, it's kinda lonely to be the odd one out in that sense. And hookups, well, they feel pretty empty honestly. It's way better to have sex with someone you love than with some random.

Are you sure your girlfriend is the one? Maybe there's some huge compatibility that's lacking there and that's why you're looking elsewhere. It's something to consider."
69,This dude is so fucking dense and just hilariously/pathetically obsessed with giant fake tits. 
70,[removed]
71,"I’m sorry your life has been so hard. You are fighting your ass off though, no words of advice just keep going. "
72,"Not to mention, that 99% success rate is with perfect use. The actual rate is closer to 91%. You're human, and you got unlucky. If after this, you want a stronger form of birth control for your own peace of mind, I'd go with the IUD/implant. "
73,"That's pretty harsh, tbh. We sometimes can't really be blamed for growing up in a society that teaches the values that it does - we can only, once we are aware of it (which OP now is) start to work on it an change the parts that don't help us grow (which OP is doing). She saw that what she was doing wasn't helping her longterm, tried to figure out what she wishes her life to truly be and then decided accordingly. I am rather proud on her because being honest and true to yourself can be one of the most challenging things in life and many people never manage to get there. This is courage - and it's not shameful to be scared some or even most of the time and let that fear make decisions sometimes, that's human. As long as we can pull ourselves together and not let that fear rule us when it is really important, that's already something. OPs SO on the other hand is still seems to be living and breathing that fear and probably can't really let it go to see clearer. That's also alright, maybe he'll see it a bit farther down the road and will be happier for it."
74,[removed]
75,"Such an important point. It’s so easy to “care about someone else’s feelings” when it means not having to change or admit fault for any of your own behaviors. That’s practically a meaningless gesture.

The mark of actual maturity, and actually caring about another’s feelings, is being able to modify your own behaviors to accommodate said feelings."
76,"&gt;""bonus dad""

Ok, that is beautiful. Thank you for the awesome additional role for today's family. "
77,"Some good advice in here. Hopefully this helps too.

Good sex isn't about the thrust, it's about the friction -- the moving against the spots. When taking a woman there are two (three) spots you want to aim for: the clitoris and the g-spots (in the front or back, depending on where you're hitting her). Remember this: when you're with her the pleasure you feel does not equal the pleasure she feels. You might be having the time of your life, she might be bored and faking to spare your feelings.

Sex is a skill that's learned. Any idiot can do it, but it takes skill to do it well. Don't assume you're a master in bed because you can move your hips like a jackhammer. Earn that title.

Now, going back to the two spots, I want you to do me a favour. Find a sensitive spot on your body where the skin is thin. It doesn't have to be sexual, could just be the inside of your palm or your elbow. First, gently tap that, then stop and try lightly rubbing circles instead. That's more or less the difference.

Now, if you translate that into thrusting versus friction you get a sense of how you can stimulate your partner. Find out where those two (three) spots are on her and use the same principle. Angle yourself while inside if you can so you come into contact with that spot as much as possible.

And watch her carefully. With practice you should be able to tell what spots, paces and combinations work well in terms of pleasure. 

If she hits her peak her muscles should/may clench inside. That's how you know you've done it right.

If I'm wrong, do drop me some corrections.

Good luck."
78,"I think that's a record, even for r/relationships"
79,Who loses a bra tho? Shits expensive. 
80,"Honestly, I think the time to fix this has passed, at least for a year or two. You two are about to be parents--she won't have the emotional energy to learn how to be a mom and also start picking up more household duties. Getting into new habits take *work*. I'm not saying that because I think you're wrong, or you don't deserve to equally share chores. I'm telling you what I think is truly realistic to expect in the future.

I think at this point you should consider only tackling the one or two most important changes you want to see happen. For example, throwing away wrappers and trash is something that you could argue for that might seem manageable to your wife."
81,"This! ^^^^ I know you have been planning a wedding, but get married before they do, then have a party and invite them, but don't let them know it is a reception.

Your dad is an asshole for stealing your thunder, call him out on it."
82,"&gt;I seem overly mad about it

How mad are you? Are you lashing out? Because it's understandable that you're upset, I don't see why the adults are telling you to keep calm. I would think a social worker would be more understanding. Why do you have a social worker anyway? Are you sure you didn't misinterpret her friendliness as more?

Assuming you didn't misinterpret, then yes, you are correct to feel wronged. She lied, played with your feelings, and was purposefully mean.

Best you can do is ignore her. The opposite of love is indifference."
83,"&gt;I had to basically have a nuke-from-orbit meltdown to emphasize how serious this was to me, how much it mattered, and how badly the disrespect for my time and effort was undermining the relationship.

Oh man.  When I moved in with my husband, I exploded at him after the third time in a row I cleaned our shared bathroom...and then he decided immediately after to trim his beard and not wipe up after himself.  I literally would have it clean for five minutes only.  I was convinced it was a Pavlovian response - the smell of Scrubbing Bubbles wafting through the apartment meant he needed to trim his beard.

So, yeah.  I would find him wherever he was and state, ""I am about to clean the bathroom.  Trim your beard right this second, or be prepared to clean up to my standards immediately after.""  I didn't care if it sounded pushy, I was tired of cleaning up after a grown adult like he was a toddler who didn't realize that he was supposed to clean up after himself."
84,[removed]
85,"&gt; he wasn’t even with us

Lol, this is unbelievable. But that's why she's staying with you rather than by herself: she wants to take advantage of you and anyone around."
86,"I agree that OP shouldn't be friends with anyone she doesn't want to. I'm just saying that the friend's feelings aren't unusual and don't make her a bad person. Also, it's likely that she thought she would feel something once the child was born and then didn't. "
87,Right?! Talk about back fire. What a narcissistic door knob.
88,"Yeah, I was thrown off by some of that advice. Dude's working two jobs to support them. ""Spend even more time away from home"" or ""Buy a hot tub"" aren't exactly plausible advice."
89,"I agree. It’s not unreasonable to want to meet them, but it might not be about you and your son, OP - it might be about his parents. 

My husband and I were together for 5 years and already married before he met my father. My father was abusive (as well as an alcoholic and drug addict), but was charming as all hell with strangers. I didn’t want the man I loved to say what I’d heard so many times before - “Your dad doesn’t seem that bad.”  Fortunately, my husband saw through his charm without me having to say a thing. "
90,That's why I subbed to this
91,"OK but seriously: NONE OF THIS IS ANY OF HIS FUCKING BUSINESS ANYWAY. It's a set of nicknames!!! what near 30 year old person gets THIS UPSET over something so trivial???

**edit:** I apologize for my vehemence OP, there was this .gif this morning on r/aww of a tiny little toddler who is clearly disabled in some way, learning to walk with tiny crutches, and telling his/her dog about it: ""I learning to walk, Maggie!"" And I cried about it, a *lot*. So seeing that is putting me in this headspace where I have *no tolerance* for people making mountains out of molehills, and that's what your BF is doing. There are bigger problems in the world, and he's wasting a LOT of energy fussing at you about a *nickname* which, according to you, almost never comes up anyway. I would say something different if this was a nickname you guys had come up with for **him** that he hated, obviously, but it's *your* nickname, and you like it. "
92,"This right here is why dating sucks. All the bullshit guessing games, playing coy, trying to feel each other out while not really appearing to do so so you don’t seem desperate. Reading all of this was exhausting. "
93,"&gt;  I certainly could not hand the child over if we shared custody.

Here's the thing:  if you share custody, ***you have NO CHOICE but to hand over the child.***

That's it--unless you have some deranged idea about going into hiding for the next eighteen years, giving your child a deeply warped life in order to show your ex just how much contempt you have for him?  

If he wants to fight for shared custody, there is a decent chance he will get it.  He will certainly get visitation rights because you can't prove he's an unfit parent--and, cards on the table here, **you're not exactly the captain of the SS Excellent Decision Making here.**  You're on the brink of having a child you cannot afford with an extremely squirrely man who dumped you every fifteen days like clockwork.

Get an abortion.

You say you're over this dude, but you're not.  I think having a baby is a way for you to guarantee that this man stays in your life forever:  *he won't be able to walk away now, will he?*  Even if all he ever does is begrudgingly cut you a feeble support check every month, you will be on his mind.  You will be the ghostly third partner in every other relationship he has in the future, an ever-present complication in his life.

Yeah, *he's not walking away so easily NOW, is he?*

Getting ""closure"" through childbirth is not A Thing That Happens.  He's not going to break down and spill a bunch of reasons why he's an asshole and then magically become The Man You Always Knew He Could Be.  At best, he will continue this push-pull relationship until he finds another woman with low self-esteem willing to cling to him because she's sure that it's True Love.

And you want to bring a child into this?  An ""innocent llfe,"" as you put it?

Look, you've already made up your mind to have the baby, so my advice is to make the necessary arrangements to move in with your parents--with any luck, your lease runs out before the baby comes, so you're not on the hook for that.  And you need therapy, ASAP.  You need to figure out why your manpicker is broken, for one, and how to set boundaries, for another (which will be incredibly important once you give birth since there will be *two* mothers in the household and everyone needs to be crystal clear on their roles).

Really, just get the abortion."
94,"Yeah, agree to your edit. Wanting someone who dresses more casual to be in suit and tie all the time is unreasonable and wanting to change them. 

Wanting basic hygiene, sustainable lifestyle and being financially independent is very basic for an adult. It should be a give. "
95,"agreed with this, now isn’t the time to start up doing his chores. OP, I think you should drop doing anything that isn’t immediately necessary (trust me, the bathroom floor will wait, and *nobody* visiting would think to judge the 7 months pregnant partner for a dirty floor), and focus only on your needs with the tasks you do take on. since he refused to take on the laundry, presumably you’re still doing it? just do only your laundry from now on. fuck his shit. since he’s refusing to cook, just cook for yourself. look after your immediate needs and ignore taking care of his, and of anything that can wait. 

if you find you can’t stand the mess and have the extra money, pay for somebody to come do a good deep clean once or twice, or hire a weekly cleaner. he will probably complain, but he sounds like he will complain anyways, and he lost the right to have a say when he ignored your very real health concerns."
96,"My soon to be ex was the same way. Refused to contribute with childcare of our toddler, didn't lift a finger to help with keeping the household running, etc. even though I was the one working and he was a ""SAHD"". I remember having to clean for 6 hours straight one day *while I was on bedrest* because the house had fallen into such disarray. 

A few days after coming home from the hospital I asked for help unloading the car which was full of heavy groceries (which I went to buy myself without him because he refused to come along) and he said no. You know how recently postpartum women aren't supposed to lift more than 10 lbs or do strenuous chores? So did he, but he didn't care.

It doesn't get better with partners like this. It will get worse and worse and worse and one day you will wake up years down the road wondering how the fuck this happened to you. You won't get those years of your life back. Every time I have ever thought ""this situation is untenable and I should leave him"", I should have left. Not once were my instincts wrong but I ignored them in the vain hope he would change. 

He **never** stopped being selfish, self-centered, inconsiderate and lazy. Zero empathy or compassion, zero desire to make his loved ones' lives easier in any way. Wouldn't hold down a job more than a few months at a time, wouldn't contribute to chores and childcare even when unemployed. Eventually he became a vicious, violent alcoholic and I did leave, 7 years into a marriage that was toxic from the get go.

 I was incredibly stressed, I had severe PPD, and I was not the mother I should have been because of it. My kids suffered and I suffered because I was too afraid to walk away and do things on my own. I think about those years and I literally can't remember any of the fun parts of watching the kids grow up, all I remember is how exhausted and angry I was all the time. 

Ironically, once I did leave and I was actually alone, my life got *easier.* Women in online groups going through the same thing had been saying that's what would happen for years but I never believed them until it happened to me. But it did. I was always doing it alone before, but now I had one less person to clean up after and take care of, and it made a huge difference. 

Once I left, he *had* to move out, get a job, start cleaning up after himself and become a functioning person. And he did. Our kids are SO much better off now having two parents that are slowly moving towards getting their lives in order separately. 

Don't make the same mistakes I did, OP."
97,WHOA you should update the post with this. This isn't just being a bit stingy with his money. This guy is going to suck you dry. Do not pay his child support for him what the fuck. 
98,"Great! Then if a pregnant woman can do that then a guy who's not pregnant certainly can! So he's in no way justified in being a sulky little crybaby because waaah!!! He has to get up off his ass and actually do something he's never had to do before. Sorry dear, but guys can justify having no empathy for women - and yes, both you and this guy have no empathy - and afterwards, they can also whine about how confused they are that women either dump them or never want them in the first place. Any guy who gets all smug and cocky about how pregnant women work in the fields and hauled barrels of hay (but isn't intelligent enough to understand that these same women were often the ones having miscarriages or died in childbirth because I guess they don't teach this stuff in certain forums were these types of guys spend all their time) are the same ones who feel far less cocky when women avoid them because they have no value as partners. "
99,"This is what I came to the comments for. Menu gore. My cooking is bad, but this is amazing.

This woman doesn't like food. Neither do I. People who don't like food probably shouldn't be cooks. My whole process is: will eating this stop me from being hungry and not make me actively sick? If yes, eat it. Other than that, what I cook is based on what would be the least work while being somewhat nutritive. Taste doesn't factor in.

I think somebody else was on the right track with the idea that this is her love language-- it's probably some combination of gift-giving and performing tasks for her loved one. Maybe you guys can brainstorm some other ways for her to express her feelings. How does she show friends and family that she loves them?

Also, does she have any other mental health issues? Because her relationship with cooking sounds a little bit like a weird manic delusion. She is just doing whatever science pops into her head and then inflicting the result on you."
100,"I’m gonna third this. Once worked with a guy who definitely “embellished” most or all of his wacky stories, was pretty well known as something of a bullshitter, but it was all harmless and entertaining so he was well-liked anyway. Everyone should have a “that guy” in their life - they add some flavor. "
101,Ghost him but let the pictures be there :) Serves him right.
102,"My mother has a lifelong hernia because my father refused to lighten her burden after she’d just had a C-section. He said she was being lazy. I was so glad they eventually got divorced because it was indicative of exactly who he fucking was in every way.

What would a person who loved you do?"
103,She's just being friendly. relax. 
104,"I laughed really hard at this and now I feel kind of bad. Those are genuinely baffling combinations and of course alternating between being way too heavy-handed with the spices or not using any just makes it even funnier. 

I sympathize with you OP. I know firsthand how wonderful it is to have a woman in your life who loves cooking for you all the time (though fortunately in my case the food she made was really good) and the idea of putting a damper on something you appreciate (the thought of) so much has to make you feel like an asshole, but from what you're describing she sounds more like a mad scientist in the kitchen than a cook. This means you're gonna have to bite the bullet and hurt her feelings. Do so as gently as you can, emphasizing as much as you can how much you love that she loves taking care of you in this way."
105,Might have been a bait and switch. Many manipulative and controlling men and women knowingly put on their best behavior until tying the knot.
106,Did he think he was being like a sexy dominant type? 
107,"What would you do if the mother of the man thinks he shouldn't be doing any chores ? I see my sister struggle with it. The mil is staying with sister and family for 6 months and she hates when her son does any chore. He is meant to not do anything cause he is the man. I feel so helpless for my sister. She works full time, had 5 year old twins , does all the cooking for the kids and the adults as the mil won't eat what was cooking at lunchtime for dinner. She won't and can't leave him and hence it makes her situation so helpless. First of all he sucks at being a partnermche just needed his mum egging him. 
I guess some people just have to live with it if they aren't willing to do anything about it."
108,"Better to end the marriage then have him end your life, OP."
109,"Right? I think it boils down to him feeling less masculine now that OP is more fit, which is super toxic and insecure of him. OP, if you decide you want to stay with him, do NOT let him stop doing what you like and liking what you see in the mirror. I’m super proud that you love yourself and I wish more people could get to that point ❤️"
110,"I could do that at least until our child is in school.

My big concern is that my ex works in a service industry that has him working nights which basically precludes taking our child half the time. He might have to change jobs but he's literally been doing this for 25 years and has no other experiences. He's also going back to school."
111,"I really, really *really* think you should postpone the wedding indefinitely.

Now is not the right time to be getting married and having a wedding. Your fiance is going through an *incredibly* huge crisis. If you get married in the next month, you and your wife will forever be looking back at your wedding as the time your wife was suicidal and depressed, and feeling the crushing absence of her father, or the father she wishes her actual father was.

Please. Save both yourselves a lot of pressure and put the wedding off. Any money you lose on the deposits can be saved up again over the next few years. You only get one chance to be married, and you want it to be when you're both happy, not when one of you is *actively* wishing she wasn't alive.

&gt;she wanted to do all the traditions: father walking her down the aisle, father &amp; daughter dance, etc. While she never had a good relationship with her dad, she always wanted to

Your fiance is clinging to a fantasy. She witnessed her father put her mother and family through hell, but she still wants to have him walk her down the aisle? I cut my father out of my life (and any future wedding I have) for far less, yet your fiance wants to put him in a position of honor at her wedding. She's so fixated on what a perfect dad should be (or what a ""perfect wedding"" should be) that she's clinging to her abuser, even though he has brought zero joy to her life.

Postpone the wedding. Focus on building a life with your fiance in your new home, and getting her the therapy she needs to process a childhood of abuse and fear. Then, in a few years time, when the pain is not as intense, propose to her again, and plan a truly happy wedding that will not be overshadowed by the absence of her father/imaginary perfect father figure, or her own suicidal thoughts."
112,"You should talk to a counselor and see if you can get him continued care. Think about it. This is the result of a brain injury, he can't just be told to change his thinking and behavior and then do it. Talking to him is only likely to create more resentment when the behavior continues. He needs cognitive care and to work with a professional in order to make any meaningful social progress. "
113,"Holy crap you're right! Here I was thinking the same thing, that this was some 17-23 year old kid, and didn't realise that it's a 32 year old loser. 

"
114,"Stop trying to fix everything for him. right now, you're not just his bankroll, you're his brain. And what do you get in return for it? Passive-aggression and guilt trips and manipulation. "
115,"You can be rude. Some people, like me, deserve it."
116,[deleted]
117,"&gt; I think maybe it has more to do with the fact that she seems to have poor coping skills.

Yep. Poverty can have serious detrimental effects on children and it sounds like she needs to start applying some of the drive she got from wanting to get out of it to healing herself."
118,"My advice would be to:

- reset your expectations

- focus on yourself until you're in a better place


Resetting your expectations = accepting that these people will never be the kind of people you want them to be.

It would be great if you come home to a warm, loving family at the end of a hard day. You'd feel listened to and loved and you'd all have a great time enjoying each others' company.

But that's not the reality you have in front of you.

So you might need to accept your family for who they are right now, and deal with them accordingly. That might mean doing everything you can to avoid your sister while living together. It might mean installing a lock on your bedroom door so that you won't be disturbed by the randoms she brings home. 

I definitely think it needs to mean that you stop complaining about your sister to your father. He's made it clear that he's not interested in talking about her, or doing anything about her.  So bringing her up with him again will only hurt your standing with him more.

Start thinking about the kind of relationships you want to have with them once you've moved out. 

Be realistic (I probably wouldn't be counting on taking long, enjoyable holiday cruises together), starting small is probably best.  Maybe you'll take your father out for dinner - just the two of you - every other month or so. Maybe you'll invite him to stay with you in [city you'll be living in] for a couple of weeks every summer.

You can't do anything about the way your father kowtows to your sister's demands. His relationship with her is their business, so don't even try to get involved.

Just do your best to build a separate relationship with him. Buy him an icecream. Take him out for dinner. Ask him about the things he enjoys doing. Ask him questions about what he's done with his life. Make sure you're only talking to him in moments when he's not being immediately stressed out by something (like your sister).


Focussing on yourself = doing everything you can to better your own situation. Make sure you're studying hard (if you're still studying), or working and learning hard (if you're already in the workforce).

Build your savings, move out as soon as possible and then see where you want to go from there.

What kind of life would you like to build for yourself?

Would you like to own your own home and have dogs? Would you like to rent an apartment and have a cat? Live in a house boat and have goldfish? 

Would you like to have a partner living with you? Do you want kids of your own one day? 

Would you like to do a lot of travelling?

Or get really good at art? Learn a language? Move to a foreign country?

What sort of career would you like to build?

What kind of friends do you want to have?



If you're having trouble with anxiety/depression, speak to a mental health professional about what you can do to help it.

Build relationships with people who aren't your blood relatives. 

Start building the kind of future that you want for yourself. 

I want you to be successful and happy, in whatever kind of life would make you happy.

So that when your father asks you for help with your terrible sister? You can feel comfortable telling him ""No thanks"", knowing that even if he never talks to you again - you'll be okay.

And when your father passes away one day (hopefully far from now), and your sister asks if she can move in with you and have you fund her terrible lifestyle? You can say ""hell no"" with ease, and go right back to doing whatever awesome thing you were doing before she called."
119,"I know everyone's saying dont worry about it and it's the coworker's fault, and I'm not trying to get you too worried, but you did say this is a family owned business and everyone is close. 

It might be worth explaining why you were awkward with them *if you feel you want to*. I only say that if it's family owned, and people are fine bringing their kids in, what if coworker and coworker wife say you don't like their kids to the boss and suddenly you have a bad work environment.

I know, it's not cool and it shouldn't happen, but a lot of people here on reddit must live in a nice little bubble. If you feel comfortable, maybe tell your coworker that you were just caught off guard and weren't expecting children around while you worked, but you thought they were sweet and adorable and well behaved (or some bs parents love to hear).

Just giving another view on it."
120,"&gt; Bi girls are seen as hot, cool, desired, sometimes as attention seekers, but not really with...disdain.

Just to clarify, bi women are seen this way by straight men*. Not by lesbians. Bi women dating other women have a lot of trouble because of it.

*(And often it's fetishization more than anything)"
121,"Marriage is a commitment and even if he did still love you that fact he didn't want to cement it was definitely cause to break up with him, I mean 6 years and you'd been living together for a while too I'm assuming what was he waiting for? Some kind of green light to go off on your forehead saying marry you? I married my gf after 3 years (got real close after we had deaths on both sides) at 23. We are 30 now been together for 12 years and had our first son.

 you will find that person who sees you as more than just a commitment but as a companion for Life."
122,"OK, so you guys are broken up, yadda yadda, she's not breaking any laws, but yes, they fucked and your best friend/roomate sounds like a total asshole.

edit: I think you should consider the possibility that your BF broke up with you FOR her. I've defended people in the past who've dated their friends' exes, so it's more about the way they did it - that it's only been a month since you broke up, that they were sneaking around, etc. if it was like a year from now and they started dating without all this shadiness to suggest cheating and stuff, it would be a very different story."
123,"Canadian here.  My parents vacation in Cuba all the time.  You need to treat a trip there like any other trip abroad - do your research, make sure your passport is up to date, understand your obligations during the border crossing, etc.  There is a fee you have to pay as you’re leaving the country I believe.  You should also read up on what money to bring.  But yeah, it’s “just another country” as far as us Canadians are concerned "
124,"If he ever does come back in please let us know what happens! I feel really invested in your situation now lol Btw I agree that he seemed interested from what you wrote, maybe something came up and he couldn’t get back to the store. "
125,"Honestly, I doubt things are going to get much better. It sounds like you and him have different expectations for the relationship - he’s more free-wheeling with how he communicates, and you like to check in more. I have been in both kinds of situations, and it only works if both people are on the same page. A month and a half isn’t long at all, especially if he can’t make the time to check in everyday and communicate with you. Is that really intimacy for you? 

I do the same thing that he does when I deliberately don’t want to emotionally commit to someone. By being difficult to reach and not responding to texts right away, I am trying to manage expectations of how much energy and time I can put into a dynamic if I’m not sure it’s the right one for me. That said, when I like someone and know it’s good, I usually reply to texts right away and love communicating with them and knowing all about their day and feeling close, even if it’s not a long period of time that we’ve been seeing each other. 

I don’t think the issue is whether or not talking to him would make you be acting like a “bitch” - it’s ok to have your own expectations. But I wouldn’t expect that he’s going to change. I would personally cut my losses and find someone who loves communication, since it sounds like something that makes you happy, and that’s ok! Best of luck. "
126,"&gt; I will very likely propose marriage to her in the near future

Whyyyyyyy?"
127,"I had a former friend that made up HUGE lies all the time for attention. One being a fiancé that died a week before their wedding and that evolved to they got married and he died a week after. This person never existed! She thought she would get attention on the “anniversary of his death” every year. Also made up being a doctor (was just a phlebotomist). And tried to convince everyone she was doing chemo when it was obvious she wasn’t. 

Does your friend usually seek out attention?  Because apparently people do some pretty crazy things for it."
128,"Honestly, I would be very wary of anyone who said they cannot think that far into the future. It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to consider whether or not the person you’ve been dating long term would be a good fit for a marriage. 

I had asked my ex the same question when we had been dating for just under two years. The answer never ever changed from ‘I just don’t think that far ahead’ in the entire 4.5 years we were together. 

However, I learned from his non-answers what they actually meant (that he was okay wasting both mine and his time just so he could stay comfortable with his life as it was) and have since applied that to my relationships after. Now I have absolutely every idea as to where I stand with my current partner. It’s up to you whether or not you want to continue gambling your time on a person who can’t even figure out a basic life trajectory after spending a couple years with you. "
129,"I think this is something that can happen with big companies. I work at a world leading multinational engineering and electronics company headquartered in Europe and almost each time when we had a team-building I was both exhausted and disappointed. Instead of getting to know my colleagues better and improve our communication in a chill and fun way, we had all these stupid activities, some of them are similar with the ones you experienced. I honestly don't know why this happens. Maybe it's because of the magnitude of the company - having so many employees makes it hard to do some more customized activities, depending on each individual level. For example, when I started to work here, we had 1 week  induction. During that week we learned a lot of stuff that even a child would know. Anyway, when I started the actual work it got better. Give it some time, try to focus on your work and the reasons why you chose it and it should be ok. But if it still gets you frustrated then consider changing the employer. I know it might be hard to find something else, but is worth the struggle instead of going daily to a job that makes you unhappy. Nowhere is going to be perfect, but at least should be acceptable. 
Good luck! :) "
130,I would be wondering if they have been feeding him information about her all along - enabling whatever need for revenge he has that is driving this 'relationship'. Ugh.
131,😂😂 thanks for the laugh. Yeah as I was typing this out I realize how obvious this is 
132,"Personally? If I was ready to marry someone I would want them to know who I am, who I was and who I'm trying to become. Hiding the hard parts of your life forever isn't very sustainable... even if your ex never comes back and ""warns"" her. 

When I pick someone to be my long term partner they get to know all of my painful mistakes and poor behavior. I want them to know me, all of me. "
133,"First of all how old are you guys? 

Secondly I would say she probably blocked you only temporarily to make a story for a couple of certain people to see, which she specifically didn’t want you to see. Then looks like she forgot"
134,"IMHO. She doesn't have any right to judge you because she's the one who cheated. And not the other way around. Now she's pissed that you've caught her in the act and she wants to cause pain because of it. It's just a filthy way of mjnd games that she's try to pull off. And she basically succeeded because you're doubting yourself. Don't fall for that trap. 

And it's your own choice where when and you want to date. She's the ex. She should STFU. Just that plain and simple.

And block her please. She will be an annoyance if you don't."
135,"Except you're forgetting that excitement/anticipation is a HUGE part of sex for women, and can make up for other inadequacies. "
136,Don't ask her to move in because you feel sorry for her. That has a very good chance of ending with you wanting her to leave but not being willing to kick her out. 
137,Sounds like what he really wants is for you to sit around and watch him play WoW.   Tell him to go back to playing with his friends.  Sitting near him while he is play WoW is basically the same as playing with him except he doesn't command 100% of your attention.  It's not OK for him to demand all that attention from you when he is giving his game 100% of his attention.
138,"&gt;He refuses to exercise but then wants to do all sorts of long hikes that leave us as the latest coming out of a trail because he is slow. I don’t feel he is my equal in fitness to run from or fight a bear.

These are actually good traits in someone with whom you might want to run away from a bear with.  The only thing that matters is being faster than the slowest person in your group."
139,Then break up and let him find a woman that does find him attractive and wants to be physical with him. All the rejection will hurt him in the long run.
140,"If he thinks it's okay to cut your hair without asking, and knows it's creepy so he's doing it when you're sleeping; it's a red flag."
141,"I couldn’t agree more, I just don’t want her to think I’m trying to undercut or take any of her shine away as she’s finally being open and honest with herself about her sexuality. She’s truly been an incredible friend to me and I’be been very unsure of how, when, or if I should bring it up. "
142,I’ve wanted to stop for a while now but when I try by telling my mom that he’s old enough to take care of himself she gets angry that I can’t “do a little thing” for her. And she sees it as me being selfish because I want to go out with friends/my bf instead of looking after him. 
143,[removed]
144,I’ve done that. There is barely any contact at all right now and when there is it is strictly about daughter. 
145,"Haha yes I knew I should’ve included what happened. The dog was original one of her friends’ and she had met the dog once before we took her, so she felt she had more right to keep her than I did. I was devastated to lose the dog when we split, especially that she moved across the country. However in the end it was for the best. I was moving into an apartment in a city that is notorious for being non-pet friendly and she was moving to the country and works outside a lot and brings the dog with her. The dog is living a very happy life and I’ve since gotten my own little rascal lol"
146,"I second this. She will know far better than reddit how to handle this.

She usually tells people to go to their manager rather than go to HR. Since he hasn't sexually harassed you and hasn't targeted you for being a woman or being queer, your company may not consider this to be an HR matter yet.

I advise you to find a woman who has been there a while and get the lay of the land from her before approaching either your boss or HR.  Tell her that you heard Josh doesn't like you and you want some advice on how to deal with him. Ask whether talking about new people behind their back is a pattern with him or whether anyone has had problems with and how they handled it. You have to be really careful who you approach this way bc if the person you pick has never had a problem with him or doesn't see an issue with a 30+ guy hitting on freshman women, it won't help. You want to suss out who is right to approach and then suss out with them whether woman at the company have a problem with him.

Look for male allies to get input from, too, but they will not have had the same experiences with him that women might have, and the women are probably not talking to the men about negative experiences with Josh.

You might find that Josh is as big an ass at work as he was at the club, and then you have material to take to HR. Unfortunately, even in the metoo era, there will still be people, including people in HR, who think that what happens outside work stays outside work and that you are stirring things up at work that shouldn't be drug in. Be very very cautious as you take action."
147,"He’s slowly ramping this up. Look how well it’s working. You limit your time with Sam, you place unnecessary (over the top) boundaries and it’s still not enough. 

You know what he’s aiming for. He doesn’t want you to have this male friendship. Your efforts to ensure he feels respected mean nothing to him until he has exactly what he wants. He’s jealous. And instead of having a conversation, he mocks you endlessly. When you tell him to stop he continues. 

I’d tell him once more: You have male friends and you’ve done all you can to make your bf comfortable with that. You will not end the relationship. You already limit your time. Yet the mockery continues. Why? Ask him. The real answer isn’t that he doesn’t trust you. It’s that he doesn’t respect you and thinks he’s entitled to bully you out of having these friendships. "

150,"Whooaaa, so you actually went ahead with cutting off the mother of your kid?

And this volatility has been going on for **years?**

OP, no wonder your family is ""going crazy"", they are trying to save you from a psycho who isolates you and pits you against your own child."
151,"She sounds kind of flaky, I wouldn't read too much into it.  If she wasn't interested in meeting you bc you were'too far way', you really have to ask, why she even continued messaging you... And how often do you read private messages sent to you from OLD, run it by your friends, *and then let the person know on the other end that you and all your friends think she is weird*...?

No bro, that's seriously childish behavior.  If I even knew that a girl I was dating did this to someone else, I'd probably stop seeing her.

Move on and keep meeting ppl. Don't worry too much what strangers think about you.  Opinions matter when you've validated that it's a decent person on the other end."

153,"Your post sounds like you're equating financial contributions and physical labor.  If he buys the ingredients for dinner, and you cook them, everything is equal, right?  Well, that depends.  Some people see acts of service and financial contributions as different facets of the relationship. 

 To him, cooking the food and buying the food are separate things.  Paying for the meal and planning the event are separate things.  Maybe you do pay more than is being let on here, but it more sounds like you're trying to compensate ""not paying"" with ""more work"".  From his comments, work =/= paying. 

 I would sit down with him and discuss how to better split up paying for things, but ALSO how to better split up the planning/physical labor around things.  Maybe if you each do 50/50 on both instead of 100/0 and 0/100, things would be less strained?"
154,"&gt; ""Oh come on, as if you didn't already know that.""

First off, he is an insensitive jerk, but he has also made it clear that he is interested in this other girl. I would suggest making it clear to him that he will need to pick who he really wants to be with if this relationship is going to work."

159,"As a chronic anxiety sufferer and someone with recurrent depression, medication is what keeps me at a functional mental level which allows me to be in the right place to apply lessons from therapy, to be in the right frame of mind to be able to eat well consistently, and to show up for my exercise classes. All those things she's listing you should still do, they don't cure your anxiety but they do help manage it somewhat. They work better in conjunction with medication. 

If your girlfriend were preventing you from seeking treatment for a constant physical ailment like IBS, would you think that was reasonable? The same logic applies to mental ailments because at the root of it is a biochemical issue that needs to be treated in addition to all the behavioral treatment.

Edit: I saw your comment alluding to thoughts that maybe all of medicine may be wrong about medication for anxiety and depression. While their are issues with over prescription, there is a lot of data to back up usage of it in treating mental health.

Most ailments in order to be treated effectively require medicine (pills/surgery), medical knowledge (therapy /working with a specialist) , behavioral changes (change in diet/norms/routine) , mindfulness (being aware of how your condition affected you in the past, in the present, and in future, why you're doing specific treatments, and how to know when you need to reach back out to a medical professional), healthy diet, and daily exercise. Shift how you view your issue: currently you both see it as default/personal failure/lack of effort on your part and view it as a treatable medical condition that requires changing multiple variables, one of those is brain biochemistry, in order for it to be managed.

162,"I don't even think this is a question of if, but WHEN the IRS catches up with him.  He has a history of frequent big-ticket purchases and is currently claiming no reportable income.  OP mentioned an inheritance, which will account for it for a while.  But eventually someone is going to put two and two together and audit them.  Probably would be triggered by not paying the student loans for long enough.  And once they get audited, he's probably going to prison for tax evasion, as he will be totally unable to pay the back taxes at that point.  And OP might be going right along with him, because she knew about it the entire time."
163,"So yeah, from my perspective this is mostly on you.

You gave her no cues beyond looking at her across the table, didn't communicate what was going on for you, and then disappeared in the hope she'd chase after you or something even though she didn't know what was going on or that you were leaving.

This is so bizarrely passive aggressive imo.

Walk up behind her and put your arm around her shoulder to get her attention if you don't want to bust into the conversation. Tell her ""Hey I'm heading out why don't you come with me?"" COMMUNICATE WITH HER."
164,"There is a lot of speculation about her behavior in these comments and in your post, but if you just stick to the basic facts you will see that this relationship is not working, on a basic level. You no longer have sex. She is gone for at least 1/4 of the time. She is keeping secrets from you and lying to your face about things. 

For inexplicable reasons you seem not to have talked to her about any of these things. Any one of them would be enough to choose to end a relationship, and if ending the relationship wasn’t something you were interested in then communicating would probably have helped. As soon as she gave you the first vague excuse for being out of town, or began turning you down for sex more often, you could have had a chat about what was going on and what you both were feeling. Instead it carried on for months, and it seems all of your trust in her has eroded. You are opening her mail, searching through text messages to count the number of days she is gone per month, and calling around to urgent care centers to check what she is telling you. You don’t trust her. Clearly this lack of trust was at least somewhat warranted, because she has been lying to you, but even if she hadn’t been it’s a clear sign that this relationship isn’t working anymore. 

She has been acting in odd ways, and regardless of what those behaviors signify or her reasons for doing them, she is no longer making you happy. You do not have any trust in her. I’m sorry to say but it’s over, even if all of her behavior can be innocently explained away. It doesn’t matter if she’s cheating or working as an escort or leading a double life - what matters is that her behavior isn’t working for you, and that you don’t trust her anymore. It’s ok to end it without knowing the other details, and I really think you will be happier if you do. "
165,"He sounds like an immature idiot. The person you are dating should care about your general wellbeing as a bare minimum and he failed to do that. 

And the fact that he is taking zero responsibility for his actions. I think you should leave him. I probably would have told his mom too if I was in your situation. He should feel embarrassed by his actions. "
166,"Really because the snarky side of me would say, well you didn't face the possibility of losing your children during childbirth so you can't possibly imagine how much I love my children. Or even, well doctors had to take my babies out because I couldn't bear to part with them whereas you happily pushed yours away from you. But I'm not a nice person."

168,"My father sometimes embellishes stories.  My mother can't stand it, will complain about it, and sometimes will correct him in public.  And here's the thing:

**EVERYONE HATES HER BEHAVIOUR.**  It's rude, it make social situations uncomfortable, and it ruins what would otherwise be enjoyable stories.

The issue you're having is real, but the issue isn't your *wife* it's *you*.  You need to step back and think about why you're behaving in a socially unacceptable way which is upsetting someone you're (at least nominally) love and are very close to.  Like a lot of issues, it's solvable, but it's not going to be solvable as long as you keep pointing the finger at other people and demanding the world changes to match you.

&gt; I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong on this one

There's your problem.

(Caveat:  I'm assuming that this is about, as you've repeatedly stated, your wife simply embellishing.  This seems to be the obvious way to interpret your post, especially since you're resolutely unable to provide examples.  If your wife is actually a pathological liar, and is living in a fantasy world, then maybe there's more to this than meets the eye.  But based on your description, the problem is *you*.)"

Explain that forcing you to choose between friends and family is a losing situation for both of you, because while you love and respect them, you can't let them dictate your life, and that life includes your friends. Regardless of their response, go on breaking curfew. Either they'll throw you put (unlikely, and fine to you according to your claims) or they'll learn to accept a new baseline normal.

P.S. There is another possibility: they're trying to get you to move out. Unreasonable rules tend to be used to try to clear the nest."

172,"This, and then you will hurt her by keeping it in and stringing her along and pretending to be happy. "
173,"Well you have to ask to be sure, but it could very well just be hormonal. I agree with the other poster that sometimes when a person doesn’t want sex, they end up minimizing all physical intimacy because they don’t want to “start something” and then be put in a position where they have to reject their partner.

I saw a comment on here once that perfectly captured an issue I’ve experienced: sometimes a person would enjoy having sex, but doesn’t want to *start* having sex. If someone has low-libido or has a reactive libido, *starting* sex sounds like a lot of effort and they’re not sure it’s worth it. But once they’re actually *having* sex, it’s enjoyable and they’re glad to have done it. Kind of like if someone handed me a bowl of ice cream, I’d eat it, but I don’t want ice cream so badly that I’d get in my car and drive to the store and buy some.

For me, I’m the lower/reactive libido partner, so once I was aware that it was *starting* sex that I wasn’t in the mood for, but I still enjoyed *having* sex, I started saying yes or initiating sometimes even when I thought I wasn’t in the mood, and found that I enjoyed it. I can’t say if it’s the same for her, but it might be a topic worth discussing."

188,"&gt; My advice is to keep an open mind. When you see him again, ask what happened, and then base your next steps on his response.

ALL parents will be annoyed with their children sometimes. That's fact. 

SOME parents will be annoyed with their children ALL the time. That's fact.

Which would you be? Dunno.

Children HAVE to be selfish to survive, at least at a young age. It's the adult's responsibility to eventually wean them off of being that selfish.

There is NOTHING wrong with not wanting kids, if that's what you decide. My gf and I are happily and always will be CF. We get questions every now and then, but nope. No kiddos for us.

195,"So let me be blunt here: what your husband liked about your stay-at-home arrangement was that he arrived home to a from-scratch meal, a tidy house, clean clothes, etc. What he is pissed about now is that the additional responsibilities of, you know, caring for a baby are preventing you from completing all those tasks he beniftted from. He sees those as a non-negotiable part of you earning your keep as a stay-at-home partner. He doesn’t care how difficult it is to raise a child, or how you’re doing, he just cares that he lost his from-scratch dinner. You may have been able to overlook that reality when you had time &amp; energy to do all the stuff he expects, but now you kind of need to face that reality. "

Okay yeah it sounds like she's being overly possessive of you. It could be because she may not be used to sharing your attention (prior to you being a relationship versus now), or it may be because she does have a crush on you.

209,"This is a very, very immature reaction. I'm kind of floored by how immature it is and the wealth of deep-set issues that could be behind it.

You did nothing wrong. You tried to open up a conversation about your needs in the relationship. You are actually doing exactly the thing a healthy partner should do! His shutting down and storming off is not what a healthy partner does.

I'd guess there's some deeper problem here. My initial guess is that when confronted with the request 'can you take the initiative sometimes on physical contact', his immediate reaction was 'I don't want to', but he knows deep down that is a selfish, unhealthy response that indicates a lack of willingness to put in effort. Hence he searched for a 'neutral' response and came up blank. Then he got frustrated with YOU for daring to want effort from him.

That's just me in my amateur armchair, however. It's a conversation you're going to have to try to have with him - maybe ask him why he used the word 'obey', does he feel controlled, has he been controlled in the past, does he have a problem with initiating affection, etc. If that doesn't open him up to discussion, you may have to accept you're with a man who simply cannot communicate."
210,"There definitely is something you can do: get a custody agreement in place now to protect your child.  Go through the courts to make certain you have legal if not sole custody and that she is putting at the very least some money towards the expense of raising a child.  She might not be emotionally involved, but she shouldn't be able to skimp on contributing towards her child's well-being.  Beyond this, I would not feel comfortable allowing my child anywhere near someone who doesn't love them.

Make one of your changes be therapy, even if it's just some kind of grief therapy. Very likely this would have benefited both of you before but you can't unring the bell, just move forward from where you are now. Find a grief counselor, regular counselor or even a child loss support group. 

In the future, avoid telling someone they are irrational for not thinking the way YOU think they should be. You're probably right that her grief (and yours) are a part of what she is feeling now, but honestly, nobody ever likes to have their feelings called irrational or that they aren't thinking 'right'. It's dismissive and minimizing. Instead try 'I hear you, let's talk about it. I hear you, let's find someone we can talk to about what you're feeling'. "

215,"Exactly - you live within your *actual* means, not ""what you think your means will eventually be"". Past earnings aren't a guarantee of future earnings."
216,"I agree with this approach. Offer if he'd like to come with you, or offer to set up an appt for him so he can go about this privately. If he doesn't willingly let something out, it'll be forced out. 


He needs to be vulnerable in front of someone, and help to grieve. You and your daughter can't be the only people for this. That's not a judgement of you, but he just can't do it in a way that returns the support. He needs to be able to do this with someone that isn't so vulnerable as well. If he has friends, extended family, coworkers he likes, you might be able to send a quick message to them to be direct with their support for him. Vulnerable men have a hard time reaching out. "

219,"Sorry but your mom says you guys were too ""poor"" to support another person but they bought a SIXTEEN year old a nearly new car (going for 18.5k I see)??? Something doesn't add up.

If your stepbrother truly lives in such an impoverished area, then yes, I would say consider your car gone and maybe relinquish at least part of your college savings. To your stepfather, you and your stepbrother are both his children and he's been DESPERATELY failing at providing for his son while you've had the privileged American childhood. He's trying to make it right, albeit in misguided ways, but at least he's trying to provide for his other kid.

220,"So, I’m closer to her boyfriend’s age than her age, and my initial reaction was to cringe at the nicknames. However, I’m still on her side, not on his. It’s not like they’re trying to rope him into the whole bizarre family tree. It’s a long-running joke between friends. I understand finding it somewhat cringe-worthy—as I said, that was my gut reaction—but it sounds like he needs to take a chill pill and stop dumping on her friend group. Part of being an adult is also realizing that you don’t have to micromanage your partner’s friendships or like every little thing about their friends and that you don’t have to vocalize every single moment of irritation that you have.

222,How you spend your money is your choice. If that means saying no to trips and eating dinner with him then that’s exactly what you should do to get the point across.

223,"Nothing will get better in the next year unless both you and your partner are on the same page about it. Have you tried actually talking to your partner about how serious your problems are? Because that’s step one.

Secondly. “A break”?!? Don’t make me laugh. A break is the most painful, least helpful, longest most complicated way to break up. It’s literally only ever effective during a time of temporary stress (e.g. pressure on the relationship due to outside influences beyond both parties control) where the rules and expectations of the break are clear to both parties. You’re basically planning to ask your girlfriend if she would mind if you went and banged some other chicks but had her as a back up. 

Cruel, immature. If you really don’t want to be with her, break up. Don’t fuck around with “break” bullshit. And don’t drag it out a year while you mentally check out, while she’s left wondering wtf is going on with you as you PURPOSEFULLY not tell her because you signed a lease. Grow a pair, make up your mind whether you want this to work out or not, if you do, explain to her how bad this has gotten for you and that you want to work together on it. If not, just get it bloody over with. Screwing around with her emotions because you’re too immature to treat her with the respect and courtesy she deserves is not an option. "
224,"I'm an introvert that has dated a few extroverts.  And honestly, we socialized and ""partied"" in different ways. 

When we'd go to parties or bars, I would end up staying in one spot away from the main action and talk to a few people I knew. Whereas my partner would go into social butterfly mode and talk to/meet as many people as possible, because it's what they enjoy. I was happy to stay low key and maybe meet a few new people.

What I didn't expect or require them to do was stay by my side and entertain me for the night, because it's not their job and that wasn't why them came to the party.

If you're not having fun, you should be able to leave. But you also shouldn't expect them to cut out their socialization every time because you are burnt out. I think leaving with you some of the time and you leaving by yourself some of the time is a fair compromise. But you absolutely **must communicate**.

So instead of saying, ""But really we're still very safe,"" try something like ""This has really shaken you up. I can hear how scared you are,"" combined with a comforting physical presence. She probably knows all the statistics, what she needs is empathy in order to feel understood and be ready to move on.

The Gottman Institute has lots of resources such as articles on expressing empathy, and they have a free app called Card Decks that has ""decks"" of different resources, one of which is all phrases that express empathy without being dismissive. I found it really helpful, empathetic listening isn't natural to me."
246,"I agree with everyone else here about how much you need to set serious boundaries with your co-workers and express how inappropriate and unhelpful their comments and stares are.

However, I think everyone stares and comments are actually indicating you how real, unhealthy and clear your low weight is. I know this is very uncomfortable but it is confronting you with the true. You mention you suffered from ED before. Chances are you didn't really overcome it, you just got better at lying to yourself and now you have a established  distorted sense of body weight and how much food you need to feel full.  You should really look out for professional help to address those issues.

249,"Hey OP! I have a son your daughters age and a daughter who is 4 years younger than him, plus a 10 year old daughter. I was 19 when I had my oldest, I feel you on sooo many things right now.

**I also just left an abuser. It was a no brainier for me BECAUSE of my rules for my kids home,** It didn't matter that I had known him for 20 years, my kids have the absolute right to be protected from violence. 

The second he started blowing up I wanted out, it took me two years to leave safely and in the end it was my son, who is college, who handed me the cash to get out. 

Everyone thinks hes this amazing person for doing so, and he really is, **BUT he will tell you it's because I always always always kept our home a safe zone.** I have a mom with a personality disorder and my kids home is such a huge boundary. Not only for myself but for my kids. I have been no contact off and on with my parents for years and will continue to maintain that boundary when someone is not being safe and unwilling to keep the people around them safe as well.

*Bottom line, your daughter is going to need you in a year or maybe less. She will try to escape this man and if you are allowing him to be there then she wont be able to have a safe zone.* 

I really really understand what you are worried about, but your priority absolutely MUST be to keep yourself safe and be ready for her to need you. 

This might help you mentally adjust to this boundary and feel like you are doing the right thing....A few rules I have from growing up with abuse and leaving an abuser...

1. I can't keep my kids safe if I am not safe. 

2. I can't make the rest of the world fair but I can absolutely make what happens in my four walls as fair and kind as possible.

3. I can't keep my kids safe if I am not safe.

1 and 3 need to be repeated over and over again. Be there, be ready for her, do a LOT of research on domestic violence because this is where this is headed, it takes an average of 12 times to leave an abuser, so be ready. Keep that house locked down like a freaking fort.

Highly recommend Lundy Bancroft to get yourself educated. You have to let her make her own mistake here, abuse is a screwy bunch of chemicals, he is taking advantage of her having been cheated on. He is predatory.

Be ready to help her get out when she needs a safe space to go. 

Until then you absolutely have to keep yourself safe and that starts with a place for her to live that he can not touch because you will not allow it!!!

I don't know your age or job history, but if you work in some kind of office where old people regularly have casual contact over writing (e.g. internal emails, IM systems) there's a huge chunk of them that do stuff like that.

You've only known him for a year. It's something he did so yes, it's in character for him. It's just a side of him you weren't aware of. 

&gt;When I first met him, I was going through an identity crisis and eating disorder, both of which he helped me through without asking anything in return.

Well, except for him to be able to cheat on you and sexually harrass women and get a free pass. Certain kinds of men often seek out younger women with self-esteem issues because they know they can get away with things that somebody older and more secure would never put up with."

261,"This is called covert sexual abuse. It happens to many children. It's hard to identify as wrong or identify at all, because it is subtle. It's not overt like someone touching genitals. It's a parent staring at a child in the bath. It's an oversharing of sexual information. It's enmeshment. It's sleeping in the same bed beyond childhood years. It's treating the child like a spouse. It is abuse. The children do not know better, because it is all they have ever known. "
262,"This shouldn't be scary, schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental illness but it is very controllable with the right medications and therapy/psychiatry. A lot of people think that schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder turns people into homicidal delusional maniacs, but the reality is that it is manageable just like any other chronic illness.

edit: I was not at all saying that your partner having delusions isn't scary, I was trying to say that receiving a diagnosis of schizoaffective or schizophrenia does not have to be this scary, life ending diagnosis that it is often made out to be. I completely understand why OP would be scared right now. I was responding to the comment above mine that refers to their partners diagnosis as scary."
263,"I'm not trying to downplay how you feel and I'd say all this to a woman OP as well, but I wouldn't be quick to assume she groomed you. It's much more likely if you guys have otherwise had a very good, genuine relationship that she developed feelings and ""went for it"" in the wrong way, thinking spontaneity was the way to go when in reality it can lead to people feeling violated.

If this is the first time she did anything like this, I highly doubt she had any sort of malicious, creepy intent. It seems like a person who expressed her feelings in the moment, with very little judgement, and didn't think about how you'd feel. Which is still unacceptable, but hopefully leaves room for you to communicate once you feel up to it about how this affected you and the boundaries that you expect her to respect.

Don't feel guilty, sometimes our brains don't work right when we're caught off guard. You did nothing wrong, I think most people who talk about how others ""should have"" acted in these situations don't realize how hard it can be to form proper thoughts when you aren't expecting a situation. 

If this is a dealbreaker for the friendship, that's fine. But I wouldn't be overly quick to assume grooming, manipulation or anything like that. I think that if she genuinely cares about you, you could talk to her about what she did wrong and how it made you feel and there could be room to move past it together."
264,"Not that you should have to do anything any differently, but if you put your food in opaque paper bags and staple them shut, labeling each with your intials and ""Thursday lunch"" or whatever, she will probably leave them alone. When people see the food itself, it's harder to resist grabbing some if they are hungry.

You could also tell her you are doing meal prep on whatever day and that if she wants to prep together and pay for half the food, she can join you, if you want to be nice. If she doesn't want to meal prep but you are willing to have a food area of the fridge for snacks you both chip in for, designate a shelf for shared food and if she is too lazy to help stock it maybe she will want to just give you money to pick up stuff for it when you shop. Again, you don't owe her any food considerations whatsoever, but sometimes it's better to make some accommodations to avoid hostile relations with someone who has full access to where you live. Do not poison her with laxatives or whatever, that is illegal and risky for you as she may retaliate with worse."

267,"I mean... for me it would be divorce-worthy

I want a partner.  Not someone who decides things for me (and not to my benefit, or considering my comfort at all).

He's acting like he's single. 

Is this his way of telling you he wants to be single?

Or is he just an inconsiderate asshole with limited intelligence?

If you want to stay with him, then I'd sit him down and explain how much this pisses you off and why.

And talk about how this is going to get fixed. 

Will he get the car meth tested / detailed before you get in it again?

Will you sell it and get an automatic?

Will you agree that the next big purchase will be a car for YOU?

If he's unwilling to discuss it at all, then you'll need to decide if this marriage is worth staying in. "
268,I agree with all of this. People are *so* quick to turn every discomfort into a “trust issue”. Trusting your partner doesn’t mean you are obligated to feel comfortable with behaviors that you view as inappropriate. Wanting your partner to be respectful of boundaries does not mean you don’t trust them. 
269,"I mean you're not wrong to find ""intelligence"" attractive, or something you need in a partner. 

But honestly you couldn't have a more pretentious attitude about it. And I would go as far as saying that being upset because other people are bragging about something someone else did, and that you can't do the same, is a sign of pettiness and immaturity. Both of which stem from a lack of emotional intelligence, which is just as important as what you can get from a book. And the thing about him going to a ""normal"" college while you're so much better for going to an ivy league school? Yuck.

You're free to end it for that reason, but I promise you're not as ""intelligent"" as you keep telling us."

271,"These scripts are just fantastic. My old neighbour, Henry, pulled this on me constantly. And he always seemed to try and do it when I was bustling in from work or the grocery with my hands full. He was a kind person and great neighbor, but he’d literally watch through his windows to come rushing out and slap verbal handcuffs on me. I got to the point where I’d just sprint in the house/leave my bags or anything that could slow me down in the car. I’d even bag groceries accordingly and thread my arms through the bags I needed to run with before I pulled up to my house. The rest be damned... I’d come get them later. Homeboy would even walk by my windows multiple times, attempting to catch my glance so he could beckon me outside. We couldn’t enjoy our porches or yard ever. I now live in the country with no visible neighbours at all and really enjoy living this way again.


While I’m not sure it would’ve worked on Henry, as he refused to respond to even the most direct “I don’t wish to talk right now” lines, I just wanted to say I really dig what you’ve written. You’re very articulate.  "
272,"He's the selfish one. This is his loophole to fuck other women and have it not be cheating. You've tried on more than one occasion, and it's not your thing- and that's okay!!! But for him to throw a man sized fit because you're not into it is selfish af. Why did you marry someone you can't trust and have been unsteady with since the beginning?

On a side note, if my husband was a regular at the strip joint, and *brought another woman and lied about it*, he'd be done. It's one thing to go for bachelor parties or whatever, but most happily married 34 year old men don't hang out on there on the regular. This whole situation seems like it's been a long battle, and he won't change, or stop. The real question you need to ask yourself is how much longer you're willing to be miserable for someone who won't do anything for you?"
273,"I pretty much stopped reading at 3 hour commute, what the fuck."
274,"dude, he's a sexual creeper, it sounds like he considered the two of you to be in a quasi-relationship as soon as you moved in together and that's really worrying.  his actions are EXTREMELY inappropriate and you needed to take a stand against them WEEKS ago, but if I were you I wouldn't tolerate living with him any longer.  There's no telling how far he'll take his trespasses, especially while you're asleep.  He considers you to be HIS after all."
275,If a woman does not want to engage in sex she will pull back in all  physical contact since she doesn't want to encourage anything. Hugging or smooching with a horny husband usually starts some wondering hands and the next thing your know she has to reject him for further play and everyone feels bad.
276,"Marriage counseling, ASAP, to work on your communication and conflict resolution (and the fact that your husband is a d-bag). If he won't go, it's because he wants things to continue as they are - he doesn't see your unhappiness as a problem. So, marriage counseling if you want to stay with him. But keep in mind that reducing your activity is what your DOCTOR recommended, and when you told your husband that, he essentially called you a lazy liar. Why do you want to be with someone who thinks you prioritizing the health of your baby makes you a lazy liar?  Your child will learn from your examples. Is this what you want your kid to think is ""normal"" and ""okay,"" that husbands call wives names, that wives do all the house work, and that conflict and problems are solved by tit-for-tat ""strikes,"" and not by working together to figure out a mutually agreeable solution? "
277,"If it's specifically TV/media oriented, it could be worth it to point out to her that reality TV often seeks to villainize certain participants in order to make people respond emotionally to it or make you root for certain people. Kinda sucks the fun out to know that, what with realizing you're being manipulated by show producers, but I used to be similar about bashing ""annoying"" contestants until I realized how heavily scripted and edited things are."
278,"I'm agreeing with this and adding: if he knows OP has a history of abuse, it's extra important to discuss the line before ""toeing"" it (frankly I think this is crossing over the line, but it can seem innocent for those who don't know better). It's a toss up between ""he's a grown-ass man who should know better, plus with the #metoo movement shit like this ought to be on his radar"", and ""a lot of men haven't the faintest idea what women go through and their radar for what is and isn't chill isn't calibrated at all because they haven't been exposed to it/are shielded from it by their privilege"".

Either way, OP should probably bring this up during a neutral moment out of bed. His reaction should speak volumes. Either he's mortified he made her feel unsafe (good), he gets defensive (neutral, maybe he comes around after, lots of people don't do well with criticism), or he victim-blames/calls her over-sensitive/is otherwise abusive (RUN)"
279,"At first I thought you were being way too harsh/ presumptive but reading back over everything, you might be onto something. I'm not totally sold on the purposeful manipulation/ learned helplessness, but this could be a case of massive fear/ anxiety over ""I like my life the way it is and what if this provider leaves me."" He said THEY are well-off, not that HE is well-off so I'm wondering if maybe she at least works part time, or maybe from home.

By all accounts he makes her sound like a kind, well-intentioned person."
280,"Nothing about this was meant in unkindness. 

You are suffering because of your anxiety issue, this is clear, and you need to work on that. That's the answer to this post and your suffering. I see your suffering and I know how to fix it and that's what I'm telling you. 

You said yourself you've been thinking about this phone thing for A YEAR. This is unhealthy and you know it. Friend, end your suffering, get actual help."
281,"It is definitely selfish. Sure you are who you are, but you agreed to be exclusively with your boyfriend. You need to stop trying to justify your actions. You absolutely need to tell him everything. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you really love the guy you're with you'll be honest. Quit your bullshit."
282,"Was she ready for all of that at 23? I doubt it. 

You need to tell her. It will fall apart. It should fall apart. You are at different stages. Having been a 23 year old once herself she should understand this. But you need to be honest with her. Unless she is happy putting all that on hold, you guys need to end it now instead of 5 years from now when you both are full of resentment from unfulfilled expectations and a kid you have to split custody with. 

Love and companionship should never be the primary motivators for a relationship. Compatible goals and lifestyle are. You two are not compatible."
283,"Yeah, you are abusive. If your partner is getting hurt by your driving and you don't care and plan to keep doing it, then you're hurting her on purpose, just indirectly. Same as slamming things and throwing things around is indirectly threatening her with violence. Whether you accept it or not it's about her because you're doing it to her. You're just using objects as a proxy so you don't have to take responsibility for controlling yourself.

Indirect violence has a tendency to escalate into direct violence because at its core is a person who has chosen not to manage their behaviour towards their partner. It's only a matter of time. "
284,You act like pyromania is something that needs to be planned for. 
285,"He's collecting money from everyone he knows, he's just worked his way down to you."
286,"Right?!? Like how do you hold a mature, adult conversation with someone like that? How is that in any way rewarding or fulfilling? It would be like talking to an adult Veruca Salt.

IDK, it just...ughh. Boggles. I'm with you in thinking it's about her looks...after all, it seems to work as her reasoning for so many expenses..."
287,"Right?

It *really* concerns me that OP isn't comfortable saying no, even to requests she knows are sexual, if they aren't super overtly sexual. You don't owe anyone anything in regards to your body or wanting to play games with them. It is always okay to say no if you are uncomfortable or just don't want to do something.

OP, stop lying and making up excuses and running away. Learn to say no. This is a super important life skill and if you can't learn to say no you could end up in *much* worse situations then this. If you really can't, see a therapist. Please. You need to be able to say no. "
288,"Just as someone who had the same due date as you, it's only going to get worse with him in the picture and you will need someone to support you. My baby was born last week at 36 weeks and last night I was up from 2-7 trying to breastfeed, pump, rock her to sleep, and changed 4 dirty diapers because she wouldn't stop pooping. You are going to need support and it seems like your boyfriend is not going to help."
289,"OH FUCK HIM.  

Sorry I have nothing else productive to say. Your husband is a sexist douchebag."
290,Spending some free time with your infant child is kind of the *absolute bare minimum* I would expect from a parent.
291,"Then this is a borderline abusive relationship, OP. No marriage can be healthy when your partner forbids you from ever spending 1 day away from the family. You need rest and downtime as much as anyone else, and the fact that he doesn't realize that is deeply problematic.

Here's what I would say to him: ""Hun. It's been 18 months since I've had more than a few hours away from Daughter. I need a day away for my own sanity. You don't have to agree, but you have to respect that need of mine. Therefore, I'm going away on the weekend of [DATES] with [FRIENDS].

""Moreover, you need to build up skills around caring for her without me. What would happen if, say, [Dear Loved One] took ill and I needed to go care for them in [Other City] for a few days?""

If he tries to refuse to ""let"" you go, then he is unhealthily controlling. If he insists that he needs child care while you're gone on the weekend, then you say: ""No, I want you to care for our daughter. You claim it's not that tiring, and I want you and her to bond while I'm gone.""

And then just repeat ad nauseum. Tell him you're going, don't ask."
292,"There's not a lot of detail (or any, really) about what caused him to feel hurt and need that distance, but it doesn't sound at all unreasonable to me that he wants to take things slowly so that you don't both fall right back into old patterns of behavior. That's one of the big benefits to a temporary separation - it changes your routine and helps both people relearn how to be functional, supportive partners in the relationship.

What does your marriage counselor say? And what is your husband's role in parenting your children during this separation?"
293,It depends. If you're 16 nearly 17 and she's only JUST turned 14 was 13 this year then I think that's kinda a big gap. But if it really is just two years like 2002 and 2004 I mean it's okay. Just go slow watch movies eat icecream etc! Don't need to take anything serious or do anything big at your guys age. 
294,"Girl, he is only gonna drag you down, for as long as you let him. I think you know that."
295,"Maybe money is why you do this, though?  I have friend who plays a certain role to her uber conservative mother because she is going to be left millions of dollars when her mom dies and she doesn't want to lose that for her or her kids.  I'm killing the romantic notion of love over money, but sometimes it is a practicality.   "
296,"As a parent, you did what I tell my kids to do in an emergency - get to safety, stay safe. You are not a bad or selfish person because of this! You did the right thing. If you can safely help others on your way to safety, that’s great, but you should not try to go out of your way in dangerous circumstances where you aren’t sure what is happening. 
It’s hard to tell from your story, but it sounds like you were in view of the bear and not in view of your family. It wouldn’t have made sense to go looking for them in that scenario. You alerted everyone in the area and did what you could. It’s OK.
I think it’s also important to note that a lot of times when people try to go back into an emergency situation, they can put themselves and others in more risk than if they stayed out. For example, if you went back in and couldn’t find your family, they may have gotten out and had to try to decide whether to go back in to find you."
297,"I would say it's definitely ultimatum time. Seven years together, he's made no commitment to you and he's saying mean and selfish things about anything which could possibly tie you together, however temporarily.

It seems you've allowed him to dictate the pace of things for a long time. Now it's your turn. "
298,"&gt; my mom and I have both paid for his phone bill on two separate occasions

So you've roped your mom into supporting him too?  Why would she ever be involved in your deadbeat boyfriend's finances?

Is this your first relationship or...?  Please help us here because nothing about your situation makes any sense at all.   In the normal world, you would pack all his shit into his car and send him on permanent vacation with his parents.  I hope you post an update when you do just that and have started therapy for yourself."

Tell you wife that you're miserable but will need her support to make this transition. Then figure out what you guys have to do financially to make it work. Something else to think about - lots of people, including men, get a lot of satisfaction from something like a clean kitchen. Especially if your schedule isn't so harsh in a different position, you might want to take on a task like cleaning the kitchen or doing the laundry. That way, when you come to her saying something like you'd like to cut back how often the housekeeper comes, it gives you a much bigger leg to stand on and also encourages her to meet you halfway. "
300,Yep. I didn’t even have to read past the first point. 
301,"Ok. But OP is working all day. She’s not sipping mimosas by the pool and getting mani-pedis every day. She’s caring for and raising five small humans. Yes her husband may work a lot and want to come home and relax, but what about OP? She’s worked all day too. When does she get to relax and unwind? She has to be on duty 24/7 but her husband can demand relaxation time when he gets home?

That’s not how this works. Not at all. If he was having issues with her work in the home he should have discussed it like a rational human being. Flipping his lid because he didn’t come home to 1954 with dinner on the table, his wife all dolled up, the kids being seen but not heard, and his wife ready to rub his feet and cater to his every whim in unacceptable. Especially in front of the children.

Having kids is a 24/7 job which means when you come home from work there’s more work because you have to care for the kids. It means they’re both going to have to work long hours and that if they’re wearing down they need to TALK and figure out some respite. But he just sounds like he feels once he gets home his work should be done and that’s not the case. "
302,"So essentially she's telling you ""I feel upset"" and you tell her ""you're wrong to feel upset"". Comforting someone is about validating their concerns and reassuring them, not completely dismissing them."
303,Not low key. Just sexist. 
304,"Yeah OP, I don’t think it’s so bad you did it once, but don’t bring it back up if he comes back again. Dude clearly just wants to shop in peace. "
305,"I had an ex who got off on how much he made his ex-girlfriend's parents love him (he had a small town politician's worth of charisma which he leaned on heavily to make people like him). He would tell me how much his exes obviously must have regretted dumping him because their parents loved him so much and wouldn't let them forget what a great guy he is (eyeroll).

Of course my parents liked him. I'm sure he told the story about me after I dumped him too. I didn't regret dumping him for a second though, lol."
306,"Yeah having people be interested in you sexually is very ego stroking and validating, but when you sleep around you find out it's actually very shallow and empty compared to the fulfillment of a long term partner.

Do you actually love your current gf though?  Because they way you talk about her makes it sound like you think she is super replaceable.  I'm sure if she read this post she would break up with you."
307,"Listen to her words and believe them. She's fine with this.



You are both making the right call. An hour is not too far for her to keep in touch with everyone (hell, I've *commuted* an hour each way). You can probably up-size again one day. Your mental health is worth dropping some cash on. You sound like a great couple, always looking out for each other."
308,"Not unethical since technically you guys finished the transaction, court was over. Yeah he’s flirting and gave you his number "

As far as the issue, be you. Someone will love your clampy self. They're your ex for a reason. 

"
310,"All it took for him to try and cheat on you, was you being busy studying for a few weeks for exams. It only wasn't ""actual"" physical cheating because the girls turned him down. It's great that he helped you out, but that doesn't make any of this okay. If you want to stay with him, just consider what will happen when something actually goes wrong or stressful. Will he stay by you, or just go ""get high and look for a quick hook up""? This was just cause you were STUDYING FOR EXAMS. That's not love."
311,"Just an anecdote I know, but My grandparents did, at least mostly. When my cousin initially dated non Caucasians they were pretty passive aggressively racist about it. Then she dated this white guy who was a loser and they hated him, after that her now
Husband is Guatemalan but he’s such a great guy they totally got over it and love the heck out of their mixed great grand kids. To me they seemed to ‘learn their lesson’. Regardless they never showed a hint of racism toward her husband and their great grand kids. Although in her later years (late 80s to early 90s) my grandma would make general racist comments about immigration and stuff. My point being although the parents may never truly stop being racist, their natural love of their own grandkids and daughter, and her showing she will not put up with their BS whatsoever, may change their behavior at least toward her family if not society as a whole. But of course it’s only a maybe. "

315,"&gt;She has also recently confessed (6 months ago) to still having feelings for Bf and expressed a desire to get back together.

&gt;I told him I was uncomfortable with it which he claims not to understand

He's lying. I won't guess at his motivations, but there is no way that he is such a detached robot that he doesn't understand your completely, utterly justified concern. You're not being an asshole. She has made it clear that she's still interested in him, and I would consider their living together to be a massive middle finger to you."
316,"Yeah exactly. Everyone has to do chores like cooking and cleaning. That’s life. She doesn’t have any other mandatory responsibilities other than taking the dogs for a walk and feeding them. It’s not like she’s raising children and constantly cleaning up after them and driving them around and all that stuff, so really I just see this as pathetic of her. I never realised so many women were a) stay at home mothers and b) homemakers without kids. A is totally fine if you can afford it and I think it’s preferable to have one parent at home if possible, or even part time, but I’m in awe at how many women in these modern times get married and never work again. That was always the domain of wives of billionaires in my head til reddit."
317,"Oh gosh, how awful. Trauma like that is a nightmare to move past, and this is relatively fresh. I hope you'll continue to encourage him to seek counseling. Maybe you could do some research on paraplegic athletes . There are multiple wheelchair athletes who finish ironman events every year. it sounds like he needs a new outlet to express himself. It just might be a while before he finds it. "
318,"If they're in the US, they'll be fine legally unless they live in Virginia.  Otherwise the law treats step-siblings as unrelated since they're not blood relatives and neither of them will have been  adopted by the other's parent.

319,"Exactly. OP shouldn't even let this guy in the door unless he's got a big grocery bag in his hand to sustain himself. (And her, if she's cooking.) 26 is too old to pretend the food fairy exists."
320,Exactly right. There’s no time frame that anyone is allowed to disturb the peace. 
321,[removed]
322,If he eats 75% of the food he should be paying for 75% of groceries. Why is the burden on 22-year-old OP to neglect her health and empty her bank account for the guy with several years of job experience on her? I hope this ends well with a long-term solution for her. 
323,"""This is my vacation too.""

**No. Your whole damn life is a vacation.**

I think OP should just say the obove line on repeat to his ungrateful wife until she gets it.  "
324,"We've been together for 5 years. 

We've talked about marriage but we're not engaged yet. We don't have combined finances, though we do live together and split rent, utilities, and groceries down the middle."
325,I knew that she’s been pretty spoiled her whole life but didn’t know it was this bad. She’s always had her moments but never anything this aggressive. 
326,"This is something I dont get. I dated a guy who cheated on me 24/7 while I had remained loyal. So I made him the offer for an open relationship.  It's not usually my thing but I lowered my standards for this guy because I thought I loved him. He flat out refused the offer stating he didnt want me sleeping around. Bullshit. He promised it wouldnt happen again. It happened again. Ended right after that. 

Again. What I dont get is why some people just enjoy either making you look like an idiot or taking advantage of you. Enjoying the lies.

I wouldn’t think twice about sleeping next to any of my fiends, most of whom are male. I’ve also been married for a long time. And if my husband requested I not drink or sleep next to someone at an outing I would absolutely honor that request. When the time was right I’d also try to understand why he felt concern, but not until after I already went to the outing and respected his request. Relationships are an ongoing negotiation. Giving up a bit of freedom on occasion is just one of those things you do for someone you love. It’s no biggie. "

348,I'd also love to know in what ways he's a great person. Because anybody who will take money from their parents or any other human being like this can't be that great of a person. Either Op is morally dubious themselves (which I am starting to think is the case considering she is more unhappy he is not sharing the money with her than the fact he is taking money from someone's mortgage to buy expensive crap) or in complete denial. 
349,"This is a really great point. In my jurisdiction, there is an emphasis that child support is the right of the CHILDREN, not the parent. That they should benefit from the incomes of both parents-- that is only what is fair. "
350,Wtf. I’m sure OP realises that there are people out there who don’t like kids. That’s not her issue. The problem is that the father of her child is saying that he doesn’t like their baby.

353,"Your proposal to split both essentials and non-essentials (while non-essential, those still cost money) from a shared account sounds like a great idea, esp. if you both contribute equally to that account.

I don't understand why this doesn't sound reasonable, it seems like a perfect solution."
354,"Look kid, I never said you ""deserved"" it. Both of you are being pretty immature. But it's not a question of deserving. It's a question of sometimes you get back what you put out; he's fucking with you because you fucked with him. You've said yourself that you don't give two shits about this person and don't care about having a relationship with them. You didn't treat him respectfully but you're upset he's being disrespectful.  His behavior is NOT cool (ESPECIALLY the physical touching) but he isn't the one asking for advice.   


If you actually want to fix this - meaning actually get to a place of mutual understanding &amp; respectful behavior, then first you would sit down and have a serious talk with him. Having a conversation is not ""being dramatic,"" it's what adults do to resolve conflict.    


You need to say ""look, I understand I screwed you over &amp; you have good reason not to like me for it. I apologize. Whether you forgive me or not, we have to move past this enough to be able to coexist. I am not comfortable with name-calling or physical contact and I need you to stop. Please don't touch me even in a playful manner, and respect my physical space.""  No room for misinterpretation. If he does it again after that, don't let it go &amp; escalate in whatever way you have available to you, which will depend on your lease &amp; landlord situation, whether your other roommates are supportive of you, etc. "
355,"I mean, sure I guess, but it doesn't mean you can't help a girl out.

It's not like she's having the baby just for herself, and the pregnancy does make it harder (though for most not impossible) to do certain things.

So if you're the husband in this case, do her a solid and switch chores. It shouldn't be that much of an ask I would think, and if you're married to someone I would've assumed that doing them favours and making their life easier would be something fairly high up on your to do list."
356,This is true - they make you pay for a pregnancy test even if there is no way in hell you are pregnant when you go to urgent care/emergency room. It's infuriating! And they charge like 20x the cost of a drugstore test.

362,"&gt; Unfortunately, she’s in a toxic marriage with a young child.

This happens and it's difficult.  But it could be because she has never changed her habits.  You have gotten a one sided story.  Is it possible her husband has agreed to pay for her summers away just so he can get rid of her?  Make her someone else's problem for a while?  

If she's reaching out to you after 10 years and suddenly wants to relocate to you for months, it sounds like she has nowhere else to turn.  Likely because she is toxic to others as well.  She has no friends or other relationships back home that she's concerned about distancing herself from.  

You should be very clear that you don't have much, if any time to spend with her so she definitely shouldn't come there just for you.  If she still comes, meet her for lunch and then you are busy after that.  You'll likely know from one lunch if she's still the same girl.  

And don't have her pick you up.  She doesn't need to know where you live."
363,"Seriously. And OP's GF was the only one who didn't seem to like or have a problem with Kane. His thoughts are he's a cool guy but has boundry issues with Carrie...

That's just so cruel :( It's not wrong to have no interest in getting married, but damn, what an asshole thing to do."
365,Read the WHOLE post. He's gone ludicrously beyond 'doing the right thing' and is ignoring his new bride for some stranger who doesnt even make her own wallet a priority.
366,"&gt; One the things I'd look forward to most if I had a child would be being their best friend as they grow up

You shouldn't be your child's best friend. You should be their loving parent. "
367,"This hadn't occurred to me but I definitely think its a possibility now that I think about it. Partially because as I read the post, OP hasn't mentioned any other cases where this friend's behavior has made her suspicious of lying (maybe there was and she didn't mention them, but it made me curious.). So I was wondering if pathological lying could come out of nowhere. Obviously mental illness flare up could be another strong possibility as has been mentioned, but as I read this I was like ""has she ever made up big time lies before?"" because her just being a pathological asshole trying to impress out of no where seems like a weird thing to pop up at that age with no history of it (at least i think?). 

Also if a friend of a friend *does* exist, that doesn't mean someone didn't lift his picture and pretend to be him - I have  an ex whose mom got catfished by someone pretending to be an old coworker and the mom subsequently sent this person about 23K through bank transfers and pictures of gift card numbers as some kind of an ""investment"" to get like 200,000 back. (...turned out to be Nigerian scammers). 

His mom was a lonelier 60ish year old, I think they kinda look at whatever is public on a persons facebook or other social media and kinda prey on anyone who appears lonely and not super saavy at computers/social media. 

So definitely a possibility. "
368,"Sorry, disagree with others that your roommate and BEST friend is not doing something wrong. Your relationship ended a month ago. That's being a crappy best friend and would raise serious questions, to me, as to when this started between them and if it started before the relationship ended."
369,"Thank you, I was starting to think I was the crazy one. "
370,"There are better ways to bring it up then launching right into it, though. ""I'd like to talk to you about a fetish I have and ways we might be able to incorporate it into our sex life"" would probably be better received as an opener than going straight to ""how many babies can you fit in your uterus?"""
371,"Your friend seems to be playing with the line and your gf needs to be reassured. Do you care more about your friend or your gf? If I cared more about my gf then I would reassure her but I would NEVER just drop a friend because she told me to. I would just tell my friend, “hey chill, I have a gf now.” "
372,"They don’t share finances though. It didn’t come out of joint account. After the bills are paid, both OP and her boyfriend do whatever they want with their own money. "
373,"This is good because the more words you say, the more ammunition your family has to use to argue with you. Keep it short and simple:

* I got her the interview and wrote a recommendation. Why are you yelling at me for helping her?
* You’re angry I didn’t get fired for breaking policy?
* You think I should lose my job so cousin can have one? Why do you want that for me?"
374,"I don't know why I even feel compelled to point this out, but OP didn't say the cousin has called to give him shit. She may well be mortified by everyone else's behavior. She could be horrible too, who knows. "
375,I’d never do this. I already have a mother.
376,"I get like this when I've done *enough* ""us time"" stuff and not enough ""alone time"" stuff. Being around people too much without too little downtime makes me a cranky, over-sensitive person. 

So maybe OP needs a weekend getaway to herself so she can get a break, do whatever, and have time to miss her hubby! "
377,"&gt;I don't really think he's off cheating on my right now, because again, it just doesn't seem like that's the kind of person he is.

Please re-read your own post OP, particularly this part:

&gt;I confronted him about it the same day and he completely came clean, saying that I'd grown a little distant during the weeks of my final exams of high school. He claimed that since I was too busy studying to hang out with him, he would get high and slide into people's DM's looking for a quick hookup. I was upset, of course, and when he showed me that he had tried to hook up with around ten or so people, I broke out into tears and left his apartment.

Because, as you have plainly and clearly typed out for everyone to see: he IS in fact the type of person to cheat on you, and has admitted it straight to your face.

Someone who truly cares about you would never do this to you. Someone who truly loves you would understand that you are sometimes busy, and would not immediately try to stick his dick into some other random person.

You are so young. You will DEFINITELY find someone else who will actually treat you right and not tell you to your face that they would cheat on you."
378,"They dated for six years - it is not a stretch to imagine the ex and parents developed some level of rapport during that time. If they spent a large portion of those six years thinking he was their future son in law, and particularly if his home life wasn't great so he came to lean more on OP's family, the relationship could have been established well before the breakup.

This isn't to say it is right for it to keep going. Just that it could have developed in a natural/healthy way, rather than ""worming his way in for revenge"". "
379,"&gt; As long as he doesn't prefer you in the state of being desperate, hapless and miserable as you were when he was comforting you

I somewhat worry about this, I know there are people out there who are realllllly attracted to the damsel in distress thing. Which I definitely was when meeting Mark, but I'm not like that at all usually.

No."
381,"I wrote a comment in response to yours but didn’t hit the “reply” button. Sorry- I am new to this whole reddit thing, but thank you for the advice! "
382,"This isn't really consistent and doesn't make sense. Don't parent your kids, but don't let them eat meat. Idk, just seems like a post specifically designed to push buttons. If I thought this was actually happening, I tell you to sit down with a professional family counselor to discuss your parenting styles. "
383,Those things a freaking magic. Before my GF lived with me I could find them in my room while deep cleaning. But it does add up to a bigger picture.
384,"Just to throw a curveball here. 

What else changed other than the weight?
did the changes to your weight simply cause by medication or did the new medication changed your mindset and allow you to change your habits. 

Like you say, 10-15lb isn't much. so either he's really shallow or there's something else.  Maybe you look happier, carry yourself better, more confident, more motivated considering you started losing weight. 

People don't just snap fingers to lose weight,  it usually needs work. to stop being depressive or lazy which can be a drag to be around. Even if you just start eating healthier that requires some change in character that may be more attractive from an outside perspective.  

People are quick to judge to say it's only the weight you lost.  But I'd be willing to bet there's been more changes then you realize.  I can't say if he just wants you because you're different now. But maybe he was pursuing someone else or had his own issues to go through.  My only recommendation is to not be so quick to judge him,  but maybe have a conversation about it and ask him why. "
385,"I think his BS has gone too far, and you need to stop it immediately. 

His passive aggressive behavior has been successful, and you have limited your interactions with your friend for no reason but to stop your bf's stupid comments. 

I'd resume normal contact with your friend, and tell your boyfriend that if he can't stop being stupid about it, you might as well just end the relationship. (Honestly for me this behavior is a deal breaker and I'd end the relationship if he doesn't stop it) "
386,Your wife is behaving like a stereotypical evil step mom. If you choose her over the well-being of your daughter you’ll be married to an evil witch and loose your daughter. I pray you don’t have kids with this thing.

The owners are above everyone else, and they are out of the country for the summer. I could still go to my supervisor certainly, but I don't know if the issue will resolve in a timely manner.

388,"This was a lot better than what I expected it to be when I started reading your comment.
I agree entirely with this. Also, the fact that he just had this creepy look/smile shows he has no remorse.  Ugh."
389,yeah.  I'd also be contacting some of the club leadership from the past to see if they remember any of this and can  corroborate OP's version of events.  Just in case.
390,"Your wife is trashy as fuck. 

She is threatened by your minor daughter.

Grow a pair, engage your spine. If you can’t, go privately to speak with someone and get some perspective. Your wife is unreasonable and frankly the fact that you even consider kowtowing to her immaturity should be extremely concerning to you. She is negatively influencing you.

My heart goes out to your daughter knowing that her father is even momentarily considering such a decision. 

Go stand in front of a mirror, pretend it’s your daughter, and out loud speak what you are considering. 

She deserves better. You can be better.

He just should not be trying to teach you anything. He doesn't have the patience or temperment for it. So stop him. Only do climbs you can do and tell him you like his as a BF but not as your teacher."

395,"Omg. She wants to be married, she doesn't want a marriage. You guys are too young. She's clearly not mature enough to even consider marrying, and this is literally just the same road I saw so many friends go down years ago. (Hint - they all ended in divorce.)"
396,"&gt; However I keep having these thoughts in the back of my head that constantly nags at me that he's embarassed of me and my boy, that's why he can't introduce me to his parents

Talk to him, and ask him why he hasn't introduced you yet, when/if he plans to, and *listen* to his answer.

&gt; His parents are major religious and is on the righteous side if you know what i mean.

Reread this a few times, and listen to what your brain recognizes as facts instead of what your heart is shouting as insecurities.

There's a...*pretty obvious reason* he might not want to deal with introducing you to his family, and it very likely has nothing to do with you."
397,I agree. I need to be less vague and put my foot down.
398,"&gt;  I meet nice people in the strangest of places

He still wants to ask you out!
"
399,"Except for his wife, who is very badly hurt."
400,"Honest question: how old are you? You are seriously naive if you take everything someone says at face value, especially someone who has violated your trust. "
401,"Yeah, I'm a nurse and honestly anytime a patient leads with a list of 15 fairly benign diagnoses and then spends the next ten minutes listing their subjective symptoms essentially to justify the fact that every actual test has come back negative.... Most of the diagnoses on OP's list are the names we give to normal bodily dysfunction. Diagnoses like those often accumulate when people shop around for doctors who are willing to tell them something is ""wrong,"" so they make gastritis and ovarian cysts sound abnormal when they just aren't.

I'd bet 100 bucks she's either a raging hypochondriac or she's got lupus. Plenty of lupus patients get dismissed as hypochondriacs because their symptoms are essentially a random constellation of slightly-more-dysfunctional dysfunction. Sucks, but doctors deal with hypochondriacs way more than lupus patients so the assumption isn't unsafe."
402,"mildly annoying? he can't even be bothered to fucking *google* anything, he enjoys arguing with people about topics he knows nothing about. He sounds like a fucking idiot with a superiority complex, and frankly, why should anyone make time for that?"
403,LOL. maybe the husband from that post is the one who took them!
404,"I'm 31 and have gone to funerals my whole life.  And still, a viewing or a funeral feels like you've stepped into another dimension.  Even if I'm not very close with the person.  It just feels like the world gets put on pause for a bit while you do this insanely incomprehensible thing.  You don't know what you're supposed to feel.  You don't know how strongly you're allowed to feel it.   You don't know what your role is supposed to be.  And you *absolutely* don't know what to say.  

You stand in line heading towards the front and tell yourself ""they've heard the same bullshit phrases all day from countless people, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry for your loss, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for your loss, I'm so sorry, blah blah blah.  I need to be sincere and say something else...what should I say?...what should I say to prove that I'm sad and I care?..."" and then you get up there and hug them (awkwardly, trying to pretend there's not a dead body 2 feet to your left just lying there waiting for you to come stare at it while you try not to show that you're freaking out and your stomach feels upside down and you can't breathe properly) and you say the only words that don't sound stupid, ""I'm sorry,"" and then you move on.  

Even as an adult, it doesn't make sense and it doesn't get easier.  It's stupidly difficult and it's really great that people on here aren't immediately lashing out at OP's friend.  "
405,[deleted]
406,"Thank you I feel the same way! I have worked on many of my habits and it sucks that he is hiding behind that ""I've always been like this, accept me"". I try to explain this to him and he tries to imply that it was easier for me to change my habits and ""it's not the same thing"". "
407,Fair enough. 
408,I feel like this would be better if said directly to the neighbor. A random note is infinitely more creepy
409,"Regarding that last paragraph, what are you supposed to do then? Just suffer? Never get better? "
410,Try looking for a group like Overeaters Anonymous in your area for more support in between therapy sessions? 
411,"You rsvped yes, so I say go, and leave early.

I would not think of her as a friend. I would actually think she had a crush at you, because it seems weird to break up your friends relationship like that. Anyhow, Going vs being «the guy who did not show up last min, whats the drama?!?!» + you said yes is an easy decision. Be the bigger man, dont make new problems for yourself. But remember this lady is not, and probably never were your friend."
412,"First off, some people don't like to befriend classmates or coworkers in order to completely separate professional and personal lives

Also to answer your question: you don't bring it up to them. If you do not want to burn any bridges then don't confront people in your professional life about personal issues. It seems most of your classmates view you as a professional acquaintance and that's a great starting place for friendship. An awkward and unnecessary confrontation will only set you back. 

If you really want to break the professional barrier and befriend these people, then you have to single people out and invite them to dinner or drinks. Do not appear over bearing or sensitive about gaining friends, portray a fun and carefree attitude and they will gravitate towards you. 

Also, you should reflect upon your overall attitude on the situation. Your classmates did not ""ditch"" you. They don't owe you anything and it isnt required for them to show up to significant events. Right now, you just aren't that close to them. That is perfectly fine. You can get close to them, but not all at once. Start small and build up, you'll do great. "
413,"Actually you could do something about it, you just don't want to. You could easily go see her where she is, apologize, and spend time with her. Or you could spend your night agonizing over your own insecurities. 

Or if you do choose not to see her again tonight - figure out how to work on your issues, come up with a proper plan of action, and work on a real apology. "
414,You left her with your friends with no phone and no keys? I would be prepared for her to be pissed. Can you call a friend that's with her and go find her?
415,"What are you doing to work on your insecurity and anxiety issues? That's what you need to be worrying about, not this.

You need to be in therapy if you're not already. Because this is frankly ridiculous and you seem to know that. "

419,"I run UTI tests at a clinic - just fyi the reason for this is that a lot of uti symptoms can be caused by pregnancy, and also that if someone is pregnant and doesn't have a UTI you have to use different antibiotics to treat them. It sucks to have to not believe people but also there is a wholeness range of ""I can't be pregnant!"" out there that includes a lot of ""well I guess it's possible"""
420,"Let her come to you. She wrongfully accused you, and now it’s her responsibility to make it right. "
421,"You should walk down the aisle alongside her; as equals. 

Her dad is pure scum and she is not his property. Domestic violence, sexist as hell and kept your gf's family prisoner. These are not the hallmarks of an ideal father. 

She needs a therapist immediately. Her father will NEVER be an ideal father. 

I foresee another equivalent instance in future where she'll never defend your relationship if her dad is around in her life. That's something you have to ponder on. "
422,"&gt;Also, he commented that he did not like masculine showing off by guys either, so it was not a gender/stereotype thing

He's relating her behavior to that of a man, and is calling her unfeminine, so let's not pretend it's divorced from gender stereotypes. That said, he's entitled to his attractions. But he doesn't have to talk about them in a critical manner or unfairly characterize her either. It also means he's a bad match for her, because his preferences don't mesh with hers, and hers should absolutely take priority in her life."
423,"Dude.

You have family paying off your debts and you think you get to say what she spends her money on? No.... you do not. 

I'm willing to bet that her apartment furnishings cost less than a car."
424,"Thank you so much for sharing all of this. I didn’t know biromantic was a thing but I do think that’s part of my insecurity that I didn’t know how to articulate, so thank you for mentioning that. That’s definitely something I’m going to talk to him about. When he told me, I was just kind of absorbing everything so questions/insecurities starting popping up the following days when I had time to process it all. 

I love the shrimp example btw. You are really helpful and have no idea how much I appreciate it. "
425,"&gt; When we try having sex the normal way, where we're both fully awake, it usually doesn't lead anywhere.

Well, what's shutting things down? 

&gt; Fortunately when I told her about it she trusted me, so I didn't come off looking like a rapist and we laughed about it, but I really don't know what to do here.

Did she act like the conversation was over? Is she going to try anything to figure out why this is happening? Did she have suggestions or even act like it needed a remedy?"

428,Being under an insane amount of stress isn’t an excuse for coming home and destroying the kitchen in front of your kids. Don’t pin the blame on her. 
429,this is an interesting point. i don't feel like being a child to my mother in law either. 
430,"I get the vibe from reading the post that ""F"" is center-stage every time she's there and gets 100% of everyone's attention.  The fact that she does this as a female makes the gf insecure regardless of their past relationship.  I suggest this because I've been both females in this dynamic at different points in my relationships.  I may be a loud mouth at parties and stuff, but I'm not trying to steal your bf.

OP, you should suggest your gf and F go out together and possibly form their own friendship or at least allow gf to see F as her own person and not an entertainment accessory of OP's family."
431,"You need to have a come to jesus talk with him.  You need to outright ask him if he wants to be married *to you*.  Not just if he wants someone to help pay the bills or clean the house.  If he says he wants to be married *to you*, then follow up and ask him why he doesn't want to spend time *with you*.  If you're married to someone then you should presumably like them and genuinely want to hang out with them.  He doesn't get the benefits of being married (and eventually being a dad) without putting in the effort."
432,"I have been pretty anti Jake's dad in most posts.  I don't know him, but everything OP has said (I know this situation, my 3rd oldest (you read that right MY) her dad is like this. Lots of shady dealings etc. I wouldn't be put in this situation because my wife wouldn't roll over to her ex. Also, my wife told me about his messages about ""being a family again"")  

I agree with you, Jake's dad is stuck in the picture until he disappears again (if he does). Your right he doesn't have to be besties, but he shouldn't speak ill of him so the boys can hear, then it just poisons your own kids away from you, especially if your talking about the ""FUN"" dad, and you happen to be the ""MEAN"" dad.

I am actually concerned about what other red flags are floating out there.

Hell, has OP done a arrest record search on the guy in a 5 state radius? Any vetting done? Was custody given right away or were supervised visits how they went? As a parent, that's some scary stuff to think about, especially since his wife is having conversations about his son with her ex.... without him."
433,"He is going there to do drugs. You know this right? He is going there to get blasted and you need to end this relationship before it becomes a legal problem for YOU. 

Start figuring out how to separate from him and start packing. "
434,"Yep ,OP is getting screwed here.

I’m sure OP put up the money for the kid, then ex steps in, flush with cash due to,not having to pay for the kid and takes over the fun role.  I’d be furious."
435,Strong bet people who jump at the “it’s none of your business” card is because they’re cheaters themselves.  
436,"&gt;What's surprising is that you are 30 and didn't realize you were friend zoned.

&gt;When we get to the next bar she is still flirting hard with me and dancing and kissing me.

Most people wouldn't think ""I'm being friendzoned"" when a girl is literally kissing them. "
437,"Ummmm not really. 

Let me preface this by saying, you have every right to live however you want. You can dress however you want, love whoever you want and be whoever you want to be, no question. 

She is NOT shallow. She cannot help who or what she is attracted to, at all. You kept this from her until you were in a serious relationship with her, that is not fair. You can’t just expect her to be completely accepting and understanding. Don’t be so naive. 

I feel bad for her, because she thought she had a certain relationship and then everything was turned upside down. Again, her not being attracted to you after this is not something she can help. You have to realise this. You are not a victim. 

Let her go, and find someone who knows about this and is accepting of this from the very beginning. "
438,"Oh, I misunderstood. I don't see a reason to like her anymore."
439,"Absolutely true. I'm a grown woman and I've developed a good life and family for myself, but in my head I an always in last place to everyone and everything, even when I'm really not. It kills my husband to realize that I always feel like I'm least important to him, to our family, to our friends.... but I was always less important than my dad's wife and always less important than my mom's men. In fact I still am. I can't remember a time where myself or my sister was the most important thing to our parents. 

And it has mentally and emotionally damaged both of us SO much. 

So, OP, just remember that if you do something like cutting out her mother or herself, she will remember for the rest of her life. She will resent you. She will lose her trust in you. She will see you as a weak man. She will feel her self worth drop so far you may never be able to pick it back up. It will always be in the back of her heard even if things seem good between you. If you can recognize all that as a potential and likely outcome and you still back your new wife here, you don't deserve to be in your child's life in the first place. "
440,Woahhhhhh. Your wife is WAY out of line. 
441,"The grass is greener where you water it. If you feel your relationship getting stale, try to think of new things to do to spice things up. The single life isn't as glamorous as you think it will be, and typically involves a lot more lonely nights. While I don't believe in the idea of soulmates, truly healthy, supportive, mutually beneficial relationships are rare. Think about which you will regret more - not experiencing the single life, or not being able to find a relationship like yours again for an indeterminate length of time. Just like there is a limited window to live the single life, your relationship is also a limited time opportunity. Once you break up, it's likely that you won't be able to get back together.

That being said, if you find that you continue to long for the single life, you should break up with her. She deserves to be with someone who is 100% committed to being in the relationship and ending it sooner is better than later."
442,We already know they’re not fashion items by taking one look lol
443,"&gt;TL;DR I am no longer sexually attracted to my SO of three years. **How will this play out from your experience**?

You will continue to lie to her while not sleeping with her.  You will start noticing, then flirting with other women.  When your GF starts pressing you about sex, you will come up with excuses that may blame the world, your schedule or her for your lack of performance.  You will continue making her think you are interested in working on things.  In the meantime, your flirting with other women will end up with you finding someone ""who really gets you"" with chemistry off the charts and you will start an affair.  After another 2 years of dragging this out, making your GF miserable and thinking she is a freak for desiring more sex, she will discover your affair.  Then you will tell her some story and after a few months of heartache, you'll go live with your new GF, leaving your old one a blubbering mess of emotional wreckage.

Or;

You could just tell her now that you aren't feeling it anymore and break up."
444,I disagree. This is a perfect opportunity for her to learn something about him that maybe she needs to know before investing any more time with him. I think even if she doesn't enjoy herself the knowledge she will gain from having him come along will tell her a lot.
445,"Same!  I'm in my early thirties and only in the past few years has my family started to lay off the ""when are you going to have a baby?  You know you'll feel so much differently about kids when it's your own!!"" talk.  No, I really won't, thanks."
446,"Seems like he's addicted to porn. Masturbation, porn, addictions, caring more about this pleasure than caring about his partner and her requests. It's all related. In this case."
447,"They gave her a painkiller and a muscle relaxer and I know she already takes some kind of sleeping pill at night. That sounds like a lot of pills to be on all at once, but she's a nurse."
448,"You can’t veto a break up. You two are broken up, despite whatever this guy says or chooses to think."
449,This seems like a huge overreaction.  What else is gong on here?
450,The feeling I get is how lucky I am. And I am reminded of that with every crazy story I read here.
451,"Holy crap, this sort of post half makes me wonder if the guy is an idiot or whether he's just secretly wanting you to dump him. 

This is completely and utterly unacceptable. Of course it's humiliating to know that for so long these people were going around behind your back without telling you. I would be just as upset as I imagine you are. Please leave this dude and focus on yourself and your child. It sounds like the whole group of them are assholes. "
452,"It's not too scary for most people. Something like a third of the world's population have been exposed to it, but have a strong enough immune system to fight it off. So for most, if you get infected you might feel a few cold like symptoms for a few days. 

Unfortunately, babies don't have that immune system, which is why pregnant women have to be so careful. "

454,All this. Also she sounds like a HEAVY planner. Maybe ask if y’all can compromise with like a monthly fun-fund. A little set aside here and there so y’all can buy a wanted object or do a certain activity. That way she can see the numbers.

456,DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE TRYING TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE GOOD TO YOU.
457,"Idk if you realized this but you wrote this entire thing extremely defensively. Like you have paragraphs on paragraphs explaining all the various degrees at which your grandparents horrendous excuses for human beings. 

Repeat after me: I do not want to help these people. I should not feel guilty about that. 

I feel like the real issue is that you need to convince yourself that you’re not a bad person for not helping them. You listed them all out here and are still seeking outside validation. 

Girl, it’s your money and it’s you’re life. If you don’t want to help those douche bags FUCK THEM for all the reasons you listed and more. Take your life back. "
458,It makes me feel normal.
459,"My boyfriend and I do this! We are both software engineers so we have a weekly 'relationship retro' every Sunday evening. It's been fantastic for us. We ask the questions from the book Communication Miracles for Couples by Jonathan Robinson.

They are:

1. What was the best thing that happened to you this past week?

2. When did you feel closest to me this past week? Why?

3. When did you feel most distant from me this past week? Why?

4. What are you excited about or looking forward to doing in the near future?

5. What are you concerned about or worried about?

6. What have you recently felt grateful for? Why?

7. Is there anything you're avoiding saying or communicating to me? If so, what is it?

8. What have you appreciated about me this past week?

9. What have you appreciated about yourself this past week?

Weekly sounds like a lot but to be honest it's my favorite part of the week. Also, that book has a lot of good stuff in it. Highly recommend. We bought it not because we were having problems or anything but so that we could avoid having problems in the future. We also address any issues that come up in the moment - we don't like wait for Sunday to talk about a problem or anything like that. Sundays are just a good check-in."
460,Yeah this is it right here. I wouldn't bother about hurting her feelings (She clearly is doing whatever she wants without you in mind) and just tell her bluntly that she needs to pull her weight and shape up fast. 
461,"if there is a bill, am I able to contact hospital about the bill to verify that it is a for sure? Wasn't sure if my name wasn't on the bill if I could ask questions about the bill. "
462,"You're 22 and he's 29. You're in a normal social stage and he probably feels like it's immature and stupid, which it would be if you were all 30, but even then, who cares.

And AGAIN with the list."
464,"Again that has to come from the spouse, not OP. This is her MIL, not her mother. The spouse needs to grow a backbone and stand up to her for OP's sake. 

Otherwise, I guarantee OP will become a scapegoat and everyone will make her out to be the bad guy in all this.

""Wow I can't believe my child married such a major asshole. Can you believe how pushy she is? She tried to separate my child from their own mother. Who does that?!""

I get where you're coming from but I guarantee that OP herself saying something will cause a lot more grief for her. I think talking about these things to inlaws yourself is perfectly fine if they're normal, healthy, mature human beings. However, MIL just sounds like a raging narcissistic drama queen."
465,"Do not go!!

BTW, one rule I have in my house is we *never* make fun of someone's name. Ever. They didn't choose their name."
466,"What do you mean? He made the decision to have sex. 

Also, his kids didn't decide to be born, but he put all of this bs on them."
467,"This is my point - you're talking in terms of ""what's she done to him"". Of course nothing, which is what proves his feelings are based on stuff around her, life changes, relationship changes, etc. Don't get defensive on her behalf - think about why he might be feeling this way, rather than blaming him for how he feels. He's not attacking you or the baby, he's just expressing what his feelings are. Fine, later than you'd like, but better late than never. 

And similarly, you say ""when it comes to the baby I get pissed off and can't think like that"". Think about your husband. You know, the way you did before the baby came along. You didn't really address my point about how he fits into the idea that the baby is ""your whole world"". Because he should still be a big part of your world.

Of course the baby has needs that have to be dealt with, of course your relationship changes. But be very very careful that you don't neglect your relationship in favour of your new baby - it's an easy trap for new parents to fall into, and I know more than one couple who've ended up splitting up because one of them prioritised their child above everything, the other got resentful (*independently* of their commitment to parenting) and things went south. "
468,Your husband sounds like a real piece of shit
469,Throw the whole husband away. 
470,"While that may be the case, it is not OPs responsibility to deal with any disorder her roommate has. It is her roommate’s responsibility to keep it in check. This kind of invasive behavior is unacceptable no matter what the reason. "
471,"If I were your mother, I wouldn’t have spent hundreds of dollars on the assumption that a 20 yr old would easily be able to pay me back. I feel like this could have been avoided if she’d just mentioned it beforehand. 

Also, off-topic but given how old she is, your grandparents must be real troopers to have raised a baby at their age and be as wonderful at it as you say. "
472,"In most of your examples, your BF is rude. But it sounds like your mom bought the ticket without discussing it with anyone, then just expected to be paid back?  You talk like she was doing something ""nice"" by having you and your BF fly at least one way so BF wouldn't have to spend time with brother, but it's not a ""gift"" if she expects repayment for a purchase she made on his behalf without consulting him.

With the giving ""gift"" she expects to be paid for, and ""feeling used"" because she gave you housewarming GIFTS, it sounds like your mom has some weirdness around money and gift-giving. She uses them as mechanisms to control people, favor-sharking, or her gifts come with strings.

But your BF sounds rude, too. 

So I think you should tell your mom to not give ""gifts"" unless she gives them for the joy of giving, and also not to spend you or your BF's money without asking (because giving someone something they didn't ask for then wanting to be paid for it is like spending their money).  Your BF should decline the ticket if he can't pay for it (unless your mom wants to call it gift in the true sense of the word ""gift""), and stay with the original plan of driving. Though in your BF's place, I would decline to attend this wedding at all, and decline all future gifts from your mom, since she holds gifts over his head and uses them as a tool or a weapon. But your BF should also work on his manners. And you should look at your compatibility with your BF, including financial goals and styles and communication styles, and think about if you really have a future together, or if there too many differences in your financial styles and communication styles. "
473,"Why does he need to bring anyone? He’s best man and probably knows the whole wedding party, plus OP said a bunch of his college friends are there. "
474,"Let me start by saying, I have made your exact same mistakes and fucked up my last 2 relationships because of it, but I feel a lot better in my life now so here's what I think: 

\-Sometimes we get way too dependent on other people, in your case its between you and your girlfriend (as was the case for me). After my last relationship ended I spent LOTS of time working on myself, hitting the gym, ran my first marathon, started making lots of friends, travelling, and the list goes on and on. The reason I am telling you this, is that now, I am with a girl and it doesn't matter who she hangs out with or chooses to spend her time with because: 

1) I have already fucked things up like this twice, I will not make that mistake again 

2) I feel good enough about myself and I feel attractive REGARDLESS of what she thinks of me. These days I do my own thing and all the right people will follow, and if my current girl decides to walk out that is 100% okay, because I will continue to take care of myself and try to achieve new things. 

So here's the shitty part of the post: you will NEVER, get rid of those feelings. I understand the weight in your chest, the panic in your mind, and if you were similar to me, the shaking in your hands. But the trick is, you need to develop yourself into a man that understands that even if she walked out tomorrow, regardless of shitty you feel (and you will feel like dogshit lol) that you are able to bear that pain. You need to get to a point in your life where no matter what gets thrown at you truly believe in your heart that you are capable of handling it. 

Once you realize that you are capable of handling whatever life throws at you, its smooth sailing from there. 

Also, I think its worth noting that by you being needy, you are literally making her less attracted to you. Which will then make you more needy, which will then make her even less attracted... and you can see how this will just keep snowballing. Do things for yourself, achieve things, set goals, etc, and not for her, for you. This is where confidence comes from.

IT IS HELLA IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO DO THINGS THAT YOU ARE PROUD OF 

One more thing lol, you are young and without a doubt you are going to fuck up a few more relationships, sorry, its the truth. Use them all as learning experiences and try not to make the same mistakes. "
475,"Guy was a jerk.

You have serious issues you need to resolve before you can be a part of a healthy relationship. 

Take your time, grieve the loss, and then spend time working on YOU. Find things that make you feel good about who you are, and you won't need to have your self worth validated by some asshole."
476,"OP I suggest a doctors note. (Something tells me he's not attending your prenatal appts?) Have your doctor explicitly forbid you from scrubbing bathtubs and getting into the dryer.

Then, bring him the note as a problem for you to solve as a team. ""Hey honey. It's official. I cannot do these things. How do you suggest we fix it?"""
477,If you look but his gf perspective she is at the age where you need to settle and have kids. After 30 there can be issues having what you can have now. 
478,"When I was pregnant I physically couldn’t get laundry out of the washer at that point. 

*(It’s funny you responded with “squat or bend over” — since that is the issue. You can’t bend over, AND also reach into the bottom of a top-loading washer — belly’s in the way).*

&gt; There’s no evidence that physical activity has any negative effects on fetuses.

*Her doctor* told her to cut back on physical activity. Even if you’re also an obstetrician, you haven’t examined OP."
479,Actually very true. He probably does that all time with every thing she asks because he needs to know why she wants it a certain way and then she explodes because she doesn’t want to defend everything she asks 
480,"I immediately knew who this was, just read an article about the arrest."
481,That's just not accurate. I go to sleep early and my husband plays games late into the evening. We still share a bed and have plenty of time to cuddle. That's bad advice.
482,"I dunno. You got pregnant with an unemployed stoner, whom you were not married to, and expected him to become a contributing member of society because you got preggers? And in the past 8 months, he's stayed an unemployed stoner. 

Honestly it was a mistake to hitch your wagon to a 32 year old dude who can't make rent. 

He hasn't changed, he's not going to change, this is it. "
483,I've got one and when my therapist suggested survivor's guilt I broke down and cried because oh my god there's a word for it
484,Not that I need permission exactly but he has always said he won't be able to take care of her by himself so if I said I'm leaving for the weekend he'd probably just look at me like I was crazy.
485,Honestly you sound so wishy washy about this - I would give yourself some time alone to really think. You should have a good understanding of yourself at this point - enough to know if and what you want in life partner. It does seem like if you were genuinely falling for this person you’d know by now. I suggest breaking up - you need therapy and she needs to find someone who knows what they want and don’t waffle around it. 
486,"&gt;... he realized ""oh, If i go back home, I loose her. That's no good"", and walked the walk back.


It seems like that’s what happened. 

He knows I can’t follow him, and that I wouldn’t want an LDR that doesn’t have a prospect of closing the distance. I’ve said that before to him. 

But the thing is, yes, it’s a possibility he might go back at some point, and it would mean we’d break up, but I don’t think that’s reason enough to break up *now*? It’s like saying in any relationship “we might break up at some point in the future, better do it now” - that means no relationship would be worth even starting. Sorry if I misinterpreted, but that’s how I understood your statement. 

But I think the clarifying possible outcomes is a good idea, just so we’re prepared in whatever case may happen. Thank you for your advice. "

488,I was in a relationship like this for 20 yrs. This is who this guy is. I suspect he has a personality disorder.  Something like covert narcissism probably. He's very passive aggressive. He enjoys punishing you. This isn't going to change. This isn't where you want to be. Please don't waste your life on this man.
489,Well it's one thing to still see your family but to leave her behind for Christmas?? That's really unkind considering her lack of family ties.
490,"He's unemployed, how the hell did he come up with 800 quid for the tickets? SOMEBODY in this family is an enabler."
491,"Oh come on.  Just focus on the OP, this isn’t your personal diary."
492,That’s literally the exact opposite. No customer is beholden to your boss or company rules. And in most cases the power imbalance is arguably the other way. Serving food? What are you gonna do with my food if I reject you? Why do I have to come to shop and feel uncomfortable about turning down a personal invitation? It’s worse for an employee to hit on a customer. Neither is cool but yeah arguably one of them isn’t breaking workplace rules and one is. I would never shop at a company again if they didn’t reprimand an employee for asking me out and I might not feel comfortable or safe EVER returning to that establishment. It’s wildly inappropriate. And I don’t know any company that allows their employees to ask out customers who they don’t know 
493,"I was waiting for someone to say that. Pneumonia is not a joke. I mean, ditch the guy, of course, because he’s garbage, but OMG go to hospital!!"
494,"It sounds like you've been shooting him down for a while and that he's tired of not feeling wanted. How often do you guys have sex? How often do each of you initiate and turn the other down? This sounds like r/DeadBedrooms territory. 

Also stop minimizing what you said when you were drunk. It clearly really hurt him and you should be able to accept and respect that. It sounds like there might also be some financial resentment here too. "
495,"Honestly you can offer to do whatever he wants when he gets back from his trip if he isn't already planning on divorce. Go to couples' counseling, go to your own therapist, talk to your doctor about your libido, go on date nights, whatever he wants and is willing to do. But you also need to seriously respect and accept his decision if he wants a divorce, because that is a very real possibility. He sounds done.

Edit: And STOP focusing on YOURSELF. You have been selfish for long enough."
496,"Same, I am kind of afraid though that “James” is going to turn out fake, and this crazy lady is going to abduct op on her beautiful wedding day. If we stop hearing from OP, at least there’s a trail for detectives to find OP. "
497,"&gt; I don’t think it was a good idea and I think you should never try to hit on your customers again.

Based on her update she is only really interested in people telling her how brave and amazing she was by putting some guy on the spot like that and not the fact it was unprofessional and could have cost her job base case scenario. "
498,you're not entitled to anything from her. she doesn't have to give you a reason. if you want to be involved in your child's life contact a lawyer and see about getting joint custody.
499,"Boohoo. She is 23 she is all grown up with her own convictions now, surely she can be an adult and understand you don't want a racist criminal in your house."
500,"Oh my gosh, that’s awesome - I haven’t seen that show in years and instantly heard her say it exactly like that :)"
501,"Forgiveness has to be earned, and your parents haven't done shit to earn it. In fact they continue to neglect you as they have their entire lives. Your problem is that you're deadset on trying to forgive your parents, but you know deep down inside they don't deserve it.

What you actually want is to *let go*. You want to let go of the negative feelings your parents are causing you. You can't do this by forcing yourself into a fake forgiveness. You have to confront them once and for all, without backing down, and you'll end up with one of two outcomes. Either they break down and truly apologize, and you can work towards a forgiveness if they are willing to change, or they stay put in their neglectful ways, and you cut them out of your life once and for all. 

And stop supporting your horrible mother. She can pay her own bills, she's a grown woman."
502,His parents bought him a new Mustang so I doubt he'll be spending any time in my car. 
503,"How is it inappropriate?.... she spoke to Jake's father about Matt staying before she EVER spoke to Matt's father (you know her husband, Matt's father AND the one who has raised Jake for 5 of his 8 years with no help from his disappearing dad). Then tried to guilt and manipulate her husband into allowing said stays."
504,"You're 24 and you don't have kids, you don't have to be understanding of someone who does. Everyone is selfish, you're just being honest about it. "
505,"I bet ex doesn’t pay support and he’s trying to avoid it by “being active” in his child’s life. Maybe he does pay, but a dude who dips on a child/mother doesn’t have the odds in his favor to begin with "
506,"You are totally right about the animal thing. Very off topic but one afternoon, our dog was laying in front of the doorway to our extra room/pantry/misc room. She normally only goes in there to eat (she tried to be glued to my side all day otherwise). She was just STARING. Everytime I asked her what was wrong, she just kept moaning and grunting but wouldn't move.

About an hour later, I discover a field mouse hiding in our eggplants in a produce crate we have. 

Animals will definitely tell you what's up. Keep an ear and eye out for things like that, OP. Just in case he starts escalating things."
507,"Wow. So OP is a hot mess too. Reading the description of his parent's house - I cannot believe he thought that was a good environment for a tiny baby, even if it cannot crawl. He said there was dust, junk, and old food everywhere, and it was ""too far gone"" for him to clean.

Neither of these people should be responsible for a baby. And OP needs to start taking some responsibility for his own messes. Because that is all you can do. You can rail against the injustice of other people's behaviour until you're blue in the face, but all you can really do is try be better. And that means paying child support if you don't currently have custody, and not getting in debt by buying fancy unnecessary things like TVs...and somehow trying to make that the GF's fault too - no OP, take responsibility for your debt and your bad decisions."
508,"Oh I missed that, is the mom homophobic too? I only caught the comments about how the sister was so pretty and spending time with boys would make her have a bad rep"
509,"&gt; He has said it doesn't matter if I make 50K or if I make 250K.

Then why does he call you lazy and say things like ""Where are you?"" when you say you're happy with your career? This line seems like total bullshit to me. The rest of your post absolutely screams that money is more important to him than just about anything else."
510,Have you expressed these feeling to him? Tell him you need to talk and focus on stating what you wrote here with I feel statements and let him know how is behavior when you climb impacts you and how you view him. 
511,"I was born with my birth mark affecting a very viable part of me (my face). I used to be made fun of and absolutely hated the way I looked; I identified with the mutants from the X-Men comics and often imagined myself in a fantasy world where at least being a mutant could be cool (if you had a power!). 

I had zero self-esteem for much of my life; I got 'crushes' but no one ever liked me. I walked with my head down, just hoping not to be made fun of and staying out of people's ways. I was pretty sure no one would ever want me. 

As I got older, I discovered my own sexuality which made me more confident around guys because I realized I didn't want one. Although I looked the same (I still thought I was unattractive, I just didn't care as much), I started carrying myself different around men and talking to them and being less shy and THAT's when men started wanting to date me (which was quite ironic; they only came around after I didn't want them anymore). 

Anyway,  my point is, a LOT of it is your own self-confidence. Having low self-esteem is unattractive and that's why no one was ever into me. I still thought (and think) that I'm weird looking, but I was 30 when I met a woman who I hope will become my wife... she loves me for my heart, personality, wit, maybe even a little charm. And hell, if she thinks I'm cute I ain't gonna argue! 

Stop thinking so low of yourself. The right kind of people aren't attracted to people who don't love themselves. "
512,You've been gone for 18 months. She has had plenty of time to herself. I suspect that she has been talking to another guy and feels like he is the one for her. She is trying to spare your feelings by softly breaking up with you and head to divorce while she has another on the side waiting. She doesn't think she has cheated but she has fallen for someone else is my guess. 
513,"Disinvite. Tell him if he's gonna be a party pooper, then he can't come.

Sounds like he has issues communicating his feelings and expects you to read his mind. That's frustrating."
514,"\&gt; You are not my gatekeeper. 

OH sorry I didn't realize this was about you. My mistake."
515,"Period/pre-period shouldn't stop you talking to each other or touching each other! Fine, nothing sexual if she's not in the mood, but the core elements of your relationship shouldn't take a major hit for 50% of the time. Having a toddler is hard, and she absolutely deserves time for herself. **At the same time** this is a *relationship*, not two people functioning indepedently of each other. You should be considering each other's feelings, and of course that means encouraging her to take time for herself, but it also means her thinking about your needs.

It's absolutely not unreasonable to have a conversation with her where you both spell out what you want/need, then work **together** to find a middle ground you're both OK with."
516,"I feel like some of these comments are really missing the point; he's not holding you at gunpoint to cook for him, you want to and you want to make it work! I'm not having the exact same problem, but similar - I LOVE cooking for my partner, would do it 3x a day if I could, and she's just recently had to go gluten-free for medical reasons. It's been a bit of a struggle, and I'm still working on it. I also have a voluntary diet restriction, so trying to accommodate both of us can be challenging.

I think my best advice is to start experimenting with vegan substitutes and see how much you can cope with. If you commonly make multiple elements to a meal, having some of them be vegan and others not be is an option. A really easy vegan swap is to switch to a high-quality margarine - you'll adjust quickly to fake butter and you can save the good stuff for when only you eat it! There's a lot of dishes where cheese can go on at the end for you, and not for him. 

Something that's helped me out is that even if my partner and I aren't going to be eating the exact same thing, she can cook with me in the kitchen and our food finishes around the same time. So we're still hanging out together, bonding over food, being cute and goofy, etc. 

Also, vegan main dishes are pretty challenging sometimes, but vegan desserts can be really easy - you should get some of those food-provider love chemicals you're missing by trying to whip up extra goodies. "
517,"Her reaction was shitty and she sounds like a jerk, but there are much better ways to follow up on a conversation that's gone cold. As a woman who's done a lot of online dating, I don't like when I get those ""are you still interested?"" messages. To me it feels cold, pushy, and needy all at once, like you can't handle a few days of space and are expecting a lot of affirmations and explanations without considering some reasons why I might not have responded. Think about her options for replying to that message - either she's not interested and she doesn't reply or she feels a bit uncomfortable that you're more invested than she is, or she is interested but is now in the position of having to state that she's interested (a lot of pressure when you barely know someone) AND justify her silence! There's no good way to respond.

A better response is just to pick up the conversation where it left off, make a reference to a previous topic, or start a new conversational thread. If she's not interested, she won't answer and you'll know where you stand, so just send one follow up and then let it be.

Some examples could be ""I just tried a coffee from that coffee shop you mentioned, it was fantastic!"" ""Omg are you watching Orange is the new black?"". You could even do a cheesy joke or a very simple ""hey, how's it going?"""
518,"&gt;In a few months, he's going to move in with someone who he has always loved

Hopefully it's his mother.

If not? I'd enjoy the few months you have your friend. Sounds like he doesn't know how to not be dating someone."
519,"I'd like to second this. Other commenters suggesting that there's ""nothing to see here"" are probably missing the point - this is intimidating and it can make you feel jealous and somehow less than special. He hasn't done anything wrong, but I can get why you feel the way you do.

Give yourself some time to get used to it, is my advice - there is no need to be rash. "
520,"A rockier relationship might draw more of these kinds of letters out, as a way of compensating.

Like if you are insecure, you might compensate. In this case, maybe she was sending these because it was an insecure relationship (and only a month, more than likely love hormones in full swing)

I did some pretty extravagant things to ""keep"" a rocky relationship that I never would have thought to do in a more stable healthy one."
521,"This is an insidious form of the Sunk Cost Fallacy; the idea that, because the previous thing lasted for a certain amount of time, it's necessary for you to give it a particular mourning period before you can be officially ""over"" it.  But you were over it well before it ended.

If you were in a restaurant, and you had a dish served to you that you did not like, and they replaced it with something you really enjoyed, would you feel as if you were ""supposed"" to either wait to eat the new dish, or not enjoy it right away, because you had *just* had the previous dish on the table?  Probably not.

This new relationship is what it is; let it stand or fall on its *own* merits, and do not let your previous one cast a shadow across it in your mind.  If this is real, then it will *remain* strong.  If it is not, then it will not.  But don't let something real be cast in doubt *because* of something that was not."
522,"Please stop being so dramatic with the 'is all fair in love and war'. this is not love or war. You just have shitty friends, that have no respect for you. And from the way you have reacted so far, you have little respect for yourself as well. That is what you should work on."
523,I think it may be a good idea to search his phone.  I'm sorry.
524,I am not going to dig back through my old emails because I know for a fact there is cringe-y shit in there to my ex that I wrote when I was like 20 that would make me want to crawl into a hole and die of embarrassment now.

526,"&gt; I didn't want my marriage to be a failure

Society pushes a toxic model on us where maintaining a relationship long term is some kind of mark of success. It's not. There are no prizes for longest marriage. There are no prizes for ""fighting for your relationship."" This mindset keeps people in toxic marriages for far too long. It's ok to end things."
527,"Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess?"
528,"""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding; it wasn't a medical appointment. It was a personal matter. Is anything wrong?""

Look friendly and helpful."
529,"Why would you marry a man who treats his mom this way? Is that how you want him to raise your son? Is that how you want him to treat you? because he's going to. Get out before you tied down to him forever. Take your name off whatever joint account you have, take your money out of it, get away. "
530,"I'm sure you'll have trouble understanding this but men have a tendency to expect women to have an excuse that they believe is worthwhile. She probably thinks you wouldn't believe it. Because she told you what she was doing, and look at you."
531,Really just boner killers in general.
532,"&gt; There’s a big difference between a doctor and someone who is in your life that you voluntarily love, trust, and respect, which is why I didn’t recommend a dr.


To really egotistical people, maybe? Taking more stock in medical advice from a friend instead f an actual medical professional is very foolish. "
533,"Probably because she *wants* to provide good cooking, but is somewhat unable to. I'm sure it's hurtful to hear something isn't very good, even when it's not really anyone's fault.

Although I imagine that if something made me lose my sense of smell/taste, I'd just have the hubby or kid taste everything and write down what I used. Like ""two pinches of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, a garlic clove"" and do that every time so it's edible for the people who *do* smell and taste it. "
534,Something tells me he was using this thread to show her he’s right (again) and it didn’t go his way. I would also be pissed if I was the wife. 
535,That is creepy thinking . No wonder she's ghosting you .
536,Why would he have to remember exactly what his wife said?  No one is going to quiz him about the details. If someone asks him about a story he tells the story his way. No ones going to call out each embellishment his wife made. As long as it’s not outright lying and is just exaggerating to make the story more interesting no one is going to care. 
537,"I think they're referring to the closer to 40 a woman is, the more likely birth defects and other complications are. "
538,I seriously don't understand where the mystery is here. 
539,"I’m not suggesting that literally no other alternative exists in reality. I’m saying that from OP’s personal point of view, she doesn’t have a choice, at least for the present moment. She has been conditioned for over 12 years, by her parents no less, to believe that her brother is her responsibility and to accept that at X point, he’ll go live with her full time, and I think you underestimate how difficult it is to break free from that level of manipulation. "
540,"""Are you sure you want ice in it?""

""You know, actually, I don't want ice. I'm not sure why I said I wanted ice just now, when I didn't. What a crazy and random thing to say, huh??""

/s in case not obvious"
541,"&gt; You lifted more than her, you lifted her spirits.

A true follower of the teachings of Brodin.

Wheymen."
542,"&gt;It’s like her parents realized they could train their daughter to be a full time caregiver for her disabled brother and then be able to have a more normal life, which is so messed up and unfair.

This right here. 

Look ive worked with Special Olympics and a wide range of other socal outreaches. But the fact is huge suffering is imparted at random and mental handicaps are among the worst.

To OP, what you feel is commendable and incredibly brave. But damn girl you are your own person. A phrase thrown around here is “dont set yourself on fire to keep someome else warm.” You deserve your own life. So does your college bound twin brother. 

So does your other twin brother. But it should not come at the cost of sacrificing yourself. You did not make this decision or situation. You were born into it not bound to it. 

"
543,That's a lot of apprehension for someone who's engaged to him. 
544,"Listen you have to get him on board with my special fool proof plan: it’s called the 2 Year Plan. 

It goes like this: you promise yourself from the moment you get somewhere new that you will give it two years. Period. It does not matter if you like it or not. You give it two years because that’s how long it takes to really get the hang of a place and find your own feet and a few friends and so on. Even if you HATE it and cry every day. Two years. It’s an exercise in strength. You become a new person who can navigate a new culture. 

I’ve performed my two year plan in the following cities:

San Francisco - 2002-2010
NYC - 2010-2014
London - 2014 to current 

Every time it’s like getting clubbed in the face professionally and personally. But you get through it and you end up becoming a SUPER interesting person, especially to yourself.

Don’t worry about the breakup. He’s just freaking out. However he needs to know he can’t knee jerk anymore. 

2 years."
545,"Honestly, no, not if it's a regular thing and I would like to hear what her brother has to say on why he no longer lets  her over because I feel like there's more to it than this, like maybe this isn't the first time she's gotten drunk and acted foolish, or something else happened that night that she's withholding from me. Idk. I feel like it would be kind of sneaky to talk to her brother behind her back tho"
546,"&gt;Does anyone have any advice as to where I should go from here?

Focus on financial independence and get out as quickly as you reasonably can. In the meantime, grey rock and try to keep yourself safe. You don't have much influence in this situation so long as your dad is going to enable your sister."
547,It does sound like she may actually be on the autistic spectrum though. Not just ADHD. Sensory overload in ADHD is more of a secondary symptom and would not be be this extreme in most cases.
548,[removed]
549,"If this is actually real, and I doubt it, then the only smart thing to do is not go. I don't think it really needs any further explanation. There's literally not one positive to doing otherwise."
550,"&gt; Where do you live?

in the nineteenth century, apparently"
551,I should have added that I think the fact that she invited OP is a subconscious call for help. She is making statements that OP can objectively prove are untrue and inviting her into the lie. I think she wants help. 
552,"Nonsense. You hanging in there for 5 years waiting for him to propose indicates low self-worth. I would just say, *If we aren't getting married, I'm leaving you.*  No one needs years in their 30s to decide if they should marry their lover.  You are modern people, presumably you are making decisions together about things that affect you. "
553,"Double check this James dude doesn't come up on some scammer website.

...the 'ex girlfriend keeping us apart totally' makes me think erotomania or a dude with a girlfriend lying out of his ass though.

&gt; She told me that her feelings for James were becoming stronger, despite the fact that they had no contact. Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together.

Like, this is straight up something a person with erotomania would say, look up erotomania/de clarembaults syndrome.  Alternatively, she's just lying and escalated to even more grandiose shit because you stepped away.  I had a friend like that and because I was so fucking nonplussed at everything she kept going and going and going with the reveals that, in hindsight, made no sense.  A 'you're invited to wedding' is designed to be hard to ignore and merit a response.

I'd confront her with the evidence *just in case* its' a scammer trying to leech her money.  If she's erotomanic the guy is potentially in danger, if he's scamming her she's at risk and needs a dose of ""the horses/houses aren't real"".  Once you figure out wtf is going on you're safe to just pull away - you're valid to just pull away and want nothing to do regardless.  You already dropped this friend and now she's trying to rope you back in with dramatics.  But yeah I'd personally confront her with the disrepancies (Painted as concern for ""hey I came across the house/horses online and think you might be being scammed, what's going on?"")and see how it goes."
554,[removed]
555,Oof. I like how you get to the point.
556,Could this be because she sees you as the winner in the relationship between you two? My thought is that she has become desperate to appear as a success to you. 
557,"First off, opening someone else’s mail is a federal crime. You would have been better off to bring it to him and you both read it together. 

Second, he’s definitely been writing her back."
558,"Maybe he felt uncomfortable. He might have just said yes to make it less awkward. Im not trying to be a dick here but reverse the sexes for a second. If you were a customer and some random guy was at a counter. You want to pay and move on with your life.

Now this guy asks you out and now you are in a cue waiting for him to give your change. You are going to feel extremely uncomfortable. If you said no he might cause a scene. So a non committal yes and never making eye contact when you return to that store is now your only option. 

You put this guy in an awkward situation. He might have had a girlfriend. Maybe he just wanted to avoid a scene. In the modern day you cant just ask someone out, especially if youre a guy. For a girl, well youre ""harmless"" and its cute. But a guy would be creepy and rude if he did that.

Now I have no problem with what you did but an increasingly amount of people do. I congratulate you on your bravery but make sure that you areant making someone uncomfortable if youre asking them out in a place where youre not really supposed to be doing that. "
559,"Hey, I’m sure she is just proud of what she has accomplished. She’s finally comfortable in outfits she didn’t normally feel good in. I don’t think you have anything to worry about if she’s just wearing different clothes. Message me if you’d like to talk about it :)"
560,"&gt;Nothing ever changes, I feel like he doesn’t take it seriously..

Yeah, because there are no consequences. He's an alcoholic (one of the signs is a huge personality change when drunk), and as a person who grew up with an alcoholic father, I really, genuinely advise you to just end the relationship completely and go find someone else who isn't an addict. Save yourself while you still can, seriously."
561,You're acting like you accidentally shrunk his favorite shirt or said something rude in an argument. This isn't just a series of mistakes. Stop minimizing it.
562,"I've been where you are, OP, and you don't have to line a job up necessarily. Abusive jobs wear on our mental health, and often leave us too exhausted to put the right energy into a job hunt.

I quit mine and had a better job with more than double the salary within a month. I had time to find the right recruiters, craft multiple resumes, write cover letters, put a portfolio together, interview at multiple places, etc.

The only thing is, it strongly helps to be in a sizeable city with a lot of job opportunities in your field. And also, get a recruiter. They're often demonized for taking a cut, but they're awesome negotiators who will still usually get you a better salary than you could on your own, and they'll tailor all the documents you send them to increase your chances for the job."
563,"Disagree, I can see where she's coming from.

When my boyfriend and I did long distance after college, I started thinking that codependency was a problem in our relationship because in our time apart, I realized how much he took over my life when he was around. Without him there, I was almost incapable of going out and being social. I was depressed. Every time I returned home to an empty apartment, I could literally feel my heart aching, because I missed him so much.

It made me realize that I should be able to make myself happy without him around. I was too codependent on him, and when he was away it really shined a light on this issue. I think this is exactly what OP's wife is experiencing."
564,It’s not ideal but she’s an adult making these dumbass choices for herself. She can’t be coddled out of every stupid thing she does.
565,"Perhaps, but this line of thinking is dangerous. You already made the right decision to leave-- so stick to it. If conditions change down the road and make a relationship an option again, fine, but you shouldn't be hanging on to that as a possibility in your head because it will keep you from doing the things that you need to move on. No contact whatsoever for at least six months to a year. Trust me."
566,"I think it was absolutely appropriate for him not to hang out with Kayla 1 on 1 outside of work.  But, why did he have to give up the larger friend group?  As long as they are in a group and you trust him, there should not be any problem with him hanging out with his other friends, whether Kayla is there or not."
567,"Sit him down and ask what he thought the money was going to be used for instead and then start a fund for whatever that was. 

Then explain that just because your parents would never take a large sum of cash didn’t mean you had stopped saving it for them and your intentions were always to get that money to them someway somehow. Ask for the snide comments about impulsivity to stop because you weren’t doing something with no forethought, and it isn’t his place to police how your spend your money. It sounds like you have a lucrative job and good money sense and don’t need his oversight. "
568,"You should be honest with her, especially if you claim to value honesty. Tell her that you first heard about her though your mutual friend and that friend helped set you up. I would not use the phrase ""keeping tabs"" personally.

Edit: I mean, yeah, I would be  upset if I were her. You guys were both playing the long game with her and her friend should have just been honest about setting you two up.

Another edit: Yeah the more I read this the more you come off as creepy. You even acknowledge that you guys manipulated her to get her to date you. That's just...wrong. I could not imagine having that as the foundation of my relationship. What were you thinking?"
569,"it sounds like Camille was assumed to be dead. there is a process for that after a certain number of years and I belive it differs by state, but I can't imagine the time involved here wasn't long enough in every state. This is a truly tragic situation"

573,"As a father in this situation (exception my daughter's father isn't going to be let back in).... Realistically when you are gone for 5/8 of your child's life, you don't get those years child support zeroed out, nor do you just get custody like that.  That's not healthy for Jake, it's for sure NOT healthy for Matt. You ease back into it, with counseling.  

His wife is trying to throw their entire family into a big melting pot.... One of the adults has an extremely shady past, criminal history, and up and walked out his kid's life.  Another adult is having private conversations with said shady individual without including the last adult in the equation.  Then informs last individual in the equation, what his child will be doing with her ex.

Open mind, close that mind right up and protect your kids..... You got a wife, who is using guilt and manipulation to get her way and an ex who is having inappropriate private conversations with her.

Being Nice &lt; Children's wellbeing first.  Jake is already throwing it in OP's face he isn't his dad (oddly after disappearing dad comes back) and now OP's own wife is throwing it in his face. :\ "
574,"Wow, this sounds almost exactly like my ex girlfriend!  We were together for a year and a half and she never posted about me or our relationship, and any photos of us together were uploaded by me.  

Here's the thing I tried to keep in mind.  Your boyfriend is allowed to have his boundaries in the relationship, and you are allowed to express your wants and needs to him.  If this is bothering you, talk to him.  It doesn't have to be in a nagging or annoyed way.  Just tell him it bothers you, ask him if there's a reason why, listen to what he has to say about it, and then have a conversation about whether or not he's willing to compromise on his boundaries.  The important thing is to not make it an attack.  Don't lead with something accusatory like, ""How come you never post about me on social media?!""  Just say, ""Hey, can I talk to you about something that's bothering me?"" and then tell him how you're feeling about it.  "
575,"Because she had him on her backburner, she liked the attention, etc. So she feels slighted because now his attention is elsewhere and he is no longer available to her. Just distance yourself from her and focus on this guy. She sounds pretty awful anyways."

Also, call the cops on this guy every single time he does it. Let him and the police get to know one another really well."
578,"First thing I thought. Normal/Kind of Common, going NC with someone who is repeatedly abusive. Not normal? Going NC with your whole family, including your child, who's a normal 15 year old girl.

Your wife is right about one thing OP, you do need to go No Contact. With her, right after your divorce her. 

This woman is trying to isolate you, and that's a CLASSIC sign of abuse, and worse things to come. Let me guess, she goes through your phone, phone records, and finances, e-mails, etc? I'm interested to know. "
579,"I can tell you that I would not be pleased if my boyfriend told me I’m not allowed to spend the night with my friends. I’d be even less pleased if he used his anxiety disorder as the excuse. 

This isn’t a reasonable boundary. If your anxiety is triggered by being alone at night, you need to work with a therapist on mitigating it. "
580,"""We're not set up to accommodate guests.""  

We have a similar situation at our house.  Both DH and I work from home, so two of the ""bedrooms"" are offices.  There is no guest room.  The couch is old and even I can't sleep on it.  Overnight guests are just out of the question.  I'll invite people over for dinner, but then they have to leave because I don't like others in my space for that long.  "
581,"We have a cleaning lady once a month and it's an absolute lifesaver. My husband pushed back on it at first – ""why are we paying someone to do something we could do ourselves?"" – but I made the point that although we \*could\* do it ourselves, we were \*not\* doing it ourselves. Worth every penny, and they do a better job than we would at getting things seriously clean."

583,Break up with her. Manliest move possible. Also necessary. 
584,"Girl talking here.

Hey just because she's on day 1 of her period, doesn't mean you have to be her servant and that she gets to treat you like that. You were tired, and apparently, more tired than her.  

You don't have anything to reproach yourself, from my point of view. "
585,"Moving in seems like a bad idea. His 180° might have been just a panic reaction to try to not lose you, instead of him really wanting it.

We don't know how exactly the dynamic of you two is and how your conversations are going, but without knowing, it doesn't seem like you are manipulating him - at least not more than he is not really able to voice his concerns.

Whenever you are in a relationship and in the beginning, EVERYTHING just runs smoothly without anyone wanting something that could be cause for a debate, you should step back and ask yourself, if the relationship is really that smooth, or if one of you just doesn't tell  the truth or is upfront with their wishes.

That's why I think moving in right now would be a bad idea, as mentioned at the beginning."
586,"I never thought of it that way at all but it sounds very plausible that he gets off by controlling me.

I think you’re right... there really isnt anything i can do to change him. It’s not like he really listens to me... sometimes i dont know if he ever loved me at all.

Thank you so much for your advice."
587,"Honestly, I don't think the porn is the problem. It sounds like even he never used porn, he'd be a selfish lover and you still wouldn't have a fulfilling sex life. You can clearly state that you think his porn usage is making your relationship worse and explain that he needs to stop to show you he cares about that/so you can figure out if it helps or not. But do consider just cutting your losses and moving on if he's not willing to wait until Tuesday. "
588,Lock up your room after you've cleaned it up first yourself
589,"This is very helpful, thank you"
590,"If you're throwing things, driving dangerously when angry with her, and being aggressive with your words and body language, then you're abusive.  It doesn't really matter if she does it to.  "
591,"Good. For. You. 

There are many, many people out there who would have just caved to her wishes and set a terrible precedent for their new marriages. You did not. That took guts. I hope your fiancé gave you a big old bear hug and cooked you dinner that night. You’ve earned that and then some. "
592,"Your housemate came to you with two pages of no-value items she's accusing you of stealing with zero evidence. You're asking our advice. No, we don't have all the facts, but the few facts you're providing are raising a lot of red flags.

Good for you.

Maybe tomorrow you will discover that not everyone is the same as you - that not everyone likes the same things, foods, words or reacts or feels the same way about other things, foods, words. 

As you continue proceeding on the path to sentient adulthood, the next lesson involves discovering that that's OK and the key to being a decent human being is to be aware of other people's feelings, needs, wants - not to try to negate or put down someone else's personal experience with how you think you would have felt and therefore how you think they should feel. "
595,Let her sulk and complain. Hurt her feelings. You need to get over feeling badly for her if you are going to make any progress here. Have there been any consequences for her not paying rent or utilities? Change the netflix or wifi password. 
596,"I feel as though anti-depressants are a personal choice that shouldn't be dictated as an ultimatum by your significant other. If she cared about you, yeah I think she would support any kind of decision that shows you're trying to take care of yourself. It's weird to me that she considers it something break-up worthy. Would she break up with you over going to the hospital for a broken bone or other kinds of medication? Why is being diagnosed and treated for a mental illness so stigmatized? Seems like such a weird line to draw. Do what is best for you though, and don't stay with her out of fear of being lonely."
597,"Just ask him about. You’ve been together for a year and this is obviously odd because he doesn’t have any Spanish speaking family.

600,Why did you ignore what she wanted?
601,"I think if a woman was asking for advice for the same issue everyone would be saying “he’s an inconsiderate asshole.”   

most people are gonna tell you try and be more outgoing.  However, I think you should dig deeper and ask yourself why you’re going out to socialize with you’re GF if you yourself don’t enjoy it so much in the first place. 

"
602,"This sounds good in theory, but in reality I think that this would be very embarrassing and frustrating for OP.  Asking your friends to basically treat you like a child is probably not going to end that well emotionally.  "
603,Are you dating/married to God?
604,"So both of you are abusive and escalating, which isnt safe. You both need to break up and both need to attend solo therapy. The abuse you put on each other is not normal, safe, or sane, and its sad to think you both believe it is.

Also, sex shouldnt cause either of you to have friction tears. It means theres not enough wetness, and/or theres a skin problem. Whichever of you were tearing really should talk to the doctor. "
605,"He gets annoyed because he thinks what he did is no big deal - he doesn't care that you're hurt. Scratch that - it's worse than not caring that you're hurt - he's ANNOYED at you for inconveniencing him by daring to have your own feelings and opinions. If he really wanted to fix your relationship, he'd be doing whatever he has to do to regain your trust, not snapping at you for wanting the truth.

He just wants you to forget all about this ASAP, so things can get back to normal, and you let your guard down again, then he'll start sneaking around again. He thinks you're that stupid, that he can keep doing this, and can manipulate you into trusting him again. From your comment replies, so far he's right - you're determined to ""win"" him back, but what kind of prize is a manipulative lying cheater?

Also, the fact that he says he just went over there ""to see if he could resist it?"" First of all, you are the most gullible person in the world for believing that ridiculous lie. Second of all, assume for a moment it is an absurd unlikely truth - how horrible of a person does that make him, to use another person like that, to lead her on and use her as a ""test,"" to play with her feelings like that? So whether it's true or not, it makes him a liar and a user and a manipulator.

Look, you know this woman, so why don't you ask her what he's said about you, and what their relationship is? I don't think you will, because you know he sold her some BS story (about how you ""don't understand him,"" or you're ""breaking up soon,"" or he wants to break up with you, but has some reason he can't - your fragile mental health or something, probably), and you don't want to admit that deep down you know the truth.

Are you really so scared of being alone, that you'll put up with such a crappy relationship? Do you have no self-respect?"
606,"&gt; He went to a counselor who specializes in alcohol abuse and they said to him he was fine. 

Was that counselor the guy at the wine shop?"
607,"So he doesn’t even see his drug/alcohol use as a problem and wants to continue making his habits a priority, despite getting arrested, losing custody of his child, upsetting his girlfriend. There’s your answer. I’m surprised he is able to hold down a career the rate he is going. Seriously, you are young and successful, save yourself years of pain and drama and just end it. You will have no problem finding someone way better. "
608,"Depends on the person. Some people have less issue with this. 

I don't nessicarily agree, but it's a viewpoint some people have"
609,"&gt; OP needs to pick a side: follow the house rules and commit to family culture or move out and choose to break the cultural norms.

That’s a very black-and-white way of looking at things. Surely there is room in between cutting all ties with family or giving up all adult autonomy! People here are obsessed with living alone as THE sign of adulthood, which is a very American-centric viewpoint. So living with his parents becomes he’s still a child becomes he doesn’t get to make any decisions of his own, not until he moves out. That’s absurd. He can set boundaries without giving his parents and his culture the middle finger. "
610,"Regardless of how they feel about speaking the language or missing it, it was quite rude of both the SO and her family to speak their native tongue when in OP’s presence. He’s completely left out of the conversation until he’s “needed.”  That’s just shitty"
611,"Did he say how you make him feel that way?  Did he give examples of things you do or don't say or do?

Breathe, calm down, and go speak to him.  Ask him how he feels and why, and just listen.  Ask him what he needs.  And get therapy for yourself."
612,This is a psychological condition at this point and you need to work with a professional.
613,"Yeah. It makes me sad that so many people are unable to enforce their exceedingly reasonable personal boundaries. If I saw someone attempting to redecorate my house without my permission, the first words out of my house would be, “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” "
614,Do you have more of an example?
615,"She needs to dump him, and NOT put the sadsack's name on the birth certificate. "
616,"Turn it into a bonding experience. Sit down and create a ""will, want, won't"" list. That way you both know what the other will do, wants to do, and absolutely won't do. Boundaries are good, conversations about them are good too and it will help you know where you need work in your communication skills with one another. "
617,"Disregarding what was burnt, the fact that she took something he loved from a 5 year old, set it on fire and then took pleasure in taking him outside to show him that it's burning and on fire is enough for me. You reacted much better than I would have, I'd have tried to wedge the old hag into the burning bin along with the clothes. "
618,Yeah...there are some serious red flags in this short post. You're boyfriend is a massive asshole and you really shouldn't be in this relationship. 
619,"I’d say you’re both at fault:  his for removing the smoke alarm batteries, and yours for staying in a relationship with a blame shifting, control-freak asshat who has no empathy.  "
620,"But what about how they treat your partner?

My mom flipped when she found out I wasn't straight. Ordered me to break up with my partner. When I said no, she refused to speak to me for 9 months. I love my mom so much. She has done SO much for me and I really respect her. It was so painful going through this because we used to talk on the phone every other day. I'm her youngest daughter. She doted on me before this happened. She eventually contacted me to repair the relationship and apologized and she has worked hard to change, so I'm very lucky!


But the point of my post is...my partner is ""the one."" We have a house together and are going to get married and are building a life together. I have chosen them as my family. And how could I *ever* dare call myself their partner and family if I let my mom ignore them and put them down and pretend they weren't part of my life? How could they trust me, their family, to have their back if I take the easy way just so that I can be comfortable while they're excluded?

Love is Action. 

(and on a bright note, when the whole situation went down my dad proved he loved me no matter what. He was surprised, but he did some internet research and said ""okay."") "
621,"Sorry for being direct. 

But to be honest. You really didn't forgave him when he cheated on you. Which is reasonable because it isn't something small. That's a breakage of trust that you're still resenting him for.

Ask yourself. Why should you fight for this relationship? What's the worth? What makes him that great? And be honest to yourself."
622,"Thank you so much! 

Honestly I was really taken aback. We weren't close, but he was always very kind to me. Always buys me coffee. Maybe his wife was super offended so he felt the need to confront me?"
623,"You really should go to the police. This is a horrendous thing to do to somebody, and she might never figure it out unless you do something. It's not your responsibility to put yourself at risk to help her, but I couldn't let something like this continue to happen with doing something. Even if you left her an anonymous note that told her she needs to take out that charger because it's a hidden camera, it would be better than nothing. But I wouldn't try to take this into my own hands without involving the proper authorities, and mention that he threatened you if you ratted him out.

I mean, would you want someone to sweep it under the rug if it was you, or your mother, or your daughter, or anyone else?"
624,"Last year at this time, I finally got out of an abusive relationship and won a court case for a restraining order and a student conduct case with 11 charges against him and he got expelled from my school. He tried to kill me, slashed my tires, stalked me, and even blew up my car and posted my private pictures online. After working through PTSD, I found the most love I've ever received. He taught me how to love again. He's a few years older and a grad student in my program. He eases my anxiety and never makes me feel invalid for the trauma I feel. He's amazing. I'm only 21 but I know I want to marry him one day. We've changed each other for the better. Thank you D for mending my heart :) "
625,"Wow, I am astounded by the level of double standards here right now. If genders were reversed this sub's  posters would be shouting for charges to be filed, the sibling to be kicked out, and restraining orders to be obtained.

Op, your sister has a long history of drug abuse and violence. As it stands she really doesn't have any sort of future to ruin; she's ruining it just fine on her own. Protect yourself- right now you have visible injuries, proof that she assaulted you. Press charges before she assaults you again."
626,"Hoarding is a funny topic. When I first started having a little bit of money, I went on impulse spending sprees. At one point in time I owned a lucite bird cage I bought on a whim to justify buying bird beanie babies. I became a “shopaholic” and everything I bought had some perceived resale value or justification. I had my own issues with depression and mental health and that behavior was an extension of those issues plus the ability to buy what I wanted, for the first time ever. I turned those habits around and then my husband had a hard time getting me to indulge in gratiutious spending for myself but I’d save the money and no one considered that hoarding. It absolutely was.

What worked for me was reading a lot about financial planning and working with a financial planner. The topic became so interesting to me I went back to school for an accounting degree. One of my personal favorite topics is how people spend their money as they tend to be very open with their own mental pocketbook but appalled at the spending of others. Cars is always a great point in that discussion. 

If you’re inclined to keep seeing this woman, you should absolutely talk about finances and financial planning. Money is a huge point of conflict for many couples regardless of the class in which they were raised. If you can both come up with responsible spending plans and savings, you’ll be better off regardless of where the relationship goes. I’m not suggesting you join finances! In my experience, once we were funding our retirement and our emergency fund, I felt more at ease. I was then able to budget for discretionary spending including buying my “dream” car which I bought at the age of 39. Prior to that I owned the same car from 1993-2003, and my second car I owned from 2003-2013. With research into cars, picking a correct car for her needs, and a proper budget, she can make a responsible choice and not overspend. Check out /r/personalfinance for some perspectives (note, there are people across the spending/saving spectrum there.)

627,"What could he POSSIBLY say?  I mean, you weren't openly rude, you were nice, and you continued working. There's literally nothing for him to complain about.  All he can do is make himself look like a crazy person.

628,"I've also never heard of a cut off to book a hotel. My husband is active AF but he books when he wants and turns in receipts to finance. Or he uses his government travel card. This guy is lying.

630,"Just saying that you make 2 million dollars a year.  Your family is NOTHING like one that makes 40 thousand, debt or not.  I laughed aloud at that"
631,"Yeah that's a big no no. OP, your gf and you set up very obvious boundaries. It's very hypocritical of you to like a revealing photo of a girl, after you and your gf had a conversation about agreeing to not like and do things like that. So yeah she has the right to be upset at you! Do I think your lady friend did anything wrong? No, I don't honestly. In her relationship that might be okay and her bf might not care about that kind of thing, especially if she didn't send you the picture. In YOUR relationship however, YOU crossed a boundary with your gf. Of course she's going to be suspicious of you if you're liking a lady friends revealing photo after saying that liking revealing photos goes against your morality to her. "
632,"It probably took a lot of courage for him to open up, but he shuld've slammed the breaks the second you weren't into it. He keeps telling you details you arr not ready to hear and he puts expectations on you you didn't agree to. He should respect that.

As for 'is this marriage doomed': only if this is a dealbreaker for either of you. Can he live without indulging in his fetish? Are you willing to try it out for him? If either of you is going to resent or feel disgusted by the other, then don't get married."
633,"Address things directly, without passive aggressive comments about you losing your job. Use the same words with all family members so the message is not at all muddled:

“Family member x, I love Cousin and I love my family. Saying that, my company is absolutely crystal clear about procedures for interviewing and hiring family members and friends. I had no choice in recusing myself from Cousin’s interview. It would have been unethical for me to do anything else, and it would have put my career at risk. I hope you can hear this and understand the predicament I was put in.”

636,no. Stay out of it. She said she distanced herself. There is no good to come from this.
637,"The age bracket you've given is worrying. 17M I'm not sure, but if a 35M is telling you he loves you, the appropriate response is ""Fuck off you creep""."
638,That's not a partnership. That's a mother and son dynamic. No wonder marriage and children aren't a focal point. At some point he'll be so brow beaten over the topic of marriage that he'll just agree to it to shut her up.
639,What did she do for food before you came along?
640,"So you went on a date and then he went to work for two solid days.

Two days. Back to back. 

Yeah, I think that might have something to do with why he hasn't called. "
641,"Stop thinking about him, or how he feels, or what he might do.

Think about what *you* want out of your life, and out of your relationship. Is this it? Do you want a partner who regularly spends nights with cokeheads, who doesn’t care if you’re worried, who’s too hungover when he finally does crawl back home that you can’t even do nice things on the weekend?

The man he is now - is this who you want to be with in a year? Five years? Fifty years? Assume he’ll never change, or that these behaviors just get worse. Is this the man you dreamed of meeting when you were a little girl?

It’s clear that you care for him a lot, and he must have other good qualities that have kept you around this long. But the whole point of dating isn’t to find someone who’s lovable or decent - it’s to find one person you are truly compatible with, someone with whom you can build the life you’ve dreamed of. Is this guy that person?"

It definitely sounds like your boyfriend wasn't doing this maliciously and simply didn't realize how much you were spending, especially since you say he generally buys the cheaper stuff. I hope this is a good step for you toward advocating for yourself - I have also had to learn how to do that over the years and I know it's really difficult, but in the end you'll be so much happier putting your own oxygen mask on first.

Is she touchy with everyone, or just you? Is all of the jokes she makes to just you or everyone? 

One of my very good friends is a lesbian (I am a female) and she is touchy with ALL of her friends. She's just an affectionate person. She's actually listed as my fiance in my phone (Im married to a man). This is just stuff we do because we're friends and have inside jokes. Doesn't mean she's into me. 

So idk. Maybe she's into you, maybe she's not. But if you don't like her touching you, just say ""hey - I love that you're affectionate but I could personally do with less touching, it makes me uncomfortable"". Not everyone likes to be touched by other people. 

If the touching DOESNT bother you and it's just other people making comments that does - well eff em.

654,"This is some extremely American input I’m gonna offer, but unfortunately it’s true - independence isn’t asked for. It’s taken. If you wait for your family (or a husband) to *give* you your independence if only you ask nicely enough, you’ll be waiting your whole life. 

Do not use marriage with a guy you barely know as an escape from your controlling family. So many young women try it, and so many of them end up right back where they started - under someone else’s control, praying for another savior to whisk her away. If you want a different life for yourself, you’re the only one that can make that happen. "
655,While shes in there do you hear snoring? In the past few years ill take a bath and fall asleep for a little while. It doesnt happen every time but enough my family notices. Although if shes awake the whole time ask her whats she doing while in there. The anger about the me time being cut to have us time is a red flag to me but i hope you can fix issues.

You can make up an excuse for this one - ""Oh, my fiancee was really looking forward to spending time together that evening so in that case I'll have to decline, I don't want to leave him home alone"". 

As others have said, there is zero chance she will believe your friendship with Colin is OK if you go through with this."

Your fears are very irrational, this was years and years ago, in a month long relationship to a man she has likely long forgotten because it was so brief. You have been MARRIED-for years. Unless there is some horrible thing you've left out, your wife has clearly shown you were the man she meant to spent her life with, and you thinking so poorly of her is a enormous red flag."

No, he's aware of them. He just *likes* doing this."
664,"I'm going to give the third girl a pass here. If I invited a guy I was getting hot and heavy with to hang and he allowed it to become a group thing with his friends instead of sex, I'd say that's a pretty clear indication he's not really into me, and I'd move on. In fact, that's Op's problem- no matter what he says here about liking those girls, he's demonstrating to them that he really doesn't care for them at all."
665,"Agreed.  There is nothing wrong with not wanting children, but it sounds like he is too afraid of losing you to think things through properly (e.g. asking you to get serious before he was ready).  This makes me think that any decisions he is making to keep you could be based on that fear, and those decisions could prove unreliable in the long-term."

671,"Yup. Used to date a momma's boy. I used to be so frustrated, but after it was all over, I was just like, ""what the fuck, am I blind?"""
672,"&gt;I know part of the problem is me and my need for control during the week, but I also think that he is being incredibly selfish with his wants and needs and criticizes the traits that have gotten me where I am today when it doesn't fit his schedule. 

It's amazing to me that you are focused on your desire for control when it sounds like you have almost 0 control in your own home.  He has come in and taken over everything!  HE has total control.  You need to start pushing back on him.  

For starters, I think you need to back off to only spending Fri - Sun together so you can keep your Mon - Thur routine.  It's only be 8 weeks, this guy should not live at your house this early in the relationship.  Is he paying for the food and drinks he consumes or are you buying groceries in addition to being his maid and picking up after him?   

You should also implement a 50/50 split in who gets to pick your entertainment media.  If he gets 1 hr of his music then you get 1 hr of your TV show.  If he can't accept that then he can leave and go back to his place.  

It's easy to be ""carefree"" when you are always getting your way.  Your BF is the epitome of selfishness.  I think you've already gone way past the amount you should loosen up and be flexible.  It's time for your BF to show the same flexibility in meeting your needs.   If he refuses then see it for the red flag that it is and get out of this very young relationship."
673,"I don't see anything to be confused about. Short of sashaying around with pink boa, your husband has shown every indication that he is most definitely gay or bi but clearly not ready to come out of the closet yet. Short of you being totally okay with being his beard, it sounds like you need to confront him and break up. Whether he denies it or not, trust has been lost and you're clearly unhappy.

I would focus on the fact that you have clear evidence of him cheating/try to cheat on you repeatedly and lying about his sexuality.  Yes you have snooped but honestly, given his behaviour,  I wouldn't consider it immoral. He can get mad if he wants but he's the one who is up to all the shady behaviour. It's not ideal but anyone put in your position would have done the same. There's only so long someone can act sketchy/refuse to communicate before their partner has to take matters into their own hands. I'm surprised you haven't acted on your discoveries sooner. Just because you found out by snooping doesn't make his actions any less real. Sorry you're going through this, I'm sure there's plenty of support groups for women who have gone through the same thing. Time to move on."
674,"It sounds like that wouldn't really solve the issue, though, since beyond not being able to afford it, OP also says he can't take the time off of work right now and can't work from the venue. So realistically, she needs to go solo and not be constantly harassing OP over this."
675,"Yeah the only names I would get on my body are people I came out of, or people who came out of me lol"
676,"I think all these messages urging you to be understanding about his father's condition are ignoring a very important point:  it will not end with his father's passing.   You already feel that his relationship with his parents encroaches on your marriage.  The inevitable increase in daily contact with your father-in-law will also create an elevated expectation on his mother's part....which will be further enabled during the grieving.   

You need to get ahead of this right now.  Tell your husband how you feel and suggest that you go to counseling...which will probably extend through the grieving cycle."
677,Didn't even notice that. Now it makes sense why she would stay with someone with such a selfish and rotten character. She’s not that much different.
678,"I have tried confronting him. He denies it and gets allll upset that I would ever accuse him. Deep down in my heart, this is what i believe almost 100%. I think he is too afraid of hurting me to tell me. He is very loyal. Like won't even leave a job he hates. So I would not be surprised. The thing is, him behaving this way is hurting me way more than if he were just to leave. I would rather be set free. "

I guess it's a good thing his behavior hasn't escalated, but still, let her know what's going on and let her contact the police if she wants. You don't need your boyfriend's permission and you don't need to wait for him to take action. You don't have to be passive about this."
682,"I agree!! You have to look at the person as a whole. If she's getting mad that you've not proposed yet, is she gonna be mad when you can't buy her the handbag she wants? Or the expensive vacation for your anniversary? Think about it; is your proposal gonna feel special now? Or is it gonna feel pressured? Is she gonna say ""Jesus, finally, took you long enough, etc"" or is she going to be your partner for life and understand financial concerns you have? Just think before you do! "
683,"Honestly, this is me. I'm in a long distance situation as well, and if I text him and ask what he's doing and he says he's with friends/family I just tell him to have fun. I might send him a meme or something if I find one I think he'd like, but I don't specifically try to engage in a conversation with him.

Look at it this way. My quality time with him on a regular basis consists of us talking on the phone. I'd feel bad if he was texting other people the whole time instead of being present and involved in our conversation. This doesn't mean he can't check his texts if we're talking or reply to one quick, but if he's holding 2 conversations it becomes disrespectful.

In my opinion, you've found someone with a good head on her shoulders!  "
684,"I can't tell whether you guys are just awful under pressure or not - seems like you've both always been under pressure. And that's okay because there's always some new pressure in life - except neither of you seem to handle the pressure well.

I think she's either angry too much or has a very direct manner of communicating that you perceive as angry all the time. I think you're passive and unreliable in a very typical browbeaten way.

She needs to let go of things being exactly as she envisioned and be better at expressing her expectations calmly.

You haven't even mentioned redeeming qualities.

Premarital counseling needs to happen before the wedding - and soon so you can decide whether to stay in this relationship or discontinue it."
685,"You went to college as a single mother and succeeded raising them well.  Until the arrival of that package, they had never known anything but your unquestioned love.  That (and family counseling) will get all three of you through this.

688,"&gt;This whole problem could be solved with - "" Hey, I don't really like engaging with you on these topics as I'm just not comfortable with our exchanges. That's all I'm going to say on the matter, please don't press any further."" And if he keeps trying, shut him down.

689,"You know how when you’re pregnant you can’t clean kitty litter? If you didn’t know then yes indeed, you’re not allowed to clean the litter.

I have two cats, 13 and 14 years old respectively, and the first time I was pregnant my partner outright didn’t believe me when I asked him to take over that chore for me. He doesn’t mind cats but he hates cleaning the litter, it physically repulses him, but you know what happened? He came with me to my midwife, she confirmed that no, I cannot clean the litter, and he just freaking did it after that.

A few years later I got pregnant again, cats still here. He didn’t even say anything about it this time, he just started begrudgungly doing it, and you know why? Because I was growing a person inside my body that was more important than his aversion to cat shit. Not only just a random person, HIS child. He cared about my well being during pregnancy because it directly affetc the baby."
690,"It sound like you're asking permission to break up with her. You can do that for any reason whatsoever. If it's not working for you then you should. I'm 47 years old, sending my oldest off to college in 2 weeks. Life is short. Honestly, it goes by so fast. Older people say this a lot because it's true. It's like I blinked and 20 years went by. Don't waste time on people or things that make you unhappy. Sunk cost fallacy. Don't waste more time because of the time already invested."
691,"I think you could approach this a lot more gently than some other folks are suggesting. 

You can wait until you're one-on-one, and then say something like ""Kayla, when you say these things, I can't tell if you're just having fun or if you think it's real. I want you to know that I care about you and find you cool and interesting without you having to tell these stories."" And if she doubles down, then be worried and talk to her parents. 

She may just be doing this because she feels like she needs to be more interesting, or cool somehow - helping her realize that she's cool and interesting without lying to everyone might help her break this habit. 

Also, I like the person who suggested telling her to start a blog, or just writing these things down into stories! If she admits/acknowledges it's all made up, you can tell her that her creativity is really cool, so what if she started writing these stories down instead of pretending they're real? Maybe you'll help her find a new hobby. "
692,"This sounds like the most reasonable thing to me. You two have to meet in the middle somewhere...if hes super clean and you're super messy, you can't just stay super messy and get mad that it upsets him...or vice versa. Meet in the middle somewhere and start a list of expectations between the two of you. Preferrably with a referee present. "
693,"I don’t think that’s fair lol Op was talking seriously about it with her all this time. It’s not like she sprung it on him suddenly. If they’ve talked extensively as he says why is it just occurring to him now that she was serious? I agree he’s not ready, and can see where he’s coming from, but they BOTH decided to be together and both talked about starting a family/buying a house. "
694,"Right. The problem is mainly that she hasn't been here for a month. We're both college students and she's home for the summer, but I work at the university so it makes sense for me to live here while she's gone. So we havent had face to face contact since she gave me the key. I am planning on confronting her but text would definitely not be taken well. I am fine with the utilities and keeping costs low. Not so fine with having to notify her if I want to get some Chinese takeout. "

701,"Honestly this relationship doesn’t sound healthy for either one of you. And to be frank, you sound like you have unhealthy, unrealistic expectations both of her and of what a relationship should be. 

You thought she could finish a master’s in a year part-time? If you had reservations about her contributions during the master’s degree you should have talked it through thoroughly beforehand, instead of bringing up in arguments how she went to school full time for two years (which for the record is normal). And you seem to be fine letting her carry all the emotional labor of the relationship, which of course is going to stress her out and cause frustrations. You can’t remember to “help” cook or clean up, she was responsible for making sure you started driving in time, and you thought it was totally reasonable that she took care of the logistics of your hiking trip while you went and fucked around with a toy on her birthday.

You both need to communicate your needs better, and if you really want to be with her you need to be a lot more intentional about how you treat the relationship. That said, I do think you should postpone the wedding and focus more on how you treat each other (or cut your losses and learn for the next one)."

727,"Okay, but what would checking in do? Give him an opportunity to say ""no, don't use that money you saved up for your parents meant to be used for your parents""? Because that would be the only purpose of ""checking in"". Yeah, let him know ahead of time for courtesy maybe, but it wouldn't have changed the end result. Unless boyfriend wanted her to use the money on something he could use, which is, again, not the point of her ""mom and dad"" fund.

I get where people are coming from, saying it would have been common decency to let him know ahead of time, but the money would have still gone to a new truck regardless. He would have no place to try and change her mind (which is what it would come to if she told him ahead of time - saying she ""owes him a call in advance"" just implies that it's his money and his decision to make)  *because it is her money that she had put away specifically for a situation like this.* "

Not exactly the same thing, but close.

When my ex-wife and I were married, she lost her father due to alcoholism. No car accident or anything, he passed away of organ failure at 53 in the hospital.

She was always a 'daddy's girl' and took it so hard.

Even though her dad and mom divorced years ago, I called her mom (and we weren't close) and I asked her if she had any old pictures of him.

She looked for awhile, and found one of him holding my wife on his knee when she was like 2.

I took the photo, made some copies just in case, and took it to a place called ""Things Remembered"". They are a store that does engravings.

I picked out a frame, that had a cross on one side (kind of like a gravestone) and a place for the photo.

On the top  I had his name engraved, with birth and death dates.

Above the photo I had engraved ""Dedicated to Douglas""

Under it I had engraved ""Devoted Father, Protector, Provider, And A Good Man""

I gave it to her on Christmas Eve (We always opened one present a day early)

I warned her, as she held the wrapped present, that she might not like it. She laughed, but I told her, looking her in the eye, seriously, she might hate it. Confused, she opened the gift.

And started the most hysterical crying fit I've ever seen in her. 

She held the photo, crying, rocking back and forth on the couch. I just watched. It was only a couple minutes, but she calmed down.

She thanked me for it, but said she couldn't bear to see it yet. She asked if I would put it somewhere safe (her father had only died a few months earlier). It took about six months for her to ask me to get it out. And she still has it all these years later. 

Your wife, well, I can't say she will love it, but she will almost certainly love the gesture.

I know a father and an husband are different. But he's never been your 'competition'. Your lives never overlapped.

You are giving her a memento of someone she loved, and lost.

748,"OP, you’re a great brother. I can feel the love and care you have for your sister through the words of this post.

Please make sure that you’re taking care of yourself throughout this process — for some people that means attending Al-Anon/other support groups, therapy, journaling, meditating, working out, continuing performing and directing, leaning on your friends/boyfriend, whatever works for *you*. You and your sister have survived a considerable amount of hardship in life, so I think you already know the importance of maintaining some semblance of inner strength in order to be strong for someone else (“secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others”).

I’ve watched a sibling struggle with addiction and relapse from the time he was 13 to the young adult he is now. I know, from his own words after the fact, that something as simple as sorting through her clothes means much more to your sister than you may think. 

What she wrote, though understandingly heart-wrenching for you to read, is true — she *is* ill. Addiction is a lonely illness, and human connection is the **necessary foundation** for recovery. (For a less flowery explanation, look up the Rat Park addiction study). All of that is to say — you’re doing everything right. Deliver those clothes, call or visit her if you feel like you’re emotionally equipped to do so. If not, something as simple as a handwritten “thinking of you” note/card is something that would help anchor her and make her feel loved. She’s lucky to have a sibling like you."
749,"...what?

How did he hit on her?? And how are these personal questions?

There's literally *nothing* wrong with these conversations"
750,"Separate your finances, accounts and credit cards now!

Contact a lawyer.

She gets to move out, not you. She sleeps on the couch, not you. 

Rally your friends and family around you. You are going to be hurting, no need to be alone while it is happening.

Aerobic exercise is great at chasing away the blues, but avoid alcohol, it makes things worse. 

"
751,"asking the real, pressing questions "
752,"I think you should hug her, tell her that she can count on you and that you love her. One day you can decide to do something together with your mom: go somewhere with her, or if you have something in common, doing it together (it can be a movie, going and eat something together or an activity).

We should all care more about our parents, because when they will not be with us anymore, we will realize how stupid we were not spending enough time with them and wse..

I'm sorry for your family's situation, but i think you can solve the problem. :) "
753,"This.

A lot of people believe in reincarnation and have for a long time.

If other stuff is obviously out of whack, then worry.

Indulging fantasies also has a long history.

"
754,"&gt;And then you'll have kids. And she will start to groom them and abuse them too.

Yup. Seen that happen in justnomil a few times. MILs groom their sons, and then when the OPs try to tell them, the husbands are in deep denial about it. They mentally blocked out the worst of it. In some cases, the MILs start their grooming with the next generation. Don't think it'll just stop with your husband's generation, OP. It's going to keep happening, and it'll happen to your child (if you have any) next."
755,"Sorry for your loss. I lost my first love in my early 20s. It took 4 years to fully recover. It takes time to heal and you really will never get over her. She will be in your heart forever. Yes be more social and therapy will help you. Don’t try to date while grieving, because that won’t be fair for the other person. "
756,"I'm wondering if your wife may have deeply internalized the ""failing as a mom"" idea and now it's just an absolute truth in her mind: ""if someone else looks after my child for even a short time, I'm failing as a mom."" End of story.

That sort of rigid thinking is incredibly difficult to dig your way out of on your own. Is therapy an options for you guys? I think you would benefit from that, to evaluate how things are going in your marriage and seeing how things can be re-adjusted, especially as baby gets older and their needs change.

If you want to try tackling this on your own with her, I can tell you what has helped me in the past, when I've been stuck in ""rigid thinking ruts."" My loved ones and I will usually have a conversation about whatever difficulty I'm having, and often they will take the situation and turn it around and it helps me explore my feelings on it in an objective way.

When you are calm, well-rested, etc.--not during an argument or anything like that, because the point here is to find information and not vent your frustrations, try asking your wife: ""Listen, if our roles were reversed, would you feel it would be wrong if I wanted to have someone babysit our child for a few hours each week? Would I be failing as a father if I did that?""

If she thinks it would be wrong, then you two have different parenting standards and you need to find a way, perhaps with a therapist, to meet in the middle so everyone is happy. If she doesn't think it would be wrong if you hired a sitter, then she has some things going on internally--holding herself to a higher standard than she is basically admitting is fair, and she needs to work on relaxing those standards so she feels comfortable and rested enough that she doesn't need so much time to restore herself, and hopefully some of that energy can be redirected toward your marriage."
757,"A bottle over the course of 1-2 weeks, depending on the size, is like 1 or 2 drinks a night. Doesn't exactly sound like a problem drinker in my book. I agree with you that insinuating that she's an alcoholic based on that is going to driver her farther away and make her defensive. 

It takes me probably about 2 weeks to go through a litre of brandy. I have on average 1 drink a night with dinner. Sometimes I have 2, sometimes I have none. My boyfriend is the same, as are most of my adult friends. None of us are alcoholics."
758,"The more I think about it, the more sad I become. I love this man to pieces, I really hope he can get some professional help. His mother has been touching him this way for potentially 30 years, I cant imagine what it will be like to hear that this isn't normal. That other kids didnt have a mom touch them this way.
...which is why I will be discussing this with my own counselor before talking to him. I would hope someone would do this for me if it were reversed so I wouldn't have another 30 years of bad touches. But hot damn, WHY ME?! I should train Biscuit, his childhood cat, to talk. "
759,Are you joking? If you stay over too you get the couch? They are definitely hooking up. This is beyond inappropriate. 
760,"For Erica's sake, I hope Jennifer is able to bond as she gets a bit older. I suspect the babyhood stage is the worst for people who aren't very maternal.

Try not to think too badly of Jennifer, who sounds like she's doing the best she can for her daughter - the pressure to have children and the comforting lies people so casually tell about how everything will be fine and you'll definitely fall in love with your baby when it's born are powerful forces. "
761,"It's obvious she's no longer interested, break it off now and find someone who will be interested in you."
762,I would straight up just say something like “you’re at the shore? I wish you told me you were going down! I would’ve loved to see you guys”
763,"I am not a creative person at all. Devin is a borderline hoarder. Her house has three bedrooms and the third bedroom is full of dressers and shelves of random junk she picks up at Goodwill, or yard sales. I never even go in that room. It's so full of stuff it gives me claustrophobia."
764,"oh my gosh, that plopped a rock into my stomach "
765,"&gt; The big problem here isn't that your BF was wrong about these things, it's that he doesn't care that you're miserable.

I'd say we don't even know if this is true.  OP talks about breaking the lease like it's no bod deal...maybe BF doesn't see it that way.  He may want to stay and finish the lease to avoid the often very steep penalties for breaking a lease early...it's not necessarily because he doesn't care about OP.  My wife and I have lived in one or two apartments that sucked but it was just so expensive to break the lease we stuck it out and moved when the lease is up."
766,"My dear as someone who is trying to rebuild her own financial life from the ashes it burned down to - When was the last time you pulled your credit report? 

You need to do financial homework, immediately. Pull all your credit reports (it's free annually), get copies of his too. And recognize divorce may have to be an option on the table to save yourself."
767,"&gt;He's having a lump removed from his side

While they're in there maybe they can remove his mom from his ass.

OP, leave. There's nothing for you except whatever scraps his mom deigns to leave for you."
768,"Not a lawyer but I'd imagine he would have a hard time chasing after alimony if she can prove how much he spent on his collection. The 10k cat with the inheritance 
 would make it laughable"
769,"If he has a large enough inheritance to buy 10k cat figurines why didn’t he just use that towards paying off loans? 
Honestly none of this is making sense "
770,"&gt;I know it was really out of character that he did this.

You've only been together 6 months. You're only just now beginning to know what his actual character is. And this is what you learn of it."
771,"That quotation is brilliant. It stopped me in my tracks.
The rest of what you said too!"
772,"Is she paying for herself and wants you to come with her or is she wanting you to pay for the whole thing?

You're argument against going is very reasonable. I understand her being upset because it's her brothers wedding BUT if you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Simple as that. 

She doesnt care about your debt and isn't respecting you when you have have come to a reasonable decision; she's only concerned about her wants. I can only imagine the hell you'd go through planning your own wedding."
773,"Ok. Tough love.

You are letting your boyfriend’s life decisions dictate your life. Of course you feel powerless. You have given him all the power - power to propose, how much notice you give your job, where you are going to live - EVERYTHING. So yes, be uncomfortable with the fact that him stalling is putting your entire life on hold. Be uncomfortable with the fact that he holds all the power and doesn’t seem to give a shit about what you need. Be uncomfortable that the things you have asked for don’t seem all that urgent to him. And ask yourself what it will take for you to feel comfortable. In your shoes? I would be refusing to even consider resigning a job and moving anywhere at this point. You need to be maintaining control over your life decisions for a while. "
774,"He being sulky &amp; you being worried about hurting her feelings is exactly what enables her to continue mooching off of you both. If she can shift the discussion from what a bad houseguest she’s being back onto how hurtful you’re being &amp; how sad that makes her, then she doesn’t have to change a thing, &amp; you’re left trying to “make things right.” "
775,"i would write the girl a note and slip it under her door/put it in the mailbox. say “hey, just wanted to let you know that a man regularly stops by your house, looks through the window, and then leaves. we know this because he drives a very loud bike that catches our attention every time. we don’t know if you are aware of this or not, but from our perspective it seemed like a reason to be concerned. we apologize if you feel like we’re intruding on your privacy but this is a very quiet neighborhood and it was hard not to notice. if you’d like to speak to us we’re ___ and ___ over at house number ___. hope everything is okay!” or something along those lines. leaving the note anonymous might make her paranoid about all the neighbors and feel embarrassed. it would be better for her to know she has people looking out for her. "
776,"This chick is 30? Um... not even sure what to say about this, except I wouldn't be hanging out with Daphne anymore. Sounds like she needs to grow up, a lot. "
777,"As someone who has been working on tiling a floor for 4 weeks, I am horrified. In my case it started out with uncovering more problems (rotten subfloor, leaking exterior door), causing more problems (wait, I was supposed to do what before this step?), and also trying to work full time while living in squalor. It just got away from me. So you know what? I have a contractor coming Monday to tile that sucker. How are you living with no floors for SIX YEARS?
Step 0) Lock down your birth control, under no circumstances should you bring a second baby into this toxic mix. 
Step 1) Hire a contractor. Tell your husband you are sorry it hurts his feelings, but it has gotten out of control. You are taking back control of the FLOORS OF YOUR HOME. In fact, don't tell him until after you have hired said contractor. (Gah)
Step 2) Get some therapy. Couples therapy in which you discuss his depression, but maybe more importantly therapy for you in which you try to figure out why you feel like it's ok to be treated like crap and live without floors for SIX YEARS. He might be sick. It sounds like he is. Still doesn't mean you deserve this."
778,"&gt; The trope that all young people are callous or stupid and emotionally stunted is just an excuse for people not to learn how to behave.

It really depends on what kind of experiences people have had at that age. This isn't about ""all young people are stupid"". It's ""Your friend might not know what to do or how to talk to you about this because she doesn't have experience with this.""

Growing up as the youngest of my parents who were the youngest of their parents (who had a stupid amount of kids because Catholicism), I had a looooottttt of death going on in my family. I lost 12 people before I turned 18. 

Most of my friends, however, had never had to really deal with death at that point. And so if it came up they didn't really know what to say beyond ""I'm sorry"" and then changing the subject. They didn't want to upset me by asking questions/discussing it, they didn't know how to really console someone who lost someone, so they just tried to avoid the topic. I think it's pretty normal if you haven't experienced a great loss that you don't really know how to approach it with someone else. 


ETA: And even as someone who has dealt with a metric fuck ton of death, half the time I don't know how to help a friend going through it. Grief is weird. Some of my friends don't want to talk about it at all because they want distraction. Others want to talk and cry and just throw it all on the table. A few more just want some kind of acknowledgement that things are shitty but also want to go about life as usual. The best thing I've found is saying ""What can I do to help?/What do you need right now?"" But sometimes that doesn't work either because people don't know *what* they want or need, they just feel kinda lost. "
779,"My best friend's father died a few years ago, and I can tell you it's REALLY hard to know what the right thing to do is. Do I bring it up? If I do, am I making her more sad because I'm reminding her of it? Or should I talk about other things to distract her from the pain? 

I think your friend probably just doesn't know what you want/need from her right now. I would send her a message or (if you can) talk in person that you want her to ask more often about how you're doing, or ask you about your dad, or encourage you to tell stories, etc... See if her behavior changes, she is probably just super uncomfortable with the topic and doesn't want to bring it up for fear of upsetting you."
780,"What’s the tattoo? If it’s a small symbol, well eh maybe she’s overreacting. If it’s a huge picture of your ex’s face, that’s creepy and I’d walk away too. "
781,"It says fine to split everything 50:50, but that means the budget has to be tailored to the person with the lower income. If he wants to upgrade from that, the excess is 100% on him. "
782,"My wife suffered terrible social anxiety and panic attacks and was home a lot and our elderly female neighbor did the same and meant well, but eventually after explaining many times the situation we really were forced to become abrupt with her. It was a shame but she wouldn’t listen"
783,"Yeah, better then nothing isn't really a great reason to date someone. "
784,"Yep, if you must compare, compare with your past self, not with others."
785,"I'd be more concerned about the 13k impulse buy necklace than the ""tourist tax"" in Indonesia. 

But this:

&gt; All my clothes are hand me downs, and I’m always looking for ways to cut costs. I literally wear clothes I’ve found in dumpsters or hanging off trees I’ve found while hiking.

isn't normal for people who seem to be pretty comfortable financially, and you might need to talk to a financial planner and a counsellor to work on your issues around money."
786,I think OP struggles with healthy boundaries.
787,"No, the headcount thing and having extra doesn't make sense. If caterers have to order extra, then yes, that's a problem, it does increase cost, and the bride and groom will be charged. However, being a guest short does not increase costs. It's annoying to the bride and groom bc they could have cut their costs, but they don't get charged extra on top of what they already paid if a guest doesn't show.
"
788,"He was cheating on his girlfriend, not the OP"
789,"If you are really genuine about wanting to learn her language, be more aggressive with your plan to learn her language (take classes, read books) and you'll start to apprectliate their conversations more. Instead of getting annoyed take it as an opportunity to pick out common words you learned in their lessons. Try to speak to them with the words you learned even if it's only to point at an object and say it's name, so they can correct you.

You're letting a valuable learning resource slip through your fingers!"
790,"Yeah, if your boyfriend thinks it's okay abandon you with no money, phone or id in the middle of the night in a major city he's trash and should be discarded as such.

But it's also an important lesson you need to learn, particularly in your early 20s - always take responsibility for yourself, even when with a group of friends. Have your own money, phone and address of where you're staying in your possession. Friends are great but sometimes shit happens, and you need to be prepared in order to protect your own safety. 

When everyones getting wasted together there are a million scenarios where you can end up separated. It's the difference between a mild inconvenience and a full on disaster. I went through a couple of really dodgy situations at that age before I figured it out."
791,"I mean, if they kick him out that will damage his relationship with them. The goal of r/relationships is usually (at least putatively) to avoid burning bridges with people unless you have to. It's better for him to move out before it gets to that point. Otherwise, their house their rules is the way to go to preserve the relationship itself."
792,"I think you’re completely right with the stalker comparison.  I know advice-giving over the internet is easy, because its not my life I’m telling you to blow up, but I think OP should take a hard look at his relationship.  If you assume she’s never going to change, OP (because every time you try to get her to listen, she shuts you down), then how long are you willing to eat inedible, gag-worthy food?  A year?  Five years?  The rest of your life?  How long would you tell your brother to stay with a person like that?  Your son?"
793,I question why he thinks he’s going to need to repeat the same story to the same group of people. There are only a few stories I’ve repeated to the same group of people and it’s not like people expect the story to match word for word. Hell half the time I repeat a story is because someone has forgot part of it and asked me to repeat it to refresh their memory. 
794,"I'll admit that the times she cried were because i went about the issue the wrong way and maybe was too pushy or aggressive. She will let me cook If I ask nicely but I can tell that when she does, she'll quietly, reluctantly agree. If I change my mind and let her cook instead she'll get the biggest smile on her face and give me a HUGE hug and kiss. These are the kinds of things that break my heart to think about."
795,"If I saw this post I would not think it was a real invitation and I would not think I was invited. You should be personally inviting each and every person so it’s clear they’re the ones you want to be there. Posting a general “Any friends want to get brunch to celebrate” is not a real invitation. I would never respond to one if I saw that and I would never show up to an event like that, especially if it’s just a classmate I barely know. 

I have a very large social circle and I am constantly throwing events and attending events multiple times a week and I don’t even have any social media. Your way of holding events is not conducive to a large turn out or any turn out. I saw another comment here saying “inviting everyone is inviting nobody” and it’s so accurate. "
796,"He’s a grad student not a professor. I’m really not sure why everyone is acting like op’s boss isn’t just a student dating another student. 

Acting like this dude is some evil douchebag isn’t helping OP. "
797,"Why are you still with him?

Are you waiting for strike 3?

The only reason he went to another girls apartment without telling you is....sex - there I said it."
798,"You said she never had the money to go to cooking school, and I noticed you also mentioned you two are well off now. 

  Not that it's going to solve the problem... (because I personally think the real problem is the way she reacts to constructive criticism ) 

  ...But is it in your budget options to plan for her going to culinary school in the future. There are many different options, community college, private colleges, state schools, technical schools, online programs etc. "
799,"That would make me gag, who puts steak with rice pudding or oatmeal and raisins? How are you choking this down? I wondering if this is a ""How to lose a guy in ten days"" movie, it sounds so strange it could be. 

You could develop allergies? Or become a smoker, that kills your taste buds pretty good.

Or just tell her, that'd probably be simpler, please do an update for us! Good luck lol"
800,"I think people are more prone to attack in this situation because the change OP has gone through is objectively good for her health. If the change was bad for her health, like putting on a lot of weight or becoming malnourished-skinny, I think people would be more sympathetic with not liking the changes. "
801,"Cmon, this dude is a piece of work. He also claims he doesn’t have a good relationship with his daughter because of her puberty issues. 

I do agree they should get divorced, but he sucks just as hard. "
802,"How dare your wife say you need to make things right.  Your MIL needs to make things right with your son.

My son dressed as a princess until he was around 7 and he is a perfectly healthy 12yo now.

803,"&gt;I do most of my tasks. It's just that I feel too tired to make pasta from scratch like I used to, or scrub the bathroom AND kitchen in one day

Doesn't feel up for making pasta from scratch after a newborn? Sometimes makes a grilled cheese when it's been a hard day? The horror! She's not lazy, she's a reasonably exhausted new parent who is butting heads against someone 10+ years her senior who somehow feels that adding a newborn baby into the mix should not change a single thing about her routine and is not difficult whatsoever. Although he won't let her leave the baby with him overnight or for the day because he 'wouldn't be able to take care' of the baby by himself--even though *she's* not allowed to say taking care of the baby is difficult. Edit: to add, OP's husband says he can't watch the baby by himself for an extended period because babies need ""a woman's touch."" Yeah...

Stay at home parents are not servants or maids just because they're not bringing in money. They are partners. The husband here has unrealistic expectations. "
804,"&gt; she needs our car to do her errands. 

Errands, huh? Is that what she's calling her oh-so-busy life of manicures, spa dates, and fancy lunches? 

Open up a savings account for the house. You've decided what luxuries you are willing to cut, so put the extra money in that account. Tell your wife to choose what luxuries she's willing to skip, and put her portion in as well. Once she sees how slowly the amount is growing, she might realise that she needs to make sacrifices somewhere. Or, maybe not. 

&gt; My wife isn't a golddigger 

No, but she absolutely thinks that money is your responsibility, and it's up to you to figure out how to make her dreams come true. Not up to her to help you out."
805,"He's acting very entitled. It's your money and you have zero obligation to pay for anything. If he didn't plan financially and reserve a hotel in time, that's on him to take care of and not on you. You're right that his behavior is manipulative.   Don't let him get away with acting like this and stand up for yourself. "

807,"You’ve been together three years and you own a house together. I can see parents not wanting to meet a new SO because they want holidays to be just for the family, but Sam *is* family. 

You’re 24 so just starting out as an adult and I think still thinking of your parents as the core of your family. But you’re starting a new family where the core needs to be your relationship with Sam. Your parents refusing to treat Sam as part of your family is an insult to her and infantilizing to you. 

I would tell them that she is your partner, and that if she is not welcome in their home you will consider yourself not welcome as well. This may mean making alternative holiday arrangements with your siblings. 

Based on your past relationship with your parents I think they will get on board eventually, but if you don’t put your foot down they will keep excluding Sam indefinitely. They’re doing it right now because you’re letting them get away with it. "

811,"You miss life as a single person...when you were 16? You don't even know what it's like to be a single adult. If that interests you, sit down and have a conversation with your boyfriend NOW, before he proposes. "
812,"&gt;I have felt some guilt over in the past due to feeling like she was suppressing a part of herself for my sake.

This is dumb, and has nothing to do with sexual orientation. Being in a monogamous relationship requires that one ignore impulses and urges to engage in romantic/sexual contact with *anyone* outside the relationship, regardless of gender. Your wife hasn't had to give up anything that a heterosexual or gay person in a monogamous relationship hasn't had to give up. "
813,"You may think she wants to know to this extent but you could be doing more harm than good. You sending her all these screenshots and “proof” is more for your peace of mind than hers. One message should’ve been enough. If she doesn’t want to respond then that’s her choice, but you already did your part. It’s best to leave her alone and deal with your own feelings of betrayal. "
814,"&gt; you can't really just break up with me for no reason

yeah, he can.

&gt; he tried leaving anyway so I grabbed his arm

don't do that. If somebody wants toleave, you let them. This was just worng.

&gt; she started twisting my wrist around like to the point where I almost started crying and slapped me.

this was also fucked up, but you were the one escalating to phisical contact with your ex in the first place. Doesnt make it right of course.

&gt;  I'm terrified of physical confrontation

well apparently only when you are not the one initiating said physical confrontation (aka assault)

&gt; . What can I do to be able to talk about everything with him

he doesnt want to, leave him alone. Move on with your life. If somebody threats you or assault you call the police."
815,"I've heard that ""I just like everything on IG"" excuse before. You described it as sexy dude. "

819,"They’re not upset with him for trying to cheat on you. They’re upset with him for sexually harassing all the women who were supposed to be his *friends* (while trying to cheat on you).

You can forgive him for cheating, buddy, that’s your funeral. (Next time it will be whatsapp, or tinder, or texts, or another app - there are loads of ways to contact people these days, I wouldn’t assume because you’ve seen one you’ve seen them all. Nor would I assume that you’re the first partner he’s done this to - or the last.) 

You can’t make friends forgive a harasser, nor should you try. Why do you think they would ever be comfortable around him again? If they’re “friends” of yours, why do you want to put them in that position and force them to hang out with someone who doesn’t respect them and sleazes all over them when you’re not around to stop it?"
820,Don't avoid right decisions because they're hard decisions. 
821,"I'm gonna be really honest; in my experience over the last 10 years of my relationship, usually when this kind of stuff is getting to me it's because of the way I'm thinking about my SO, not because of anything he's doing. Consider this: would you really want him to do things exactly the same way you do? Would you really be happier if the kitchen was quieter? Or would it just feel like there is more of you and less of him? Picking at your SO for these little things is a dangerous game because if he loves you, he might try to change and become less of what he was before. You might find one day that you miss those little things that used to annoy you.

If you do decide that the little things are a problem, you can always ask him to do them differently. Maybe he can start cleaning up the water off the walls when he's done in the bathroom.

I do think, regardless of how you proceed with solving these problems, that part of any successful relationship is finding things to like about each other even when it's difficult. Are there still things you like about him? Maybe he ties his shoes in a cute way, or makes the best pancakes ever. It's the little things, you know? Appreciation has a way of neutralizing frustration and reminding you why you're with somebody. Hope that helps!"
822,"&gt;Had she stayed things would have been different.

I've never been in this situation or had anyone close to me, so I'm curious: what *does* happen if you hit a pedestrian and you stay?

I guess a lot of it depends on the circumstances, right? Were you speeding? Was the street lit? Was the pedestrian using a crosswalk. Were you drinking? etc etc. 

But like, are you fucked if you ever hit someone?"
823,"I see what you're saying, but rereading it and looking at his other comments, I think they can have that conversation, he just wants to make sure he doesn't come off as taking a step back from their relationship. I can be rather crass when it comes to stuff like this so I tend to hurt my partners feelings completly unintentionally because of how I say things. I think he's just being cautious, which is reasonable."
824,"Honestly? I agree. I was a grad TA from 23-25, and 19yos are children. They act and think like kids who can do things legally. There would be no way in hell I would have dated one. "
825,"I dunno, missing out on decades of your daughter’s life might wear on a guy and make him change. I’m not saying to trust him immediately, I’m just saying it’s not impossible that the loss of his kids and grandkids may have broken him down. 

The only way to know is incredibly limited contact to test the waters. I hope Dad has changed but I won’t be shocked if he didn’t."
826,Yeah it’s a total non-issue. My mom goes by my dads last name in public/social life but she still works under her professional original name. It’s never caused a single issue even on paperwork.

828,"More adventurous? Ok, try any of a hundred kinks. Bondage, public, s&amp;m, sensory deprivation, roleplay of any configuration, primal/pray, etc.  Have her guide you, step by step, for things she wants.

Just because you dont know what do right now, doesnt mean you never could..."
829,"This isn’t the sort of thing someone gets past. He creeped on a 15 year old girl. His wife’s sister no less. When you’re older, I think you’ll realize more fully how disgusting he is. 

He’s a terrible dude and will likely cause other problems in their marriage. It’s up to you what you want to do - your sister could very well shoot the messenger. But know for sure that men who hit on their wives deeply underage sisters never become good men. "
830,"He IS abusive. None of this is your fault, but you need to leave."
831,"Stop paying for his shit, and especially don't pay the bill when it's because of his irresponsibility. Frankly, he's using you and you're a fool if you stay in this sad excuse for a relationship any longer. "
832,"You know what would've helped? Initiating it. Asking him how he felt. Asking him what he needed. Finding out why he seemed so switched off. Understanding that you shutting him down over and over again and ultimately telling him that him wanting to have sex with you was ruining your day was pretty goddamn hurtful and that you had some work to do rebuilding intimacy in your marriage after you so thoroughly destroyed it. 

You know, simple things like taking some goddamn responsibility for the health of your sex life and actually giving a fuck about what your husband is dealing with. "
833,I like that idea a lot. Would make things much easier.
834,Exactly. Guess why the apartment was empty for you to move into. Guess. I dare ya.
835,"In addition to all the other points being made, stealing/altering your ADHD meds during finals right before graduation could completely derail you academically. That's lost money, time, academic/career opportunities, etc. It's way more than an inconvenience and breach of trust. This could have had severe, life altering consequences.

One more thing, if he gets busted selling your meds, then you could also be charged and no longer be able to get them prescribed for yourself if you haven't filed a police report."
836,"I really hope the judge saw exactly what was going on with him. What a fucking creep. 

I think you should see a therapist to work on techniques for reassuring yourself in the face of...his face. And enjoy sending his ass to jail."
837,Don’t be that girl. Come on
838,"Make sure to keep detailed notes of all your interactions with him. 

Unfortunately, as long as he's not openly hostile, he can make things harder for you, especially given the fact that he's been there for a while with (I would assume) good record of behavior. 

Try to stay away from him as much as possible, and limit the amount of time yoiu speak to him. "
839,"Talk to her about this:

&gt;There have been a couple times where she’s mad me pretty uncomfortable (then and now) and I’ve just tried to gloss over it. 

If she is truly your best friend, and has your best interests at heart, she will hear you and make adjustments. It would also force the issue if she *did* have feelings, so you guys can talk that out and shut it down if need be. Whatever you do, don't gloss over something that makes you uncomfortable, because then it doesn't ever change.

&gt;I genuinely don’t want this to be the case because I don’t want anything to jeopardize our friendship.

I know you don't want to go there to risk finding out, but not talking about it and rug sweeping is about the worst thing you can do for a friendship."
840,"Yeah, I wondered that too. Why would they tell him exactly who complained? But, the people who lived in my unit live in another unit in the building now. In his tirade he said those tenants told me I just needed to talk to him if it was too loud. The other tenants talking to me never happened, but it indicated that other people have had to tell him it's too loud before. So he knows its an issue, he just doesn't care. "
841,"My mom wasn't exactly telling me that I should still like her, she was just saying it's weird that I don't. I agree with you though."
842,"Unless they have kids or a hobby farm (pretty much the same thing, TBH), the homemaker ""job"" is suuuuuuuuper cushy."
843,"I think that you guys are on the right track. Move in with Michael, Kyle and Ashley. Tell Dani about this ASAP, because her boyfriend seems to purposefully make you and Ashley uncomfortable. He’s being overly sexual and honestly, it’s really icky. Telling Dani is the most helpful thing you can do, because you have no idea how he treats her. This might be her push to give him an ultimatum or even break up. Or it might reaffirm that moving in with the other three people is the right thing to do. "
844,"Yeah seriously! I work 32 hrs/week and I’m 10 years younger than her, I _still_ am looking for things to pass the extra time. 

I think what OP meant is that while she has the extra time, her fiancee’s demanding attention, which can get in the way of using that time for herself. Still though, that’s a lot of free time. Even people who work a normal 40 hr week have free time."
845,"This... isn't a definite, as it still possibly could be a coincidence, but if your version of the story is correct, this situation smells like shit. If he was planning on taking a picture to work, why did he toss it into basically old storage? 

""I gotta remember to take my breakfast to work with me tomorrow morning, I'll just leave it in the garage behind the power tool rack so I know where to find it."" 

Also:

&gt;When I asked [about the bobby pins] he said they must’ve been from before. He said he’d found a few of them and must’ve just set them on the bed.

""Must've""? What does that mean? Did he set them on the bed or not? I'm not buying it. 

If you questioned him about the bobby pins and the picture randomly being shoved somewhere, he knows what you found is setting off alarms, and he's likely deleting texts and evidence anyway. I'm not really sure where to go from here, except to communicate with him about why this situation smells, and hopefully he can see how this all looks from your POV. "
846,"Pretty medium yellow flag here.

You uninvited him from something he clearly doesn’t want to go to and he gets to act like the jilted lover."
847,He will surely know someone who was handling emails during labor and immediately post partum and think everyone can and should do that :(
848,"
If I were you I’d just phase out the rest by just chopping the relationship’s head off. Haha. This dude doesn’t care about you

Good luck to you! "
849,"&gt; I throw or slam things when we argue so I don’t direct my anger at her. 

The fact that you *need* a physical outlet for your anger is the problem here. Yes, it is good that you don't take it out on her, but that's only the very first step in not being abusive. And it's a very shaky step, since all it takes is one level of escalation before you are hitting her instead. You need to get to a place where you can be mad and not be standing right at the edge of that cliff. "
850,"I’m sorry that you’re having to go through this. Pregnancies happen. You’re not stupid or any other negative thing you think about yourself. Don’t feel you need to “punish” yourself for a birth control failure.

If you haven’t yet, go to an actual Planned Parenthood, not a crisis pregnancy center. Crisis pregnancy centers do not, in any sense of the word, have your best interest in mind. You owe it to yourself to get accurate and complete information to help you make your decision."
851,"Stop lying to them and sneaking around. Just be honest with them about your relationships and friendships. It will just take time. It sounds like you and they are reasonable, so just be on your best behavior and they will come around. "
852,"PI here - i would definitely get ALL my proof / ducks in a row &amp; tell his new GF. You should attempt to text message the ex, regardless of how you got the #. Apologize for not believing her, explain how two words are better than one, and show proof to the new girl. You could also conduct a background check to prove his paper trails (opening businesses with different girls, using and abusing them etc). Wether you succeed or not, you can TRY just to save her a lifetime of commitment and trust issues. 

If Ellie won’t help, have his friends who told you. Best of luck. "
853,"No. When I first met Devin, she told me upfront she did not want a lot of people over and especially not guys, for some reason. I wasn't going to argue, it's her house. She never has guests over either, except for her brother and sometimes his boyfriend, so I guess gay guys are okay...? Idk. I didn't even get a chance to say anything. She shoved the list in my hands, I was stunned and then she walked off and has been in her room ever since."
854,"These are pretty normal reactions for having your consent violated. Just keep reminding yourself: you are not a piece of garbage. Freezing in a situation like that is a normal, human reaction. It's part of fight or fight (or freeze is left out, but it's one of the F's). 

I don't think involving HR is appropriate here yet. This sounds like an instance of mixed signals and crossed wires. She may have mistaken your friendship and closeness for romantic interest - this happens every day. I would make it clear to her that you have no interest in a romantic relationship and that her kiss felt like a violation. She should be mortified and apologize to you. It's up to you whether you think you can resume your friendship or not.

Involving HR would be appropriate if:

* This happened at work, or
* She was your superior, or
* This escalated into further harassment or further assault"

856,Your boyfriend is a rat.  He and his boys are the worse of the worse.  Really he should be an ex. Why isn't he an ex?  
857,"&gt;she did not really want to keep her at first, but i managed to convince her.

and yet somehow you think SHE is the selfish one?

I have no words (well, not that won't get me banned) for your behaviour and your selfishness. 

Offer to adopt it 100% from her and let her go free. And try not to manipulate and bully the child like you did its mother."
858,"Not only that, but other people are noticing her sour mood.  I'd bet a round at the NCO club that there are already rumors going around about an inappropriate relationship between them.  

The OP's husband doesn't have to make a big deal about it or ask his Gunny to do anything about it.  It's important to get his version registered with his chain of command first.  "
859,"Statistically speaking? Absolutely yes.

I've been with my husband for seventeen years. He's actually never violated my trust. Ever. 

But as someone who's been with the same person for seventeen years--a year is NOTHING. You don't know someone after a year at ALL."
860,Got to agree. I know they are kids an all but I don't think that absolves them from basic stuff like making sure a friend is safe and just not leaving them drunk by some woods at night without anyone else to help... 
861,"Never made any advances WHILE at the party.

In another comment in the original post, the girl had told OP she had no intention of doing anything NOW that she had found out that OP's boyfriend had a girlfriend. 

She was originally pretty interested. You don't tickle each other and go on dates (effectively, that's what they were) because you're not interested. "
862,"is there other stuff going on in your life right now that is causing you stress? sometimes when we have a lot of free-floating negative feelings occurring, it's really easy to attach them to one thing and make that that scapegoat for everything else."
863,Let him be frustrated. Maybe you need some distance in this friendship.
864,"Worse, it was real life."
865,"You need to tell your boss the truth. By trying to avoid making one person look like a liar, you’ve actually successfully made you all look like - and into - liars. 

Also, ask for separate checks in the beginning of your meal if Bella goes out with you all ever again. That way if she skips out, the restaurant can hold her accountable. It’s stealing. "
866,Good lord. Leave the chat. These people are not worth your time.
867,"If you want to appeal to his sense of logic, tell him it's presenting a neutral third party who can give an outside perspective. That he obviously doesn't know everything because if he did, that would make him the kind of person who knowingly hurts people he loves and you don't think he's that kind of person. Y'all do love each other, right?"
868,"This is the only solution. and OP, you need to do it while staring him in the eyes. "
869,"Maybe it's because I'm older and I've been through a lot in my 44 years, but I'm a pretty big fan of not trying to understand the motivations of people who don't have my best interests at heart. If I know that being around them is bad for me, I don't want to be around them, and I don't want to waste my time trying to figure out how to make them care."
870,"Does he actually treat you well or is he just not abusive on a daily basis?

For example a bf does not get a gold star for not hitting you or cheating on you-thats just a given. Its like minimum wage.

SO what does he actually do?"
871,"&gt; “Do you want to resolve this? Because you can Dee, it’s much easier than you think. All you have to do is report this, and most people will have your back once you do.” 

I would recommend against this type of advice. It puts pressure on her to fix something she didn't cause, it's telling her that her situation is ""easy"" to fix, which it is not or at least doesn't look like it to her. 

You're also making entirely unfounded promises about how 3rd parties will react. You don't know that ""most people"" will have her back. According to survivors of abuse, this is usually not the case at all.

You're making ""perfect world"" assumptions on a fucked up, complex situation.

My recommendation is to listen to her, ask her what she wants, and don't do *anything* against her will. No violence against her mother's husband, no outing her to the authorities, nothing. Be there, be supportive, let it be known that you'll be there for her when and if she takes the next steps, but don't pressure her to go ahead. No ""so, when will you [x]?"" No ""You know, I heard that [y] is really helpful."" where [y] isn't related to self-care.

You get to decide where your priorities lie right now. Is it your gf, or is it your anger at her abuser?"
872,I'm on Lexapro and I noticed that it did stop me from ruminating as much. Less obsessive negative thought cycles.
873,"""Hi M'am, I don't want you to take this personally, but I'm working from home and when I'm working, I need to focus 100% on my job.

I'm also an introvert and I'm not used to so much interactions with people. Again, I don't want you to take this personally. I don't mind if you knock on my door once in a while, but every day is... a bit too much for me. I hope you understand and don't take this the wrong way."""
874,Bull shit. That is the risk you take with sex. Unless he wore a condom every time there is no sympathy. If he did he should have talked about what would happen with an unplanned pregnancy long before it happened.
875,"That's 100% fair for you to upset about a lack of communication. However, you also failed to communicate that you were leaving, hoping that she'd notice. You both of communication issues to work out. Framing it that way might be more productive than blaming her.

What do you mean by ""told her I was like this""?"
876,"Well, the fact that she initially said no, but he kept pushing is pretty creepy and disrespectful of boundaries if you ask me. And what worries me about that is... what if she says no to other things when they're together? She doesn't want to hug, kiss, be touched... A guy who can't take no for an answer is a bit of a risk IMO."
877,This guy is very clear about his sexuality and is acting like a predator.  You definitely need to get out of that apartment.
878,"I can't believe after 6 years together OP is acting like a private eye in his relationship instead of just, I don't know, CALLING OUT the weirdness and inconsistency in her story."
