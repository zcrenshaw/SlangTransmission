0,"&gt;she only screamed that she couldn't see. It got to the point where she actually started to cry. I felt bad after this and realised that it had gone too far. I was going to give her glasses back but she ran out and screamed for her mum. 

So she can't see, but she can see enough to run out the room and get everyone in there? OP, Ellie played you and everyone else in the house. 

Give her the most non-apology possible and then just cut that part of your family off."
1,"No offense, but are you sure you guys 19, not 14? 

What I'm trying to say is... you are too old for this drama. Leave her a message and let her know you aren't interested in the guy and she can call you anytime. Tell her that you don't know why he / she is acting like this, but you're willing to clear up any misunderstanding. Then leave her be. "
2,"\&gt;  I need advice. I know I need to do better for myself but i love this woman.

\&gt; She just doesn't really love me anymore.

With kids, it is always going to be tricky. But how about letting her Mom help with the baby while she gets a damn job with real hours to pay for some expenses. Not to assume, but it sounds like you folks (without bachelors) are just getting the low end of the bargain and can only make decent money by putting in more hours (not a good trade-off, never a good trade-off). 

You need time to study and pass exams and then get a job that can hold its own weight. In this economy, that is crucial. It doesn't look like your gf or her mother understands equality and independence. Back then, families can live on 1 person's salary...so the guys took the hit. Now that doesn't work anymore. Corporations and governments have changed the system....and made it ridiculously hard to live on 1 salary. If somehow your gf/her Mom still doesn't understand, then you have no choice but to split the family. "
3,"&gt; Her boyfriend is not being a jerk

he is. what op is dealing with is a tic, but she's expressed this to her boyfriend, who gets angry and antagonizes her instead of believing that she can't help it. if he didn't understand it at all times, that's one thing, but op literally said he antagonizes her when she expresses her feelings. that's absolutely being a jerk."
4,This guy has serious control over so much of OP's living situation and it's scary as fuck.
5,It's really that bad. It's ok to be alone.
6,"If your future husband has tantrums over issues like this, you can be sure it will not be much better, with children involved. If he thinks you're a pushover, and is willing to continue arguing with you until he gets his way, do you really want to marry someone like that? If you're unsure of living together now, why would being married change that? I personally would reconsider marriage at this point, especially when you are under so much stress and uncertainty. "
7,"&gt;not go on a repeat trip, as dumb as that sounds. 

Yeah, that sounds dumb. I could go to Barcelona 18 times, and it would never be a repeat trip. Especially platonic friend trip vs. romantic trip. "
8,"&gt;	I would label it ""avoiding compromise"" from the examples given.

/u/manipulativebf2608 please, please listen to the comments on this post, especially points like the above. He is **not** manipulating his way out of conflict or an uncomfortable discussion. He doesn‘t like nightlife and doesn’t want to miss out? He manipulates the circumstances so no one goes out without him. He didn’t ask you about the suspected familial ties...if you *had* recognized the baby are you **sure** he would have come clean and told you you were related?

This is important: is he a Defense Attorney? If he is, that’s evidence enough that knows *exactly* what he’s doing. **he is using similar techniques to those he would use in a courtroom to get a jury to come to the conclusion he wants them to come to**.  And he’s probably pretty good at getting what he wants from people. 

Manipulative people can be really *really* ***really*** good at being generous and kind and charming - they’re often model citizens. That doesn’t mean that this behavior is acceptable in a relationship or interpersonally effective to any degree. You need to bring it up with him, tell him point-blank to start communicating like a human adult significant other, and **run for the hills** the next time you find yourself making ”compromise” only to realize he actually “won” and got what he wanted. 

Don’t give him any more chances after addressing your concern. If he stops- great! If he doesn’t, it’s because he *doesn’t want to*. "
9,He's not your friend.  And he is not ever going to be interested in dating you.  You have to let that go and stop trying to explain to him why you think his actions are wrong.  There is nothing you can say to him that will make him think he is a bad guy.   Cut him out of your life and focus on yourself.
10,Yeah-reading his original post I had assumed they were living separately based on how he talked about it.  
11,"The way you presented your expectations came across as aggressive and confrontational. Unless you already had boundary issues with your family then it wasn't the way to go at all. I think you really hurt your mom's feelings unnecessarily, if you never had boundary issues in the past. Her reaction is pretty extreme, but I could see how the lack of trust comes across as a huge insult. 

So, do you want to be right here, or do you rant to maintain connections?"
12,"I assure you, there's nothing harsh about that. It's what everyone is thinking. I'm ten years younger than you and side-eyeing hard, because 21 is too young for *me*."
13,[removed]
14,"I can't help with the questions you asked, but I can give you some advice in general.

Like you said, you're not just choosing your partner, you're choosing your child's step-parent. You've only been with this man a year. As far as I'm concerned, that's barely knowing someone length. I tell people without kids to wait 3+ years to get marriage serious, because it really does take a long time to actually get to know someone on that level. With kids in the mix, you should absolutely be waiting at least that long.

1 year is too soon for pushing for marriage. Family counseling is an excellent idea."
15,"The death of your wife’s childhood friend is clearly a really big deal to her, and this wake is something that is only going to happen once. If she really needs you there for support, I think that’s something you should take into account. You say you’ve been to funerals without her at times. Maybe you weren’t as shaken by those deaths as she is by this one. Or maybe you were. It’s just something to think about.

At the same time, I understand that your mom’s 60th birthday is a big deal as well, and something you’ve already promised you’ll be there for. But... deaths are hard to schedule. And if your wife is really going through something, then you need to take that seriously and be there for her, the same way you’d want her to be there for you if you were really going through something.

Is there *any* way that the smaller, more intimate family party (if I remember correctly, the one that conflicts with the funeral) can be rescheduled for a slightly different time? I know that’s a huge thing to ask, but for a death in the family, it’s not necessarily a totally insane request. 

Bottom line, I believe funerals should usually take priority over birthday parties. No matter how much you’d rather be at the birthday party. "
16,Thanks guys. 
17,You should have called your wife to discuss this with her before declining. She has a rght to that decision as you have a right to say no
18,Bingo. That’s the huge red flag there. OP gave bil a perfectly reasonable response to the inquiry. Bil did a complete end run around the actual parent to get what he wanted. Why? Very fishy. I’d be irate at bil and mil. It could be perfectly innocent but really handled poorly but wife needs to understand that her family can’t go around husband if they hear an answer they don’t like. 
19,"My BF was very similar in age and experience to you on our 3rd date when he asked ""So, do you think I can call you my girlfriend?"". It was adorable and a memory I've cherished for years. 

Do it, there's nothing brave or endearing about pretending not to care."
20,That’s a good point. I’ll lock it down - just as a precautionary measure. 
21,"&gt;texted me while she was there saying she is mad I would accuse her of cheating (which I never did), 

Yeah, that's her guilty conscience accidentally tipping her hand. She used the word ""cheating"" because she knows thats what she's doing."
22,"He posted them to strangers for a year and he just got caught. He can totally use them to blackmail you and at this point you have to assume he has taken pictures of you with your face in them maybe while asleep or in the shower. He could do anything with them, send them to your friends or family or your job. "
23,I wouldn't be able to even kiss someone with that kind of bad breath and BO let along sleep with them. 
24,"Seriously, it just doesn't make any sense to me! My boyfriend and I both browse this reddit and he brought it up the other day himself, he asked me where these women find these guys and WHY do they stay? I just have absolutely no answer."
25,"No, her brother can go fuck himself."
26,"I also think he's only saying that he's saving it for her as a gift because she caught him in a lie.  If she asked for the money now he wouldn't be able to just give it back her he definitely has been dipping into that ""rent"" money from time to time."
27,Probably 1-on-1 couseling and together tbh
28,"Yeah, it’s called genetics"

30,"Why does your sister have to stay at her grandparents house? Does she not have anywhere to go?

&amp;#x200B;

To be truthful. You and your sister's problem with your dad's new family is between you lot. If the grandmother wants to invite her new step-grandchildren round, she gets to do so.  If your dad wants to visit his parents with his new family, he gets to do so. I know it hurts and sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you pick your sister up? "
31,"How about trying to fake it till you make it?

I too have many insecurities and have also met someone amazing, but whenever I get these insecurities, I breathe in, tell myself what values as a man I want to have and be part of me, and I BE that man.

Do I want to be a jealous man, or an affectionate man who is self assured and capable? The latter of course, so I break down what being self assured and capable means, what traits that man would have, and then be that.

Eventually by doing this you begin to live that and thus when nothing bad happens you overcome it slowly."
32,"My husband (46m) also has CF. He is fairly healthy, doesn’t take enzymes or anything for it. He also has asthma. His CF isn’t something we talk about very often. But when he gets a cough or develops pneumonia inside I (37f) panic. I know there is a really good possibility that he will pass before I do, but I also know I could get hit by a car tomorrow. If she’s not ready to talk about it, then I think you need to leave it. It’s not that it’s something she isn’t aware of. She knows very well probably. But she may not want to say it out loud to you. 

Do what you need to prepare, maybe as suggested talk to some close friends or family. Or maybe leave her a note. 

I’m sorry OP. "
33,"My SIL cheated on my brother and I've read a small mountain on the subject to try to understand what happened.

Let's first look at what you two are looking at in terms of time line if you decide to stay together.

From what I've learned, my best guess is that most innocent spouses go through 1-3 years of white hot emotion. There is then a 5-10 year period where things cool down, but can be triggered up. After that, things are as good as they are going to get. During the white hot period, there is a good chance the affair will be discussed daily. For sure OP, you will be thinking about it, even if you don't mention it. In the second phase, it won't be a daily thing, but something might happen that triggers a memory and boom, it becomes a daily thing for a month.

Ironically, when reconciliation is attempted and fails, it is usually the cheating spouse who leaves because the innocent spouse is ""taking too long"" to get over it.

So before anything else, are both of you willing to go through a process that can last as long as 15 *years* to get over this? If not, there is your answer.

If you both decide the answer is yes, then I suggest you both read up on how to get past infidelity. You could both start with Michele Weiner-Davis's book ""Healing from Infidelity"".


Another factor to consider is kids. Since she has proven herself as sexually untrustworthy, if you decide to reconcile I would recommend that you both agree that any kids are immediately DNA tested to make sure you are the father. I would also recommend that you have a pre-nup that spells out what happens if you aren't the father of any children.
"
34,"&gt;Like a child, he is only interested in his toys when they're about to be taken away.

YEP. This is a jealousy thing. As soon as she's available again, he'll be bored and leave her."
35,"It is a great idea, we have an axolotl and when we were in transition I moved it into my classroom (I teach 3rd grade) and it was the best decision! Kids were huge fans and we’re bringing parents inside to talk about it, at the end of the year they new so much about it. It is now back home and students are still asking news about the axolotl when we cross path at recess!"
36,"People sure are quick to jump on a woman for asserting that her needs are important. 

The ex-boyfriend can't even keep a part-time job, but OP needs a lecture about coddling his needs when she's in school to get a professional degree for a future career?

&amp;#x200B;"
37,"&gt;My boyfriend is very very smart. He's one of those naturally smart people that doesn't need to study for anything and still does well. 

Apparently freaking not. He doesn't need to study because he's a cheating cheater who cheats. 

If he's ""one of those naturally smart people that doesn't need to study for anything and still does well"", then why...um...didn't he do exactly THAT?

I get that you don't want to turn him in, and I get why. I have no opinion on whether some idiot kid ruining his future gets the hammer or not. You *didn't ask that though*. Should you dump him? Someone that could so clinically tell you he stole all the exams *over the internet* (again, this guy is NOT smart. How hard would it be for Tech to trace this back to him and 100% guy--double idiot?) with zero remorse? Hell yes. He didn't come to you and say, ""College is harder than I thought/my high school didn't prepare me for this. I freaked the frick out over how crazy hard this class is, and I took the stolen exam. I screwed up in the worst way, and I don't know what to do."" He just told you he did it and didn't care. (And really, why afterwards? He's not exactly ride-or-die because a Robin Hood type would have offered you the exam when he got it. Instead, he let you get a D. Again, cheating is wrong, but he has the weirdest line in the sand.) 

Hell yes, you dump this lazy shit who's messing with the entire class. "
38,"My guess would be that you said it was a biological function and she was exciting. Even if you don't mean it that way, it translates to 'semi nakedness women is exciting and arouses me"" and not ""YOU are making me aroused because YOU are sexy and I am attracted to you "". She wants to hear that it is beyond animal instinct and real love that makes you feel that way for her. "
39,You were up front with him about what's in your pants and he has continued contact so I would try to relax and just take things one step at a time.  He may be bisexual or he may be curious or questioning.  It's honestly too soon to tell so just enjoy the ride for what it is.
40,"You did nothing wrong. He's the one that's wrong. Also the ""don't do sports or the lesbians will molest you"" is so batshit insane I don't even know where to start. 

I know you love your dad, and will probably forgive him whatever he does, but you need to understand that, objectively, he's neither a particularly sane nor a particularly good person. Hell, he's not even being a good father 

In future, when he blows up at you over petty shit, don't let him convince you that you're wrong. Look to your mom instead. If she's okay with it, then you can just put it down to your dad being a crazy/bigoted person again and ignore his opinion.

And if he's going to be harder on your than the rest of your family, then that's fine. He can just turn to them to explain why you never want to visit once you're grown and have left the nest."
41,"You should have a face to face talk with your parents, tell them how hurtful it is, and that you'd like to still be invited. Then start inviting them over for dinner, to the spa, etc. If they still choose to exclude you, you can't force them.

You can however have your siblings over for dinner, initiate a sister spa day, do siblings and spouses trips, etc. The choices your parents make don't have to be your siblings choice"
42,"is it possible to find a domestic violence shelter for you and the kids, and for your husband to live in the car?"
43,Because she's a victim of negging... he's made her feel so bad about herself :(
44,"Seems like she's really killing his ""joie de vie."""
45,"If I was your BF, especially of 8 years,  I'd want to know."
46,"Your fiancee is taking advantage of you. You will never have a job that's good enough for her. You will never make enough money for her. You will never do enough chores for her. She could sit on a golden throne, waited upon hand and foot, and it would not be enough.

Is that really who you want to marry?"
47,[deleted]
48,Bad enough ALONE? No. Bad enough ON TOP OF a convicted rape attempt? Yes. 
49,"Oh, the joys of being subjected to a lecture on life by a wet behind the ears twenty-two year old know it all. 

Ignore him, or dump him--maybe that one--but don't be condescended to by some puerile prat with all the life and career experience of a housefly. You're just fine, he sounds like an ass. Btw, things always end up being more difficult for people with such an elevated and unshakeable sense of certainty."
50,"&gt;Yeah, he told me that he wants to take care of me in every way including financially 

NO. This can get really ugly really fast when you are totally dependent on him. Manipulators love to isolate their victims so they aren’t able to leave-do not let yourself get drawn into this. "
51,"I def relate to this. I'm sensitive to noise too, and have quite a few loud talkers in my life who I've hushed before - normally with a lighthearted ""why are you yelling?"" They can tell I'm joking bc they're obviously not literally yelling, but it also does usually make them check their volume. 

If the looks from strangers are the main thing that embarrass you, I would try to have a conversation with him about this centered on that aspect - let him know you're not trying to criticize him and you don't necessarily mind his volume, but you notice when people are turning to look, and that's what makes you uncomfortable. Ask how he would prefer you let him know when it happens. Hopefully, he'll care about your feelings enough to make an adjustment. 

Fair warning though, loud people, in my experience, are always going to be loud. Even when my friends take down their volume, they always eventually revert back. It's something I've learned to deal with, and you might end up having to deal too."
52,"&gt;The conversation needs to happen, or this information will eat you from the inside out. You need to see first hand how she reacts, what she has to say for herself. The allegation that she ruined multiple marriages is very serious. Let her tell you, in her own words, how and why she changed.

This... All this... Don't sit there letting it fester.. Talk to her."
53,Yeah this dude is gross just stop talking to him in general.  He is also a giant idiot.  I mean who lets someone they know for a couple months live with them and borrow money.
54,"Just send her a message saying that you HAD to list her as a reference for a government job, and that they may be contacting her. And that lying to a federal agency is a federal crime (I don't know if that's true or not, but at least scare her a little bit to keep her reference factual). Ultimately the people that run the background checks have dealt with more than one angry ex, so it would be easy to dismiss what she says if she sounds as crazy as she is."
55,"This.

100% this is what happened. She got drunk and inappropriate at the bar and is covering her ass (literally!)"
56,"&gt;I’m not sure if this was a fuck up or not but I went ahead and told Andrew the total price because I had nothing to hide.

Not a good idea. What you are charging is what was agreed on. Disclosing your finances isn't necessary. If you are playing property manager you set the rules. If he was butt sore it's not your fault."

58,"Just wanted to say that this comment just gave me a huge wake up call in my own relationship, albeit in a different way. I’m a writer and storyteller as a hobby and sometimes I try to actualize different “relationship fantasies” with my girlfriend, sometimes even in conversations, and they usually end with me being disappointed in myself because she didn’t respond the way I imagined she would.

I didn’t know how badly I needed to be brought back to reality and to learn to control my expectations, so thanks for this."
59,"Sounds like she was assaulted by someone she thought was your cousin.

Also sounds like she has realised the person she was sure assaulted her couldn’t have done it and is probably freaking out wondering if it really happened, if you think she’s a liar,  etc. If she’s telling the truth and genuinely believed your cousin assaulted her it’s probably a pretty big headfuck to be shown proof it didn’t happen like she thinks it did.

Of course she may just be lying for no reason, but given everything you’ve said about her that seems unlikely."
60,"It’s a date. 

Boyfriend is using any excuse to get away with it. 

End of story. "
61,"OP specifically mentioned that he expected her to “perhaps do some light painting”.  I’m not sure what he thought he meant by that - you usually either paint an entire room at a time, but it sounds like painting was explicitly on the table when he left. 

I think it is super bizarre that the couple decided to have her make the changes while he was out of town.  Clearly he had strong opinions about things and wanted to be involved in the process.  This should have been something they did together, but they mutually agreed that she’d get started without him.  "
62,"Oh god, that’s so cringy.  I can’t imagine asking a guy to go to the movies and he shows up with his girlfriend and her friend.  I would feel awful! Shame on him!"
63,"This is abusive and seems to be escalating very quickly.   I could give you bullet points but the end result is you need to leave.  Your gut was screaming at you when he held you and you felt gross.  Please get out, this sounds scary."
64,Wouldn't his parents have to pay child support if he is awarded guardianship? 
65,This is entirely daniels fault. Not on you to make right. 
66,"&gt;  I asked (begged) her to please help me out

She just had an abortion. The last thing she probably wants to do is be around babies or kids. I'm betting she feels like you don't have a clue about how she's feeling if you were so insensitive as to ask her that. I would leave her be for now. She'll let you know when she's ready to talk again. "
67,"&gt;exacerbated by the fact that he's currently living in a shared house with a shared - and frankly, kinda gross - shower.

I recently moved into a new house with this kind of arrangement. I too felt anxious in the shower. That lasted three days until I deep cleaned the entire bathroom. This is not an excuse for an adult to not bathe, I mean come on!

&gt;well, let's say I don't think he wiped very thoroughly, and it had dried in the crack.

...He has literal shit caked in his cheeks. I don't know how you can stand dating this guy. Im sure he is nice but this is some severely low functioning stuff."
68,Love her like you did before you knew. This really isn’t going to impact you as much as you might think. 
69,"Every once could be a little worse too because maybe she hoped the one before was the last.

This sounds a lot like anxiety. Off in a military capacity and suddenly change routine without explanation makes her think you're injured I'd bet. Hence the severe reaction on breakfast, it's because she assumed way worse."
70,"Make a list of the things you did and said in this post under the heading ""Things I will NEVER EVER Do Again"", laminate it and stick it to your wall and read it every day until you dont do these kind of things. Then get off the internet for a while and talk to people in real life."
71,"First of all, go get your kid. Whether he wants to see you or not, you are his mother and his grandmother cannot hold him hostage. Get the police involved if you have to.

Second, your kid should not be abusing animals and your husband should not be condoning it. If I were you, I would send all of the animals somewhere safer including the dog your husband brought. He clearly has no sympathy for animals and is teaching your son to be the same way. Your son is going to end up being an abusive psychopath if you let this continue.

More than likely there is something deeper going on that made him turn on you like that and you need to look into it. The fact that he took your kid away without your consent tells me he has no respect for you and thinks he can control you and your family and his mother is in the same boat. Consider cutting them off before things get out of hand. Next he will be turning your son against you."
72,"You are totally being taken advantage of and taken for granted.

Stop offering blank invitations like that. 

If you want to keep hosting trips, you're going to have to make it explicitly clear what is expected. And personally, no more offers for the people that take advantage. If they grouse, tell them you didn't like feeling like they were taking advantage of you so its best not to muddy the waters of friendship with money. ;)"
73,"I would bet my house on the fact she cheated on you.

Lies by omission, changing stories, and the whole ""Im going to be extra attentive and sexual with my husband, and do things we havent done before to make it up to him"" Is really her just trying to deal with her own guilt for cheating on you. 

I'm sorry bro, but you are giving her too much trust even now. Demand shes honest with you, and then you can decide if you want your marriage to continue. 

She is clearly still not telling you everything. If she refuses to come clean about everything to your satisfication, i think you know where its going to go. "
74,"~~While his heart _might_ have been in the right place (emphasis on _might_ since what he did was very shady,~~ **EDIT: based on updated information, OP's BF is a manipulative lying jerk, he gets zero benefit of the doubt**  ... This kind of deception and infantilization of you is absolutely _not_ ok. You need to make clear to him that this is not how a mutually respectful relationship works. This kind of deception is completely out of bounds. You do not need him to ""rescue"" you in this way. 

He lied to you and artificially created a financial stressor in your life just to make himself look good. You should be wary of trusting him in the future. He is older than you, so you should consider whether he sees you as an equal in your relationship or if he views you as subordinate to him. 

Another thing to consider is that his parents went along with this plan. You should think about how they view you and that they were ok with carrying on this deception. Also, not a good sign moving forward. "

Why did you invite her and not tell her you will be at work?

She needs to own the fuck up."
80,"As you said, you need time to process and mourn *both* of these relationships. Maybe get into therapy if you are struggling with that. Don't worry about dating right now, it's time to focus on yourself. Maybe start looking for a new job as part of your turning a new leaf. "
81,"Stop going to the hardware store for bread. 

Your dad is the hardware store. Support for the milestones in your life is bread. You keep showing up and asking for bread. It isn't going to happen. 

Yes, you have a right to feel hurt and angry. However, going forward in your life, you'll be a lot happier if you accept that your biological father is the way he is. Why should he be the second person you call with news of your pregnancy? Share your hopes and dreams with people who demonstrate their care for you.

Do you have anyone else in your life? A good friend? In-laws? Aunt or uncle? As adults, we have the family we were born with and the family we choose. Moving forward, I suggest focusing on the latter."

83,"&gt; If the third highest score is a 72 with him and his pal getting a 97 and a perfect score, that seems fishy enough that the professor ought to be looking into it. 

I don't think that's really that unusual. I can think of a few times in college where I, or someone I knew, got a high grade in an exam and the rest of the class did substantially worse.

""Hard"" (poorly designed) classes like that often have a fine line between 'acing the whole thing' and 'doing poorly'."

87,"I actually didn't realized she'd missed her dorm until I got to my car and she told me. I still don't know the campus very well because I live off-campus and only frequent two parts of campus.

But, yeah, you're right. I just need to tell her I'm busy. It's just so hard to get a word in. She literally will go on for like 10 minutes with straight talking. One of my colleagues told me to tell her I can only talk about these things during office hours, but I'm terrified she'll try to stay way past office hours.

She did text me today and I just didn't answer. I'd told her I was busy, though (when I was talking to her, not through text)."
88,Yeah this is some Disney type shit right here lol 
89,"So is this how you respond to your wife's concerns? Because in this post you speak as if your wife has no right to complain. You don't even mention what specifically she has an issue with. You belittle and minimize her issues by trying to frame this as ""we have a perfect looking life so why can't she get over herself?"".

I bet good money part of her problem is the fact that you show no empathy to her and expect money and chores to magically make and keep her happy."
90,"I know there may be extenuating circumstances, but IMO if you've been together 5 years and don't even have plans to move in together, you should re evaluate this relationship "
91,"I am shocked that you are still with your fiance after his refusal to remove someone who treats you so badly from his life.  He has utterly failed you as a partner.  Your request is beyond reasonable.  I think you two need to get into couples counseling immediately to work through why your fiance values such a shit person, and why he is ok with how this jackass treats you.  Because do not be fooled...if he was NOT ok with it, he would have cut him out by now."
92,"Looking at the ages her parents are so nearly there with being done with parenting children that OP needs to prepare herself that they may be looking forward to an empty house. Your parents might want to spend time with just each other in the future, OP, don't be oblivious when the time comes. "
93,"Well, well done on getting out. I know somebody who spent 20+ years in an unhappy marriage despising her husband and then finally he cheated and left. But I suppose that was a different case because I wondered why my acquaintance expected him to be content when she despised him. Incidentally people never stay together for ""the children"". Their son has issues from growing up with two people who didn't like each other. Better to have been civil, happier divorced co-parents I think."
94,"Hey, man.

Have you tried to reinvent your relationship? Meaning, introduce something new?

Maybe she would be up for some kinky stuff, some light spankings, some tying each other up, using blindfolds, etc?

Are you two still going on dates, just the two of you? No kids, no worries for a night?

Maybe also go on a trip just the two of you, a weekend get away here and there?

Ask her what would excite her, because I have a hard time thinking she can only get aroused if in a new relationship, and for a set amount of time, after that the drive is off.

She is missing something, whether she knows it or not, and maybe the two of you can explore what that might be.

Best of luck to you."
95,"It’s usually overt condescension, basically no one says this and means it ever, it’s like saying “well you’re trying but that’s all” or like “you don’t know anything but that’s cute”. "
96,And what if they had no one to watch the other kids if she went into labor? 
97,She was like this before the pregnancies though.
98,"I think he thinks sex is dirty, and he doesn't want to introduce it to the women he loves. 

But sex dolls are dirty, so it's okay to be dirty with it. 

I definitely, strongly suggest a sex therapist. "
99,"&gt; Spoons are supposed to be different from ordinary exhaustion. Having no spoons doesn't mean you don't want to do the thing because you're tired and need a nap, having no spoons means you are literally incapable of doing the thing and either your brain or your body is going to bluescreen if you try. So it feels like someone saying ""oh yeah I get sad sometimes too"" when you tell them you have clinical depression. 


Thank you for this explanation! It makes sense when you put it that way. "
100,"So seek shared custody if a paternity test comes out saying it's yours. Some states also have a father's register where you can register as a father with a father's interests (if she doesn't want to put you on the birth certificate for example). Make sure you get a paternity test though - she does seem to have been meeting up with other guys, the child might not be yours despite how convinced you seem. In utero tests are much cheaper and safer now, ask for one and offer to pay for it. 

Custody wise, despite what you hear, when there's two parents who want to be involved a shared child care arrangement is favoured by courts now, unless one of the parents is unfit for some reason. You've got every chance of being involved in the child's life if that's what you want. 

I'd consider telling her that you won't be getting back together but will want shared custody of the child. She can consider that when deciding what she's going to do moving forwards. She may be assuming that you won't want to be involved, and knowing you will and she'll have to deal with that may make her rethink an abortion as well. "
101,"This is like your job firing you, and then still having you work there. Because let's be honest, there's no way this guy isn't also going to try to sleep with her while they're ""remaining close."""
102,"Also, let’s face it. It sounds like there are texts from the wife making it clear that sexual favors are essential for good recommendation letters. That’s quid pro quo sexual harassment. There’s no way that this way entirely consensual, and it seems pretty clear that the student was resistant enough to doing anything overtly sexual. Why else would the wife put good recommendations on the line? She wasn’t getting what she wanted from her student, so she made it clear to her student that her future academic and professional [career] was dependent on providing sexual favors. "
103,How many hours/days a week is preschool?
104,"Gosh, guys, don't you all know that this is a clear indication he doesn't love her? Sheesh! The hints are everywhere /s"
105,"You sound very over-sensitive and passive aggressive from this comment alone. The commenter wasn’t attacking you, maybe chill out a little. "
106,"&gt; how cushy of a spot she’s in and is taking advantage of it 

She's showing you who she really is.  When times get hard, she doesn't work harder with you as a team, she slacks off and watches you struggle from the sidelines - then has the audacity to insist you continue to do so.

I'd be out the door, because she will never change.

108,"We just want you to see all the work and effort you're putting into the relationship, supporting yourself and being 100% responsible for feeding another adult. If he can't see it, he's taking his wife for granted. If you can't see it, you're going to continue to set yourself on fire to keep him warm. It's 150% okay for you to make demands of him. "
109,"&gt;After the ""incident"" I worked to trust T and to take his word, to cease the habit of looking through his phone. However, with this new development I had that doubt gnawing at the back of my mind again so I broke that promise. And I found that he and this girl had been having some definitely sexual conversations.

I don't mean to be a jerk, but after you discovered this, were you really all that surprised?

He found a coworker interested in having a threesome *without you*. How exactly would he stumble upon that knowledge without having sexual conversations with her? And doesn't it seem obvious in retrospect that these sexual conversations about threesomes (again, without you, his girlfriend) would escalate, especially given his history?

Just as a side note, when you have trust issues related to cheating (past and present relationship), a threesome seems like a really bad idea. You two aren't solid. He lies and cheats and you snoop in part because you know he's untrustworthy.

&gt;found that he had also been texting one of his coworkers, not as sexually explicit but definitely inappropriate.

Wait, a second coworker?

So that's three times he's done this in your relationship?

&gt;So, Reddit, I guess I'm just asking for a script or some support when it comes to broaching this subject. I've been binge-reading Chump Lady for now, trying to get into a more rational mindset. And yet I don't want to believe that he's a bad person, that he's manipulating the situation by doing and saying all the right things. I really do feel like he's just a dog trying to get a bone and that he truly does love me, and manages to separate the two things in his mind. And that if I had worked harder in trying to overcome my sexual hangups this wouldn't be happening (which might be true in some regards). Please, help me find a way to have this discussion and end things. Thank you.

I'm sorry, but why do you feel bad for your own relationship and sexual needs? Stop calling your desire for love and monogamy a ""hangup."" What's his ""hangup"" with being faithful? Why are your needs less important than this? Do you really think you deserved to be cheated on and lied to because you want a faithful boyfriend?

I'm going to be a little blunt because I think you need it: you know you have poor self-esteem, but what you may not realize is that you seek out assholes because of it. It's not a coincidence that you've been with liars and cheats two relationships in a row. You keep telling yourself you won't tolerate it, but then you rationalize it away as your problem and your deficiency rather than theirs.

I'm so sad for you and I wish I were capable of getting through to you that *your needs matter, too, and this guy is never going to fulfill them.*"
110,"Op, you don't appear to be absorbing what people are trying to say. If he wants to live with a person with a drinking problem, that requires compromise that he literally needs to do for the sake of your health and livelihood, as you would with any illness. My boyfriend has a severe shellfish allergy, so why would I refuse to stop eating shellfish in our apartment? I love him and would like to see him healthy. He has higher priority to me than clams.

The fact that he is unwilling to drink in a different room or just not drink at all in the apt is extremely worrying, and probably an indication that his relationship with alcohol is less healthy than you want to think it is."
111,"If it was just a friend, why did she go out of her way to makeup a random female name to hide the guy? Oh yeah cause it sounds like she's having an emotional affair."
112,"I think you know enough of the truth, actually. Any more detail is just going to be hurtful, and of no benefit to you. Your next steps should really be the same no matter what else he might tell you. 

Get scheduled for STD testing now and again in six months, and go no contact with him right away. Block him everywhere, and block any questionable mutual friends who might keep tabs on you for him as well.  

This is unusually terrible behavior on his part, so when you're ready I'm sure you will be able to find someone new who is honest and decent. "
113,"Um, you do realize why many women are quick with the “I have a boyfriend” right? I’ve literally been accused of leading a man on because I said “I like your hat.” We get accused of leading men on at the slightest provocation so yah sometimes this leads to mentioning a boyfriend early to prevent the situation. "
114,"If you send out a list of rules to relatives saying ""Don't dio x, y and z,"" that implies you think they might do those things. I think it's pretty normal to be insulted by that."
115,"Could there be a racial issue involved? Like, she is white, cousin is hispanic, hispanic guy groped her? So she doesn't want to be seen as racist for mistaking one hispanic guy for another?"
116,"No. Plenty of people do mdma and never even consider cheating. And it lowers your inhibitions the same way alcohol does, it's not that it removes them completely like that other user said. "

119,What if the spare room was just yours and his desk and games go in the lounge?  That way he doesn’t have to switch rooms and you have a sanctuary on drinking night.  The sofa that’s currently in the spare room can stay there and you can buy a second tv.

121,"Wow, your poor wife! Stop allowing this to continue! Your lack of assertiveness is going to make your wife leave you, and I wouldn't blame her!

All you need to do is tell your siblings that this is over. That's it. The next time they try to stick your wife with a baby, you - not your wife, YOU - stand up and say ""no, that's not happening"", and you physically pick up the baby and you hand it back to your sibling. Not your wife. This is not your wife's battle, it's yours. You make sure that your wife has nothing to do with this, and that your wife is not stuck caring for anyone's children. You are 100% responsible for this. You tell your siblings that if they abandon their children with you or your wife again, you will be calling the authorities and letting them know that they have abandoned their children. Stop rolling over and letting your siblings steamroll you and your poor wife. Set boundaries. Enough is enough. Stop trying to make peace, and be the good guy, and have everyone like you, and not make waves. Now is the time to make waves. 

When your siblings try to get you to babysit, or make comments about you not being tired because you don't have kids, why can't you say the following?

""A person doesn't have to raise kids to be tired. We're not watching anybody's kids today.""

""If we wanted to be responsible for watching children, we would have had children. We won't be watching your kids today. You had them, you're responsible for them.""

"" if you're so tired all the time, maybe you should consider putting your children up for adoption to a family that can take care of them. We're tired too, we don't want to take care of children today. We chose not to have kids, unfortunately, you made a different choice, and you're going to have to take care of your kids, or maybe give them to a family that isn't so tired all the time.""

Why are you not saying these things to your super rude siblings? You're well within your rights to ask these questions. If you think it would be too mean, or too rude, or it would make waves, or your siblings would get mad, then maybe you need to stop hanging out with the siblings. Maybe you need to break off from this family because they aren't respecting you and your wife. I have a brother that I haven't spoken to in years. Why? Because he's a piece of shit. Just because he's my brother doesn't mean that I have to spend a single minute of time with him. I have tons of other great family members and friends that are well worth my time. I'm not going to waste my time on the family members that don't treat me well."
122,"It's promoting self-preservation from OP. ""Viciously homophobic"" means they're likely to kick him out, possibly cut him out of the family entirely, and definitely make his life hell. That's not worth telling your cousin the guy she's been dating for 6 months is a cheater. If they were married, or if OP was older, or if the stakes were lower for him, it might change the balance. As it stands, if I were in his position, I'd keep quiet."
123,[removed]
124,And lied about it. But as she already said in the post itself: she has forgiven him.
125,"You sound as if you're saying that your feelings are the problem here, and that's what would hurt your child.

In reality, your husband is the problem, and you need to do better for your son."
126,"He is angry because his weird creepy webcam set up is over, and he is also probably using anger as a way to get you to back down. There is no reason to have cameras in the bathroom and in your private room. "
127,"Um, I can't help but feel as if he's being almost shamed for being upset to know all this stuff was stolen and them expected to buy replacements for his SO...? Like, this is kinda weird almost victim blaming...?"
128,I usually dont jump on the Dump Wagon but if yall are already at this breaking point then it's going to happen again and again. He shouldn't be that needy over just WORDS if yall were truly meant for greater things together. Actions matter more than words and he clearly failed.

She watches you spend $1.5k a month in expenses, doesn't contribute a penny AND wakes you up in the morning so YOU can help with the kids, which is looking like her sole responsibility. Meanwhile you work 2 jobs and study. Makes me wonder what it is that you love so much about her."
136,"Yeah agreed. However, I think his sister was being rude if she snapped at him about it instead of taking his thoughts on board.

Next time I suggest mentioning all the plans like, “hey I’ve looked in all these things from Friday to Sunday an I’d really like to bring you guys out to enjoy them with us!” 

Leave time free for them to chill/do their own thing too though, because a whole trip of social time is a lot for some people and we need to recharge"
137,"Like I personally don't care if they share a bed because I've shared a bed with my friends before and I've for sure cuddled with them, but just the disrespect for me and our relationship is just so unacceptable. "
138,"OP, mental harm IS harm. Depression literally kills people. Anxiety is correlated with all kinds of long-term chronic physical conditions. PTSD is in some sense a merely ""emotional"" problem, but try googling the very very physical effects it has on the brain. There are a lot of ""physical"" brain injuries I'd rather have than severe PTSD.

You are worthy. You deserve help."
139,"Yes. I'd bet money that Brian mentioned it in passing, ""oh, OP was nice to bring us little gifts."" And then Alex tried to disguise his perceived betrayal by making it a ""boss"" thing. 

It sounds like he thought there was a real connection going on and then got angry when he realized that either it wasn't or he had competition. Either way, dysfunctional family is a ""cute"" way to describe a situation like this, but the reality is that this is a business. 

I'd stop giving gifts, and don't play into being the boss's favorite. Just do an all around good job and keep it professional. If your boss crosses the line, don't hesitate to report him."
140,"Hey uhm... you sound mean? Your girlfriend was feeling jealous, instead of comforting her and reassuring her that you love her, you chose to criticize and attack her? 

It sounds like she will probably break up with you. Sorry dude. Perhaps you'll learn to communicate nicer to your future girlfriends when they feel insecure and want reassurance of love instead of escalating into criticism.

You should definitely apologize, if you apologize in time, she might forgive you, but you should think about your behavior and try to think before talking in future."
141,Omg check out I'm terrible thanks for asking. The woman's husband died. It's amazing and addictive! It will help. 
142,"I think this is possibly a jealousy thing - do you view his gifts as the fruits of a ""spoiled sibling,"" a symbol of how you can't do the same?

You know how good it feels to be able to help someone else, financially or otherwise?  If not, try volunteering somewhere.  Your brother is just showing you he loves you the best way he knows how.  Don't look a gift-horse in the mouth.  Show him you appreciate the gift by taking really *really* good care of it."
143,"He wrecked the curve though, screwing over his gf and other students. "
144,"&gt; and thinks actually shitty then he is bringing upon himself. 

This. Usually I can be very sympathetic because not everyone has an easy time making friends. But if this is how you describe Chris and you actually **like** him, I can't imagine how he behaves around everyone else. "
145,I think you're being reasonable but you should move on to the next.
146,"Yeah honestly at this point the baby is still a mostly-uninteresting lump and the party is just a big to-do for the parents. I don’t like how OP compared this her her graduation because.... well, the baby isn’t doing to remember this at all. "
147,"He should be upset with you. You have continuously undermined him and done things against his consent, and now *are surprised that he's unhappy.*  

You have been INCREDIBLY selfish here. 

Your brother wrecked his car and then *you* got the two of you into debt to fix it when he was the victim. You moved your grandmother into your house against his will. "
148,"Your husband just needs to work on his political spin.

*I wanted to send my son to a public school, but the public schools are so desperately in need of reform that I felt I had to send him to a private school. As a parent, I have to do what's best for my child, and I am fortunate that my family has access to a private school. However, as your representative I want to do what is best for all of our children, and that is reform the public school system.*

*If we can improve the safety and quality of our local public schools, enrolments and funding will increase, which benefits the schoolchildren, parents and the wider community.*

*It shouldn't have to be this way, where some children can access better levels of education than others. All children deserve a high-quality education in a safe learning environment. That's why school reform is such a critical issue in our community. If elected, I will take action to improve education for all children.*

See? It's easy to spin it into a political positive, plus your child gets to go to a better school in the meantime."
149,"I have trouble getting my head around the idea of being comfortable with looking dirty. Like, if there's a stain on my shirt, that's going to drive me out of my fucking mind until I can change shirts. I know that I'm a clean, hygienic person, and it drives me nuts when I feel like I'm not. I definitely understand getting dirty at work (most of my job is cleaning stuff), but you'd best believe that I'm changing clothes when I'm off work.

It perplexes me when people have the choice to be clean and they just don't. Are you not more comfortable when you're feeling fresh? Is it really not worth the time to you? I just don't get it."
150,"&gt; If they are in an open relationship that should be ok. 

If she has been fully informed and kept in the loop then I'd agree. It sounds like there is a lack of communication and a larger issue with respect to her."
151,"Exactly this. If he can freely do shitty stuff like that, it wilö probably go for worse..."
152,Call your family get a plane ticket from them and leave. You are in a bizarre relationship why do you have tocover up working? This is controlling bordering on abusive. Get out.
153,"Bet she'd hate Jesus too, that impious, socialist Arab."
154,"Yeah my romantic partner has a chronic illness and I take care of him when he goes through a really rough period. It's a hugely emotionally demanding experience, and I'll add some insight. Your girlfriend may not feel the same way as I do but hopefully you'll get something from this. 

The dynamic shifts. My fiance and I still have a very deep bond but after staying up for 30 hours and spending a fair amount of my time cleaning up vomit, it's not a partnership. I'm his caretaker. There's a line of seperation that exists for me mentally. And intimacy just isn't always part of the equation. I get exhausted putting my partner's needs ahead of my own so often and since you say she's usually the initiator maybe she just needs more of a break from holding thw reins. 

Also, as an unfortunate reality maybe the stoma is a huge turn off for her and she doesn't want to admit it. Maybe because she doesn't want to hurt your feelings, maybe because she feels bad about it. Who knows. I'd suggest talking to her again before deciding to break up. Make your concerns clear, and do mention that it's making you feel doubtful and like it could lead to resentment. Be honest and open. "
155,This. He didn't realize he made a mistake. He realized you are moving on with your life so he wants to drag you back into all the drama while he keeps flip-flopping on what he wants.  
156,"Frankly, it shouldn’t matter if you fall in that group. His statements are ignorant at best and rude/offensive at worst. He’s an arrogant douche because he makes these statements in general, not just because you’re sometimes actually in the group he’s insulting (although that certainly makes things worse).

It’s your call, but I would be ashamed to be associated with someone like this, much less date them."
157,"Like others have commented, it doesn't seem like you two are compatible. She's young and wants to go out and party and have fun, and there's nothing wrong with that. You're not into that, and that's okay too. But you two are both going to wind up resenting each other, because she's doing things you don't want her to and you're holding her back from having her fun. It would be better for you to find someone who's a homebody like you and it'd probably be better for her to be single and have fun with her friends. "
158,"I think you'll weather the storm. This absolutely sucks for you, for the reasons you cite, but it doesn't need to be the end of your professional career there. Keep doing what you do - be a good professor and an amiable colleague. Maintain boundaries and in time, this will no longer be a hot topic and you'll be able to move on, at this institution or elsewhere. 

As you note, this was a tremendous betrayal. She isn't even trying to say it's a false allegation, she's only trying to say she thought the student was into it. As you describe, there is an OBVIOUS imbalance of power that creates a feeling of coercion even if the student appeared to be game, and your wife surely knew that. She put your wellbeing and livelihood at risk when she did this, not to mention the breach of fidelity, privacy and respect for your marriage. "
159,"Yeah dude, go make some donuts. Wake up at 4am to go spill some hot oil on yourself and lift heavy pans and shit all day. 

Do you understand that there are jobs, other than office jobs, that have difficulties and hardships and stress?"
160,"People hide in the closet even after the door is wide open. Does he understand that you view witholding revelations about his sexuality as dishonesty within your relationship? Have you ever not forgiven him? 








Maybe he doesn't know. Maybe he's been on the down low all along. You don't mention your sex life once except that you have children. The only question that you can answer right is: is this marriage where you want to be right now? The rest of the answers might take time. "

164,"I’m not equating normal and middle class. I’m equating normal and stable and law-abiding at the very least. Clearly that’s not your normal, which is very sad, but that is what’s normal for most people. 

I’m not dictating to you how you should live your life or what your priorities should be, I’m pointing out that whatever life and future you envision for yourself, “waiting” for this guy will only be an impediment to that life. 

By staying with this guy you will damage your career and professional credibility (before you’ve even established them) you will lose and fail to make friendships (you are already straining them), you will miss out on love and companionship and shared experiences (travel! sex! watching Netflix on the couch together!) with a partner who is actually present in your life and not locked up in jail because of his own decisions. Can you really not grasp how much you will be giving away by trying to stay with this guy. 

25 years is longer than you’ve been alive! No matter how much you think this guy has done for you, you don’t owe it to him to sacrifice half your adult life for him."
165,He’s sounds like a huge asshole (pardon my language) are you sure that you want to marry this person? 
166,"Respectfully, you're not a real adult.  Most people aren't meaningfully adults (at least in developed countries) until the 23-25 mark.  Men (and it's almost always men) who date women significantly younger than them are usually immature and looking for someone they can manipulate and control.  ""I want to move in and get married when we haven't even hit the six month mark"" definitely fits that profile.  The subreddit gets about a post or two an hour from women who are about a decade younger than their partners that are just *baffled* as to why their partners are immature and obnoxious for their age.

The moral of the story?  Date people your own age.  "
167,I’ve had a woman like this in my circle of friends before but I never understood why everyone listened to her and you just nailed it. When I was younger and single I’d take all kinds of bad advice from another woman because I was lonely and felt like they genuinely cared. 
168,"Me too! I've know about 12 months this is a thing that I suffer from. And if someone says picture an apple, all I do is describe it mentally. I can't see it, not matter how hard I try. I've always been like this so I never realised it was a thing til Reddit told me."
169,"&gt; there's no reason that two adults can't just avoid each other in a large 15-person group.

And if she couldn't behave like an adult while he was there then she should have chosen to not go herself. "
170,"Thank you. I am starting to get mad with myself for even entertaining the notion of sweeping this under the rug. I think therapy and some ""rebuilding"" for myself are definitely in order. "
171,"I think it was only awkward because the two of you made it awkward. Like, deciding ""We need to kiss like randy teenagers"" put you both on the spot and it wasn't natural. You were both overthinking it and trying too hard.

When we were dating, kissing my now-husband goodbye was intense because I wanted to make sure he remembered me. Now, I know we'll see each other in a couple hours. I save the long lingering kisses for the bedroom."
172,"You don't need to learn how to tell her you don't like it. You need to learn how to actually share an apartment. It's no longer your apartment. It's both of your apartment. Live with the changes for awhile. If you still don't like the paint in six months, go together to the store and redo it. Oh, and of course she gets one of the spare rooms!!!! Wtf were you thinking otherwise. Sharing is caring."
173,In op he said he expected paint and changed furniture. I think he is upset it isnt just more expensive versions of what he already had.
174,"&gt;**EDIT** I stayed friends with one of my Tinder dates, he expressed how uncomfortable he was with that, and I stopped  talking to the said man. I chose to do this without being influenced by my bf in any way. 

This to me is important. He expressed that he was uncomfortable with you remaining friends with Tinder folks, but you need to become stronger because he has people who he talks to regularly and sends things that you didn't even know about? And he in 6 months hasn't disclosed information like who he talks to every day?

Red flags all around. It's entirely possible that it's kosher but from an outsider perspective it certainly looks like a double standard and that he is withholding information. But it sounds like gaslighting to me."
175,"I want to preface this by saying you seem like a great, caring brother and I'm proud of you, one human to another. Your brother will always remember who was there for him at this low point and I hope he really appreciates you. 

I'm pretty sure teens who have been kicked out by their parents can apply for food stamps. On one of the questions when i applied, it asked your age, of course. But it said if you're under 18, are you either A. Emancipated, or B. Unsafe to go home/escaping a DV situation. 
DHS may stop by and make sure that he's okay, but they would MUCH rather your brother be with you than in foster care, most likely. 
And then for toiletries and other expenses, he could get a pretty part time, after school job at mcdonalds or whatever, and probably be okay. 

As long as you're okay with providing him with shelter, which you're already paying for it seems, he shouldn't have much issue taking care of the rest. Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm just assuming you would be okay as long as he can get himself food/transportation to school/toiletries. 

Lastly, if he wants to work full time instead or hurry to higher education, GED! I got my GED at 16 and hurried to college, now at 20 I'm doing pretty well financially. GED tests took me 3 hours in one sitting and I paid 100 to take them total, because it's on a sliding scale in my state. He could move on from high school tomorrow, if he had to! I understand he probably wants to keep things as normal as possible, though. He is 16 still wants that social aspect of HS, I'm sure. 

Anyway, good luck to you and your brother and much love!"
176,"I wouldn't call it petty and, while she deserve some blame especially if there's a chance she only hangs out and sleepsover to have sex with your brother, I think the person to be mad at the most is your brother. Does your friend know he's done this with former friends? 

Does your brother know that you wonder if you're actually friends with these girls or if they're using you the way he seems to be using them?

 Based on what you wrote *you* seem to think there's a possibility neither are thinking about your feelings. You are losing friends because of his actions (idk if you chose to end your friendship because of this or it happens on its own because of their relationship to your brother)? It doesn't sound as much that they ""get their way with him"" as much as he gets his way without thinking about what effect it has on you. He is your brother, your friends may have alternative motives but they aren't related to you. He is all nd he should care about how his actions affect someone he lives with

I'll suggest the obvious, which I guess you'd want to avoid, and tell your parents that he is doing this, has done this in the past, and what affect it has had."
177,Dude log on to LFG and find a new group. That is not a clan environment anymore. LFG is quick and simple and there’s plenty of helpful gamers. If you’re on Xbox I’ll gladly run D2 with you. I understand you’ve known them a long time but they don’t seem that great at all and *they are already cutting you off*. 
178,"I *might* agree with this assessment if Bride didn’t get shitty about the bachelorette and shut down another person’s opportunity to share something personal. She’s not just sitting quietly in a corner while her friends have fun - she’s actively blocking them from speaking about anything not Bride’s Life-related and turning her nose up at their thoughts and ideas. 

I do not think this is simple anxiety. I think this woman has something else wrong with her. And OP and her friends have been out of her life so long that she’s unlikely to listen to their input anyway. "
179,"I agree about the BIL. He doesn’t like getting told no (or any form of that) and he certainly didn’t respect what I said. 

I agree that the SSN is probably safe and I don’t mind that he wanted to create an account. He will find a way around the “No” as he’s done in the past. Once he called me asking for help with something at his house. I told him that I needed to make sure it’s ok with the wife. He said he already talked to her and she said it was fine. Little did I know, he didn’t talk to her. 

I’m a subscriber to Personal Finance and it’s extremely common to hear stories about an Uncle / Aunt / Family Member stealing identities. I don’t think anyone would ever do that. However, neither did they. We can never be too safe."
180,"Its sad that having to the fucking hospital due to the beatings isn't 'consequence' enough for her. 

OP did the right thing imo. "
181,"Remind him that if he has an eviction on his record, then it will be hard for him to rent any place on his own."
182,"You said you still haven’t done your laundry... 

You were going to do laundry, you asked her to come, she said no, so who did you not just go on and do your laundry without her?"
183,"&gt; But he sends them allll the time. Everyday multiple times a day. It’s just too much.

I don't know if you've dated anyone besides this guy but just so you know, not all guys are like this. You can have a boyfriend who doesn't do this and who doesn't pressure you sexually at all. Instead of having to fight your boyfriend on this problem constantly, you can have a relationship where this problem just doesn't exist. "
184,Be honest that it was prompted by a message reply when he was showing you something and your instincts were right.   He has no right to be defensive at all
185,"I'd end the friendship, and tell her the reason why. 

One day maybe (hopefully) she'll see she was wrong and apologize. Until then, you probably can't avoid seeing Mike if you remain friends with her. "
186,"Yes yes yes. Immediately. OP seems to be in legitimate danger of being kidnapped.

I suggest going out of town with your Dad or staying with relatives at an unrecorded address until the restraining order is in place."
187,Thanks! I’m a pretty good cook and they are all super busy so I think this is something I’ll try to do regularly!  
188,"Being honest, she probably expected to just show you things once and there'd be no issues after that. And for something like cleaning, it really should be that simple. She shouldn't have to show you multiple times or do it after you. I would suggest trying a lot harder, and learning to do these things in the next couple days."
189,"She’s not the police. You’re confusing what’s illegal for the State to do with what is legitimate for a spouse to do. 

The State can’t pat your ass or peek at you in the shower, either. "
190,"Seriously, wtf? Your problems with the ladies probably mostly stem the fact that you still act like a drunken frat boy."
191,"I'm trying my best to absorb everything now and change my mindset. I was unsure if I should post on here, but as always redditors come through with support and advice to help. Much appreciated right now."
192,"I have older brothers... and I love them, but I cannot imagine having conversations like you are having with him.

You really need to work on your boundaries with your brother, because he obviously has none. And I get a super creepy vibe from this. :/"
193,"""You're being so selfish! Why is is it always about you? About what *you* want?""

194,"Sure, but you can't force your partner to not go to Law school because you require constant babysitting."
195,[deleted]
196,"Ugh, this is terrible. I’m an independent tech worker, so I know all about contracts and delivering projects. There are no holidays if they butt up against a due date. I’m flabbergasted that your partner (both in business and in life) is so callous about all this.

But then again, he’s been getting by thanks to your credit cards, your coding, your car, etc., etc. I think it’s time to evaluate if you’re getting what you need out of this relationship. "
197,[deleted]
198,Why would your mom need your dad's permission to do something? That's weird and pretty sexist. 
199,"That would drive me insane. My boyfriend is the type of guy who runs a little late and leaves everything to a last minute fluster and it annoys me so much because I tend to prefer to arrive a little early for things, but he ends up being 10/15 minutes late, not *8 hours*.

How I treat the situation with my boyfriend is that if he's going somewhere on his own, I try not to comment. It stresses me out when I watch him run around the house finding stuff 10 minutes after I think he should have left to catch a train, but that's his business. When we are going somewhere together, I leave when I think we need to. He can join me or he can leave on his schedule but I'm not waiting around for him. "
200,Wtf? What is there to disagree with?  She tried to get him to cheat so how can he in good conscience keep her as a friend?
201,"How can you be upset that your girlfriend said ""hi, how are you?"" That is so unbelievably petty. When your ex got to your home did you literally just open the door and glare at them with no greeting?

I hope the kids weren't there. You need to work very hard on what they experience with this."
202,"You cannot ""say"" anything. You demonstrate that you are a good potential mate. Either your GF has a backbone or she does not,time will tell."
203,Check out r/justnomil. This story would fit in great there.
204,She could have the bear just because she liked it and it's still no excuse for mocking her publically and damaging her toy. OP should not feel obliged to discuss trauma with people who've already proven they're jerks.
205,OP listen to this person. When you fill out the marriage certificate you will have to disclose that you were married but also when the divorce was finalized. You have to come clean about this as soon as possible. 
206,[deleted]
207,Do you think you can be happy having a girlfriend who does those things?
208,"If you think you are in an abusive relationship (and it seems at least close enough to me!), you won't make any progress bringing these things up to your partner. You are better off leaving without trying to explain/defend why. She will always end up talking you out of it."
209,"*I’ve tried so many times to talk politely about this without hurting his feelings.*

Stop being nice. Start saying, ""I can't come to your house if it's a mess. It bothers me,"" and ""It grosses me out that you don't take care of your place."""
210,"&gt;Is it even worth trying to make sense of who she is as a person given all those deceptions?

No.  Clearly, she is not the woman you thought you married, and what she did is really, really fucked up.  

If your colleagues are going to gossip, you can't stop them.  If they ask, just be honest:  you're divorcing her because what she did was wrong, both to you and the student, and you don't want to discuss the issue further.  "
211,"&gt;he’ll say, “Your viewpoint is so ridiculous that it’s impossible not to laugh

OMG another ""logic master.""  No, your viewpoint is not ridiculous.  No, playing devil's advocate isn't actually helping the situation.

Expect him to do this any time he doesn't directly experience the same things you do.  His empathy is broken.  You can do better."
212,"34 chasing a 19 year old   &lt;strike one&gt;

&amp;#x200B;"
213,"This is an abusive relationship OP.  He's your husband not your dad but you defer to him and for some reason it's ok for you to be deprived of the essentials of life while he stuffs himself with  fast food and *forbids* you to seek assistance.  If you were his child CPS would have you removed from your home.  

What happens if you get sick and need someone to manage the household and make you food?  He is not  good husband and you deserve better."
214,"&gt;Like I said in my post, as far as the relationship goes without taking money into account, the relationship is wonderful.

When you look back in five years, you're going to read this sentence you wrote and your jaw will drop.

I hate being pushy with my advice, and I hope I don't condescend. But this statement of yours is a contradiction in terms. Adults do not compartmentalize their relationships in this way."
215,"&gt;Aladycommenter

My thoughts EXACTLY!

It's like she has her own little harem of insecure men."
216,"He was trying to get you to break up with him so he could be single in a new city. If he'd merely wanted to spend the summer with his brother, he could have told you far in advance; he intentionally blindsided you so that he could be free without having to be the ""bad guy"" and dump you (or maybe he was intending to sleep around over the summer and then come home to you like it never happened). So he's either a creep who had no problem cheating or a coward. Possibly both. Now the summer's over and he's alone. He'd wanted to keep you on the hook so he could have a backup plan. Don't be someone's backup plan. 

Don't take him back. You can't trust him.

Also, what is this shit? 

&gt; A couple of days ago I got home from work to find a note slipped under the door.

He couldn't send you a text or email like a normal person? Instead he's creeping around your home.

&gt;  Without prompting, he said that he hadn’t so much as looked at anyone else while he was away - his brother also apparently tricked him into going on a date a month into his stay

I'm calling bullshit on this. 

This guy is a flake and you absolutely cannot trust him. Do you want to spend your life never knowing when he might randomly pack his shit and leave again? Who needs that kind of anxiety in their life? Plus, he just sounds like a freaking weirdo — his behavior is not normal. You can do better."

218,"You guys moved too fast and are just now seeing there are incompatibilities and communication issues. It would’ve been better to wait to move in and not get caught up with infatuation. You’ve been together such a short time you’re probably better off kicking him out, paying for and keeping that bike and moving on; this would be really early in a relationship to pursue serious counselling."
219,"&gt;It's a pretty common theme over on the raisedby amd jno subs that a partner just doesn't get the need for no/low contact, and then tries to encourage/force reconciliation. 

I guess this is a thing?

I feel like this is the 3rd or 4th thread like this I've seen in a week.

I grew up in a pretty normal/good household and have a positive relationship with my parents. Yet, I have *never* been under any delusion that all or most people grew up that way and have never had any trouble believing others when they've told me they didnt like or downright hated their parents. 

Even my ex-wife has this sort of relationship with her mother and when she explained it to me and said she never wanted any contact, my response was ""Yes ma'am. I understand."" and never pressed the issue (because there's no reason to!).

I'm starting to feel less like these people ""have a hard time understanding"" and more like they're just fucking stupid."
220,"I guess this is true, 3 big bouts of things that're a downer can't be easy on a person. I guess there's nothing to do but ride it out and try not to panic so much."
221,"This is super weird.

Your boyfriend is clearly planning on going on a date with another girl."
222,Especially if they're not actively saving for anything. Or in any sort of financial trouble. I could see if they were saving for a house or a move or whatever and she was out eating lunch every single day then *maybe* he could even consider complaining about it - but being a complete asshat over a food court lunch?
223,"Bizarre. Maybe she wanted drama in her life. Sometimes people get bored of being happy.

Or maybe this guy looked just like your cousin.

Maybe she wanted to feel like a prize worth fighting for? Idk, I feel like if that were the case, she wouldn't pick family. 


I don't know, I'm sorry, though. You must be really confused. I'd personally keep bringing it up until I got answers, but that might be a bad move. "
224,"I have six kids. I understand that a mom's needs here are important and establishing healthy boundaries is essential, though I do believe a baby is born into a wider family. But communicating your needs to your mother in a group email in a list of rules is really an insult to your relationship. And the very manner it was communicated indicates a distrust in all the family members, it establishes an adversarial tone that is completely unnecessary if you've never had boundary issues before."
225,"Please listen to this. He should never threaten to hit you, especially over something so silly as a snack! What if one day you make a ""bigger mistake"" and ""disrespect him""??
I know it's probably hard and you're soo young so this relationship is probably all you know but trust me, you CAN do this. Please leave until it's too late. "
226,"Your wife likes to lie to your family. Don't let her lie to your family.

Going along with it makes you a liar too."
227,Think about a restraining order
228,Why haven’t YOU blocked that crazy on all possible means of contact? 
229,"Nope just take care of it and carry on with your life. Unless you need help paying for it but if you’re not hard up for the cash then my advice would be to not tell him. My reasons are that because he’s a one night stand I’m guessing you two didn’t have the talk about what both your beliefs are about the subject and that could go poorly if he doesn’t share the same view point as you do. The second thing is that he might just think it’s a ploy to get him to talk to you again after he ghosted you and who wants to look like a crazy chick. 
I’ve told and not told the other party (all were serious boyfriends  each time ) when faced with the same problem and it’s been easier for me not to tell the person but that’s just me. I wish you the best of luck with whatever decision you do make. "
230,"Take this with a bucket of salt - but I think the fact that your pros and cons when weighing your own qualities are quite balanced in comparison to your list of pros and cons when weighing *her* qualities speaks for itself. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression you have pretty much already kinda checked out of the relationship and you don't seem to respect her as your equal. Based on this alone I think you already know that you don't want to be with her, and from what you have written, I think you should go with your instincts. 3 years is usually around the time where you've been exposed to all of their qualities good and bad, and this doesn't sound so much like a rough patch, it sounds like you've gotten to know her and realised your incompatibilities as a couple."
231,"&gt;her sacrificing their relationship over you - is simply not worth it.


I dunno. Are you a parent? Not asking condescendingly just... I'd be fucking livid if my husband treated our kids differently like this, it would put him in a whole new light for me and my love for him would absolutely be affected. 

I might leave my husband over this were I in her shoes Especially the getting mad over her saying shell write a cheque then, sounds like hes financially controlling and has some disgusting sexist ideas that I'm not sure I would be able to continue being with my husband after finding out about them..  


Especially if he viewed my amazing hardworking wonderful son in such a vile twisted way. "
232,Oh wow is it really? I kinda like that age better than 18 cuz you van still be in HS at 18
233,"You're catering to your friend at the expense of your family.  An extended weekend trip with the guys - fine.  A two week trip that means you won't have vacation time to spend with your family - on the selfish side.  Echoing what your wife said, when do those family vacation memories get made?

The fancy free side of your life is kind of over.  It changed when you got into a significant relationship, even if you had no kids it wouldn't be cool to fly off with your friend and leave your wife behind.  You get the freedom to do this stuff again when your kids are self-sufficient and you're an empty nester."

235,"&gt; That's the thing...he knows I'm going to be comfortable. There's no question about that.

Ironic considering you have no way of predicting that with any reliability because you have no idea what's actually going on to inspire that message.  Maybe there's something wrong at the campsite.  Maybe the tent busted and you have to sleep somewhere uncomfortable.  Maybe animals got to all the food so all you have left is trail mix.  You LITERALLY have no idea, hence, this reddit post.

So, your assumptions are leading you to create a scenario that may or may not exist when you could just as easily confirm it with a phone call.  Or stop worrying about it, assume the message is atonal and show up with a good attitude."
236,"Right? 

OP knows the massage therapist? “Oh wow, I’ve met him before through a colleague of his, small world!”

GF likes his shirt? “Oh thanks! It was a gift from a few years ago!” Or just “Oh thanks!”

OP, I know your ex was a part of 7 years of your life, but just change “ex” to “old friend” in your stories. "
237,Wow. I wasn't sure what to expect reading the comments but I think the policy of a domestics violence shelter should absolutely be the only advice that matters here. Thanks for sharing.

You may want to inform the landlord the new tenant threatened you. "
239,"Girl this is a big deal. He’s sending your private nudes to other people. He’s pretending to be you. And he’s very likely recording you having sex and selling it online. You might be a porn star without ever having consented to it!

You need to gather your things and leave. This is a very big deal. 

I’m not even going to touch on your violation of his privacy/phone because holy shit that isn’t even the most pressing problem right now. "
240,"It sounds like you feel like you are in some way ""buying"" their time &amp; companionship.  It would be appropriate and ideal if they were to spend some of their time *with you* if you invited and funded them to be on a trip *with you*.  But, I don't think you can dictate how they are to spend their time on a vacation that you gifted to them.  

Expectations, like boundaries, have to be specifically communicated in advance if they are to be maintained.  If you really expect them to spend time with you while traveling, you will have to find a way to politely express that expectation to them prior to agreeing to pay for their trip.  ""If you guys want to go with us on this trip, I can pay for it because I think it would be fun to hang out *together.*  It's been a long time since we spent any quality time *together*.  There are plenty of things that we can *all do together*.""  Stress and be clear that your offer is for the benefit of the time *together*.  "
241,You need to accept that may not be possible. And apply this lesson to your life. Stop mixing work and personal. This is exactly why they say not to date co workers and not to rearrange your life for something so new. Four months? Girl. Please get some therapy. This isn’t healthy.
242,"My cat once gently set herself on fire a little bit on a candle I had burning while I was in the room with her. I love cats but they can be super stupid. Your boyfriend also sounds super stupid but in a much less endearing way. Personally, it wouldn't be worth it to me. What if he kills someone driving? What if you combine finances and he blows it all on gambling? What if he kills your cat with his negligence? Could you forgive yourself for putting her in that situation? "
243,"I would suggest speaking with a doctor about how this might impact you and how to protect your own health. 

In general, a wart here and there once in a while is probably not a huge deal. You said you saw one wart on him once? How do you know he has warts on his eyelids, if you can’t see them, and he never told you about them? I’m confused about some of the details about the situation. "

245,"Dealing with Domestic Abuse is SO SO DANGEROUS. Did you know that involving yourself in a domestic conflict can get YOU KILLED? Did you know there is a higher chance of getting assaulted for stepping in? Her ex beat her to the point he could of killed her, what do you think he would do to you if you stood in the way??

GOOD FOR YOU. Never get yourself involved in Domestic conflicts. Call the police from a safe location. Never physically put yourself in between this again. Your ex-friend would be defending him even if he assaulted you. You think about that the next time she begs for your friendship.

She doesn't give a shit about your safety nor did she respect you after you helped her. She's sick and surrounded by enablers. You did the right thing. 

Battered women tend to get into one abusive relationship after another. There is a pattern with them. Who's to say this saga won't continue with her next boyfriend. 

Protect yourself. You are being smart. "
246,"&gt;he made a pass. He kissed her, she didn’t put a stop to it. It kept progressing to the point of sex, but was stopped part way through and she asked him to leave. 

Is this her version of the events?  Or his?  Or do they both agree?

&gt;She did later call him a cad later that summer and basically spoke poorly of him,

&gt;items of hers that he swiped

&gt;He said that she basically “gave him blue balls”

247,The first step to finding the right person is no longer dating the wrong person. 
248,"This probably won't make you feel any better, but men would be sexualizing her even if she didn't model professionally. Part of being a woman in this world is the knowledge that to a huge swathe of the male population you're just a vehicle for a pair of tits and ass. She will be objectified regardless.

&gt;And I don't know how to handle that either. Just, ""your sister models semi-naked"" seems... I don't know.

How about, ""Your sister models semi-naked and there's nothing wrong with that because nudity isn't wrong and women get to decide whether and to whom they display their nude bodies."""
249,As you aporoach your wedding date everything becomes more hectic and difficult. I wouldn't burden your sister with this. It may seem small but she is probably under considerable stress.  I would skip the gig and spend that time trying to help her in anyway I could.

Well this just got a lot worse.

You do know."

I would run far and fast from a sex offender. Immediately. I’ve been raped before, though, so maybe this colors my opinions? "
258,"8 months is an abnormal amount of time. I think that's where people are having a problem helping you. There are no magic words that don't make your boss feel 8 months of time pass. I guess the only thing you can do is face the situation head on and deal with the fallout.  Maybe this thread won't help you as tough love can cause anxiety. I'd probably delete it and look for strength inside / use your training in therapy to look for answers. But, really, there are no complete solutions here. Shit is going to suck because of that 8 months. There isn't a way around it."

262,"Sure he took the bottle of champagne, why you ask?

2. because after he's done screwing her he will be parched and want some champagne to quench his thirst"
263,"I love your friend, buy her drinks and make her hangover brunch!!!"
264,"You are likely to go back and forth in your emotional state. She will do the same thing. There are some things that being 50 and on my third wife has taught me. Write down what you want from your SO. Oddly, you'll find alot of her in there but there will be things that aren't perfect. Use a pencil this might change over a few days. Do not answer the question, what can I live with... Answer the question what can't I live without. If she isn't that and you can't find that in her over a few nights of sleep, if you get any. Do her a solid and tell her. Move on with your lives. This is going to be hard. It's going to hurt. Put yourself through the ringer and find out what it is you need to be successful in a relationship. Sorry for the tone OP. I think a little bluntness might help you get to the bottom of your feelings. "
265,"That's not something you should know. In a professional environment your boss should be able to treat you the same as other employees. You should probably start treating your coworkers and boss more professionally as it stand there are probably already rumors about you and your boss since your his ""favorite"" and you know he finds you attractive."
266,If it’s a deal breaker for her I’m not really sure where you can go from here. It sounds like you either agree not to indoctrinate your children or you don’t get married. 
267,"OP, I just wanna say I feel like I'm in crazy town reading some of these comments, particularly any of the 'you're an adult now, drop everything and only hang out with your husband' which is super condescending and makes me think no one read your actual post where you're 26, been with this guy for 6 years, and had been on family trips with them just fine before. This sub is so painfully pro independence/self sometimes and it shows in posts like these where OP clearly does NOT want to be rejected by her family as oppose to being the one doing the rejecting. There is nothing wrong with wanting to continue the traditions you had with your family-- it is ridiculous to think that you cannot have time with both your 'new family' and old. Obviously things will change, but it's not a 'can't have your cake and eat it too' situation.

Anyway just saying your feelings are completely valid. Advice wise, as others have said, talk to your parents (not your brother) and let them know the kind of relationship you still want to maintain. Also not a bad idea to invite them over to things as well. "

269,"It does sometimes, but I usually forget to bring it up the next day. It’s definitely frustrating, though. For example, a couple of months ago I said I had a job opportunity in another city. I told him wasn’t sure what I was going to do yet but wanted to make a plan with him. And we got into a fight because I did not give him enough notice for that conversational topic."

272,"38F here. I say this for myself and all of my girlfriends, AGREED!"
273,"Don't let them shame you out of protecting your boundaries.  Simply tell them; ""In our home, we wear clothes in the common areas and we use our inside voices while having sex.""  Period.  If they can't follow the house rules, they can get a hotel room.  Their behavior is outside the societal norm, but even if it were not, it is still your home and everyone visiting needs to follow your rules. Will it mean an uncomfortable conversation?  Yes, it will, but will that conversation be more uncomfortable than wiping their naked butt prints off your kitchen stools?"
274,The fact that you have been together 10 years really stood out to me. Is she expecting a proposal? You need to either accept her as is or move on now if she has marriage and kids able a goal. You’ve had more than enough time to decide if she’s the one or not. What are her opinions on all of this?
275,"Also, ""he got tricked into a date,"" ""I regretted leaving the minute I got there, but didn't contact you b/c, oh well,"" and ""I never even *looked* at another girl""(come on guy, make it believable, at least) all sound like BS.

OP kind of sounds like her mind is already made up to take him back, though. That's her prerogative, but this would be a good one to update next summer."
276,"Of course not, she only has an associates degree."
277,"I actually haven’t spoken to her since this happened, about 22 hours ago.
I am extremely angry and I don’t want to say something I’ll regret later.

Something I forgot to add.
My wife’s friend text me and said I was over reacting, She shared what my wife told her happened.

This is what her friend text me.


But she just told me that she had been drinking and didn’t mean to get drunk and there was this dude that hit on her and wanted to take her up to his room and she made it very clear that she was very married BUT she did not get up and leave the situation. Then when you saw her (or something like that) the dude said something while y’all were walking away 


That is not what happened. 
I don’t know if she actually doesn’t remember all of it or if she’s trying to down play it. "
278,"His friend was using his tinder?? First of all, BS. And let's just pretend that's true. He still had the account and was active on it! And was messaging girls, saving numbers, and trying to meet with them. He's trash "
279,"As a woman who has been with men who have this happen- it was likely the pressure to perform for your dream girl/being nervous that caused this. If you got her off with your face it saved you this time. As a woman, this happening 1x doesn't mean much to us but if it happens every or every other time you hook up, then it might deter her.

283,I'd find it very off-putting and controlling if a family member sent me a message like that. You said your family aren't ones to be smothering and to take over so why send this message? You risk alienating your family and putting them off ever visiting. 
284,"&gt; I totally get that, it totally makes sense, and I don't think it's a dealbreaker

That assumes they're even remotely interested in learning.  That aside, to me, that sort of failure to empathize shows me that the partner doesn't trust my decisions or judgement regarding my experience with people.  "
285,"Thank you I will try this approach. Especially the ""strict information diet"" part and apologizing directly to my manager. "
286,"OP i have been in your EXACT BOAT.

I have 2 sisters and a brother. Biologically they're my half siblings, which is obvious when you meet us as I'm white and they're half white and half black. However we were never raised to call each other half siblings because my stepdad always said ""we don't do things by halves in this family"", and any time it gets brought up by a third party we explain it to them.

I did have this one girlfriend when i was 18 who could never get over it. The first time she said it i politely corrected her, but then on the fifth time she said it to our group of friends (""he can't come with us as he's taking his *half* brother training"") which was about 15 people and i lost my shit with her.

I pretty much humiliated her in front of everyone, yelling at her that if she disrespected my **brother** and family in that tone again (and there was a tone of pure annoyance) that i would never talk to her again. I split up with her a week or so later, she wasn't worth the hassle.

My only regret is blowing up on her in that way, so i suggest to you OP that you have a quiet but stern conversation with this guy. Tell him that if he's incapable of treating your family with respect then he should politely go fuck himself."
287,This comment should be higher up
288,"I totally agree. At the end of the day, do you care about your gf or the girl? "
289,"Just wondering, have you and your BF ever been on a coffee date?

Most of my first dates have been coffee dates. It's one of the definitive first date in the US because it's casual and in a public place.

This woman isn't even *from* his home country, so how does he even know what her cultural norms are? Plenty of english speakers have different cultural norms.

Also, he already had an opportunity to bring up that he has a girlfriend. ""Hey here's my email. My girlfriend is trying to learn my language and it will be great to introduce her to a new pen pal, if you're interested (or literally any other casual mention of his relationship status).

IDK. Your BF *could* just be super dense, but that doesn't make his disregard for your feelings any better. "
290,"Agreed... 35k sounds outrageous. Aside from that, plenty of companies offer some kind of tuition reimbursement, I’d be looking at a job in one of those places before even considering dropping 70k of my own money."

I don't think it's that you are going crazy, although it may feel like that, but you just need a little help controlling your emotions right now and a mental health professional can be really beneficial in that regard. "
295,Throw the whole human away. 
296,Plus if you’re patient and caring it shows respect and love and will probably make your relationship better in the longrun!
297,"There was a case in Northern California. The woman came forward as an adult in 2010 and disclosed that her middle school PE teacher groomed her, and then proceeded to molest her throughout middle school and high school. Her disclosure and cooperation with the police resulted in the teacher being convicted in 2011. In the course of the investigation, they found that this school had multiple reports of this teacher's improper behavior. They had not acted on them. So, she sued the school.

What followed was a long, drawn out process. Due to the way our court system works, her entire sex life was fodder for the school's lawyers. They were allowed to drag this victim's name through the mud. They said that she wanted this attention. That this could have only gone on as long as it had if she was interested (keep in mind, fully grown adult... 11 year old). That ""it takes two people to be in a relationship.""

As disgusting as all of that sounds, as inappropriate as all of that sounds? That was a lawyer doing their job. It was the best defense they could think of in the face of overwhelming evidence that this school had screwed up. It was just part of their strategy. In fact, it would have been pretty successful if it weren't for one little problem... in the course of the investigation? They found that the school had covered up not just allegations but full on evidence of *another teacher* molesting *multiple victims* at the same time. That case has since led to the largest ever per student settlement in the nation's history. The cases were settled in 2014. This was considered a rapid settlement by an embarrassed school.

These victims went through three years of invasive personal questions, demeaning implications, having to deal with the defense try to schedule things at inconvenient times to make this as much of a pain in the ass as possible (it's an effective tactic because it wears the victim down), and generally being reminded of one of the worst parts of their lives. Now, they did (apparently) find this worth it, in the end. According to interviews, they found it worth it because it meant fighting back against a school many of them had reported the abuse to. It was a chance to ensure a school that had ignored them would never ignore them again. It also meant that something that had been dismissed was put under scrutiny and the school district that had turned a blind eye suddenly had to open it's general find and learn their lesson.

This? This is what you need to be prepared to face. That is what you'd be walking into. If you feel that suing your former school and district would be worth it? Go for it. Just have a therapist in place and be ready for all of this and probably more (I only know what was in the news). If not? Tell your mother your sanity is not for sale."
298,"Update: I called him and he gave me a bunch of extremely lame excuses. Cue 15 minutes of me laying into him and him generally not having any response whatsoever to my reasoning. I told him he is doing nothing to better himself and I want my shit back if he's continuing to act that way. 

Him: *shittily* **""So you just want to leave?""

Me: **""I want someone that's at least going to work as hard as I do. If you can't do that, you can bring my shit to me at [my place of employment] tonight.""**

So anyways, I'm newly single and I'm working a 12 hr shift on third with damn near no sleep. Thank you so much for your help, guys. I think seeing everyone else's distaste for his behavior was the push I needed to make this decision."
299,"Honestly I would be mad at my SO for getting blackout drunk, it's just irresponsible. They aren't in college anymore."
300,Ok. Thanks for the advice. This is why I left her but it's hard to move on hey? Thanks again.
301,"&gt; When we first got together I found that he had posted ads on craigslist looking to hook up with men. I confronted him, and he said he would never do it again bla bla bla. **Some time passes and I found out that he did it again!!!**

Bolding is mine"
302,"And to be fair, this isn't something that just happened out of the blue. The dude repeatedly goes through her messages on her phone and deletes conversations - *and she just lets it happen*. Why wouldn't he think it's OK to just remove all of her stuff?

I mean, I have no problem handing my phone over to someone I'm with, but as soon as they change something or start browsing through pictures and text conversations that had nothing to do with what they needed, that's crossing a line. 

I find these posts the most annoying. Partner shows a pattern of behavior for awhile, finally does it enough to really cross a line, and OP comes asking how to get him to stop doing that *one* thing, but overlooks all the other crap."
303,"Don't get rid of it. Put it in a box and shove it under your bed or high up in a closet. 

It might be the right thing to get rid of it sometime in the future, but it isn't right now. It would hurt and you'd regret it. 

Put it away. Heal your heart. Move on. And *then* decide what to do with it."
304,"Too often people use the defense of ""culture"" to defend abuse. Corporal punishment when your child is misbehaving or throwing a tantrum is one thing, like spanking them.

What your mother did was not corporal punishment, it was serious abuse. You were a good child; you did the cooking and took care of your little brother. Your mother was not a good mom however. 

You shouldn't have any guilt over not wanting to be close to her. Don't let anyone condone this as ""cultural."" Just being something might be cultural doesn't mean it isn't wrong, and you clearly have lasting scars from this treatment.

&gt;How do I turn down her holiday request without being seen as a bad person by my friends and bf, and without hurting her feelings?

She didn't care about your feelings when she attacked you with a knife and neglected you. You can be honest with her, or just make excuses and avoid her. For me personally, without her admitting it was wrong and apologizing, I wouldn't be able to have a relationship with her. Perhaps speaking with a counselor would help you sort through your feelings."
305,"Usually, yes.   Give him written notice and explain that if he is not out in 30 days, the police will escort him out.   That will let him know that you are serious.  Which may be all you need to get him to move back home.

You do want to talk with a tenant or landlord association office to be sure that there aren't any other details you need to cover. "
306,"Nothing. Do nothing.

Your parents are adults and need to take care of this themselves.

Remember, no matter what happens, you are allowed to love both of them."
307,"Long distance relationships are hard. 

Answer this: would you be ok if your wife said goodnight to you then went out with friends and slept in the next day? Would it feel like you were sort of out of the loop? Or would you just be like cool no problem? "
308,"&gt;I can't just go around telling everyone what he did, because I could get in trouble for slandering I think


You really can't. Ever hear of anyone getting into trouble because of Student Gossip? 


Telling people what he's done and that he's a pig isn't taking justice into your own hands.


A more subtle approach would be to set up a ""anti sexual violence"" organisation, or a feminist organization, which just severely hints at the guy. Needn't be a whole political organisation. It could just be a few conversation evenings capped with a party, maybe affiliate with a local self defense club. And if people there tell their own stories it's never slander. 



But don't force your friend into having to make this official. That's a horrible process. She might one day be ready for it but not now. 


If she talked to the police at least the police have an idea, and if someone else comes forward they'll know where to look for co-claimants. "
309,"No you shouldn't feel guilty, what you should do is never talk to that asshole again.   Your relationship has gone to shit because he's a shit boyfriend."
310,"screen shot and record phone calls...especially the ones he's making to you begging for money...do this if he calls again.  I don't know if your in a two party consent state, but your lawyer will help. don't end it yet. Get you ducks in row, proof in hand determine what you want to come out of this with.   Hand him a document that says if he signs it...he can do it privately and not be embarrassed. "
311,"Seriously. Not even a ""You wanna have sex?"" Just ""Oh, she's awake so I can stick my dick in her."" Fucking ridiculous."
312,I agree. I can't forgive how he tried to ruin my future of leaving. Especially mentioning my boyfriend which was completely unecessary. We're both adults and what he did out of sudden manipulated concern was childish and reckless.
313,"OP, you have a big heart, and you wanted her to have some easiness in life after a lot of hardship. But instead what you ended up doing was enabling her. Unintentionally, you were allowing her to be more like her lazy addict mother, and to morph into the bad qualities she grew up seeing.  

She never felt the need to develop as a person because she was selfish enough to not feel she needed to reciprocate all the was provider to her by you. She knew she could keep using you for money indefinitely, so why would she put in effort when you had proved to her she didn't need to?

Sweet personality or not, refusing to get a job after four years, dropping out of school, etc., are not a ""a few bad habits"" - these are major issues!

She wants you back now because it was a really sweet deal to sit around gaming during the day and partying at night on someone else's dime, and she wants that cushy life back. Things would go right back to how they were before if you let her back in your life. And remember, that means that you would actually be complicit in her never being a productive person. You would be complicit in her not reaching her full potential. For her sake and yours, do not take her back."
314,"Are you actually trying? Ask her what her least favorite chore is, and have her show you exactly how to do it while you take notes. Seriously. Bring a notepad and write exactly what products she uses and how and tell schedule. Then, put it on your calendar and tell her that's your chore now. Do this one by one until you've divided up the chores equally. 

Oh, and that makes no sense to me why you need her to come to laundry with you. I know you wanted company but when she says no you should respect that and just go alone. "
315,Yeah it also doesn't help that he comes from a really wealthy family and my parents together barely earn like 50k a year. I guess like his parents jus want him to have a gf who will b rich like them or something but idk. Thank you 
316,To be honest you should break up now but you don't seem ready.
317,"I wish I had better news. This has been a problem for 30 years and it will not change.  You can't change anyone, you can only control how you react to someone.  

&gt;How can I push my mom to show him some tough love?

This is never going to happen, as soon as you accept it , you will be in a happier place.

If your brother has the ability to search google, he could have had a job the last 10 years in a call center.  

I am sorry.  I am related to someone who has never had a paycheck.  Ever.  No amount of talking will change them. Ever.  

Until your mom is out of money , then and only then will they look for money elsewhere."
318,"that's a legitimate concern however, I think people like his brother have socialized themselves into the weird beings they are rather than it being an inherited trait. If you're boyfriend is caring and sweet as you, with a decent environment your child should be as well. As for your kids not being around their uncle, they'll see him enough during family events so it's not to the point where they feel deprived, they'll eventually grow old enough to establish their own opinions of him and if he's that creepy they'll want to avoid him as well. "
319,"The baby won’t, but the parents will.  The first birthday only looks like it’s for the baby; really, it’s a “We survived the first year of parenthood!” party.  To me, it felt way more significant than any of my graduations, because I had to work much harder for it."
320,"Every relationship is flawless until it isn't. Trust is gone here, she's running around your back with her ex who wants her back, and you're turning into the crazy, possessive guy she's going to accuse you of being no matter what. Bail before you end up needing bail."
321,I also love this advice for realizing the sister needs professional psychiatric help and the current situation is enabling. 
322,"Then it's time to plan. You do have small children, and I get that the daycare is costly. It'll be costly once you leave as well. 

First, research financial abuse and any other kind you care to. This is atrocious behavior on his part. Tell your parents what he did. If someone stole a present I gave, you'd better believe I'd want to know. A freaking golf club! 

Get your support system together. ONLY people you can trust not to talk to him. Look into local resources. Start job hunting/updating your resume. Make a realistic budget. Change passwords including the the one here. Make sure your documents and IDs are safe. Open your own bank account with either paperless or a P.O. box and start squirreling money away. Talk to a lawyer when you're ready. If you have to play the long game here (waiting until 3yo is in preschool, for example), so be it. The point is to get out and stay safe. He is abusing and controlling you. "
323,"Hate to say it but based on this story and your comments, you husband sounds like a real abusive douche. "
324,[deleted]
325,"&gt;That she believes her and I are different and that we should learn to accept each other (??? I always have). 

 and 

&gt;Thing is, I approached her about this weeks ago - how her sense of humour, sarcasm, and perceived favoritism hurts me 

go together. That is what she was talking about when she was talking about accepting each other. You approached her about her behaviour, she approached you about yours. Both did not work so she wants to live and let live.

&gt;FYI - the day before, at a family get-together, I saw my brother in law working on his laptop. Thinking he was doing so because he felt uncomfortable (many of my family members speak another language, that he does not), I approached him and struck up a conversation

So did you actually ask if he was busy or did you just approach him and talked to him even though you saw him working? I find it incredibly rude if people just assume how I feel and proceed to ""help"" me. Yes I am enjoying the music, no I don't want company. Yes I would like to eat my food by myself. Yes I am working, that is why my laptop is right here."
326,"&gt;I found out the next day that my girlfriend and her friend had been previously had an extremely drunken conversation about exes who had cheated on them and how all guys couldn’t be trusted.

Well that's a red flag if I ever saw one. Your gf and her friend are toxic and have personal issues that will affect your relationship no matter how good of a bf you are. That would be a hard pass for me."
327,It sounds like he is passionate about ensuring that the property meets the platinum standards. Have you asked him what his “must haves” are in the house?
328,"Good grief. She’s clearly not well. 

Every time she mentions social media just end the conversation. And I would suggest that she see her doctor because this isn’t normal.
"
329,"sometimes people just come on here for reassurance that breaking up is okay, or they think someone will have the magic words to make their partner treat them right, or they come here to have other people reassure them that their relationship is fine(lol it rarely is). some people just don't have a good support system where they can ask for advice, and sometimes even with a good support system they won't explicitly say to break up with your partner because they don't to push you away. I hope I don't come across as snotty, I just wanted to offer another perspective :) "
330,[removed]
331,"I’m drunk so please excuse my tone. 

Okay, and?  You acknowledge a flaw in yourself that your BF appears to be exploiting. 

Either tell him to get his shit together or stop wondering why he does stupid, calloused things like this. Should he know better?  Yes. Absolutely. But the fact that you are excusing it by saying “I  things for those I love and this it happened so I guess there’s nothing I can do” is insane.

Have some self respect. Have some pride in who you are as a wonderful, sweet, and caring human being and find someone who isn’t a massive dipshit and won’t exploit your awesomeness. 

It’s not your fault he did this. It is your fault if you stay with him and he doesn’t realize what a complete selfish ass he was. He’s a ducking asshole and there’s no way around that. "
332,"&gt;I'm not saying the message shouldn't have hurt her. I would be hurt if I saw that on her phone. But I feel like we have some bigger issues. Like her snooping.

I wouldn't say her snooping is a bigger issue. At least not immediately. Don't get me wrong, her snooping is a massive issue. What drove her to snoop is an even bigger issue. 

But the way you talk about, you make it seem like you expect her to understand that your thoughts were NBD. Don't get me wrong, you should be able to vent to a friend. But her seeing those words, no matter how she came across them, and realizing you once felt that way is a serious thing. "
333,"Right, because you're not acting stupid. He's making you feel crazy. It's deliberate. He's using tactics against you. We don't use tactics against people we love, we use tactics against enemies.

I'm really sorry you're going through this. I know it's extremely painful right now. When you get free of him, little by little, your sanity will return. You will no longer feel so confused all the time. Right now, he's deliberately keeping you off balance so that you don't know which end is up. It's awful, it's gut-wrenching, it's confusing, you don't know where to turn. That's how abusers operate.

I wish you the best of luck in getting out of there. Once you're out of there, it will take some time, but you will develop clarity that you've been missing for these past few years. You will feel like you have awakened from a bad dream. The confusion, the anxiety, the knots in your gut, they'll be gone. It's so freeing."
334,[deleted]
335,Yes it was really damaged and matted so I wanted to cut it off and start over. I told him this but he’s having none of it. He said thing like “did you have to cut it that short?” I cut it to where my natural growth started and cut the matted hair off. I basically had no hair in the back before I cut it because it was that damaged. I just want his approval I didn’t want to make him mad.
336,"Don't seek revenge, don't contact her again.   Well, you know she's crazy.  She will only destroy you.  

Just let it go man."
337,"Yeah that was my conclusion too. Granted, he doesn’t mention her being a frequent user. But I’ve had a stoner phase and had stoner friends and being punctual took all of us a lot of effort haha 

But eventually you have to know when to get your tushy moving or take one puff and complete one task. "
338,"Yeah, look, a joke, oh let laugh has I ruin belongings. He teared apart a piece of the tissue. 

Don't forget those people are supposed to see patients naked, to go to their place for some. 

"
339,"No, you aren't over reacting. 

Your weight is irrelevant in this. The guy is either an idiot that doesn't understand basic manners, he was being rude on purpose,  or, all that's pretty much it.

The thigh thing could have been from working out, but the chin stuff was just a jerk move. Yeah, he's young, but that's just plain dumb. You could have a dozen chins, and a boyfriend should know better than to say it that way.

If he knows about the eating disorder, it's just extra rude and hurtful"
340,"You're never wrong for your boundaries. If it makes you uncomfortable, that's that. It doesnt matter if other people think it's great, what matters is how YOU feel about it, like with anything sexual.

For example, if he wanted to shit on your chest during sex would you ask others if you should let him do it? Some people like scat play. Only matters what YOU like when it comes to you.

The fact that he continues to do it when you tell him to stop is the disturbing part. Have a conversation with him about it."
341,"I reckon she has a “Why you’re not getting a second date” text message heading her way. Do it, man. Please. "
342,"This doesn't seem as simple  'laying off the social pressure' to me. This behavior to me sounds like very old ideas of women as property. When a daughter becomes a wife, she moves in with her husband's family and takes their last name, her children inherit his property, etc. This might just be a shot in the dark tho, these are obviously extremely old-fashioned views (at least from my perspective), to the point that I didn't really know they were still extant in the West in 2018. 

OP, is your family really traditional/religious? Has anything hinting at this come up until now?"
343,"&gt;  Make sure he doesn't have access to your birth control, you might even consider ""losing"" it and getting a new supply just in case.

Seconding this. Before I left my ex he started making ""jokes"" about messing with my birth control. Abusers will do anything to keep their claws in you."
344,"Your wife is in full-on self-destruct mode. The woman has clearly lost her goddamn mind.

Wow.  I would call that take naive but that doesn't really do justice to how horrifyingly blase/callous she is being about this.  You've gotten great advice (therapist, lawyer, and maybe another lawyer to help you interface with the investigation?, all ASAP).  Is there any chance you can schedule a sabbatical for any part of the upcoming academic year?  Getting the hell out of dodge for a bit might be a relief. "
346,"I think your safety is more important. He’s crazy unreasonable and perhaps just straight crazy, leave already "
347,Just tell the honest truth like you did here. Tell her you're not trying to call her a liar but you cannot see how it can be true. Even if it is true though you just said you really liked her when u were drink. Maybe u really liked her as a friend not a big deal. It's not like u cheated on her or anything.
348,"The VA payment thing is one of those weird things where it both makes sense - if it's really coming - or could be a major case of denial - which absolutely happens, too. So you need to figure out which it is and behave accordingly. 

It's fine for you to say, ""It's been so long with the VA payment that I'd like to start making a plan for if it doesn't show up. And if it does, well, that's a nice bonus!"""

350,"No way to really win with a narcissist except to set firm boundaries, and offer very little interaction and information. She's an expert manipulator. It's unrealistic to expect OP, who is not, to be able to navigate that kind of fuckery; it'll just turn back to her, and she'll be miserable and unsure of herself in the process. But most people can learn to say, ""No,"" ""I don't like that,"" and to reduce the flow of information going to a manipulative person. Since OP is already shy and uncomfortable around this person, then it's also an easier path for her, personally, to do that. 

They call one technique ""grey rocking."" You offer no surface for the manipulator to cling to, no information they can twist, and although it may seem passive, you avoid engaging whenever possible - because engaging is what gives people like this power. 

OP, if you're reading, my advice is to bluntly tell your boyfriend that you've decided you don't want to be around his sister because she is negative and manipulative, and that you don't want him to come back to you with criticisms straight from her mouth. Sounds like she's got a good hold on him and his other guy friends, and I'm guessing there's some other weird family dynamic at play here, too. She fits a classic profile of a jealous narcissist, which means her love is entirely conditional. If he doubts that, then I suggest her set a firm boundary with her (i.e. ""I don't want you to say negative things about my girlfriend anymore,"") and see how long it takes her to push it. 

He also just needs to get his head on straight, but that's often a gradual process when you've been manipulated for a long time, which he has. Like you said, he gets upset and then realizes that wait, he's *actually* happy and likes his life. I don't think it's a matter of him not respecting you, really. It's more like he can't see straight sometimes, and then he gets exhausted by the conflict (manipulative people are *very* good at creating conflict and then passing the blame for it onto others).  I realize it's upsetting, and you shouldn't have to tolerate it, of course, but this stuff happens all the time with in-laws. Seems like she recently overplayed her hand by straight-up lying to him about how his friends feel about you. I think that's worth a good, long conversation because that is abnormal behavior. 

One of the easiest ways to cut through manipulation is to work in terms of objectivity. Manipulative people live in a subjective world and they insist that others do, too. Maybe you can just ask him for objective examples when she fills his head with subjective trash. For example, if he says he's not getting to live the life he wants, say, ""Can you give me some examples of that?"" If he says ""she says my friends don't like you,"" you can respond, ""Wow, that's interesting. Which friends told you they don't like me, and why?"" It removes some of the emotional punch. "
351,"If your boyfriend is happy (for the most part), why can't he just tell her ""I'm happy, back off, what happens in my private life is my issue."" I would stop opening up to this SIL, don't go into personal things with her. Be kind but very short. The more you give her, the more she runs with this info in a negative way. 

Its like she thinks she's the judge of who's good enough for all of these men. If you aren't, nobody will be. Probably why they're all still single (she gets all the positive attention). Very immature for an almost 40 year old. "
352,This is less conflict avoidance and more sociopathic.  It is extremely worrying and a HUGE red flag.  Read up on non-criminal sociipath tendencies....

354,"&gt;“Your dad was a dumbass who pissed away your widowed mother’s safety net and that’s why I don’t believe in this crap”

That is your anger talking.  But, that message should be conveyed in a more sensible, fact-laden approach.  ""Your father attempted many of these same schemes and never made a single dollar.  He left your mother a destitute"".

It's important to have this conversation, even if it hurts your marriage in the short term.  If I were in your shoes, my biggest fear would not be him signing you up, but eventually taking up the cause himself -- either to prove the world wrong and his Dad right or as some crazy notion of it being the ""family business"".

Perhaps, now is a good time to start thinking about separate finances, too."
355,"&gt; make them see the situation more clearly

Yeah, that's the whole point of "" What has happened in your life that you think this is the best you can do?""

Suggesting a critical look at their choices and where they come from. Who someone loves and chooses to stay with is a product of their past and their expectations about the treatment and life they deserve. It doesn't come out of thin air and it's not unchangeable.

356,This is absolutely the right thing to do. No one can say for sure what type of delusions your wife is having but being evaluated will help you figure it out. 
357,"Ok, even better for you. Just avoid them hardcore until they leave. Hope that they break up eventually. If he or she ever brings up what happened with this guy **deny, deny, deny!!**

359,"Im sorry but it IS a little different for a significant other. If you are casual that's totally different but if you are serious that child is going to be in your life and to some extent your responsibility(think moving in together, etc.) The fact you are even around the child lends itself to you two being serious, so think long and hard about what you want for yourself and if you're ok with this other small  human in your life."

362,"What you are doing is childish.  It does not matter one bit why or how your father met and married this lady.  And you do not have the right to impose your immature feelings on the matter to your dad.

Your father is an adult.  And /u/fwooby_pwow is correct.  He began grieving the loss of your mother as soon as he knew she was terminal.  My husband has metastatic lung cancer...he has about 18-24 months left to live.  And I am already grieving his future loss.  And he has encouraged me to find someone to love me and for me to love as well.  I will always love my husband...been together 30 years.  But if I meet someone after his passing I know I have his blessing.  **And we have not discussed this with adult children at all.  It is not up to them how we handle things related to our marriage.**

Let your father be happy.  Distance yourself from your toxic mom's family.  They do not get to decide on your father's happiness either."
363,"Honestly it's not even that good of blackmail material though.

Yes it would be embarrassing but he wasn't doing anything *wrong* and it will be obvious from the footage the cameras are hidden and OP is unaware. "
364,"I mean, you snooped because you saw something suspicious, and your suspicions were confirmed. Snooping isn’t great, but I’d say it was warranted here, and he’s definitely doing something worse.

I think you’re downplaying his behaviour. It’s only “innocent” because the model isn’t reciprocating the flirting. She’s trying to be polite and steer conversation back to the fact he has a wife, while he’s literally saying he wants to travel the world with a model that isn’t you. "
365,He has a secret camera pointed at your bed and you don't think you have a reason to be angry?

372,"He's allowed to dislike your tattoo, but the constant barrage of criticism from him is completely unacceptable. No one has to find everything about anyone else attractive, but the fact that he is repeatedly bringing up your tattoo just to upset you is incredibly disrespectful to your feelings. Nowhere in your post do you mention any kind of thoughtful discussion or attempt at compromise on his behalf, so why does he keep bringing it up? Just to make you feel bad about something that makes you happy? It's childish and immature, and you should be upfront about shutting down his comments without JADEing. You got this tattoo because you wanted it, and it's not like his insults will magically make it disappear."

375,"He’s let you know that he is not comfortable being your friend. Respect that and don’t contact him again. You’ve only known him a few months, and something like this would be hard for even very close friends to recover from.

376,"It's fine to ask ONCE for her to come with you, but you kept badgering her and now still haven't done your laundry because what, she won't keep you company? Especially after she is already cleaning everything else behind you, maybe you should just have gone to do the laundry yourself. She's exhausted.

I also don't understand at all how an otherwise functioning adult can't figure out how to sweep, or wash dishes. Just take note of how she does it and do the same thing. And dishes you can SEE when there is dirt left on them."
377,Maybe he should have thought of that before he cheated and screwed with other peoples GPAs.
378,"Wow. You are completely justified in being upset with him and what he did was awful. I think you’re right in saying he was probably serious until you brought up the ridiculous of the situation. And even if he wasn’t serious, that behavior feels like it could be nearing abusive/emotionally manipulative. 

He liked making you upset. He liked hearing you get worked up while he could laugh it off knowing he was playing a “game” with your emotions. This would honestly be grounds for leaving someone imo. I’m so sorry he put you through this and I hope he matures and learns that this behavior is unacceptable but he may not have the capacity to. And you deserve someone who won’t treat you like this. "
379,This. If you won't do it for yourself. Do it for your kids. No child deserves to be in a home where their own mother doesn't love or care about them. 
380,"She sounds disengaged with you and family. Before you assume divorce will only hurt her financially, I would chat with a lawyer to get a more objective assessment.  You may want custody, etc, but may not end up there..,

I would also get some professional support. No matter what you choose to do, suicide as a solution, though in your past, indicates a red flag- depression or impulsivity or both. Neither of which are harbingers of good decision making in future times of stress, particularly in divorce situations where things may not go the way you want.  If control or lack of it gets under your skin- get that treated now. Best of peace. "

384,"Yeah, I love that whole concept that private school kids don't do drugs. Private school kids have the BEST drugs. And their parents vacation a lot, so they're home alone. They're smart enough not to have big parties, they just invite a bunch of friends over to do a lot of drugs. I mean, a lot of drugs. We are talking just massive, massive, massive quantities of drugs. I cannot overemphasize how many drugs these private school kids are doing.

Man I love private school kids. Such a great part of my childhood. I went to public school, all we could afford was shitty weed. My private school friends were where it was AT.  

Oh, and the reason they never got into trouble was because their parents were either cops, or lawyers, or friends with the cops, or politicians, or connected to politicians. It's not that they weren't doing anything wrong, it's that they were getting away with it. We just knew that Rob was a rapist so steer clear, and Shelly was a serious klepto, and nobody could leave their cocaine unattended around Michelle because she'd either do it all or steal it, and don't let Tom behind the wheel after he's had a bunch of drinks, because every time he wrecked his car his dad buys him a new one, but he still keeps wrecking cars. Just because they didn't get arrested didn't mean they weren't really bad influences.

Still, they could really get their hands on the best drugs. I'm a grown woman, and sometimes I can't even get my hands on drugs that good these days.

Sad to say, if I were a parent, I would send my kid to private school just so that I could meet their parents and score some of that incredible cocaine again. Us public school kids just couldn't afford it."

Do you have kids? If no, it is an easy decision. And I would personally tell his wife. You are sitting there being philosophical about what's the point of telling his wife? You won't get your wife back,right? But you would save another person from lies, deceit and sexually transmitted diseases. Isn't it enough to do a good deed? And some semblance of revenge which make you calm and maybe help get rid of anger. 

And you know your wife no longer loves you and respects you and all and any of your efforts. Maybe she did love you. But she is not that person anymore. Have you lost contact with any friends because they were not the same person ? And I don't think you will be the same person. This sort of experience should be cathartic. You won't be able to look her the same. You can't believe half the things she says.

Plus she will lose more respect for you if you forgive her. You set a precedent that she might get away with it. You set a precedent that it's okay to cheat on your wife with someone else's wife because she would be forgiven and you won't tell his wife because what's the point? Then there should not be any legal system if you keep on looking at it this way and utter chaos should rule. 

Go and talk to a lawyer. Record everything and plan on divorcing her. If you have kids, discuss custody and make sure you get the time with them that you deserve. Throw her out of the house or move into the guest bedroom/couch. Get her a STI test and get yourself tested. You never know who all the guy was fucking and what he carried. 

And best of luck. This is a tough time. But things will get better. You will see her for who she is. And she will always start looking once things start slowing down in your marriage. And things will slow down. Keep your head up because you did nothing wrong. Work on yourself and divorce her. 

Edit: Don't have sex with her and get her pregnant. She might end up getting pregnant once you file for divorce. Ask for a paternity leave test. Stay the hell away from anything which involves touching her. Even holding her hands or kissing. You never know what that might lead to."
387,"Then he clearly doesn’t possess the desire to aid his suffering, which is something that when depression is truly horrible, most people would give a limb to have access to.

He seems to be manipulating you with his mental health, which is not healthy."

Would you want to know?  This ""friend"" of yours is not really a friend. What she did is VERY disrespectful of you, your GF, and your relationship. This is someone that you need to distance yourself from if you care at all about the relationship that you are currently in. Again, would you feel comfortable with your GF wanting to remain friends with a guy that asked her for sex knowing that she was in a relationship with you? This is a no-brainer, OP. Of course you tell your GF and you let her know that you are distancing yourself from this person as she is disrespectful of your relationship.

397,"&gt;  I said he seems addicted but he says that you can't get addicted to weed. 

That is bullshit. Complete and utter bullshit. If you use a substance multiple times a day, everyday, at that price - you're dependent. It's all too easy to get psychologically dependent on weed, especially when you use it to cope or it becomes completely ingrained in your life. Yeah, it's rare to get to a point of being *physically* addicted to THC, but the physical addiction is the easy part of any addicts recovery. Physical addiction isn't the reason why ex smokers crave cigarettes years, hell decades after quitting. Physical withdrawel is not the reason why ex-substance abusers say ""Once an addict, always an addict"". 

THC restructures your brain like any other drug, longterm everyday use reprograms your brain, infiltrates your every habit (When I'm happy I celebrate with a joint, when I'm bored I have a joint, deep conversations = high on weed, when I can't sleep I need a joint and so on) until there's barely anything left in life that is not associated with weed. *That's* the hard part about addiction and it's all too real with weed. Responsible use is only possible when people are honest with themselves about that. 

Honestly, in my experience if someone is both smoking that much and doesn't even allow himself to think about the possibility of addiction because ""that isn't possible with weed"" already is in deep shit and still has a long way to pull himself out. If you think he's just okay, I don't think you'll want to deal with that.

&gt; Should I just go through with it since it'll only be for a couple of days? 

If you don't want to, no. Tell him now so he has time to find someone else to go with though. You didn't ask for this or plan it together, you don't owe him anything. If anything, then that he goes with someone who actually wants to be there.

Like me, I'm pretty rarely ""in the mood, give me sex now."" But once we start making out, getting into things, I enjoy it.

We'll stop, I'll usually help him finish up, and then we'll cuddle or whatever. But more often than not, once we get things going, then I'm in the mood. 

THAT is what people are talking about when they use that line. Not ""Well, I'm super not in the mood but my boyfriend doesn't respect me or thing of me as a human so I should just give in to being his human fleshlight whenever he wants to stick his dick in me for the 5 seconds he lasts.""

The process is different for us all. What others are saying is that your dad and mom were partners/best friends. He was grieving that loss as he was taking care of her through her illness. After his best friend/partner died, he had no one. Kids don't count in this situation. He was able to find happiness again and that is a good thing. You are making it sound like your dad should be miserable for as long as you say is ok. He still grieves for your mom everyday, it's just now he has someone to talk with to help him sort out his grief and feelings. You should be happy for him. Give him a break. It's been 2 years. "
416,"&gt; Is it fair to expect them to spend time with us if I've paid for the trip?

I mean, was any of this discussed with them ahead of time?  If not, you can't expect them to read your mind.  ""Hey, I want to fly you guys into town for a birthday, here's what's involved {list museum visits, hanging out, etc.}.. Are you interested?""

So yeah, it is fair to expect that if they agreed to it.  But if they didn't, then not really.

&gt; Carla's been talking about their plans and essentially ... it's just the two of them doing romantic vacation stuff. I kind of suggested I thought it was a bit rude for them to go off alone

They're about to be separated for 4 months!   Why would it be rude?  Again, is this something they agreed to and are now going back on their word?  Or  are they simply two lovers wanting to spend as much time as possible together before a long break apart?

417,"The owners of the house are apparently unaware that any rent is being charged

According to the lease she signed, OP didn't sign anything indicating there is rent  

&gt;The lease doesn't say anything about rent. I looked back at it and it basically says that we won't trash the house or move other people in. His parents didn't know about any of this, as far as I know.

The issue is that:

&gt;(I) was told that the total rent was $2k/month

The owners aren't indicating rent was due, the lease doesn't indicate that rent was due. The boyfriend told her that $2k / month is owed, which is a lie. Could he get the place rent-free from his parents and then rent to her for $1,000? Sure, I'd imagine so. But that's not indicated by what she was told or signed. He lied and admitted that he did so in order to put her money in savings to return to her. ~~That sounds pretty legally shady.~~

edit - but apparently from the minds in legaladvice, perfectly legal since what he intends to do with the rent is irrelevant. So OP is best off trying to get him to hand over the gift willingly before dumping him."
418,"True that the rent arrangement can be whatever the landlord wants. 

However, he has admitted that her $1k/month was not rent and actually a ""gift"" for her. And she was paying into his account, not his parents' (assuming the edit is true and the parents knew nothing about this), based on a deception."

422,"This guy's advice is about as on point as you can get. Though be careful, the point is that you need to focus on being cooler and more fun, somebody impressive and exciting to be around. The mistake you may be tempted to make is to be extra romantic and wine and dine her, trying to make her feel special. Doing that will actually lower your value because much like the out-of-league comment, it sets a precedent of her being better than you. 

That said, she's not stupid, she's not oblivious, she likes him too... Does that mean she's lost already? No, but it does mean she's looking towards the door, maybe walking towards it. 

Tip: next time she goes out to fun things like parties, go with her and be fun... Sitting at home, watching her instagram while you binge on mountain dew and fortnite, wearing your unwashed pajama pants is in no way going to get her gears going. That shirtless guy at the party making her laugh, that might..."

It leads with "" Aren’t there more important things to worry about? Is this really that big of a deal? Aren’t you being overly sensitive? Are you sure you’re being rational about this?"" and finishes with telling men to LISTEN to women instead of minimizing and dismissing our concerns about sexual violence."
424,"You still aren't getting it. It's not that having children is more important to her than who it was with, it's that actually being able to have children with someone who shares her values on having children is more important to her than *potentially* having future children with someone who doesn't share her values on having children."
425,"Considering the alternatives, you would probably regret not adopting your niece. 

If there's no one else to take her then you're looking at putting her into the foster care system once your grandmother can't care for her anymore. 

That seems like something you'd regret much more than the fact that life became more complicated by having her live with you. 

If you're worried about your marriage, though, then make sure to communicate with your partner to ensure that all parties agree to this and can handle the new challenges. This is a big ask. "
426,"It sounds like your boyfriend wasn't even remotely apologetic about violating your privacy or lying about it. If you forgive him now, he'll probably feel within his rights to do it again the next time he starts feeling insecure. 

I understand wanting to save the relationship because it's been so long, but you deserve respect from your partner. "
427,"I like this idea too! I think if I just tell them I’ll be making dinner on days x, y, and z, then I won’t worry about them planning for it etc. and I’ll have time to plan a menu.

431,"You are painting your wife as a controlling, unreasonable shrew in this thread and maybe that's true, but you are definitely off the mark here. Your wife losing someone she cared about, even someone from childhood, doesn't affect you and you don't see what kind of support you can offer?! If a friend of mine died, I would want my SO there to hold my hand, and to help me make small talk with people at the wake while I was grieving, etc. Obviously we would all rather go to a fun birthday party than a funeral. But choosing your mom's birthday party over your wife's friend's funeral sounds like the death knell for your marriage. "
432,"Please read this and absorb it:

**IT IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SORT YOUR MOTHER'S PROBLEMS OUT.**

&amp;#x200B;

Read it again.

&amp;#x200B;

**You do not owe her anything.** She does not get to tell you what you can and can't do with your own car. She is a liar and she is abusing you financially and emotionally. 

**She does not care about your wellbeing.** She does not care about your happiness. She does not care about the financial trouble she has put you in. She does not care about what you want. She is never going to care about you if that means putting her own wants or needs in second place.

**She is not down on her luck.** She has fucked up her life, and she has done that herself, and she is so selfish and so narcissistic that she has convinced herself that it's her teenage daughter who should carry the burden of the mistakes she has made.

**She is not going to change.**

That means that you have to be the one that changes if you want to have any shot at a life for yourself. Take your car, right now, and put it somewhere she does not have access to it. Put it in long-term airport parking if you have to. Then make some calls and find a therapist. Do it today. You are going to need professional support, at least in the beginning, to work through the conditioning that you've been subjected to. 

The fact that you even think there's a choice to be made here means that you're caught in the FOG. Fear. Obligation. Guilt. The three weapons of every manipulator. 

This is not going to go away. It is not going to get better on its own. She is going to escalate her behaviour until she gets her own way or is forced to give up. Please do not wait around on this - take action today. Go now. 

&amp;#x200B;"
433,"And now he's abusing it, lesson learned.

Break up before you get used to this behavior."
434,"Ahh oh my gosh I missed the five years later part. OP, rather than your girlfriend, maybe see an actual therapist to talk through things related to your ex. "
435,"She absolutely knew it was cheating. Otherwise, she would have told you she was planning to do it. And she certainly wouldn’t have hid it for you to discover only in texts. She knew that this was something you wanted to experience *together* with her. 

Bottom line is that she just didn’t care. She wanted to pursue this for herself. You were nothing more than a mere afterthought, and she knew trying to first get your consent or involvement could impede her own pleasure. So, she simply opted not to, figuring that you either wouldn’t find out, or that you’d forgive her if you did. 

Hard to ever have trust after someone does something like that to their spouse. "
436,"Chilling with my sister the night before her wedding was one of my favorite parts of her wedding, and she did the same with me. It’s not “just chilling.” It’s the brides last time to really reflect on her single life, to let out anything that’s stressing her, to really get emotional... it’s actually a really intimate and emotional night. My sister wasn’t nervous at all, so it was mostly just us doing the excited giggles all night and I loved it because it felt like when we were kids. I was more nervous before my wedding, so having her there helped calm me and she helped me focus on my love for my husband instead of my nerves about something going wrong. I don’t know what I’d have done if my sister didn’t just chill with me at my house the night before. "
437,"Right? I was expecting that maybe she *had* become overweight, which isn’t uncommon for students. But she’s still a very normal and healthy weight

Op, maybe take some time to consider why your boyfriend would treat you like this. 

I have dated similar guys - two of whom literally *offered to buy me boob jobs* because they wanted me to maintain my boob size while having size 00 stomach, arms, and legs.  All of this was while I was either at a slightly underweight or normal weight for my height, gender, and age. One ex specifically complained I was too skinny, so I gained some weight. Then he complained I was too soft in the stomach, so I lost weight. Then he complained my thighs weren’t “grab-able” enough for him. And I put up with it because I didn’t have any self worth and didn’t stand up for myself at the time. 

Men who want to control your body, and in particular when you’re otherwise happy and healthy, are no good. They’re trying to fit you into a box of what a woman ought to be all the time. If 5-10 pounds somehow makes you less of a woman or less desirable in his eyes, he’s an asshole and he doesn’t deserve you. You’d spend your whole life trying to fit within 5 pounds of his desired weight for you, and being criticized if you fail. Especially since your boyfriend addressed the topic in a particularly rude way. 

Don’t be like I was, OP.  You deserve a man who finds you sexy and respects your body regardless of your size. "
438,I think the issue is he is now jobless and having worked for his family he will need them as a reference for future employment 
439,Yes and the boyfriend's choices are his choices too. He chooses to associate with a disgusting person who treats his girlfriend poorly. 
440,Why does your boyfriend allow a person who punched one of his girlfriends to be around you?
441,"This.  This isn't ""cheating"" to me - it's breaking the law.  Cheating is looking at someone else's exams or looking things up on your phone or whatever.  But having a physical answer sheet of a past test was a no-no pre-internet, and hacking into someone else's computer (which is seen as the same as breaking into their residence) is illegal today.

Nevermind the fact that - illegal/immoral act aside - he didn't even offer to give OP the same leg up."
442,"I think you need to find a line of work that doesn't involve other people, somehow. You aren't ready to work. Leaving for 8 months puts your coworkers in a lurch (unless it's like 200 person call center type job). And, the most understanding person in the world is going to be aggravated that you needed 8 months for anxiety. 

I have PTSD. It fucking sucks. But, when I hit a point where work might not be possible, I take medication on those days. Trust me, there are meds that nuke anxiety to the ground. It has long been up to you to find that. And, if you are here, worried about a conversation, you haven't. Thus, you aren't ready to work. I think you should quit and find something more suitable. That, or become more aggressive with your care plan. "
443,"Yeah, I think this is a whole lot of nothing--he's known this woman for over half his life! If he wanted to try something with her, he would have. Sounds like he loves you, he just likes his de-facto SIL and is the type of guy who says lots of nice things (which is awesome!). Maybe he had a little crush on her at some point, but it sounds like the harmless meaningless kind if that.

I mean, obviously if you catch him writing love letters to her or something, that would be different, but I think you just had an irrational moment of panic--happens to everyone."
444,Acting rationally? Dude can't act at all. Please read Captain Awkward #1085. So similar. 
445,"Oh, dude. I grew up extremely poor, so I understand the practical difficulties, but you just need to leave immediately. There's no way around it. She's abusing your cats. She's threatened to hit your kids! She HIT YOU in front of your children! **She has guns in the house, flips out on a dime, and is clearly angry at you. You are putting your own and your kids' lives in danger every night you stay there.** This has really, really got to be your urgent priority. Get out however you can.

Edit: Sorry, I realize maybe that this came off as pretty harsh, but I'm really, really worried about you, OP. I've known people like this. It's domestic violence and it's escalating quickly. Please don't wait until Tuesday to figure out an exit plan. "
446,"I genuinely can’t believe that you saw an apartment where one of the two bedrooms didn’t even have *four complete walls* and you didn’t discuss whether either of you would be okay with taking that room before you signed the lease. Seriously?

Given how mind-bogglingly dumb that was, if this ends with you getting the decent bedroom for six months out of the year, I’d say you’re lucky. "
447,"If they wont make the effort to welcome you and integrate you, then this has no future. The onus is on THEM to help you fit in. And on HIM to ensure that happens."

450,"Google “types of abuse “ and read the following: 

Financial/Economic

Because abuse is about power and control, an abuser will use any means necessary to maintain that control, and often that includes finances. Whether it is controlling all of the budgeting in the household and not letting the survivor have access to their own bank accounts or spending money, or opening credit cards and running up debts in the survivor’s name, or simply not letting the survivor have a job and earn their own money, this type of abuse is often a big reason why someone is unable to leave an abusive relationship.

She is using money to control you. Tbh your family probably already knows and is waiting for you to make the decision to leave so they don’t risk alienating you further. I understand how it feels when you’re in an abusive situation and it feels like your pride is the only thing you have left, but that’s incorrect. You have the entirety of your future left and you just have to ride the short term discomfort of making that phone call and getting out of there. It’s never going to get better if you stay."
451,"Your husband needs to start putting his foot down.

""Stop talking about my wife like that, or I will no longer speak to you.""

Also, what a horrible situation.  I'm so sorry you've had to go through all this AND have people be terrible to you about it."
452,"Is he taking any medication or seeking therapy? If not, he needs to be. If so, then clearly something isn’t working properly and needs to be addressed properly."
453,I feel that this response is underrated. It's important to know how to navigate the social aspect of work. 
454,"&gt; I don’t even know if I wanna tell him since it really has zero relevance to the present.

Honestly, the fact that you're thinking this tells me you're still not mature enough for marriage.

There's no way to sugar coat this: it's a big deal. He might even leave you because of it. If it were me, I'd have a hard time deciding, not because of the previous marriage or even the timing, but because waiting this long to say anything about it would make it very hard to trust that you'd be telling the whole story, as well as make me question what else you will hide from me in the future. And if I somehow found out that you were considering just never telling me, that would make the decision much easier.

Edit: To add some advice, just tell him. There's no easy or magical way that will make this ok. Just tell him and answer any questions he has honestly, then give him his space to figure it out. And going forward, don't get engaged to someone you're hiding such a big secret from."
455,"Then tell your parents how invasive he really is. Parents don’t want their kids married to someone who will make them miserable. As for trying for a baby? DON’T! Stop having sex with him. It will not get better with time, and getting married/having a child will not fix anything. If anything you will have a harder time leaving him, and that’s exactly what he wants. You are miserable, leave him and block him he instant you break up and live with your parents 

Edit: Also, if you have a child with him, do you want your child to grow up thinking how you’re treated is ok? Do you want your son to grow to be as abusive as his father, and treat his partners like crap? Do you want your daughter to have an abusive partner that might kill her because she thought it was normal? "
456,That’s awful I’m so sorry. He needs individual therapy. His unhealthy attachment to his toy is getting in the way of his marriage and causing him emotional stress. He likely has some deeply rooted issues with sexualizing women and some madonna/whore complex issues just based off of you mentioning him being so chaste with you
457,It actually feels that way sometimes.
458,"I would be interested in how they split the chores. I think your guess is right on the money here, since child care still falls statistically speaking very much on the women. 

Other than that it's weird that he can't talk to his wife about it calmly. Chore distribution aside, she wants to work and his problem seems more to be her choice of job. I think OP has a communication problem and may be dismissive of what his wife wants ( 'mall is for teens'). "
459,"&gt; b) when they have no sort of underlying issues at all, and are just tired/worn out, and I think there's starting to be some backlash/resentment around those kinds of usages.


Can I ask why? I'm kind of curious about how the backlash and resentment builds, but I have no underlying issues, so I want to understand better from that perspective. I personally feel like if a theory helps someone communicate better - whether it's about an issue or just about daily life - it's useful. But again, I'm not coming from a community that has issues, so maybe that's not the right way to look at it."
460,I see the exact opposite. I see her as a manipulative person who demands her husband not go see his family. She creates drama when ever she is forced to go. She didn't even want to let him go to them *alone*. 
461,"Based on the rest of your post it really, really sounds like he changed it so he could confuse and blame you. Google Gaslighting. Hell, watch the movie the term comes from..."
462,"&gt; he thinks OP’s family is beneath him.

He thinks /u/mybfisentitled is beneath him, this is the power dynamic of the relationship. I bet he hasn't said it out loud yet but he's thinking it. "
463,"|hes cold, distant, very short with me, has a temper, shows no affection, and does not sleep with me.

Guilty as charged.

He has a pattern with women that is going to be near impossible to break on his own and will bring it into the marriage. 

I would tell him you’re rescinding the engagement. Don’t engage in conflict or debate with him. Just let him express himself and evaluate his response. That will tell you everything."
464,Time for him to invest in catheters and adult diapers for sure.
465,"&gt; One emergency = normal, two= odd, three= highly suspicious

I've adopted a general rule of thumb across all layers of my life:

* Once - an anomaly
* Twice - a coincidence
* Three times - a pattern

When something happens a first time don't worry about it, when something happens a second time take note, but when something happens a third time accept that that's probably what you can expect to happen a lot more."
466,"Move on. I'm not going to judge him, I don't know him, but you're not talking about waiting 6 months. You're talking decades. 

You're not going to be remotely the same person in a few years, let alone 20+

467,"Stop apologising. What, you're sorry for looking after your friend? You're sorry that he couldn't just say what he was doing instead of dragging it out? Yeah, if I lost a few hundred dollars, I'd be a little upset, but I'd get over it when I realised the other person was helping someone who needed it at that time. But, really, all this doesn't matter because this...

""He said that kind of shit happens to loads of people, it wasn't such a big deal.""

Is all you need to know about the type of person he is. Seriously, do you want to be with that? "
468,"I think those priorities are like, things you need to be responsible for and make sure to look after. Your husband shouldn't really be too high on that"
469,I think you have the wrong perspective on this. Forget about what boyfriend said. What he did was ditch you. He may have some problems that he was unable to verbalize. Personally I wouldn't bother trying to figure out what those are and resolve them. You just got disrespected big time. The right response is to dump this fool. Otherwise you are never going to gain his respect. Overreacting? You are severely underreacting here.

472,"This is the right answer. It is just who he is. You can't make someone want to have sex more often. You can do all the therapy you want, but it will do very little if anything. You need to accept him and accept your sex life or leave to someone better suited."
473,"My in-laws wouldn't let us share a room when I stayed over until we were married, even though they were well aware we lived together for 3 years before we got married. They are conservative in that sense and I am not. If I were you, I'd just keep quiet and let them get over it. It is 100% on your boyfriend so it's good he ""took the blame"". I'm sure they're a little uncomfortable but it's really not your issue. Just lay low for a while and next time you come over (after giving them some time to move on first) don't mention it and make sure it doesn't happen again. It's not that big of a fuck up, there are a lot worse things that could have happened. If it makes you feel better, I think my MIL heard us having sex one night while we were still dating. I'm sure she was very uncomfortable, but she just had to move on. We're all good now."
474,"You are dating a racist. This is not about his family, your boyfriend HIMSELF is racist, and I can't really figure out why you're with him."
475,"This sounds kind of like a 'you' problem? Unless she's making you feel pressured to spend more time with her than you want to, this is all in YOUR head that she's ""twiddling her thumbs"".

478,"He crossed a line. He will hit you next time. He can say sorry all he wants, but the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. 

Maybe he did not actually lay hands on you but he definitely got physical. Not letting you walk away from an argument and following you to scream at you? Getting in your face and threatening you? That is abuse, 100%. And you don't deserve that. Get out now before it gets worse."
479,"Sounds like he's trying to gaslight you by saying you're the one who's being dramatic but you actually have valid points. He's going away with her, to a very romantic spot, and had the option to bring you but didn't consult you and said YOU'LL be the distraction. He sounds a little fishy to me."
480,"It has already changed it, unfortunately. His immediate and noticeable change in approach and focus means he wants to escalate the sexual dynamic between you. That isn't bad per se, though I would warn you: he screencaps, I wouldn't send him anything too racy as that can come back to haunt you.

It isn't a compliment. It is him pushing an agenda. That he made you believe it wasn't a major intent of his for a long time says plenty. That doesn't mean your chats weren't real, it just means he has liked you as more than 'pretend' for a while now."
481,"Right? The fact that two people showed up instead of one makes me think that they had something planned for the fake tinder girl they thought they were meeting with
"
482,"Real talk:  You both sound immature and like you would benefit from some ""me time"" to grow as individuals. "
483,"Instead of worrying about your friend body shamed your boyfriend, you are reading into this as cheating. Have you ever tried supporting him through the ordeal? Have you ever thought that he is still insecure about not meeting your best friend looking shabby because she might be rude again. Did you talk to her that it is not fun to make jokes on your boyfriend? Do you ever think about what is best for him? Are you always this self centred and insecure? 

""My friend and bf blushed at a party. They must be fucking."" What sort of gross imagination is that?Have you and another male blushed at the same time? Was it because you were fucking him?

Your friend is an asshole. Jumping to the boyfriend's insecurity. It's great he took it positively and moved ahead. Others won't have taken it so well and might have become depressed or self conscious.

Go and fucking talk to your boyfriend and try to understand his perspective and stop being a self centred .. "
484,"Basically you wouldn't be notifying him that you're pregnant with his kid.  You'd be notifying him to tell him you're undergoing a medical procedure.  And that's none of his business.  If you absolutely feel like you have to tell him, then tell him after it's over.  He can make your life miserable if he doesn't believe in abortion."
485,"The answer probably depends on whether this is a transition to wearing makeup all the time. 

If it's just an occasional thing, then I wouldn't worry. Your boy doesn't need to be dressing for your gaze all the time, so long as he is sometimes. 

Then again, if the fact that he sometimes wears makeup makes him less attractive for you even when he has a bare face, that's more of an issue. 
"
486,"You are repeating an unhealthy relationship pattern. It makes me wonder what your relationship with your parents/primary caregivers is like. I see that you've vaguely mentioned childhood trauma, but that you have had your girlfriend meet your parents, and fairly early at that.

Three months is around when the glow starts to dissipate and you see each other as real human beings, flaws and all, and you can't coast any longer on chemistry - you have to start putting in work. That's when the relationship really starts, in my opinion. When you attach, and you risk getting hurt. 

Yes, you did get into a serious relationship again way too soon after your previous, abusive, relationship ended. That doesn't necessarily mean anything, but it makes having a healthy relationship with this girlfriend a little harder than it has to be. 

This is good, meaty stuff to take to therapy. "
487,"I would argue that BPD is a severe stretch- I was much like Eve during my teen years. Quick to outbursts of rage, followed by tears. Things just set me off really quickly. 

What no one in my family knew was that I was suffering long-lasting, undiagnosed depression which was causing me to be quick to anger/agitation. Once when I was so annoyed at my younger sister for talking too much, I took a water bottle and poured it over her head- in public. 

It’s worth counseling and a trip to their practitioner to get help for her, but this definitely needs to be handled super gently. "
488,I wish I could get my one friend to understand this. Being in an unhappy marriage definitely does not benefit the kids.
489,"break up with him or at least start distancing yourself. If he’s not attracted to girls his age, what do you think will happen when you start visibly aging? "

Don't feel pressure to engage if you're not ready. Your brother took years to change his mind; you're allowed time to consider how you feel.

Be on the lookout for warning signs, like if he asks for money or favors very quickly. 

Don't rush into a relationship even if you decide to go forward. He's biologically related to you, but in most ways he's a stranger to you. Get to know him as if you were getting to know any person not related.

If it were my brother, I wouldn't hold it against him too much. He was only 19, practically a kid himself, and I'm sure he found the situation a little strange and confusing. Also, speaking from personal experience, my perspective and values have shifted a great deal since my late teens (in my thirties now). I reflect on some of the decisions I made at his age (and yours) and wish I'd chosen differently. That's just a part of growing up. He's considerably older now with a family of his own that could be informing his change of heart."

499,"I recommend you contact instagram and let them know your account was compromised and tampered with, they may be able to undo the damage. Also, change all your passwords and have a very, very clear discussion about how his behaviour is beyond unacceptable and you will not be giving him access to your social media any more. 

On your end, don’t use it around him and stop messaging random guys on social media apps when you’re in a relationship. If you want/need the attention, that’s another issue within your relationship. These guys aren’t your friends, they’re thirsty dudes on the internet and you say yourself that you’re flirting with them. It’s fair for him to take issue with that, though the extent he takes it to does sound pretty jealous/possessive and this may be an area where you guys aren’t compatible. It is absolutely not okay for him to interfere with your business. If he’s not okay with the way you interact with guys online and you aren’t willing to stop for him, you need to go your separate ways. "
500,Don't stay with someone because you're afraid of being alone
501,"&gt; But I could do a lot with 20k and I know myself and it would make me resentful to give it to anyone else. I would not give 20k, or any money really, to my own siblings.

She didn't respond to me, but she posted this somewhere else. This is how she views her own siblings, so I guess is not shocking she doesn't have basic sympathy for her fiance's sister and has no desire to compromise. I don't understand someone being this cold or selfish and I would definitely not marry them. Idk."
502,"Mmm, okay, so that is an outright lie. But I also think it's pretty benign. You may not like hearing this, but lots of people (I'd venture to say most) have similar information on their resumes, especially when they're young and just starting their careers. Claiming to have worked for a family business while you were still a teenager is a pretty low-grade lie in the grand scheme of things, and given the widespread insistence on only hiring people with work experience they can't gain if no one will give them a chance, I also think it's justifiable.

This is kind of the game of the working world. It doesn't operate by rigid moral principles. It operates by ""what I can get away with"" principles, and prioritizing yourself and stacking the deck in your favor is a *strategy,* not a sign of moral turpitude. If you don't have your own best interests at heart, nobody will. Corporations certainly won't. To them, you're a potential source of revenue, nothing more.

You may find you have to be a little more flexible with your ethics to get your foot in the door."
503,"Tell them if you're hungover and not 100% you could kill someone. Since your friends aren't nurses/medical professionals so if they go into work a bit tired and hungover the biggest mistake they could make is probably not life threatening, whereas for you there is multiple instances in the day where your actions could lead to something really serious. They need to understand this. Also if they really want to see you they should try be accommodating sometimes and organise a hangout that's not partying all night, maybe you could all go out to dinner and they can continue the night while you head home for a good sleep? "

505,"That's honestly the reason I couldn't be a SAHM. As you said, it's a huge leap of trust. I'm sure you're happy though, I just think a lot of women (and sometimes men) don't realise what it means to not be the breadwinner."
506,"I am sure that your intentions are good but it is one thing to long for your immediate family, especially your own parents, to make an effort to see how he is doing and actually care about his life and it is an entirely different thing to have someone you are not particularily close to to be prying into personal subjects. Its essentially an invasion of space to an introverted person.. You feel me? He may have moments that he just doesnt want to go there and he may have moments where he is a little more open. 

I would be a little less direct and cornering. You can drop hints and keep it short though you should also give him the chance to lead the conversation.

Edit : this is coming from a person who very much hates small talk, who has an intense, strong impulse to help and understand people's psyche and over the years has had to find my own coping mechanisms for dealing with this and to also.deal with, i guess youd call it...rejection?? Which is basically to really hold back and channel this energy into other ways (volunteering/leading support groups, making friends who are likeminded)  To learn to not take this personally and respect those who do not want to ""go there"" with me."
507,"You can choose to break up for any reason - and a lack of integrity and honesty is a pretty good reason.

On another note, you might want to check if this has any implications for your own academic integrity? i.e. do you have a responsibility to report it if you know that someone else is cheating? There's a high chance the university will find out anyway, and it wouldn't be great if he dragged you in as an accomplice or something because he offered to share the files with you."

510,"Yeah I think the issue is OP has been conditioned to see her as his sister and not his mom. I don't think it's ever going to change at this point, unless the two of them put in a lot of work to change the relationship dynamic. The therapy session is probably more for her to cope with the reality that she's always going to be more of a sister to him than his mother."
511,You need to flat out tell them that their behavior is hurting you and ask if that is their intention.

Anyway it doesn't really matter the specifics. If you're not comfortable with her making this lovelife/social life division, then that's totally reasonable. As her partner it's natural to not want to be excluded. I would tell her how you feel about it, and if she won't compromise on this then you guys might just not be compatible."

People who play with other people's emotions and sense of self-esteem like that are not worth your time. Just break it off and block him everywhere so that he can't worm his way back into your affections.

531,"It sounds like the logistics of the break up are a big consideration for you.  I urge you to just rip off the bandaid.  Your lives are going to get more and more interwoven as the next 12 months progresses.  It’s not like you won’t continue to book trips together or plan events in advance - and if you start pulling back it will be way more prolonged and hurtful to him than if you were just straight with him.  

Talk to him soon.  Like tonight if you can.  You really sound like you’ve made your mind up and every day you wait you’re preventing him from finding his sport loving, road raging, mature houmoured girl!  It’s terribly hard AND the most generous thing to do for him."
532,"As I was reading this, I literally thought for a second it was myself and my wife.(ex: she likes heavy metal and gaming too!). That being said, we are both extremely different in the ways you said. We have been together for 9 years and still love each others differences. 
The reason I bring this up is that I don’t think it’s the fact that you’re “too different”. It’s the way he is handling the differences. He does not seem very tolerant to any of them(tattoos, cats, etc). While on the other hand, you are very tolerant to his. 
All in all, I would not move in with him. At least not until you two have come to a mutual understanding. If he can’t learn to compromise more and give up more, then I would leave. 
Good luck! And please don’t let this stop you from dating “different” people in the future. "
533,"Have you considered telling her this, honestly but kindly?"
534,"I consider myself very open minded. I think everyone’s sexuality is different and that most couples should embrace that. There are times when even someone’s wildest dreams should absolutely be considered in order to further strengthen a marriage. 

This is not one of those times. 

First of all, I’m stressed just thinking about how he probably doesn’t disinfect it enough and it’s covered in germs. Ugh fucking gross

Also, I’m ashamed to say it because this is so judgmental of me, but I see this as pathetic. He’s skipping sex with his wife for a grimey old doll???? Why can’t he buy a fucking flesh light like a normal person. Idk man this seems too creepy and off to me. He compared it to your CHILDHOOD TEDDYBEAR. I think he is emotionally invested in this doll and if you took it away (do not recommend) he would be devastated 

I would have waltzed the heck out of there the day I found out. Because I’m a quitter and I’m not ashamed of that.

But this isn’t about me. If you want to resolve this, you need to find a way to get him to see and understand the problem here.

You want sex. He is keeping his boner to himself and is relying on a doll. 

Your only real solutions are to seek couples counseling with someone who is sex positive. If that doesn’t work after a solid 6 months... :( 

I’m very sorry you’re going through this!

536,"You might want to get to the bottom of exactly why your wife feels this way about your family.  Ask her calmy but straightforward to explain why she feels the way she does about your family.  Ask her to provide examples of any perceived wrongdoing on their part.  If you have excluded yourself from important family events in the past because of her, this could be a good time to figure out why she feels the way she does so that bridges can be mended."

This is a very telling window into your boyfriend's character, dont ignore it."
539,"That one line is the most annoying thing. He should either never go if that’s the rule or bring his gf. This woman is acting like an insane mother in law. Sadly, this doesn’t bode well for the relationship. "
540,"Amen.  This isn't just a depression thing.  This is a ghost of negligent parenting.  Sometimes you have to get in your kids' ass about their shitty hygiene habits; doesn't seem like anyone did that for this guy, and OP is left holding the bill.  Barf."
541,Lmao move across the country and forget to say 'bye'. 
542,"Look, I can easily believe that he regrets losing the comfort and security of being in a relationship with you. I can believe that he loves you. But the fact of the matter is that nowhere in this ""explanation"" did he explain *why* he did this - why he suddenly, out-of-the-blue decided that the *only* solution to his ennui was to ""take a break"" from the relationship in another city. *That's* the explanation you need and that's the one he didn't give you. Your subconscious is trying to tell you that if you take him back this is going to happen again, because he won't or can't articulate what triggered it the first time. Even if he loves you, that doesn't mean he's ready to be in a relationship. "
543,"Um, your boyfriend is an ass who has *decided* to feel attacked when you communicate really, basic human expectations to him. No amount of tact will save you when someone *wants* to take offence and be an ass. 

So, I say forget about tact. Be clear to be kind. State clearly and calmly the results of his choices:

There will be no sex.
There will be no other real physical closeness.
The relationship will suffer, and eventually, probably die. 

This is ""your business"" at this point because his choices are seriously damaging the relationship. 

Sure, he can keep on choosing not to shower. He does have that freedom, but that choice has already had consequences and may have far worse ones.  

Once you've shared this very serious and utterly true message, pivot to mental health: Is he okay? Does he need help? Because this is a serious problem not just for the relationship -- it's going to impact the rest of his life as well. If this is feeling overwhelming or causing anger or frustration for him, then he needs to speak to a therapist. "
544,"Yeah not sure how much work you would get if anyone found out their lawyer(if you go that way) had a boyfriend in jail for heroin, I would definitely stay far far far away from you thinking you clearly can’t make good decisions for yourself much less me as your client.  "

549,"You sound like me a few years ago. Also from the North, also went to a uni full of posh people. A few things I've learned:

1) Don't be afraid to ask questions. There will definitely be people at these events that have been (or still are!) in your position. You can make it a topic if conversation (telling people I learned how to use fancy cutlery by watching Titanic usually got a laugh). 

2) There's no need to change. You deserve to be there just as much as everybody else, and probably more as you didn't have the same start in life as they did.

3) They're more scared of you than you are of them. If they're the bad kind of posh, you're winning by just being there. If they're the good kind of posh, they'll be ashamed to make you feel out of place and work to make you feel included.

Good luck OP and congratulations on everything you've achieved!"
550,that line stucked out to me too. sounds like his brother finally grew some spine and stopped financially enabling him. still shitty that he broke his promise but lets not pretend that OP lost anything here. seems like OP did not contribute a cent to it and will get a year of free housing.

3.) YOUR MONEY. I really hope you guys have seperate bank accounts if hes this controlling over $12. 
4.) He's willing to fight over $12, hes not mature. I dont wanna jump the ""dump him"" bus (I have my ticket though) because I don't know the rest of your relationship but he's being an unreasonable tightwad. Put your foot down that you will spend your money how you want without a peep from him or you can just take your money elsewhere. "

You told her to come to dinner with you...

You told her to stop being jealous and crazy...

This made me uncomfortable to read. You sound very controlling.

"
557,"Dude, honestly after reading this me, my fiancé, and my sister all agreed you were at fault. 

It’s a piece of paper that you’ll never use and you could’ve just told her what it was instead of being so passive. Also you wanted to cancel something because she did her makeup a bit longer than she needed to? 

Dude grow up and take some blame (or most of the blame because everything you said sounded like your fault) . You’re 24. 

You dated someone who was younger, yet you expect her to act your age. "

561,"It was absolutely not ok for your son to abuse your cat and it's very concerning to me how your husband brushed it off. Malcom needed to be taught that hurting animals is NOT ok. 

The words your husband used were not ok either, while tensions were high and the situation could have been handled better, ultimately he brushed off abuse and tried to frame it as no big deal. That's extremely concerning."
562,"The compassionate and remorseful response to one’s girlfriend saying “I got scared when you yelled at me and raised your hand to hit me” is “oh my god, I’m so sorry, I’m going to work on never doing that again.” An abuser’s response is “you made me do it, if you hadn’t done X, Y, and Z, then I wouldn’t have needed to yell at you, and you wouldn’t have made me angry enough to hit you.” 

Which of those responses is closest to what your boyfriend said? 

Which of those responses is what you want in your life?

And just to be clear, you deserve the first one (the apology and *him* working on fixing things). I don’t care what you said or did, no one deserves to be afraid their partner will hit them. No one. He should never have said/done those things, and he should be apologizing and correcting his behavior. You have nothing to be sorry for. "
563,"Well, write them a nice letter explaining your thoughts on it, apologize and make it clear you will pay them back not because you must but because you respect their help in those times.

566,I honestly doubt he even has the money anymore :(
567,"Yeah, the comments about ""doing your own thing"" ARE correct... But I think are a little off-track here. Is his gf REALLY that oblivious? We can't say for sure. But everything this Ian guy is doing are not innocuous and she needs to be told directly by OP and create an action plan with him. If she doesn't follow it or continues to feign ignorance, then... :/"
568,"While I don’t condone her ghosting you, it isn’t mature and it isn’t being a good friend...I think sometimes married people with children don’t get how hard it is to be the single friend. It can be hard and lonely to see all your friends having everything you want but you are still very much alone without your person. Especially as you move into your mid 30s.  We usually have to work around everyone’s schedules and always have to be understanding of I can’t because my kids, I can’t because my husband etc etc it’s life and it is what it is but sometimes it can get to you. 

To add on to all that she’s probably still grieving the abortion since you said it put her in a tailspin. There is no time limit on grief. And being asked to watch your kids, alone possibly could have been a trigger. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this because a rift in a friendship is difficult and sad, but I’d say to give her space. Send her a text to let her know you love her and are there for her when she’s ready. "
569,"It seems so odd to do this especially if the household is already dysfunctional, which probably causes the younger brother to be introverted as a defense mechanism (if you don’t say anything you avoid confrontation) what kind of person “experiments” on their sibling? "
570,"Your POV is understandable, but it isn't physically possible for her if she wants kids (and, it sounds like, ideally biological kids). If in a couple years you decide you're still not ready, maybe even want to break up, she needs to find a new partner *fast*.

What she told you was not insensitive, it's a fact of life. She can't afford to wait for the perfect situation for biological reasons.

&gt; this recent shift in our relationship I'm starting to doubt whether we are even compatible for having kids together.

Your recent shift is due to realizing how badly she wants commitment and kids. If you're ready, then your doubts evaporate. If you're not ready, then you need to break up so that she can find a partner who is."
571,"You better have hit her with the ""I think I just fell head over heels for you""."
572,This exactly. I really think this sums it up so perfectly. 
573,"Yeah, nah. She's not ready "
574,"Yeah, this post rings a lot of bells with me as I'm in a very similar position to OP. My parents, especially my mother, have seemingly forgotten I exist. I have been dealing with a fractured leg for over a year now...every now and then mum asks if there's anything she can do to help and I say yes, please I'd love her to come round, bring my brother to help with the garden. She says sure. Then it never happens. She's even arranged days to come round and then on the day will text and say she's ""busy"".

Sure I could go and see her but it would take about four hours and £££ on public transport, plus me carting my crutches around. She can drive here in an hour.

People are telling OP that maybe it's her fault but...having experienced it myself, some parents just don't have anything to do with their kids once they're gone. "
575,"I agree with this. I also want to note that you will never be able to collect the $12,000 from her."
576,This is a super crummy situation and probably calls for some whisky but I'd recommend putting your phone away for the night before you start drinking. You got this!!! Just take care of yourself :) 
577,"She cheated. Plain and simple. She's feels no remorse and she plans on doing it again right in front of your face. 

How are you possibly still talking to her? GTFO. Now. 

There's nothing else to say. "
578,"My belief is that if you’re at the point that you feel you need to spy/snoop/stalk, the trust is already gone and you should break up anyways.

Since you’ve already done it though, and found guilty behaviour, just call the relationship off. Don’t waste any more time on this.
"
579,I agree. A lot of people are pointing out that you said you don’t feel ready to be a single parent. Who does? Nobody plans on losing their spouse or significant other when they’re trying to have kids. Keep in mind you could have lost your husband 2 months after giving birth. There was an age difference and you still could’ve ended up a single mom a little further down the road. He would’ve been in his 60s by the time the child turned 15. Personally I think this is fear speaking through grief. A lot of big changes at one time can be scary. Speak to a therapist so you can sort out your feelings first. Whatever you choose make sure you won’t regret or resent it.
580,"Your internal, emotional reaction was 100% understandable and valid. 20 hours is a chunk of work. It sucks to have all that time and effort just...gone. If it was a drawing with personal meaning, this is all the more true. You can and should be angry about his carelessness, and about your ruined work, and about those hours of your life, and about his poor handling of the situation.

However, your external, verbal reaction was not okay. Screaming at someone is not great, though it's understandable if it slips out before you can catch hold of yourself and your emotions. But to *keep it up*, and to *escalate*, tells me that you were punishing him for his carelessness - not merely expressing feeling upset. Someone who made a mistake without malice, and who immediately apologized and wanted to help, does not deserve to be treated that way. 

I'm a writer and music composer. My wife is an artist. I'm an amateur, she's a professional. Both of us have lost our progress on pieces of work with similar numbers of hours as you had in your drawing. I can relate with you, both firsthand and from the outside looking in, on how that feels. It's an awful feeling; one that can even make me physically ill. But I can confidently state that neither I nor my wife have ever screamed and berated anyone, much less each other, at length over it. Your relationships with the people you love and respect are - should be - more important than artwork that you can presumably recreate.

But your boyfriend doesn't get off scot-free, either.

Like you, his internal, emotional reactions were totally understandable and appropriate. His immediate reaction was to feel terrible and remorseful (apologizing), then to feel compelled to try to help (picking up the drawing), then to feel embarrassed by the consequences of his actions (you screaming at him), then to worry that other people would hear how you screaming at him and crying and think the worst (eg, think he's abusing you and call the cops), then to feel frustrated with the situation because nothing he is doing is helping, and finally to be frustrated with you because you seem to be beyond consoling or reasoning over a ruined drawing. No red flags that I see in his emotional processing.

But, also like you, his external, verbal reaction was not acceptable. He has been with you long enough that he should know that you don't touch an artist's work without asking and without invitation. He should know that *of course* you're going to be upset by what happened and he needs to accept the consequences gracefully - no, he didn't mean to do it, but he also didn't take the necessary  precautions to *not* do it. Worse still, when it became obvious that you weren't having a momentary emotional outburst, but rather were throwing a full-on tantrum, he threw gasoline on the fire by telling you to calm down and insisting you were being ""batshit crazy."" He had the opportunity to try to defuse you or - at the very least - leave the situation without further exacerbating it, but chose instead to be unkind and demanding. He **must** learn to do better than all of that.

At the end of the day, this is an opportunity for you both to grow as individuals and as a couple. 

You can forgive him for ruining your drawing and for making a bad situation worse, or you can establish a precedent of resentment and anger for him to fear from you for any mistake he makes. You can acknowledge and apologize that your reaction was disproportionate and disrespectful, or you can send the message that you are more interested in extracting the pound of flesh you think you're entitled to than in being a loving partner. 

He can acknowledge and apologize for being careless with both your art and your feelings, or he can show you that he thinks it's more important for him to not have to feel bad about doing something wrong than to respect your work and validate your emotions. He can forgive you for escalating the situation and lashing out at him, or he can bear a grudge for a situation he could have prevented in the first place.

It's up to you guys, but this doesn't have to end poorly."

582,"Maybe this hurts because there is some truth to their criticisms. Think about ways to meet them halfway conversationally. 

At the same time, seek out friends and groups who you have more in common with, like you could join a political club or volunteer on a campaign."
583,"Years ago, I went to therapy with an abusive ex. (Unfortunately I’d never heard the advice not to.) I can attest that it was a nightmare. We only went to one session. A lot of my energy in the session was invested in trying not to anger him; but I was still trying to be open and honest with our therapist. 

My ex became increasingly agitated and hostile, interrupted, and accused me of “trying to turn (the therapist) against him.” The therapist was having none of it and actually set boundaries. Eventually, my ex stormed out, leaving me sobbing alone. The therapist gently informed me that I was welcome to come back, but the dynamic with my ex was toxic and my ex could not come back. 

When I got home, my ex flipped on me. He spent the next several weeks blaming and guilt-tripping me for “demonizing” him in therapy, and doing the wounded-animal act abusers sometimes do when it was very “oh woe, you’ve wounded me to the core.” I regretted every second that we’d gone to therapy and wished we’d never done it.

In the end, it just became one more thing he gaslit me over and used against me. 

No healthy therapy is possible with an abuser, because they’re not actually interested in changing. They just want to retain their control. And if the therapist sees through it (as many do) and doesn’t allow them to impose their worldview on the therapy, they will go off the rails. "
584,"I'm guessing they don't have any actual work to do? Jeez... these are 50 year old men, you say?"
585,"Sorry but your father is a homophobic sexist immature person. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. Be proud of yourself and embrace your new haircut. It's very fortunate that your mom is on your side, so just ignore him.

When you get older, you need to have your own set of values even if it doesn't align with your father's. It will be worse then, but it's life, unless you want to live your life according to his will."
586,"&gt; “having lunch” turned into going to brewery with her and her friends for a couple of hours (1 guy and 1 girl)

Sounds like he went on a double date lol, I wonder if his other friends know he has a gf"
587,"If he’s at a point where he’s asking you to change how you present yourself and where you go on your own time out of fear of you getting approached, then you’re in marriage counseling territory. A guy who doesn’t at least *suspect* that his wife will leave him for the right offer doesn’t ask her to do these things. If he doesn’t want to turn into the controlling grump husband, he’ll start calling counselors *now*. "
588,"Buy a lab grown diamond. Chemically it's exactly the same as a natural one, but they're cheaper and also not blood diamonds."
589,Please post an update when they show up at your house. 
590,He has a toddler tantrum over a haircut and then has the hide to call YOU emotional??!? Zero self awareness on his part 😂😂
591,Well people usually write when really bad things are happening in their relationship and they've been gaslighted and can't see it from a neutral position that they're in something abusive or unhealthy. 
592,They sound rude and unwelcoming. I'd stop visiting.
593,Does he not even understand that metrosexual is a term used to describe men who take pride in their grooming? It doesn’t even apply to girls! Your dad seems pretty confused about how things work in general.
594,"Find out how much a maid costs. Tell them that since they are lazy as fuck, they’re going to pitch in for maid service and tell them how much their portion of the cost is. They’d probably rather pitch in an extra 20$/week than get off their asses to help. "
595,Exactly what I though. Some people have really toxic family and it's nothing against the partner if anything they're protecting them
596,I’m going to disagree with most comments here and guess that it’s at least partially the bag. It’s very unsexual and not many 24-year olds are going to grit their teeth and go for it. She probably just doesn’t want to hurt your feelings. 
597,Women are not projects or prizes. The view you view them is really unsettling. Are you in any kind of therapy?
598,"Eh, it's only been a year, I'd leave."
599,"OP, please don't listen to the rude assholes calling you dramatic or whatever. Your feelings are valid and some people are just jackasses and shouldn't be in advice subreddits."
600,"Agreed, this post made it seem like this has been going on their whole relationship. "
601,"""I get it -- guys follow porn stars and models. It's normal""
Umm.... No."

603,"It does sound odd. What contraception you use? There's no chance he could be tampering with it is there?

EDIT: To answer your question, I do think you should ask him why he went straight to that question. It's not unreasonable to speak your mind about this."
604,I'll second this &amp; say weird stuff goes on with women after they have babies (I have 2 little ones myself). A therapist may help your wife to see if any of that stuff is secretly affecting her.
605,You have posted here a couple of times. Every time people tell you he is abusive and you should leave. Are you going to listen to people who answer your questions?
606,"You're talking to someone who loves cooking and perfecting recipes and showing off - if my partner said, ""Surprise me,"" then complained about dinner? They'd be surprised with divorce papers :))))))) "
607,"&gt; My personal life and my professional life are not intertwined.

You’re being naive and delusional. Not surprising when you are 19 and have never had any professional experience whatsoever. Take it from someone who has, yes your personal life and relationships do impact on your professional life and reputation. If you think you can make a career as a lawyer with an incarcerated drug felon as a partner, you’re in for a rude shock. "
608,"I was about to say to the OP, why are you, a woman, friends with a redpiller??  It makes no sense. No one should be friends with redpillers - they are human flaming garbage. "
609,Listen. I had a gut turning feeling before heading out to get food to cook for dinner. I told my boyfriend at the time bye from our patio. I went to the bedroom. Looked through the blinds over his shoulders and saw him texting his ex. I caught my ex with my own 2 eyes texting with his ex. By the time I came back to the patio to tell him what I saw he deleted the text. He denied it for almost 2 hours. I told him over and over and over again. My eyes don't lie. You can tell the truth or leave. He finally caved. They will lie and sound believable. Don't trust them. Trust the truth. 
610,"I’ve worked in a small industry for 10 years. Turns out that quite a few people think that me with long blonde weave 5 years ago, and me with short dark hair now are 2 different people with the same name. Have a conversation along the lines of “Did you ever work with the other xxxxx? every few months. Favourite was being told “yeah, she was such a bitch!”"
611,"Oh honey no. I smoke weed and while my husband would like to indulge, he can’t because of work so I don’t smoke around him. He loves chewing tobacco but I find it really gross, so he does t do it around me. When you truly someone you take these simple measures to make them more comfortable. "
612,"Topshop clothes are to trendy for this. You need classic so when you go back to uni go into the posher shops like LK Bennett, Reiss etc and try and stuff. Take photos of the names of the dresses you like on the labels or website and then hunt them down on Ebay for a bargain knowing they fit after trying them on. Avoid anything patterned or memorable. It shows re-wearing where black does not. Dry clean them not machine wash and cover them when storing even with a binliner poked through with the hanger. It stops them looking worn fast. Do the same with a decent coat.

Keep your shoes clean and polished if suitable as this adds a very groomed look and make sure they are heeled and soled and not super worn down. Again you can buy cheaper shoes and prolong their life this way. Keep them plain and subtle. No character on the clothes if you have little cash and keep your brows neat but not scouse brow) and your hair well kept even if it's just well conditioned and a simple cut. No roots. This makes anything you wear look neater and posher.

Watch what other people do first and see if you can find any army/navy types to guide you. They do lots of officer balls and learn crazy etiquette shit that way and pass it on happily.

also stay authentic. If you grwe up Northern, don't try to be all Made in Chelsea. It won't work. go for the best mannered version of yourself such as please and thank you inc thank you letters or emails, eat with your mouth closed, don't shovel food down like it's your last supper, divert the conversation back to the other person if it gets awkward like they ask your holiday plans and theirs are Tuscany and yours are Dewsbury and say neutral but open ended things like 'oh where you there for that heatwave?'

Also try to learn small facts about things likely to come up in conversation such as the uni, Dean, town you live in, the Govt minister for your subject, football team, anything you can deflect with if you don't know what to do. Have a 'oh my plantar fascitis' type excuse if they expect you to know formal dancing (where do posh folk learn this?)

Don't swear too much and keep it off the c-word. Southerners are *weird* about it. Ask questions in an interested way if you want to learn college etiquette (I'm guesing Oxbridge or Russell Group) and befriend the porters and staff to help you out. Learn how to laugh stuff off instead of show embarrassment but feel free to mark the card of anyone who shames you because they have no manners if they do.

Good manners and etiquette are about making other people feel comfortable not being an expert in fish knives. But a basic etiquette guide on cutlery and glassware will help. Look online and practise the knife and fork stuff at home to get comfortable.

I learned all this coming from Ireland to high end uni and high end sex work where I discovered Irish middle class is considered barely housetrained to proper posh people. I learned what was needed and allowed my difference to be noticeable and I stood out amongst the sea of Sophies in a good way. My accent and different background ending up helping me not blend in and gain chances.

But it was stressful faking it til I made it. I bought a lot of old school etiquette books in second hand shops, practised small talk, smiled a lot and got so good at sourcing second hand and bargains I opened my own business after a while. I did not keep in touch with the Surrey set who thought they were a cut above me but I did learn a lot from properly mannered people who made me feel welcome.

Turns out hospitality is hospitality no matter what social class you are from and that shines through. But do not be ashamed of you. You worked damned hard to get here compared to some people who got it all on a plate and do not let anyone put you down now. I got to my Russell Group uni the hard way and I was fucked if any Rupert was going to shame me especially when it turned out their private education had nothing to do with intellect and mainly money.

Someone from a 20k a year priave school once said 'what a beautiful accent, where is is it from?' I replied 'Northern Ireland'. And they said in all seriousness 'oh what part of Wales is that in?' I never felt inferior in my hand me down dresses again..."
613,"Well if he's actually a red-piller, doesn't that sort of preclude him from even being able to have a respectful friendship with women?"
614,Just because he grabbed your butt doesn't mean he wants to fuck you. It's also a sign of intimacy and just being close to you. Stop putting so much pressure on the guy. I feel bad for him
615,Yeah it's ok to insult people if you're friends....
616,Yep agreed completely. The phone was a mistake. The meeting was straight up betrayal.
617,"Nah I think that would be an extremely unnatural response actually. If somebody accused my cousin of something and I provide cast iron evidence it isn't true, I'd say the onus is on them to try and explain what's going on."
618,"Let her go. 

Right now, she is reacting with denial and anger. Once she gets through these emotions, the remorse and groveling will come. Even then, let her go. Do not let her pull the “I just said I was moving out in the heat of the moment!” She already said it. Keep her to it. 

Regarding the wife, gosh. I would really want to know about this. 

You are so so young. 6 years! A lot has happened in 6 years. Spread your wings a bit, my dude. "
619,[removed]
620,"I would be kind hurt if my partner wanted to go across the world with his friend and not me. I also would be annoyed to have to deal with the kids alone. 

But she can't tell you not to go because that's not really fair. She's in a tough spot. "
621,Are you sure there isn’t already a camera in your room?
622,"I still think you shouldn't go. There's no guarantee with traffic, and even if you travel a lot, 5 hours in a car (best case scenario) is a lot the day before a big event, and you won't be able to be 100% for your sister. "
623,"Your husband needs to learn that different people deal with things differently.  Maybe the past weights HIM down, but it doesn't weigh YOU down.

I'd be having less conversations with him about the boxes of stuff, and start turning them toward his behavior and how he treats you.

""I don't talk down to you about your coping methods and way you see things, and I'd appreciate you not talking to me like I'm an idiot that you need to teach out to live."""
624,You need to give her space and respect her relationship. What if you were her boyfriend? Consider having to cut it off if you truly don’t want to interfere in her relationship. 
625,Your experience has also been supported by a lot of studies.  
626,"&gt; It can’t record

This is categorically incorrect. If it's feeding into a live stream, it can be recorded if you're even a little bit tech savvy."
627,"Bingo. There are many people who grew up in such circumstances that have to make a similar choice between learning to swim and drowning. Learning to swim doesn’t mean that the person who threw you into the deep end gets the credit if you grow up to be Michael Phelps. Any idiot can neglect a child. But it takes resilience and cunning to take that trauma and use it to thrive. 

My dad was similar to OP. Super toxic and volatile home life. He threw himself into school as his ticket out of there and wound up very successful as a result. I had a much easier childhood than he did, and yeah, I’m probably not going to rise as high in life without that fire under my ass. But that does *not* mean that I envy what my dad went through or that I’d trade lives with him in return for a higher-paying job. And it certainly didn’t make him treat me the way he was treated in an attempt to motivate us. No one is “grateful” for abuse. But succeeding in *spite* of it is something to be proud of. "
628,Not much needs to be said after this.
629,"By your age you should *definitely* be able to read his actions. He liked the sexual tension and flirting and now that it’s been broken he’s not interested anymore. Don’t let the occasional forced-cheer texts fool you. You can see the writing on the wall. 

Drop him. He’s shown you what he is. He’s never gonna give you the satisfying conflict-resolving conversation that you’re after. And if you’ve been paying attention, you don’t actually need it."
630,"I know you’re in schock right now, but you should at least consider pressing charges. What he’s done is a huge violation of your rights as well as your relationship. Like, your partner, who you’re supposed to be able to trust, did this to you. "
631,"How do people like this even make it to 60 living in the modern world? She sounds exhausting. Treat this as a lesson for you rather than a learning opportunity for her, because she’s not going to change now. Based on my experience with these types, confronting her will only lead to much weirder issues at work. Let it go as best as you can and absolutely do not get together with her again if you can help it."
632,He prioritized his desire to wank off higher than your physical safety and emotional well being. He was being completely manipulative and immature. Don't move in with guy. You will regret it.
633,"I had surgery Wednesday and have been recovering at home since then. My husband took off work to take care of me. Even though I am able to walk around and do some things myself, it’s nice to have him here to help with things and keep me comfortable. Yesterday he went to the store to pick up some pain meds and Gatorade for me, and he returned with a bouquet of flowers too. He put them in a vase on the coffee table so I can look at them while laying on the couch all day. He’s also just being so sweet and caring- which he is all the time anyway, but even more so right now. Even though I feel gross and look like a mess, he keeps telling me I’m beautiful and how much he loves me. He keeps my water cup filled all day, and asks if I need anything probably every 30 minutes. He lays close to me and holds my hand, because right now that’s the closest we can get to cuddling.

It’s not a super romantic time, but feels very intimate. He’s my best friend and I know he truly wants to take care of me. Also, he keeps making me laugh because that’s just who he is, but it’s uncomfortable to laugh so I keep telling him to stop being funny. Then he apologizes and it makes us laugh even more. "
634,"Oof.

Well. Good luck dude. I’m sorry she’s stonewalling you over something this sensitive. That’s often the death knell of a relationship. If you manage to pull a happy marriage out of this mess, write a book, you’ll make a killing. "
635,Just wanted to say this is an amazing comment and thank you for taking the time to write it. Know you helped at least one person today x
636,"Option 1 - quit. If this wasn't the family business you would quit. So you can still do that, just tell them and don't show up for work anymore. I don't think that would make a difference on whether or not you will own it one day. Do they expect you to work there until they retire? Just explain your reasons CALMLY so as not to damage your relationship with your family.

Option 2 - because it's your family business and you will own it one day, you want to make it work better. Talk to your parents and explain to them that you would like to be more involved in management, since one day you will inherit this business and you want it to be in good shape. Then, if they accept, you can make some decisions like firing someone.

If you pick option 1 or your family doesn't accept for you to get involved in management, take it like any other job and don't get upset about things that are out of your control. The same goes for the 30$ tip. It may not be fair, but from the customer's point of view, it's 100% normal to tip your waitress."
637,It wouldn't be *throwing* away a friendship.It would rather be getting rid of someone toxic and who doesn't take responsibility of their actions and put the blame on you. 
638,"I’m getting married on Saturday and FWIW I would be very hurt if my sister told me she wanted to leave the night before my wedding to go to a show 2.5 hours away. Not to mention what if something happens and the car breaks down, etc., and you don’t make it back? I wouldn’t even ask her. This is a once in a lifetime event for her. "
639,"&gt; Men seek friendships with women they're attracted to almost exclusively.

That's a pretty bold claim with no evidence.  My personal experience as a dude with female friends disagrees with your statement, but I'm not going to do something silly and say that my experience applies to all men.  "

642,"You need a lawyer IMMEDIATELY. Screenshot all those messages, back them up, and get a formal custody arrangement in place. It's not alright for you to be going through this, and it's going to be terrible for your son to be caught in such a toxic dynamic. The only way to 'handle' this situation is with the legal authorities so that you can put an end to it for once and for all. "
643,He’s probably trying to set up a threesome lmao

645,"Try separating the accounts. I find the best success is with each person contributing to a joint account while maintaining separate accounts as well. All joint expenses come from the joint account (rent, food, dates, etc.) where personal spending (fun money, individual bills) come from that person’s personal account. It allows you to work together on budgeting and saving together, but also enjoying spending your own money how you choose. 

Without knowing your girlfriend, it could be as innocent as not realizing how much she is spending a month. By having her return to only spending her own money, she could make that realization quick and cut back. I would say if she’s resistant to improving her spending habits and being tighter with her budget, you’re in for some financial struggles. Finances is one of those relationship killers so it would be hard to have a good relationship if you two can’t get on the same page. 

Sit down with her, show her the bank statements and highlight her spending vs yours and compare it to your contributions. Based on her reaction, you’ll know what to do. Good luck!"
646,"I think, don't quote me or anything, but I think if you were to have the baby, he/she would get surviver social security benefits through Charles. Just something else to consider. Good luck on whatever you decide."
647,"Yeah, I was never ever the party type, and I wouldn't have done well dating a guy who was.

So I found a fellow homebody, married him at 20, and we've lived in Netflix and countryside bliss ever since. 

It really is all about finding someone with a compatible outlook on life."
648,I've started to wonder the same thing. :( 
649,"I think it was very irresponsible to move in with someone without having had this conversation first. 

He isn’t wrong for feeling the way he does, but you’re not wrong for wanting a partner who helps you and wants to be involved with your children. You two are incompatible. There is no way to build a family with his attitude. This would honestly be a deal breaker for me. "
650,"OP, you have to turn them in. They have the entire semester's exams. They're going to tank the grades of the entire class. That's not right."
651,But I feel like in your early twenties you have to be a bit self absorbed - otherwise you get plenty of regrets later. She made the best call for sure.

653,"Good god your family drama is totally exhausting! 

I've only been reading 5 minutes and no wonder you quit FB."
654,"Alright guys, only took 23 minutes, but I get it. I think I was trying to be her 3rd parent, rather than the older brother she should want to go to when she needs help. I'll simply tell her that I'm gifting her this laptop, and that she can always come talk to me whenever she needs help with school or life. Thank you Reddit for seeing the error in my ways.

EDIT: *Helping me see the error in my ways*"
655,"Definitely!  This is a stalker situation in the making.  He may or may not be on the spectrum and unable to read signals but he also may be mentally ill.  There are lots of cases of the stalker acting out more and more and becoming violent or menacing.  Please nip this in the bud as quickly as you can.  If they won't act on your behalf, you may have to leave your job.  Sad to say but your safety is important."
656,"Exactly. What’s really concerning is that he’s spending the whole weekend with a friend but you don’t even know enough about his friends for him to tell you which one. Do y’all not talk? I can’t imagine my bf doing a weekend long going away thing and *not* asking which friend it is, and honestly being included bc you should be friends with your s/o’s friends. "
657,"Why is he still your boyfriend? Honest question. There is nothing in your post that makes any sense why you would have even started to date him, let alone continued doing so. "
658,"Girl you don’t have to apologize and you don’t have to grow it out. It’s YOUR hair and afros are beautiful. Stay strong, The only one being in the wrong here is your father."
659,"Dude, stop putting yourself down. You're not a fucking idiot. And had you not tripped, you two wouldn't have interacted. 

You're smart, you have beautiful blue eyes, and you were able to move past your insecurities in a positive way rather than doubling down on them, which implies to me that you have a decent amount of emotional maturity. Plus your personally and your looks attracted your girlfriend.

Acknowledge your strengths, own your awkwardnesses, and work on your weaknesses. But stop putting yourself down, that's not going to do anything but make you miserable. "
660,You have what is colloquially known as ‘a douche’ 
661,"Something similar happened to me, except it took me a few months to leave. I realized, then, those months I spent moving on weren't for nothing and how I regarded him changed greatly. I thought we could pick up where we left off, but his annoying habits were phenomenally more annoying, lost a lot of respect for him, etc. "
662,"Why don't you just have a Thanksgiving in your own home? Cook the smallest turkey you can find, you can have some of everything and he can have the sides or some ham. Eat and freeze the rest for leftovers. Invite people if you can/want.

If that doesn't work for you two, tell him that you're fine with not going to these SIL's family but you want to celebrate Thanksgiving one way or another. Ask him to find a solution *together*. 

You're trying to force him to spend Thanksgiving with people he doesn't want to spend too much time with, and it's not even because you care about these people. It's just because you want to eat turkey on Thanksgiving and see them as you're only opportunity to do so. "
663,You are leading him on. You're treating him poorly by telling him you aren't interested in him romantically and then continuing to flirt and hookup and cuddle. You need to make a decision about him and either date or let him off the hook 
664,"You yourself said in your original post that your fiance had a rough childhood, listed how difficult things were for him, because of his mother. It makes so much sense that he'd like to provide a better young-adulthood for his sister, by having a safe place for her to live while she works on a degree. If his sister were even to take him up on his offer {she might prefer to live on-campus, if she chooses to attend college at all}, we're talking about  something seven years in the future. I don't think he's asking for too much. He sounds kind-hearted and loyal. 

So what are these ""other ways"" you've suggested of handling the situation?  "
665,I’m seeing this sentiment a lot on this thread and have never heard this before. I’m curious to learn more? I was close to convincing an abusive ex to go to therapy with me and now I’m wondering if not going was a blessing in disguise. How does therapy help abusers refine their abuse?
666,"I'm sorry that someone/some group is targeting you and I'm sorry that your boyfriend is so immature.

I've gotten vicious prank calls and I've been phone-stalked. I would never believe what some anonymous person said to me on the phone and I would block any number that was making the calls until it stopped. It is entirely unfair for your boyfriend to blame you for what sound like bizarre and harassing phonecalls."
667,"Says everything I came here to say, but way more eloquently.

Edited to add: 

&gt;I am very in tune and sensitive to other people and when other people are not honest with me and I can't get a read on them it seriously messes with my head.

This is my favourite bit.  So, so in tune with other people that he didn't notice that she was apparently faking her entire personality for the first year.  She must be some actor. "
668,"And Elly was *in her own bloody house*. I'm horrendously short sighted and used to wear big thick glasses. If someone had pulled them off in, like, a dark pub I'd have been freaked out. In my own home? C'mon. Elly sounds heinously spoiled."
669,That's a binary choice you just pulled out of your ass 
670,This right here OP. It will be 10x easier to leave her now and figure out all the logistics than to do it in 5 years when you're married and have combined finances. Not to mention it'll save you a boat load of money.
671,"I bet if you talked to her, she wouldn't want to spend two weeks away from you and doesn't understand why you would want to spend two weeks away from her.  She's hurt emotionally but logically sees that she is just not getting your POV so she is not saying anything.  "
672,"If he left his phone and snuck out before you woke up, it sounds like he was maybe trying to run an errand to surprise you with. Pick up some breakfast supplies? Some flowers? Something like that? And it sounds like he seriously mistimed how long that would take lol. If he was planning to go anywhere for a long time he probably would have taken his phone.

 I've tried to sneak out to do the same before, especially in a new relationship when I was trying to impress the person, (though I made sure my errands would take 20 mins max lol)

But keep us posted on what happens!"
673,"This sounds annoying and corny as fuck to me and if someone did it to me I'd laugh in their face. If it seems sweet/fun to you (instead of exhausting and weird), go for it."
674,"Yep it sounds like she’s so desperate for full time work that she’s indiscriminately sending the same resume everywhere. She needs to tailor both her resume and her cover letter to each specific job.

On her resume, she should emphasize the experience that is relevant to the position. Her cover letter should talk about the specifics of the job and why she is a good fit.

I’ve been a hiring manager and it’s obvious when people are just sending the same resume and cover letter everywhere. We want people who have really thought about the position and what they could bring to the role.

She needs to be more selective and spend more time on her applications."
675,"&gt; It could be that maybe he didn't want to go to this brunch anyway, and the call five minutes before was a perfect reason to get out of it.

I don't think this would make his behaviour any more acceptable."
676,"Yeah he comes off as the genuine worst. Entitled, hippocritical, hurtful, classist, and just plain rude. Like in my head he has one of those sneering posh British accents and he's casting withering shade because they don't have solid gold salad forks before he blows his nose on a rhino leather handkerchief lined with condor feathers. Which his mother bought him.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this guy OP? Your family sounds fucking great. Find someone like your Dad who understands that worth is earned."
677,Then I don't think you have anything to worry about in regards to them; your sister will probably look ridiculous to them for trying to shame you about this. 
678,"Alternatively, someone who is mature enough to know that adults have sex, it's a small world, and sometimes you just have to shrug a little, laugh a little, and move on. Becoming enraged, guilt-tripping her, and making this out to be *her fault* when she did nothing wrong is not the sign of a mature person, which explains why a 32 y/o dated a 20 y/o. "
679,Don’t wanna be blunt but fuck that. She cheated on you it’s as simple as that 
680,It sounds like older sister takes after their mother more than OP realized.  
681,Really! I would consider a funeral an exception to that. It's not like it's meant to be a social event so much as a way for people who knew the individual to grieve. The new girl didn't even know the deceased right? I know I definitely​ wouldn't take offence.
682,"If he did that, and she told them, then THAT would reflect poorly on his character. It comes off as a threat or trying to influence testimony."
683,"This seems to be something people do when they want to belittle your familial (or other) relationships. He’s essentially saying: She’s not your sister, she’s just your half sister (as if that makes her less than). 


I’ve seen people do this a lot when families have adoptive children. They’re not your “children”, they’re your “adoptive children”. They’re not your siblings, they’re your “adoptive siblings”. 


I would definitely talk to him and let him know that he’s belittling your relationships with your family. Half or not, they’re your siblings. And he needs to acknowledge that. I personally would never introduce my siblings to my SO if he didn’t see them with the same “status” that I did. "
684,"He could be a child of divorce, and toxically socialized by one parent or the other to see his own half siblings or a family member’s this way.

I only bring this up because my daughter has 2 half brother’s, my stepson’s, and their Mom is insistent on referring to their sister in this way to them.

Yes, she’s a toxic B- - -h.  And I never refer to them as her half brothers, just her brothers.  

Not an excuse, just possibly a reason he may think this this way.  It’s definitely wrong and unacceptable no matter the reason."
685,"I somewhat agree with what people are commenting in the sense of you sending out this list before anything had happened. I totally get being worried about things that may happen with family when they get baby rabies, but I would have waited until something a bit more concrete had displayed itself before politely reminding people that it's your baby, your rules.

Saying that, the way your mother reacted is not normal. Being a bit upset that you've been sent a list of rules for your own grandchild is acceptable. You'd maybe take it on the chin since this is your daughter's first baby and her head will be running wild, or you ask her why she felt the need to send something like that the next time you see her. You *do not* block your daughter and go behind her back to tell her partner that she is mentally ill. It seems like projection of the highest order that she's convinced herself that there is a mental issue at play."
686,"Knock offs aren’t as well made, obviously. If anyone ever tries to get their item repaired, it’s going to be much more humiliating for your wife, it will come out eventually. "
687,This. If it's a case of mistaken identity that blew out of proportion at least the friends would be able to confirm that someone did grab her.
688,"Yes on the new dress if you have the money to do so.

Primark clothes are great for day to day but they are very obviously from Primark.
Something classic with an appropriate hem and neckline that can be trotted out at multiple occasions will ensure you get your money’s worth and something you’ve spent a little more on will definitely hold up longer than Primark clothes (which I find useless after a couple of washes).

You don’t need to go full designer obviously, but something from the higher end of the high street.

Edit: Debretts are the traditional go-to for British etiquette, their courses are horrendously expensive mostly but you will find plenty of free articles online. "
689,"Basically, why you got fired is for Bad Acting. What you are asking us for advice on how is to become a better Actress in a professional environment.

Looking back upon my career and education, and this office world, I wish I would have gotten a Drama degree. Instead, I have looked to role models, or certain characters on TV or in movies, to copy.

My advise is to think of your model for acting in an office environment, and copy their demeanor and what they would do in such situation. Then do what they do."
690,"I don't care who you are: there's no reason to feel guilty about what you're attracted to.  As long as you're not a jerk about it, and you don't go out of your way to say things that might hurt other people, you have every right to feel the way you feel.

There's no straight-forward answer to this issue.  You and your partner need to find a way to balance his need for self-expression with your need to feel physically attracted to him, if that's possible.  No one here can tell you what will work for you as a couple, or what your relationship can handle.

What I can say is that there's nothing wrong with you or your boyfriend.  You're two people who happen to have some conflicting preferences.  That's all.

​"
691,"Google ""gaslighting"". You're correct that you are 100% being manipulated.

Your husband is trying to emotionally manipulate you so that everything (EVERYTHING) is your fault. Even having to deal with the insurance people on the phone = somehow your fault. 

&gt;In its milder forms, gaslighting creates a subtle, but inequitable, power dynamic in a relationship, with the gaslightee subjected to the gaslighter’s unreasonable, rather than fact-based, scrutiny, judgment, or micro-aggression. At its worst, pathological gaslighting constitutes a severe form of mind-control and psychological abuse."
692,"It's not about whether she can DICTATE what OP does. It's whether she has a right to be upset if OP, her bridesmaid, decides to do something that will leave her tired on the day of the wedding. I wouldn't say no, but I would be upset because a comedy gig is going to end around midnight, OP will get home at 2:30 am, will be in bed by 3, and then is going to have to wake up by 7 or 8 the next morning to start preparing for the wedding. And yes, that's how early bridesmaids generally have to wake up to make sure everyone has time to get prepared before the wedding starts. Unless OP is superhuman, she's going to look, feel, and act tired all day, and not exactly be 100% for the responsibilities she signed up for when she agreed to be part of the wedding party."
693,"Have you seen the paperwork? Like you said, IUD failure rates are so minute for this not to be hella suspicious."
694,"I don't care how much someone drinks, that's not an excuse. She's been wanting him for awhile and she went for it. She's not your friend. You tell her you know what she did and that you never want to see her again. "
695,"&gt; OP if I found my roommate put cameras in my bedroom (!!!) and pointing INTO THE SHOWER (!!!!!) I would have called the police, not just confronted them. 

Yeah, Op is being way too calm about this. "
696,"You absolutely did the right thing. I was in a similar situation with a very close friend - who was actually the only friend who stuck by me through my own long and drawn-out escape from an (emotionally and mentally) abusive relationship with an addict (booze, drugs, sex).

When she first started confiding in me  and turning to me about his violence, I tried to provide a safe refuge for her to turn to. For a year or so I carried the weight of knowing I was the only person who knew and who she could be honest with, before finally confiding in my new boyfriend and another close friend. I made a promise to my boyfriend that I would put my own safety first. 

I lived less than half a mile from her, and one evening I had a call from her - when I answered she couldn't even speak she was crying so much. I managed to establish that she was in her way to mine, and ran out to find her. She was round the corner, absolutely hysterical and her face was all smashed in. This was the first time he had hit her anywhere visible. 

She agreed to leave him, I took a couple of days off work and helped her find a women's refuge. I had to deal with her family - her brother is a policeman, and didn't know anything about their violent episodes. I helped her call the police to report it and start the process of pressing charges. I went back with her to collect some stuff from her house (ding ding - BIG mistake!!) and he was there.

It got ugly real fast - he tried to pin her down, was throwing stuff at her, both of them screaming and shouting. For a split second I tried to separate them but quickly realised it was way more than I could handle - he was a steroid taking gym goer so very fast and very strong. I noped the fuck out of there and rang the police from the street. I waited at the end of the street until the police arrived, and then went back home to wait for them to drop her off. They arrested him and helped her collect some stuff. 

Anyway, to cut a long story short she was back with him less than a month later (while still living in the dv shelter no less!!!!) and I cut all ties with both of them and a few other people. We had one final conversation where I asked her point blank if she was back with him, and she said yes. I asked her to imagine that the scene of violence had gone differently- what would she have done if a stray punch hit me and put me in hospital? Well, her response was ""you can't help who you love"". 

I didn't even have to give a formal statement in the end as she didnt proceed with pressing any charges. 

Trying to support a friend through something like this is so so tough. I ended up moving to another city to live with my boyfriend after this as I felt so uncomfortable that this guy knew where I lived AND knew that I called the police. You have to look after yourself - you 100% need to put yourself first.

My friend finally got out about 18 months later, after he punched her in the back so hard that he caused permanent nerve damage. She has had to have two spinal surgeries to repair nerves and will likely need more. I am truly glad she escaped but we will never be friends again."
697,"It's sex when circumstances were obfuscated because consent would not have otherwise been given.

So... Rape."
698,"I'm not one to advocate breaking up immediately, but this is not immediate. This is years of promises broken and wrongs committed without taking responsibility. You are going to couple's therapy and the trained therapist doesn't seem to make you want to save this marriage. No one here will if they can't.

&gt; I have broken things but I stopped. He’s started breaking things too but nothing in the last couple months.

Will this happen again and will your son see this? Why do either of you want to stay with someone that makes you act like that?

Even if he changed into the perfect husband overnight, I don't think that will be enough for you. You are just done. Nothing in this post made it seem like you actually want to save the marriage. You were looking for validation in your want to divorce. You got it.

Use that couple's therapy as ""divorce mediation"" as you put it. Get individual therapy for yourself. Use both to make this as amicable as possible, at least on your end, for the sake of your son. But don't forget, having divorced happy parents, well at least one happy parent, is better than having two miserable married parents normalizing bad relationships that could end up taking out frustrations on him or putting him in the middle of marital problems."
699,But you *didnt* know about this. He did these things without your consent.
700,"Jeeze, these comments became sort of condescending! I also own an apartment. I was reading the comments and was in the same boat as OP as far as needing clarification. It makes sense of course, but i also assumed the original comment was referring to a different landlord, not OP. "
701,"Everyone else is right, but... from someone who was in a similar predicament at 18 with a husband 12+ years older than me, for over 5 years? Break up with this jerk and move on with your life. 

I'm around your boyfriend's age right now and it would be absolutely impossible for me to consider a relationship with a teenager. The difference in life experience and maturity is massive between these two ages. I'm not saying you're immature (and in fact, you sound a million times more so than this asshole) but it's hard to see how wrong this is when you're in it. 

There are countless other men in the world who are 1) closer to your age and thus will have more in common with you, 2) kinder and more considerate of your time and feelings and 3) would never dream of using you for sex instead of treating you like a respectable, fellow human being. Go date them instead of wasting more time on this idiot. "
702,I want to add that just because OP hasn’t seen this behavior from her with past boyfriends doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Fiancé said MOH said “I won’t tell.” 
703,"You're severely under-reacting. 

Having found him out and telling him off is not even close to a resolution. 

Imagine all the footage he has. You shitting and wiping your ass. You jerking off in the shower. Your friends using your facilities. You should assume he's done this before. This dude is a disgusting fucking criminal. 

And you're trying to move out and move on? no! HE should be getting arrested and moving out. He's done more than plenty to be kicked out, expelled, and arrested.

You shouldn't have confronted him. 

You should have called the cops, campus security, dean of students, etc. This is criminal behavior that can and should be punished.

Ok hindsight is 20/20 so I won't grill you more on that..

What you can do now is follow up with the authorities (cops and university) and lay out everything that's transpired. Save any texts or ANY evidence. 

This dude knew how criminal his behavior was. If he has any brains he'll already have destroyed all evidence and will claim you're making shit up because of roommate drama or something. Do whatever you can to substantiate what happened."

707,Why don't you go do your laundry now instead of finding excuses to not do it? If you do it now you're showing her you can do your laundry and without needing to be mothered while doing it.
708,"You saying that you don't have ""the reflexes"" to clean under the couch is ridiculous. You obviously know that it needs to be done, you just don't do it. I get why your partner is upset... you're 27. These things are not hard. You need to grow up and stop blaming your parents.

710,"Counseling/therapy STAT. You have had two abusive relationship, a whirlwind marriage, and are fresh out of a divorce. You are asking some important questions (what does a healthy relationship look like) but the best thing for you is counseling.

713,"I wouldn’t call this a red flag so much... but her probably indirectly trying to figure out how serious your relationship is and if you can see yourself together for a long time and in to the future.

If you aren’t interested in a baby right now, before marriage, you should probably tell her that.  And protect yourself from the possibility, by wearing a condom."

716,"Could your husband find someone to raise his children and take care of the household for free?

Of course not. Then you also “bring in the money.”  He’s financially abusive and controlling. Tell your parents what happened and ask for their help in talking to a lawyer to learn your options. "
717,You are opting-in to all of this drama. 
718,"Sounds like something was said that was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. They'll probably feel like shit later once the emotions clear. 

In the meantime, you should keep the relationships superficial. That means consider them akin to business colleagues where you don't talk about politics, religious, social issues, and so on. You learn water cooler talk. That will give all of your relationships the rest break that they need. It's family so you have decades to figure out how to handle everything. But, for now, they've asserted that the ""deep"" impacting conversations are causing them stress and it's a boundary they don't want you to cross. See what happens if you respect that before your next action. "
719,I would give her the separation she's asking for. She's made it clear that she wants you out of their life. Her child has a father. It would be incredibly selfish to get involved at this point since it would destroy the life they have. You've done nothing wrong and the best thing to do is to not act. This is one of those things you need to let go.
720,"Let’s remove the gender of the other person at the club and summarize this:

- you flirted with another person at a bar, and enjoyed their attention (the fact that you had to specify twice it was platonic means you know very well it wasn’t - you were seeking and enjoying attention from another person right under your girlfriend’s nose)

- when your girlfriend had completely valid feelings of resentment about that, you lashed out and used a known insecurity of hers to attack her 

- you then bombarded her, contacting her via three different methods of communication, ignoring the fact that she obviously didn’t want to talk to you, insisting she forgive you 

- you’re not remotely sorry for what you’ve done. I say that because you haven’t even acknowledged that you sought attention from someone else, and not a word was used to indicate you understand how she feels or why she’d be upset 

- you’re now considering continuing to contact her or showing up unannounced to double down on demanding her forgiveness 

Take some time instead, while you’re giving her the space she obviously wants, to reflect on your behavior and why you need strangers to validate you, at the expense of a loving partner. "
721,"....she doesnt sound materialistic or unreasonable at all. She sounds like someone who made an unconciouss connection between fake rings, bad relationships and her own self worth. Noone here is the bad guy. I feel sorry for her, she cant enjoy simple things because of what happens.

Yet here you are, talking bad about her without even understanding the full picture."

I've brought it up to him but he doesn't seem to see it as much as I do since he actually gets to partake in the convo still. Plus I don't think he thinks a big deal...""all families do that"" was his response.

He is quiet and rarely leads the convo. Especially next to his dad and even his mom who are both louder and talk over others."
726,"Yeah but in this kind of situation it IS men. When mothers are made to feel less than by a man because he earns the money. A woman physically can’t work when heavily pregnant or looking after babies, to have that held against her is misogyny. Of course anyone can be abused but this seems like a male/money/power thing to me "

He's got you beat there, it's not the kids' money if he earned it.

730,When you said you had a good time with her I was thinking “man she must really be pretty” because she sounds like a horrible person to spend time with. The text she sent critiquing you is disgusting too. It serves her right that she thinks she was ghosted. I just hope she’s self-aware enough to figure out WHY so she can become a better human being. Probably not though. 
731,You think she's horrible enough that the idea of having a child who reminds you of her living with you upsets you. Now imagine having to actually live with her. 
732,He should be trying harder than shitting on you for actually moving on with your life when he said he wanted a divorce. Can't put that genie back in the bottle 
733,Find friends with the same values and interests; everyone grows out of their high school friends.  Don't waste time trying to one-up them at their own game.  It's honestly not worth it and decades later you will look back on all the time wasted with these people who wouldn't be there for you when you're in trouble.  *Shrug*. Easiest way is to find new friends and just let the others slowly fade away.
734,"&gt; How do I broach this continued issue with him?

I recommend telling him straight that as long as he lives in this past fantasy land, you won't be taking the relationship seriously, and you're not considering an engagement."
735,"Even if he’s being 100% honest, you don’t need to support someone when they are unwilling to try and get any help. At that point, it’s enabling, not support. It’s been over a year of supposedly severe symptoms and you said he’s never been diagnosed with anything, never seen a doctor, not working with a therapist? It’s completely unfair that you seem more willing to try to work towards solving these issues that he is. But then again, why would he? He gets you accommodating his moods, your attention, and never has to put it any work to control himself or work on himself or cope with anything himself. 

It’s okay at that point to put your foot down and say that you can’t keep enabling him. You can support him but only if he’s willing to take steps to try and help himself too. "
736,"Ok, what reaction would you like her to have when she stubs her toe? Again, processing emotions differently to how you do doesn't make her a robot, but if she's suppressing emotions due to past abuse, then maybe she needs a good therapist (and a partner who doesn't make them feel abnormal, I'd wager).

Not everyone is super emotional. My boyfriend cries over literally everything, and I sit expressionless through funerals of people I'm close to. That doesn't make him better adjusted emotionally. It doesn't mean I don't feel anything at all. I just prefer to deal with things on my own terms in my own time."
737,"&gt; Is it even worth trying to make sense of who she is as a person given all those deceptions?

People are going to say 'no', but some part of you is going to want to understand what happened to your 23 year old marriage, and that's fine too. That question is probably best addressed in solo therapy after the dust has settled.

You're going to want some support as you reframe your past with this woman.

"
738,"Honestly, you see a lot of sexist guys who also detest cats. I think it's because they're culturally regarded as a woman's pet -- after all, you never hear about crazy cat gentlemen. Not to say that all men who dislike cats are sexist, but *hating* cats can be a tell.

I wonder if Ken tends to be judgmental in part because he has a bunch of weird subconscious ideas about gender and he objects to people who don't match them for whatever reason. Which could be most people, given how narrow gender norms can be."
739,"I agree with this. 

Being shocked is one thing, making the judgement that this was a ""stupid thing to do"" is another.  I think this says a lot about his character. First, he obviously has a much different view on sex than you do. That's not likely to change. But more than that, OP, he is judging you on decisions that you made willingly, as an adult, that didn't hurt anyone else. This isn't a judgement that comes from concern for you or society in general. No, this is a judgement coming from someone who is insecure. As Hooper from Chasing Amy succinctly puts it *""Men need to believe that they're Marco Fucking Polo when it comes to sex.""*  Not all men are like this by any means, but  I think your boyfriend falls into this category. 

Only you can decide if this is a deal-breaker or not, but I think you probably need to prepare yourself that if you stay with him, this will be used against you in the future. I suspect you will probably also see other insecure tendencies play out.  And OP, this man made you feel like ""a dirty slut."" You know you don't deserve to feel that way, right? If you decide to stay with him, I just want you to make sure you know that you have done absolutely nothing wrong. This isn't about you. It's him. All him. "
740,"...no, he's clearly choosing to shit on his daughters here, and demand that they validate his *ongoing* affair.

OP is completely allowed to recognize that he isn't a positive asset to her life, and cut him off. That's not ""bitterness""."
741,"Mate I wouldn't go. You are still hurting and need plenty of support. I was invited to my best friends wedding years ago and I was asked to play music there also. Trouble is my ex wife was also invited through my best mate's wife. I just knew I couldn't do it. I told my best mate. He got pretty emotional and said 'you have to come. I don't care. She's uninvited'. So I went and had a greet time after my ex got uninvited.

Moral to the story is that you can't put yourself in vulnerability despite expectations of others. "
742,"If she thinks, as an adult, that having her adult GF come visit her college dorm without informing/asking permission from her homophobic parents is “sneaking around” then she might not be ready to be in an adult relationship yet. 

And honestly she’s never going to be able to date anyone until she can stand up for her partner and stop putting so much effort into gaining her parents’ approval. Her parents are going to work their hardest to torpedo any relationship she has with another woman, and they’ll probably succeed, until your GF starts putting her foot down and sets boundaries with them. 

That’s going to be hard since they’ve raised her to not stand up for herself. You can try and encourage your GF to pursue therapy at her college to learn these skills but don’t stick around if this situation gets too risky for your mental health. "
743,Call CPS.  You were assaulted by your sister.
744,"That is not fair to the friend.  There is no way the friend wants to change traveling around Europe with his best friend to traveling around Europe as a third wheel on a couple trip.  I have had a friend’s boyfriend horn in on a trip and while his presence didn’t ruin the trip, it did completely change the dynamic, and listening to the alternating bickering and sex in the shower was annoying."
745,"All of our friends live over an hour away so it isn't something we even thought about. But you're 100% correct. Knowing somebody who knows somebody is everything right now.

746,"I remember once when I was a kid, we sat down to dinner, it was something that wasn't a 'favourite' of mine, and I asked ""What's for dinner tomorrow?"", my dad took the plate from me and sent me to my room. When he and mum had finished eating he gave me a stern lecture.  


I was only 6 or 7 at the time but I cringe so hard whenever I think back to that moment - my mom gave up her job because my dad got a great job in Saudi and she couldn't work, she made being a SAHM her career and she's amazing at it. As an adult I know how much effort and love goes into my mom's meals, and I feel so sad when I think of how much that must have hurt her.  


That's me as a 6/7 year old, who learned her lesson then and there - this guy is 29 and acting like this!"
747,"Cliche but true. Many people I know want so desperately to be in a relationship so they'll be happy but don't understand they'll never be truly happy until they learn to accept themselves for who they are. Also getting into a relationship ""at all costs"" tends to mean you'll end up hurting."
748,"I'm a bit confused, sorry. Did she mean to show you pics of her ex, or were they just in the pics she showed you of something else? This sort of reads as her showing you pics her ex happened to be in and you showing her pics of your exes deliberately (which would be a huge difference), but I might be misreading. "
749,"I don’t have inside knowledge on the finances of Bill Gates or anything, but his wife was with him from the beginning of Microsoft.  In other words, a prenup probably wouldn’t have done much for him anyway, since he and Melinda both contributed so much to earning all that wealth.  "
750,"He may just have a low sex drive. But to be honest, the way you’re explaining things is you need sex. It’s a compulsion. And it seems like he’s only a part of it because he’s your partner. What I’m trying to say is from his point of view he may feel like he’s just a prop for your needs. "
751,"I can see both sides. You want your privacy and after all this is your child. However it does come off as pretty controlling also. 'Don't say this, don't do that. Run everything by me first'. If anyone in my family acted like that they'd be pretty hard to hang around. "

755,She’ll be sitting there bored out of her mind. Honestly don’t bring casual dating scenarios to events like weddings/office holiday parties etc. 
756,Such a great response. When I was younger I forced my bf to come with me to a wedding I was in. He didn't know anyone and I was busy for most of it.  Probably a big factor in why we broke up.
757,"Is he your ""ideal"" body type? I've never dated a guy who was MY ideal body type. I doubt if I've been the ideal body type of anyone I've dated...but who knows. 

The guys who I've met who were my ideal body type, after speaking to them a while, I was totally turned off (crappy personalities). 

Where as people I wouldn't be attracted to at first glance, something drew me to them after getting to know them. They were either funny or sweet or charming or brave. And I began to think they were the most attractive men on the planet. 

There's more to love than looks"
758,"You also might want to consider that, with the spotty service, he might have sent those two messages together and one got delayed for whatever reason.  Would you interpret it differently if it was an immediate afterthought rather than 2 hours later?  I think I would."
759,"It's homophobia. Deep seeded homophobia. A lot of closeted men will say they could never be with a man and it's just another way they deny their sexuality. I'd browse through r/gay or r/askgaybros if you haven't already and you'll find posts about it.

Edit: deep-seated. And damnit I even googled it. Geese louise."
760,Make a list of every instance they've insulted the other women. Send it to him and tell him that's the reason he and his wife are no longer invited to anything.
761,"its not normal to run ""social experiments"" on people . Why do you feel the need to test people around you?"
762,"You don't have to be a SAHM. You could get a nanny or find a daycare. Do a little googling and get a ballpark idea on childcare costs in your area. Think about if you have family or friends who might help with childcare. But, if you do't want your hypothetical child to be raised by someone else, and you don't want to have another gap in your career, you could ask your SO if he can rearrange his career to work from home, work nights, or maybe be a SAHF.  

Also, find out what your company's maternity leave policies are. 

Either decision would be ok. Women get pressured to do it all, it is really ok if you decide your career is your priority right now. Having a baby can be very hard on your body, your marriage, and your career. For some people children are a burden, for others children are a great joy. Listen to your heart."
763,"Wow. My guess is that he's spent at least *some* of the money and is afraid you'll know that all 13k isn't there.

You actually shouldn't pay him back anything. Each time he saved the day it was because he was forcing you to spend 1k a month you didn't have to. Don't forget that part. You don't owe him shit, and he owes you 13k.

Unless when he helped you there was the understanding you were already going to pay him back?"
764,[removed]
765,"Here are my thoughts, broken down into 5 parts.

1) Your insecurities do play a part in this. But it isn't totally your fault. Yeah you need more confidence in yourself. Stop feeling like *she* settled for *you*. I am almost certain she is aware of the fact that you feel like she is ""out of your league"".  And that sentiment probably plays a huge whole role in the dynamics of your relationship. Its possible that she is taking adavantage of that belief and keeping her options open. Which brings me to point 2..

2) Ian sounds like a ""just in case guy"". A ""just in case guy"" is a type of guy she vibes with and is attracted to, a guy she *could* see herself with *if* she were single. But she isnt single.  So she keeps him around as friend, *just in case* things don't work out with you. Or she gets tired/bored of you. She sets soft boundaries that she will let Ian continously tetter on edge of and eventually step over. She pretends to be clueless about it because she doesn't want to ruin anything. Anything meaning her friendship with him, AND her relationship with you. At the moment she wants to keep both. You said it's only been *two weeks* and you already feel like your relationship is being threatened. She ignored you to spend time with him. That was intentional. 

3) Ian is obviously into her. You don't put that amount of time and attention into an attractive women without it being based on some sort of interest or attraction. I'm a firm believer that most male-female platonic friendships are based on *some type* of attraction. Whether it is sexual, shared interest, shared conflict, compatible personalities, etc. Obviously every relationship is unique and circumstances must be applied to provide context, but that general rule applies. He is currently courting her. It's not an overt ""him or me"" type of thing, but playing into her interest like the drawing of her (that she obviously values deeply) is a clear as day subtle move of intimacy. 

4) Ian doesn't care about how you feel. Befriending him isnt going to make him want your girl less. He will continue to court her, and she will continue to allow him to comfortably grow into his ""Just in case guy"" role. You are just an obstacle that he is actively trying to  work around. And you're allowing this to happen. 

5) This will continue to get progressively worse over time until YOU put your foot down. YOU must establish the boundaries of their relationship, because SHE failed to do so. When she hangs out with him make your  presence known. And what I mean by that is don't be aggressive or confrontational. Randomly pick her up from that particular class one day. Make time for it. Don't tell her you're stopping by, just show up catching them both off guard. Classic power move. You want Ian surprised and uncomfortable. When you not around he is comfortable and in his element, free to chip away at those boundaries. A firm handshake + introduction mixed with a little spontaneous PDA in front of Ian should get your point across. But be smooth about it, and make it seem like it's all about her. ""Hey babe, I wanted to surprise you!  Let go to _____ and get something to eat"" or something like that. He needs to understand that he only gets to spend time with *your* girl because *you allow it*.  Its seems barbaric and petty, but pay attention to their reactions as it will give you more clues to what Ian's intentions are and how she feels about him.

*I hope this was really helpful man, get your girl back I'm rooting for you* 
"
766,"Legit, just call his mom. Offer to take back $12k not $13k. "
767,"I think he's entitled to privacy about his porn. I think the real issue here is the dissatisfaction with yoursex life and the effect that his masturbation and porn habits may be having on it. Focus on that. If he's not willing to work with you on this, take that seriously."
768,"&gt; because who would want to date a midget that looks like a teenager?

I had a good laugh at this because Im 5ft, 23 years old, and have such a babyface that people think Im fresh into high school. Only difference is that Im super confident in myself where as you seem to put yourself down a lot (going as far as to say you have poor English skills when you have better English skills than most people I know). Confidence is attractive to people. If you work on loving yourself more, you might have better luck with dating. "
769,"Uh, why can't you go to the same college or escape that reputation by moving somewhere else? Do you have a really unusual last name? You could always just change your last name."
770,Insufferable...exactly...she wanted to be the damsel in distress...so annoying...my issues is that I am a people pleaser.   It took everything I had to not let her bully me into staying all week....but I learned my lesson...never again!!!
771,"&gt;I played it off as us having to get ready for work,

I mean but why though? You shouldn't fuck people you can't talk to honestly. This was the perfect point to say, ""Oh honey, you really need a shower!"" and then follow-up to let him know that sexual intimacy requires hygiene.

Stop trying to save him embarrassment and stop dancing around the topic. Be direct, compassionate, but entirely honest about **your** needs to continue having an intimate sexual relationship with him.

​These ""my dirty luvver"" posts always make me think of a local punk rock band that had a song called, ""Here's a tip! Wash your ass!"" You need that band to come over and do a rousing performance for your stanky friend."
772,"&gt;Parents house is half hour away it's in different direction with train

That's his problem, not yours.

 

&gt;""Well he goes a head and promises people that we will regardless **and then physically forces me off the train** in order to change trains/ go to the area of raid""  
&gt;  
&gt;""He goes without me leaving me at some random station in the dark at night.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""He hasnt apologised cause he doesnt think he did anything wrong. Hes angry in fact because they lost the raid without the my account to help win.""

...I'm kinda shocked at how much you're underreacting here."
773,"Seconding this, The Gift of Fear is all about trusting your gut."
774,"FWIW, I was a “groomsmaid” and brought a BF of 8 months. He legit asked to leave 30 minutes after dinner ended, then played DS the rest of the night. Cringe. And he’s in tons of pics since we sat at the head table.

The bride is my friend too... pretty sure she’ll never, ever forgive me for that."
775,"Seriously. I would have booted his ass out the door until he apologized if he honestly said this:

&gt;  ""It's good to see you're growing your hair out. Don't ever cut it off like that again -- that was NOT attractive."" And went on to add that he loved his wife's ""beautiful long hair that she'll never cut off"".

Completely unacceptable.
"
776,"I would strongly suggest a pee or blood test for Roofies and ketamine.  That test needs to be run asap.

Having that data would be useful either way.

""Hey new co-workers...I got slipped a mickey and here's the data.  I sincerely apologise for anything I did but I honestly remember none of it and I am ashamed nonetheless.  Lesson learned.  I will not be so careless with my drink receptacle in public again.""

Or, if nothing is found, you get to have a serious conversation about the fact that he got blackout drunk; once is an accident (never to be repeated), twice is a pattern and treatment begins, and third time and you're gone (unless you  fancy a life of broken dreams and heartache, then go for it).

&amp;#x200B;"
777,Doesn't that work both ways. OP shares his apartment with his GF but wants to have two whole rooms and the colors and style he wants. What does she get?
778,Yes I totally agree. I'll give him a bit more time since we don't know each other that long. Thank you.
779,"It is mighty coincidental that you had *literally no one* to speak to except your 21 year old crush.

Also find me a 35 year old man who wants to date 21 year olds who *doesn't* have a crazy mean ex-gf. For some reason they all do. It's a mystery, I guess."
780,"I know, right? Why is this such a consistent problem? Why are women putting up with men who don't shower, wipe their asses, change their clothes, or brush their teeth? What is going on here? "
781,"His extremist views sound like he could be dangerous, be sure you're not alone when you tell him to get out. He's not a friend either with that attitude, just using you."
782,"I know right. I don't spend $6,000 on clothes in a year. Selfish doesn't even begin to describe her. "
783,Your dad is choosing to live this life with these insane restrictions. You are allowing yourself to be drawn into petty conflict and drama that you don’t need to be part of. 
784,"Honestly, they can, which is why this boggles my mind.  I wouldn't want to be working on site with someone that compromised who is potentially operating dangerous equipment."
785,"Yep. OP is in a office politics minefield and isn’t fully aware of how unprofessional and toxic it is. Sure every place has some office gossip but this place sounds like a nightmare. She seems to think that she’s her bosses favourite employee but doesn’t understand that bosses should never have ‘favourites’. It’s a clear manipulation tactic for her boss to do and say these kinds of things. They have employees in a team, some who are easier to manage than others which makes them more likely to get promotions. They should not have favourites seemly based on attractiveness and youth (honestly her boss kinda creeps me out).

@OP as a young female professional myself you need to try and search for a better place to work. As you’ve just experienced this level of toxic office politics will bite you in the ass. You’ve gotten away with just a small backlash this time but you won’t be so lucky the next time. Environments like this can kill careers and twist your view on what behaviour is professional and unprofessional making it hard for you to integrate well in another company. Take it as a warning and seek out a more professional environment to work in."
786,"&gt;Money is not a problem for him he has plenty of it. 

Good, he can get an airbnb. 

Your daughter's safety and sense of security matters FAR more than his feelings. Get him out so she can feel safe. That's your duty. Stop exposing her to this. "
787,"I don’t want to scare you, but built in to rules against cheating is an additional caveat that if you know someone cheated (even if you don’t know how) and you don’t report it, you can get expelled as an accessory. Since he shared the folder with you, your name is now attached to this incident and if you don’t go forward and this does eventually surface, you WILL be seen as a coconspirator and will face just as hard of a punishment as them. If he didn’t share that folder you could claim plausible deniability, but you have it and you’re a part of this now. You need to go forward to protect yourself.

I saw it happen in under grad, and was briefed on it when I started handling student exams in grad school. "
788,"Maybe he's talking about negging? I mean not exactly negging since he's not outright insulting you, but rather manipulating you into staying attached by briefly giving you hope. "
789,Well he just sounds like an arrogant douchebag. I don't think telling him is going to make a difference. Hej might just need to mature and see different peoples perspectives and learn that the world isn't black and white but it might take a long time
790,"&gt;But you DON'T have the space

Not to mention, ten beds at the ready."
791,"Even if they did have a handful of perfectly equipped bedrooms with 10 beds and clean bedsheets all at the ready, they STILL wouldn't have the space."
792,This is such a waste of effort. Quit enabling and quit trying to rescue him. He sounds like a loser quite frankly . You do all this bullshit for him but it's not like he respects you or himself enough to make a change. Stop being his mom already and babying him through his social life. You're adults for god's sake.
793,"&gt;Surprise, yes I am the husband

...no, that wasn't a surprise. I think everyone figured that out from the title.

&gt;I am genuinely interested in what others think

Why? Isn't what your wife thinks what really matters? Internet strangers telling you that it sounds like she leads a charmed life isn't going to flip a magical Happy Switch in her head.

My guess? If you've controlled all major decisions in your relationship thus far the way it sounds like you control every aspect of your life together now, she's discovered she doesn't want to be married and the mother of a toddler and living in Stepford. But that's just a guess. There's one surefire way to find out though."
794,"Yeah and no.

She should absolutelly go see a therapist, but she may want to do that after she left him. Making steps to regain self-confidence while still being with him is dangerous. He'll notice, and he won't like it, and come down even harder on her.

Leaving is very dangerous as it is."
795,[removed]
796,"From what I'm gathering from other comments here, it seems to me that she's probably doing it because he wants it not because she wants it. It will only lead to a life of sadness, anger, and resentment if it isn't resolved."
797,"Lol what logic?  What does any of his increasing attempts to control your actions, clothing, and social life have to do with love.  Here's some logic for you - your boyfriend is cripplingly insecure and has unhealthy expectations for dating a non-slave in 2018.  "
798,"My boyfriend frequently gets me ""just because"" flowers.

I have never gotten tired of it."
799,"Yup, final nail in the coffin right here."
800,Well the good news is it only took you $20 to figure out that this guy is not your friend. Find better ones.
801,"The rest of it was understandable and I was ready to chalk it up to them wanting to give you space and some miscommunication on whether “drop by whenever” really means drop by whenever. But not even asking you if you still wanted to go on the annual trip is pretty mean. Your brother’s comment about “not really being” in the family anymore is very hurtful, even if he didn’t intend it to be. 

I think you ought to sit down with your parents and ask them flat-out what gives. Especially if you’ve been willing to pay your own way on vacations and outings. I can understand if they see it as your responsibility to pay for yourself now, as an adult, but to not even discuss the issue and just un-invite you is kinda mean. I would approach them gently, but firmly, and tell them that you feel excluded from the family and they’ve been hurting your feelings. Then give them space to respond. It’s possible they may be feeling like they’re “losing you” and this is a reflection of that feeling. "
802,"&gt; I’ve always felt that you should be ready for the 1% worst case scenario when you’re sexually active.

This. I just can't fathom why people think they are victims when they have unprotected sex and get pregnant. Like...that's literally a scientific, biological reality. Any fertile person is not immune no matter how much they don't want a baby or think it won't happen to them. The only victim in this situation is the child who might be fatherless because OP isn't willing to grow up and stop thinking only of himself. "
803,"&gt;""the guy who divorced his wife over a false allegation.""

Even if it turns out your wife didn't technically abuse this student, she still got into a relationship with someone she had power over. She also cheated on you. Both of these are more than enough reasons to divorce someone.

She's burning her career to the ground. Don't let her take you down with her. Let people gossip - your friends and the well-informed will know the truth."
804,OMG my boyfriend's long time friends were married and they had relationship troubles. They'd invite us and others over to hangout and then they'd cut each other down. It was so terrible. Early on into my relationship with him I stopped joining him to visit his friends. 
805,[removed]
806,"The thing is this is no longer ""his apartment"" it is ""their apartment"". The problem here is that OP hasn't yet accepted that this is no longer ""his place"". It's a common problem with couples when one moves in with the other. If it's going to be a big problem then it would be better if they moved together into a new place."
807,"You are draining yourself and you will reach a breaking point sooner than later.


It is outrageous that she doesn't contribute as much to this family as you do.


When are you done with your education?


Do you have family (such as the naggy mother of your GF) who can help out with the kids as long as you are studying?


Please do not give up on your education, it will be worth it when you are done!


As a last resort, make a plan for your university classes, studying (because without, you will fail the courses), work and the least amount of sleep you need.


Sit your fiancé down and show her your plan, so she can accomodate your studies and work scheduled, which have priority right now. It is investing into your future.


Don't budge on the sleeping schedule. She could be a SAHM for two full years, so she can accomodate your tight schedule for 2 years at least, too. You need sleep to recharge. 


Agree on rules. She has to work at least 20hours a week and contribute financially to the household. This is the 21st century. The man is not the sole provider. What is her reasoning of not aupporting the path she urged you to go in the first place? As long as she isn't pro iding herself for the family, she has no say in when you have to get up if sleep is what you need to manage your intense week. 


Set a timeline when you are finished with your education and can focus on work.


Talk to her what she wants and expects and see if you can accommodate her needs if they are reasonable. It is okay to insist on her working as long as you study.


Stop letting her mother comment on your family. She is not welcome in your home as long as she continues to be disrespectful. 


I know with 12 hours, it is highly unlikely to have a hobby or nurture friendships, but see if you can find some me-time in between, even if it js just 10min meditating or enjoying a cup of coffee in the cafeteria of your university. Take actively time to breathe. 


If your GF doesn't compromise at all, maybe it's best you separate. I am sure you will get custody once you prove you are the better provider with an university education and a stable job. Keep tabs on what you do when for the upcoming months to have written proof of your engagement. Also, sometimes writing out what you do daily helps to get an overview and feel better and optimize things. It's better than just to know ""I work 85 hours a week"", which can be overwhelming


Be thankful you are young and have the energy to work so hard. I promise, it will get better if you take care of your own wellbeing before you burn out due to stress.


All the best! "
808,"&gt; Unfortunately I suspect if OP stays with this guy, she'll waste several years of her life with a much older man, giving up experiences she should be having with people her own age, only to realize later on that it was a mistake.

I think so too. That's what I said in another comment we see posts here about what awaits her future daily. He'll likely rope her in with marriage and/or a kid in the next couple of years and 10 years from now she will be wondering why her husband refuses to treat her as an equal and how they can't afford anything or have a decent savings because all their extra income is going into paying thousands of dollars of debt. "
809,The only thing I would change is to put quotation marks around the word “dump” like that
810,"I'd say don't mention the budget, because that leaves a window for her to say ""oh let me pay for them then"" and then you're out of excuses. "
811,"I think you are going to remember daily injections for 15 years. Especially when you have a genetic condition that you likely will pass down. You, as the parent, should have known, even if there was nothing to do about it until now."
812,"put it this way, if you already had a conviction for rape against you- would you REALLY be extra touchy/feely with girls to the point of creeping them out if it was a mistake or a one time thing or something you learned from?"
813,"It wasn't your fault at all, because he always had the option of disclosing his debt to you or just saying he couldn't go on vacation because he couldn't afford it.  You're not a mindreader; you had no way of knowing his situation."
814,"OP I am so, so sorry you're dealing with this! 


I would seriously consider if this is the kind of person you would want to build a life with. Putting aside the sentiment of ""If he regretted it straight away why didn't he immediately come back/call/reach out"", that everyone is saying, and I wholeheartedly agree with, what he did was still seriously concerning. 

&gt; He said that he had woken up one morning and realized that for the past 6 years (we had been friends before dating) he had not done anything without thinking about how it would affect me, and if he wasn’t ‘selfish’ now, then he never would be.

This is the most disturbing part to me! First of all, considering your partner in your decisions is literally part of being in a relationship! Does he not understand how relationships work?

And even MORE concerning, what if you get back together, build a whole life with marriage, kids, a house etc., and he just ""wakes up one day"" **again** and decides to leave? Decides, completely out of the blue, that this isn't what he wants and ""he needs to be selfish"" **AGAIN**. He made a huge life decision without at the very least communicating with you first!

He needs to understand that his actions have consequences. He signed up for a relationship with you, a PARTNERSHIP, and he is in no way acting like a good partner. Please OP, consider his behavior now as a huge marker of how a life with him will be.

EDIT- to add one more thought!"
815,"&gt; Can you suggest an alternate ""best part"" of my life if it isn't A

The life that you will build once you break up with him. The successful professional career, the healthy functional relationship and (if you want to) kids you will have, the nice house and normal middle class life you will have. Those will be “the best parts of your life” that you will have, and that you will forgo by staying with and waiting for this loser. 

Again, I know you are only 19, but you seriously need to get some perspective and think long term about your life and your future. "
816,What did he say when you told him the marriage isn’t worth it? 
817,"That was not your BF’s choice to make at all. And he has no right to be mad at you for the way you reacted.

My parents split when I was 2. My dad paid no child support and made the effort to see me once during my childhood. My mom took me to see him once more another time when we were in the town where he lives. At 17, I got curious to know him more. It didn’t turn out well and I gave up at 18, which was 25 years ago now.

I’d be furious if anyone did to me what your BF did."

819,"She made it super clear that she doesn't want to be your project so I don't understand why your first thought was, ""but maybe she can be my project!"""
