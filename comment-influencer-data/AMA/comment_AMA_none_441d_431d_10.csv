"Yeah, on occasion I consider being rich. But then I go back on Reddit. "
"HOLY FUCK

We grew up in a three bedroom house. My three sister's all slept in one tiny room. My mom slept in the master bedroom. And the third bedroom? Yeah, that was the 'spare room'. Filled floor to ceiling with shit. Garbage bags stuffed with old clothes and broken toys. TV Guides going back years. Cardboard boxes, etc and etc. You literally could not open the door, because it opened inward. So for a good few years, literally, no-one went into that room. It was just...you just didn't even bother. 

My brother and I slept on the floor in the living room. For years. No heat, on the disgusting floor where the cats pissed and shit. Sometimes I slept with my mom, but he always slept on the couch or the floor. One year he decided he'd had enough. we were going to clean out the 'spare room' and make it our bedroom. We threw out a bunch of garbage in secret. Worked really hard for days. Got our own furniture, and surprised my mom. 

I think that happened in like...95? I'd say my mother had a year-long meltdown after that. She didn't buy my brother birthday or christmas presents for like a decade after. To this day she will lose her fucking mind if you bring up the spare room. 

Cleaning was literally the only sin we could commit in our family. My sister had an abortion at like 15, and it was nbd and we never talked about it. But the spare fucking room? That's like the fucking remember the alamo shit. "
"No. When I was younger I had similar tendencies...I'd feel irrational emotional attachment to some things and take longer to throw them away. I kinda had my mom's tendency to think of things as having feelings...like, ""I've had that sweatshirt for so long, he'll be so sad if I throw him away. I can't do that to him, he's been so good to me."" 

I don't often have those feelings anymore, but they help me understand her a bit more. More frequently I almost revel in throwing away everything, even stuff I end up needing later. "
"I don't really have a question but just a wish. You know that feeling when you wake up on a cold morning, you have no plans in the immediate future, you are under the warm covers, a cat purring or a dog snuggling up to you, and everything is perfect in that moment? I wish for this to happen to you for the rest of your life. "
"Yes, but can't complain too much because my sister got toxoplasmosis which led to her losing eyesight in one eye. 

I got Scarlett Fever at a young age which caused a lot of complications because it went untreated and became Rheumatic Fever. My temperature got so high it denatured the proteins in my enamel, so my teeth have been yellow all my life. But it also caused some lifelong heart and lung issues as well. "
"I grew up in a small, affluent town that was almost 100% Italian (East Hanover, NJ). 

Most families had a stay-at-home mom who kept the house spotless. Many couches covered in plastic, that kind of thing. So I became aware from a very young age. There was also a lot of psychological conditioning from my mother letting us know we were different and had to work to keep others from knowing about it, otherwise 'they' (usually the dreaded DYFS or Public Health) would come and take us away from Mommy. 

So yeah, it was pretty young. "
"I’m against the death penalty, but I seriously hope that he messes with the wrong person in prison and gets killed by another inmate. "
"Moved out at 17. Got a job at Best Buy, became manager. Built confidence. 

Lost job, got sick, played X-Box for a year. Lost confidence. Went semi-pro in Halo 2, traveled around the country competing. Gained confidence. 

Got a job at an Alpha Graphics, became manager, more confidence. Took everything I'd learned to Community Colllege. Double major in varied subjects, 4.0 GPA, president of student government, president of International Honors society. Traveled around the country giving motivational speeches to college students. 2400 on the SAT, and a personal essay about a hoarding mother that practically wrote itself. "
"My siblings all recognize it. But the thing is, my siblings are 7,9,11, and 13 years older than me, and my younger sister died at a very young age. 

Because my mother was younger with her other kids, she had more energy that she put into abusing them. They had it worse than me, so they're simply not as close to my mother as I am. They are kind of emotionally detached from her a bit. 

Even mentioning the word 'hoarding' around my mother will cause her to scream like someone in a horror movie going through an exorcism. SHE IS NOT A FUCKING HOARDER!!!11!  The way she acts almost makes it seem like she knows deep down she has a problem, but never would she ever admit to having a fault. She is a textbook narcissist...incapable of showing weakness or admitting to any fault. My siblings and I joke that, in our entire lives, we don't think we've ever seen or heard my mother apologize for anything EVER. Every mistake she's ever made in her entire life has been someone else's fault. Every one. She'll fucking oversleep for work and it's my fault because she had bad dreams the night before because of a movie I watched 4 years ago.

She likes watching the show Hoarders to make fun of the disgusting people on it. Often after visiting someone's house, she'll talk about how their house isn't that nice or clean. It's so fucking delusional I wonder if other people actually understand what the word 'surreal' means like I do. "
"No. I'm 32 now. She was homeless for a long time living in her car. But she's got a job now and she's living with one of my sisters because my sister can't afford the rent on her home without some support. 

My mom is back to her old ways though. Her bedroom is filled from floor to ceiling clothes, dead plants, church fliers, and random shit she buys from Walmart. Luckily, my sister has been successful having my mom contain her hoarding to her bedroom. Unluckily, my mom has chosen that instead of saving for retirement, she will spend 50% of her income on a storage unit that is literally filled with garbage...and that she hasn't visited or opened in years. I think she spends about $400 a month on it. "
"My oldest sister lives in a two bedroom with 18 cats and one kid that she pretty much stole lol. Not kidnapped, don't call the cops or anything. No-one would marry her because she's a crazy cunt, and she couldn't afford in vitro, so she got pregnant with some guy and then broke up with him and didn't tell him for years later lmao. Her place is 'clean' but she's obsessed with cats, as though she didn't get enough of that shit when we were kids. She is an affectionate person, but can't show those emotions to other humans because she's as narcissistic as my mother, so she needs animals to care for. Otherwise, she's the world's biggest asshole. 

My second sister is great. Four kids, successful husband. They just had a kid with down syndrome though, and a TON of health problems that's putting strain on their relationship. 

Third sister is a wreck. Four kids with like five last names from 6 different ex cons. Her kids are SO fucked up from not having any real parents ever. She's literally such a bad mother that almost noon in my family even speaks with her. She's so fucked up. My mother actually lives with her, and is more of a mother to her kids than my sister is...and if you've been following this thread, you should realize how fucked up that is. 

My brother is the only other man in the family, so we bond over having to constantly bail our sisters out of their crazy shit. He's a good guy but with some severe inferiority/security issues. Makes no sense because he's handsome as fuck, 6'1, funny as hell, and a great singer. WTF do you have to be insecure about? Anyway, he's a struggling alcoholic. Last year he tried to quit drinking and had a couple seizures and a stroke. Light brain damage, but fell off the wagon recently, so this month he's in rehab somewhere. He married an awful woman, but I don't think they'll be together much longer. "

"If you could personally sentence that man to death, would you?"
"My mom...um that’s a complicated one. We already had a bad relationship and I did not want her involved in this situation at all because she was not a support person for me. But she inserted herself in against my will and I think her behavior contributed to my trauma. She played the part of the “supportive mother” but refused to respect my wishes and let me talk to the cops alone, and she refused to leave the courtroom when I testified as I’d begged her to do. Imagine testifying about the horrible intimate details of your rape in front of your worst high school bully, that’s what it felt like to me. As far as I remember my dad has never said a word about it to me, never asked how the trial went or anything. My mom told me that he said I was asking for it by letting a black man into my car. Surprisingly he and I actually have an okay-ish relationship these days. I'm not currently speaking to my mom and she may be cut out of my life for good, I'm not sure yet. She says there's no way I’m still traumatized by being raped over 20 years ago so she's certain my PTSD symptoms are actually just a reaction to gluten! I don't have celiac or a gluten intolerance, she's just obsessed with gluten. "
Do you have any health conditions from growing up in such a dirty environment?
"they'd say something like, ""he's the only normal one who managed to succeed, and we're all very proud of our little brother, and the things he's always doing for other people...but everything was so easy for him because he was practically an only child so he got everything he wanted. And just because he went to Stanford he thinks he knows what's best for everyone, when really he's just an arrogant asshole who didn't have it as bad as the rest of us and doesn't remember what it means to be poor."""
"Yes, fundamentalist Christian. My parents are young earth creationists, believe solely in faith healing, taught us that women are created weaker than men and to be their helpmeet (aka, obedient housewife, and nothing else), all that stuff."
"My grandparents were hoarders, and my parents are what I call pack rats, but not full on hoarders. I noticed in my 20s that I had the same tendencies you speak of: irrational emotional attachments to things. A few years ago I read “the life changing magic of tidying up” by Marie Kondo, and she had some great techniques for getting past that. I’m so sorry that you had to live like that, but so glad you’ve moved on! "
"I was taken into the uninhabited hills that surrounded the city where I lived at the time, down a long dirt road, and into a small pull off area off the dirt road. 

My mental health situation is not great! I have severe PTSD and haven’t found much success in healing so far.

It changed me entirely as a person. I almost feel like...I died that night and became a new person. I barely have any memories from before. I have trouble with relationships, with trusting people and letting people in. I have a lot of acquaintances but no really close friends. I have a bad relationship with my family for multiple reasons. I have been in a few serious romantic relationships with varying degrees of success. 

I’m not a person of faith. "
"I'm going to copy and paste my answer from another post: 

My mother has a bunch of siblings, but they were much older. She was an accident.


Her parents lived through the depression, and stressed the importance of NEVER wasting anything. That's part of it. Because they were older, she was also a bit lonely and didn't get much attention.
She has epilepsy and REALLY bad scoliosis, and kids used to call her 'Ant Woman' because she was hunched over and shake all the time. 

Then at 15 or so she was in a really bad car accident that left her in a body cast for a year and a half, missing out on high school.
Her 'friends' used to claim they were going to come over, so my grandmother would clean the house and make dinner and put my mom's hair in pony tails with bows, and then she'd just sit there all night waiting for them and they wouldn't come. Just a lot of awful stuff like that. Then when she got the cast off and went back to school, the kids were really mean to her for having missed time, for the casts, for the wheelchair, and still for the shaking and scoliosis.


My mom got a lot better in the following years and was VERY pretty. Landed a semi-famous rock star. They got married, had four kids, and she had everything she dreamed of. Then he left her because she's cray cray, and she LOST everything. I think that was the moment that she started holding on to everything in hopes of having another family and another house and another life some day. She still has like, wedding presents of shit from like the 80s that she talks about using when she 'gets her own place someday'.


And yeah, I'd say that on top of the hoarding, she has paranoid personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and probably a bunch of other shit. Who knows, at a certain point it all just bleeds together.

She's really calmed down over the years though."
Yes to both. I'm desperate to have children and give them the best life I can :)
"If your siblings were to write a paragraph describing you, what do you think they’d say?"
"I have four siblings, from my mother's first marriage. They divorced when he got tired of her hoarding and abuse. She dated, got pregnant with me. 

So, my biological father tried to kidnap me when I was three and take me to Ohio or some shit. My mom tried to have him arrested, I never saw him again, as he started his own family. He's tried to contact me through Facebook in recent years, but I haven't responded. 

My step-father, who was the father of my siblings had weekly visitation rights, never wanted a *whole* lot to do with me, but was the same with his other kids. He was a great man, but had such a strained relationship with his father that he was a bit standoffish out of the fear that his kids would hate him too. He only had weekly visitation rights, but we started to get close around the time I was 10. At 11 his health complications started (diabetes). Amputations led to more amputations. Heart problems set in. I spent the next 4 years in hospital waiting rooms before he finally died when I was 15. 

I had a high school Spanish Teacher, CK, who I was really really close with. Talked every day for four years, and after graduation, kept in close contact for another 4-5 years. Someone found out he was maintaining a relationship with a former student, and he was pressured to cut ties with me. That's probably the MOST traumatic thing I ever went through, but that's fodder for another post. "
Going from that to graduating from Stanford sounds like a long hard road to walk through. How did you do it?

"I didn't until I was an adult and I did research on them.
I'm lucky to have not had serious issues. I'm lactose intolerant (among other things) and my parents believed I was just being fussy when I said I had a bad stomach. They followed the books advice and made me eat hot sauce, cod liver oil, and other gross stuff off spoons (so I'd stop teling them), so they kept feeding it to me and I'd have vomiting fits while they pray over me.

I think vaccines for children are crucial."
Do you have any desire to have children in the future? Do you think the way you were raised has factored into whether or not you want children?

edit for accuracy: the jesus wasn't 'wavy' he was 'waving'. Like his hand would go up and down, I think it was like gif"
"I wouldn't say my mother struggles with it, lol. Her biggest struggle is that her kids are constantly bitching about it. She doesn't see herself as a hoarder, so she does very little to address it. 

Honestly, I'm fully emotionally and rationally aware that my childhood was fucked up so I truly have a hard time getting emotional about any of it. This makes it hard to talk about things I went through, because I can be telling people stories about physical abuse, murders, suicides, etc and etc and be laughing all the way through because that's just how I deal with it. Some of the more social stuff like at school is often where I'll get more upset. I'll throw out a few highlights of things that kinda stung even though I was so callous to everything: 

Being 'invited' to pool parties but not being allowed in the pool because the other kids were afraid they would 'catch poor' or make fun of me for being too dirty, ""my pool isn't your yearly bath."" that kinda stuff. 

Making the newspaper because my mom had a hundred cats, or for wild animals plaguing the neighborhood because of our trash. going to school and finding the newspaper on my desk so all the students (and the teacher) could laugh at me. 

Shit like that. The more difficult stuff came in later years when I was trying to figure out who I was and who I wanted to be, and realizing that I had no real family to lean on...and either teachers aren't emotionally prepared to hear the shit you're going through, or you have to be metaphorical about everything you talk about with them or they'd have to call the authorities. "
"Honestly I think it’s more likely that he’ll end up killing another inmate rather than the other way around. I don’t wish that upon a random inmate, but at least it would probably keep him in prison for life. A few years ago he received a new 5-10 year sentence for aggravated battery causing permanent disability or disfigurement, for something he did to another inmate. Now he’s in the supermax block of the maximum security prison in solitary confinement so for now I guess he won’t be getting killed or doing any killing. "
"The mushrooms on the carpet were small and white? they were underneath the piano because of flooding or some shit. 

I don't think there were any mold problems, surprisingly, that I know of. My sister lost her vision to toxoplasmosis, but that's a bit different. I got rheumatic fever which caused a mold to grow in my heart, but that's also a bit different. 

A big thing was going to school in clothes that smelled terribly of mildew. One time it smelled SO bad the entire class laughed at me. Teacher sent me to the nurse. The nurse called my mom and told me it was unacceptable. My mom had to leave work. We went to K-Mart to buy new clothes, where she wouldn't talk to me the whole time and walked five feet in front of me. We got home, I took an ice cold shower while she beat me (I guess beating me in the shower was to save time?) I then went back to school, freezing and covered in bruises and scratches, where my friends laughed at me for my new stupid outfit. 

After school I went home and my mom beat me again. 

edit: I apologize. I might be mixing up stories from my childhood. That wasn't from mildew. My mother wouldn't let us throw out a turkey, (or she did throw it out, which just meant taking it out of the freezer and leaving it in a pile of garbage on the kitchen floor). Anyway, I was getting ready for school and my brother pushed me down into the turkey, so I had to go to school with rotten turkey flesh on me because if I missed the bus to change my shirt I'd get murdered lmao.

"Richard Seale. He was the house musician at a very famous (the most famous?) venue/bar in the village in NYC (The Back Fence) for a very long time. Very close friends with Frankie Valley (who my siblings called Uncle Frank). Played with a ton of famous people. Recorded the original radio rip of ""You're Sixteen"" before the single was given to Johnny Burnette and then covered by Ringo Starr. 

He had the talent and was a musician's musician. He could literally play almost every instrument and could sing in so many styles. His fault was assuming he was so good, something would eventually fall in his lap and he'd make it big. So he never worked on promotion, and just stayed at the Back Fence for years. "
Your parents sound like terrible people.  I hope you have a support network that truly cares about you and that you can rely on in times of need. Best wishes

How is your brother’s relationship with her now? How are the rest of your siblings doing?
"My father was a proud American and joined the Army right after 9/11 happened. He went through a lot of training and all I know about his job is that he was a Ranger. In 2003 he was killed in the line of duty during house to house clearing.

My mother passed away due to breast cancer roughly 3 months after my father was killed. We all knew she was going to pass but nobody thought it would be within months of my father passing.

My uncle took me in and raised me. If it weren't for that man I wouldn't have had a father figure after mine passed. "
Sore subject!
"A little bit, yeah. I throw things away and then later I get frustrated that I was so impulsive. But if anything, I am aggressively well-adjusted. If I might toot my own horn, I'm very good at essentially looking at my behaviors and saying, ""that's not normal, that's a result of X condition of your childhood. Don't over correct, be a normal person."" 

I will say that if anything, I FEEL like there's a black hole chasing me. Like as a kid I never had a family to rely on or anything, so if I didn't go all out in life, I'd fall back into that darkness. I feel like I have to work 10 times harder than anyone else for the same amount of success, because I have to support and help my circus family constantly through...honestly...a book's worth of ridiculous episodes ranging from murders, christmas suicides, homelessness, addiction, etc and etc. "
"I can remember a lot of the things that I thought about but I don’t think any of them were to help me through, because I thought there was no hope for me. I thought about how my body would probably never be found and no one would ever know what happened to me. Every time he strangled me I thought it was going to be the last time and I would die. Eventually I hoped that I would die so it would be over. 

Yes, massive sense of relief for sure. He pleaded guilty to rape in a deal to get the kidnapping and aggravated battery charges dropped. Kidnapping for the purposes of committing a rape is considered a very serious crime (the only other crime eligible for the death penalty besides murder in that state). The judge said it was one of the worst rape cases he’d ever heard in his courtroom. It was nice to get that validation. "
"Both. I felt guilty for a long time for siding it from my parents  and felt like I was losing my faith (missing prayers, bending some rules,etc). 

After what it felt like my double life was coming to and end and everything settled down, I began to soul search a little more. I am currently a lot more practicing than I ever was before. "
Ass is fine- all meanings
Why did I get a -1?
"As an adult or when you were younger, have you ever had a conversation with your mother about her hoarding? Does she recognise she has a problem? What do your siblings think?"

"Oh wait I misread your first question. It’s sort of complicated to explain how I was taken. I wasn’t snatched off the street or out of my bed in the middle of the night or anything like that. Basically I randomly encountered a man hanging around the downtown area of my city, who I had no interest in speaking to. I kept politely trying to walk away from him, and he manipulated me by accusing me of being racist. I didn’t want to be rude and especially not racist, so I ignored my gut feeling and reluctantly talked to him a little. I tried over and over to gracefully remove myself from the situation but it wasn’t working. Eventually he asked me if I would just give him a ride to the park nearby and I thought it was finally my chance to get rid of him so I agreed. Next thing I know I was punched in the face and he said something along the lines of I better keep driving or he would kill me. It was so shocking, to be punched. I immediately shut down and went into autopilot mode basically. He directed me to drive up and up and up into the hills. We were very quickly into an uninhabited area so there were no cars, no people, no houses anywhere. I didn’t know if he had a gun so I was scared to make a run for it. It was also winter time, extremely dark, and the dirt road we were on was basically a one lane road surrounded by canyon walls on both sides so there was nowhere to run except up or down the road. Every time I even slowed down a little he punched me again and threatened to kill me. It felt like I had no other option but to do what he said. "
I’m a potato whore
"Hmm I guess I’m sort of neutral on myself. I don’t really have any major life goals. Mostly I just want to be okay. I want to make enough money to feel comfortable. I want to always live in cute, safe apartments. I want to travel more, especially to Scandinavia. I want to learn more languages. I want to spend more time in the forest. "

"Hey, thanks for doing this AMA. I think as a society we tend to reject hoarders as filthy and lazy instead of seeing them as people struggling with deeper issues. 

What is a memory of your childhood that is still impactful for you (good or bad)?"
"It's the only thing in the world that keeps me up at night. It's been 10 years, and I still cry about it. 

All the shit I had to endure and I came out mostly without a scratch. Then that shit happened, and I just can't cope with it, even to this day. "
"Honestly, I agree!"
"Yes. In fact, as many people who come from those houses will likely tell you...that show changed my life. Until that show came on, I'd never seen another house or another family like that ever. Putting a name to it, 'hoarding' helped me to cope with it and reconcile the situation. Learning phrases like 'obsessive compulsive hoarding' also made me look at my mother as more of a sympathetic character. Learning about triggers and stressors also helped. 

What does frustrate me though is seeing the people on the show UNDERSTANDING triggers, and then stepping on those pressure plates and upsetting these people just for good television. That brought me to tears a couple times, because I felt like they were victimizing people. 

The issue with my mother is she refuses there is anything wrong with her. She's a good christian woman who loves her children, therefore she is perfect. All else aside, she doesn't have health benefits so there'd be no treatment available for her even if she were to admit she had a problem. "

"I knew he had been sick but didn’t know the extent. His sister (who I’m better friends with) invited me to benefit for him and the invite mentioned he was waiting for a kidney.

My first response was honestly “how do I get tested for a match?” My younger brother had an organ transplant a while ago, so it was a network I was proud of and wanted to do anything I could to help someone else.


And the whole process from match to today was a little over 2.5 years. So it certainly took its time!

Thanks for the well wishes he’s doing well and the new kidney is working like a champ so far!"

I straight up acknowledged in what I said that it's irrational, 2. If you've never dealt with a hoarder before don't reply because honestly it's not helpful, and 3. Those who are replying with ""Just stop being depressed, it's so freeing!"" type shit- go away. It's seriously not helpful to anyone. I'm not going to just close up all the tabs. Today isn't the day I'm going go seek help either. Thanks, I appreciate your well-meaning, but no."
"This sort of reminds me of alcoholics, they know it is bad for you, but they still drink.

What do you think causes this hoarding?"
"1. How frequently did you watch porn daily?

2. Did you eventually find yourself looking for other kind of porn out of the mainstream stuff to fulfill your desire?

3. How did porn affect your love relationships and social life?

4. How often you masturbate daily?

5. Do you find that porn is better than you actually having sex?"
"My parents were both hoarders, my mom couldn’t throw away paper. Wether it was junk mail, old bills, coupons, newspapers, magazines etc. She subscribed to everything and our mailbox was full everyday.  Every surface of the house was loaded down. Oddest part is she rarely read anything. 

My first glimpse that something was wrong was going to my grandparents house and realizing just how clean everything was. I thought everyone lived in constant clutter. I thought it was normal to have piles of junk everywhere. "
Yes. I hope he gets what he deserves and suffers in prison. Dying is too easy. I’m sure he will be targeted there. 
Those kinds of Christians suck. That's not at all what the Bible teaches. I'm sorry you had to be raised that way.
"Thanks! Sounds like an interesting book, but if anything, my roommates and girlfriends (when I ever have them) would complain that I'm maybe a bit too tidy/organized. "
"they were, by necessity, all outdoor cats. They pissed and shit EVERYWHERE. We had a cat cemetery in the back yard. Yes, they were always fed. No, we kids weren't always fed. Yes, I can give you some tips on how to make dry cat food more palatable. 

Some funny memories. You would think you were alone in a room. And then you would pour out one of those huge 25 pound bags of cat food into a bunch of those big chip bowls all over the ground and cats would literally come out of the woodwork. Behind the fridge, out of cabinets, drawers, holes in the ceiling/walls. ya know how they say cats are liquid? well sometimes the house would flood. 

Worst cat memory. I had a rare day of pure happiness as a kid. We all went to Six Flags. Classic childhood day for others, go out for a day trip, have a blast, fall asleep in the car on the way home. 

My mom ran over my favorite cat in the world, Shadow, as we pulled in the driveway. I was inconsolable. It was late October so it was cold out, and at like 8-9 years old I had to bury my favorite cat with its eyeball hanging out of its head. I was in the cat cemetery in the back yard crying my eyes out over Shadow, trying to dig in the cold ground at like 11pm in the fog. My mom was yelling at me from the back porch to like 'man the fuck up' or some completely inappropriate shit. "

"I think I could list for you ever single time I ever brought a friend over my house. Once my friend Katie came over for a birthday, maybe 7 or 8. We jumped on my bed for a few minutes while her parents cautiously sat on a couch. About half hour later they bailed in a hurry. 

Antonio came over to watch cartoons, but the heat was bad so I'm sure it smelled worse than normal. He bailed pretty quickly. 

Brad came over a handful of times in high school after we'd moved to a new home in the same town. Once things started getting messier, Brad would make fun of me in school about things he saw in our home. That felt like an incredibly deep betrayal. Then Brad lit a pile of garbage on fire, and I panicked the house would go up quickly because of all the kindling. Brad didn't come over anymore after that. "

One of my teammates late in my career actually went on to become one of the greatest. My last team was actually the beginning of Ambush, with Kill3n, Gun Sh0t, and Igoturpisto1a. And from what I understand Justin (Pisto1a) went on to win it all. "
"I talked above in how this situation led to me developing intimacy issues later in life. But I didn't *really* date until college. I had *tons* of 'friends' though. I was honestly really popular in a way. 

In a town where everyone was rich and italian, some people thought the poor irish kid was interesting. I was also VERY social kid and just get along with people super easily. I'm still close friends with some people I've known since kindergarten. But yeah, growing up, there were a LOT of times when students, parents, and teachers were VERY mean to me. Astonishingly cruel in retrospect.

"How were you taken?

What would you say about your mental recovery? 

What did this do in terms of you and long-term relationships?

"I always wondered about his technique to get people to open up so deeply. To this day, I still think of the photo of a young woman who seemed to have been severely religiously abused and now involved in an abusive type relationship with a married man. It was heartbreaking.

"No worries for two questions, thanks for asking!

It’s true. Muslim women who choose to wear it take pride in it and I am so happy for them and their choice to cover themselves. I personally took it off because I  didn’t feel my job search was going well. 

I don’t think the ban on hijab in the Netherlands is a good thing. I believe in a woman’s freedom to CHOSE to cover herself or not. "
"Not a question: 

My husband is very similar to this, recently we found out that he's on the autism spectrum, Aspburgers if it were still a thing.

Anyway, he's a really smart dude but he very much loves routine, and lacks numerous social abilities... right now, he does a job a surveyor and blows the quota out the door (because he just reads a script).

Anyway, maybe you might want to look into that, lots of places offer classes to help teach social ques and resonances."

"Are you going to let them be alone with your parents?

Please say No."
"Go to Europe. Nudity is accepted at beaches, spas, resorts, and on TV. Their families haven't fallen apart because kids saw tits or dicks. This country (US) has been brainwashed by conservative religious fanatics that nudity = sex/ shameful and children MUST be protected. But, it's perfectly fine to expose them to guns and violence of course. "
"Got interviewed a while back and was posted on the account, not sure if he actually posts everyone he interviews or not.

1- I was sitting in Central Park on a break from work when he approached me. I saw him try to talk to someone else first but I guess they declined. He told me who he was and then I remembered seeing his photo before. 

2- His first question was ""what is a challenge in your life right now?"" or something like that, which triggered the story he ended up posting. We also talked about my job and my family, all in all about 30 minutes of chatting. He took notes on his phone the whole time we talked. 

3- I honestly don't know what made me talk so openly with him, I'm normally very hesitant to talk about myself, let alone to a total stranger who was going to put it on the internet! But he just kept asking and I kept answering!

Happy to answer any other questions!"
"Eh, i wouldn't really describe anyone who visits as gross (maybe that's just me drinking the body positivity kool aid!) Of course some of them are attractive, just imagine your average city street naked, some of them are gonna be lookers! "

"Eh it's a mix of both. Sometimes she knows where shit is, like, ""it's under the fourth pile in a laundry basket with a box of cheez-its."" More often she'll see a shirt from 10 years ago while 'cleaning' and start crying. 

I don't think we ever thought it was normal. We were conditioned from a very young age. No friends were allowed over the house EVER. Cardboard was kept over the windows to make sure neighbors couldn't see in. 

As a kid you brag because you were different and it made you special in some weird way. I'd be at a friend's house and boast about how we didn't have to get up to throw things away, you just dropped shit on the ground wherever you were lol. As an adult, years of being brainwashed that if you 'let other people see in' they'll essentially think you're a monster and call the cops on you....led to some VERY serious intimacy issues. I still take a very long time to open up to people, and date very infrequently. "

"It's very strained. Just as I was getting my life together and saving up some money, I made the mistake of trusting her with my debit card number to help were with some stuff while I was across the country in California. She kinda fucked up and took every cent I had. 

She was being evicted and needed to get out of her place fast. My brother was helping her, but it was her last day before lock out and there was still some stuff left over that she was freaking out about. 

She made it seem like it was still important stuff left and was devastated to be losing it. Apparently my brother had already gotten everything she needed, and was essentially forcing her to let go of some garbage. I was kept out of the loop. She called me freaking out, I said if she needed to hire a helper or something to pack up the last of the stuff I could loan her a couple hundred dollars. 

She hired some guys. They packed up all her garbage and unloaded it in a storage unit. She gave them my card, and they charged me $3k. She was shocked. I was shocked. I was pissed. I had less than a hundred left after that. I didn't as much as I wanted to in college so I could save breadcrumbs here and there, and she blew it all on moving piss stained TV guides and empty packages of ice cream and church fliers. 

It took me a LONG time to forgive that, and I don't even know if I totally have. Anyway, the ""I have to get out of this house"" was literally the day I turned 17 and the court allowed it. I was out of there SO fast. "
"“Asking for it” what the fuck. How can she have no compassion? Absolutely disgusting. That is absolutely insane. Is she insane?! That is despicable. And what the hell does she expect? How could you not be traumatized 20 years later. 

I’m so sorry for everything. I feel so bad I wish I could help you in some way or just hangout with you. God your story really hit me... I pray for your peace of mind and for the trauma to ease. God bless you, you are strong as hell. "
Hardest question so far! Hmmmmm... 8 / 10
"She died of colon cancer. I still find it curious that that day happened to be the only day of those weeks that the only visitors were me and my dad. She asked me to buy her a cake, she was already very weak but I was in denial convincing myself it was temporary and she would recover. I bought her a cake, she started eating and because she was that weak and ill she choked to death. I ran to call a nurse and when I returned she coughed the last times and became static. I immediately froze in shock, screamed ""NOOO, MOM! NOOO!"" and then became numb, unable to walk, talk or cry, shaking like hell. Of course it was the worst thing of my whole life and it changed me forever in every way."

"Dude, a teacher and two kids were the ones who told me my dad was in the newspaper for being a drunk, and then showed me the arrest report. No one in my family had any idea he even drank.

My question is what did your parents think of the situation and what do you do to cope and distract yourself? 


My prayers are with you. "
"I dated a guy like that. He was completely oblivious to the fact that he had a serious problem but would always point out afterwards if someone’s house was slightly messy. He actually asked me to move in and I did briefly. He would always complain about how I needed to organize my stuff and put it away because it was taking up too much space. Like, 1: I didn’t have any stuff because I kept my apartment and left everything there 2: even if I had stuff, there would be nowhere to put it away because there literally wasn’t even anywhere to put myself.

He died of a heart attack last year but I still have dreams where he is a ghost sitting on top of piles of trash and making sure we don’t throw stuff away... because one day he might need 5 kazillion plastic forks. Is he haunting me because I was right when we broke up and I told him that he was going to die alone, surrounded by trash, having never loved anything but his mother?"
"What about your dad? Was he in the picture at all? If so, did he contribute to the hoarding advertently or inadvertently? What was his opinion on the matter? "
I came here to tell OP reddit has diagnosed his high functioning autism. 
There's a reason you feel you need to stop. Is your addiction causing any outside difficulties or problems in your life? Or is it internal and you feel shamed by it?
"No, it says nothing of the sort. In fact, Jesus seems to teach just the opposite. In culture where women are seen as inferior, Jesus treats as equals. Coming to the aid of the adulterous woman, taking time to share with the Samaritan woman at the well, (which he could’ve been beaten for doing) and allowing a sinful woman to shower him with perfume prior to his death, when she should not have even been in the house. He also convinces Martha to stop being a “housewife” and be more like Mary, spending time with Jesus and the disciples rather than cleaning. So Jesus was trying to establish the value of women contrary to what the culture of their time taught."
Yea i see a lot of contradictions in this lifestyle
Any thoughts as to why she is like That? Any other mental issues besides the hoarding?

There's also formatting issues. The obvious choice is to go with a series of vignettes, Sandra Cisneros style. I might even pay homage by naming it, ""The House on Cedar Street."" All things I've considered. But not now. "
"Bingo! This!!! I can't quite call my parents hoarders, they would be borderline, at best, but they definitely \*never\* throw anything away until it has had every. last. possible. use. imaginable. Some junk has built up, but not at epidemic levels. This may partially be due to near abject poverty related to all monies being devoted to the farm business (it does sustain itself), not living close to a shopping center and my parents not being tech savvy enough to shop online.

Cleaning up? Punishable by fucking death.

I rarely visit or speak to my parents (re: 17 years of BS, physical, emotional, psychological, financial, verbal abuse, obligatory plug for r/raisedbynarcissists ).

We never had cleaning products in the house. The dog could get up on the spare chair at dinner and eat right off the table, drooling everywhere. She would always give me a huge list of chores to do each morning and a ridiculous timing to complete them. I would be halfway through vacuuming a room and she would pull the plug.. literally leaving a room obviously half cleaned. Dusting? Forget it. Windows turning opaque? They're fine! Cobwebs in the doors? It's fine. Rotting food in the fridge with pink mayo and green meat? It's still good to eat!

We did have to get the dishes washed 3x a day, but I find that was more of a power enforcement than anything else. She regularly made up rules/games that heavily favoured my siblings and the punishment was always having to wash the dishes in scalding hot water (no gloves) with no more than 1 tiny drop of soap.

Any other cleaning attempt was met with pure rage, even violent punishments. She would lecture me and shame/guilt trip for days even for attempting to clean a window or cobweb. I literally had to wait for her to leave the house just to clean my room. 

I visited once in my adult life, a few years ago. Tried to make things sanitary, but it was a lost cause. At best I was putting lipstick on a pig, the place was filthy.  The fridge was just goop. The dryer almost caught fire, had to have been years worth of lint and clog in the vents. The dog hair... oh, the damn dog hair... The garage was just cat shit everywhere, and so much worse.

She lost her shit on me.. for 2 days. I was 30."
I like to magnet fish. How about you?
I still am in the community. I would wish to leave but it’s extremely difficult for numerous reasons. 
"Yes. As early as six or so I was pretty much allowed to roam town on my own. I spent all my time at friend's houses and just playing outside with them, usually within a mile of home though. 

But it was also a bit different. I had to go to the neighbor's house to use the restroom or shower, and when I got hungry I went around friend's houses around dinner time and knocked on doors to ask if I could eat with them. I didn't really have a concept of 'shame' until much later. "

"I'm actually going to let my uncle take the reigns on this one. He'll finish this answer out.   


Hi there. When my sister died I thought about how my nephew will have to grow up in an orphanage fully knowing at his age he wouldn't be adopted. People want babies not pre-teens. I decided taking him in would be better for the fact that he would be able to stay around the family and still be in our arms with love and acceptance. It was hard at first for the fact I thought I never wanted one. Life and love for family can cause anyone to put down their old ways of life and help them as much as possible. I'm proud of my nephew and extremely proud of his accomplishments and wouldn't change anything if I had the chance to do so. "
"I built the best chicken coop ever and uh... um... dang, I guess not much else. "
"Oh for the most part, yes. 

I do distinctly remember periods where the toilet wasn't working for some reason (I was really young so I don't remember clearly.) It was a mountain of human shit and wet toilet paper. People were shitting in toilet paper they'd hold in their hands and then put it in the garbage? Eventually I think it got fixed...but it was rough for a while. I'd go to the neighbors to use the restroom. 

The shower worked, but we often didn't have hot water...and NJ can get cold. Waking up in a cold house, taking an ice cold shower, and getting back out into a freezing cold house...and then waiting for the bus in January? By the time I got warm again, it was time to go home. "
