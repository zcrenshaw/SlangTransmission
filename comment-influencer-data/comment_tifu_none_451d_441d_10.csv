Least the grasshopper had the good decency to hang round and share in the blame. Hope you didn't immediately swat him with the wiper blades.

"Well, first time I was smoking a cig while on the toilet, and vastly over estimated the space available to ash in and inadvertently flicked a hot ember onto the tip of my dick. 

I got a LOT of sympathy head from the gf for that. 

Second time, we were all waiting for a movie to begin and got bored. My buddy (named Dicky funnily enough) had sparklers with him for some reason, and we all agreed that seeing my crotch ""sparkle"" would be high-larious. 

My jeans caught fire, and Dicky quite literally beat the ever loving fuck out of my flaming crotch in an attempt to put out the fire. 

I watched the midnight showing of Snakes on a Plane with a giant hole in my pants, a burnt dick, and bruised ego.

Unfortunately, Dicky did not give me any sympathy head.

Bastard. "
Yep! They‚Äôve all been taught self defense skills to some degree. I guess she just paid attention 
I decided this was a cat collar. I gifted this to Norman.

"As I recall, we did have to register with the airport tower that we were a radar emitter in their area. So they knew who we were and where we were. The Air Force also knew we had a contract to develop this gizmo. So there was no way we could hide."

Some times it's just better to honestly admit you were doing something stupid than try and come up with a silly excuse or get defensive. More often than not honesty goes a long way in these interactions. 
"If the company didn't include important information in the schematic and also is leaving you to train yourself, then only they can be to blame for the mistake. 
You're an intern, someone who needs supervision and training. The only thing you could have done is ask for help so it's not entirely your fault."
They look very similar when you set them on fire.
"Made me think of an inmate I knew when I was working security at a maximum security prison. This guy was in the disciplinary unit, so every time he left his cell, he had to be handcuffed behind his back. He didn‚Äôt care; as soon as he got the opportunity, he would swing his arms up and over his head to the front. Absolutely the most double jointed person I‚Äôve ever met. It was damned impressive to watch. Fortunately he was really laid back too; I think he was in disciplinary for breaking rules, but not for any kind of violence. "
Nooo!
There's no such thing as an implied component in a schematic.  If it's not on the schematic then it's incomplete.  Otherwise there's no point in  even making out a schematic.  Don't feel bad.  That was a trap just waiting for someone to fall into it.
How? I too am a moron and now fear dick burns.

"That's what my doctor called it, but Google apparently confuses it with the Pediatric Assessment Triangle, which is completely different.

 I guess officially it's just called the tripod position: [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod\_position**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod_position)**.**

When healthy people do it, it's typically because they've just exercised a whole lot, and they stand up with their hands on their knees. When I do it, I'm sitting cross-legged on the bed with my hands on my knees rocking back and forth trying to batch my breath. Until my doctor gave it a name I didn't even realize that I instinctively did it when my breathing goes south."
That sounds like a separate TIFU
"&gt;...she's on top, and I go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and *bend her over top of me*...

There are several stages to gun radars. Search. (Find target) Concentric Scan (refine target). Firing (tracks the target AND the cloud of cannon shells and moves the turret to bring them together). They are different signals to a radar detector.
"For a nurses aide coarse, our instructor had us replicate what would be similar to living with COPD. She had us tape up one end of a straw and poke just a few holes in the tape with a tack and try to walk up the hallway breathing through just that straw, most of us felt faint and light-headed just a quarter of the way up, so I definitely have empathy for people whom have to live with that kind of suffering on a day to day basis.  This lesson taught us all patience and understanding for those we cared for with this disease so that we would be more tolerant and understanding when they required some extra time with ADLs and such.

"I went to high school with a girl who could do that. She could link her fingers together behind her back and swing them all the way around to the front in a smooth motion.

"I'm 42, and no one can tell me how I got COPD so bad so young. It's most likely something genetic, but it's not CF and it's not A1A deficiency, so they're stumped.

And yes, the testing was to make sure I qualified for a transplant and to help figure out where to put me on the list. Over the course of 4 days I had 11 tests and 7 consultations, which is in addition to all the tests they do to pre-qualify you. The good news is, if there was **anything** wrong with me, someone would have found it by now."
thank you!

I know it's not really my fault but I still feel bad about not asking for help since it was something I didn't understand. I took my best guess at the problem when I probably should have asked.

Afterwards I tried to explain myself, we talk about this for a few minutes and then she realizes I said 'punish'.
