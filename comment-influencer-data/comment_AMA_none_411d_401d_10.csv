I think knowingly having a child in a way that will give it inherit disadvantages is wrong. I resent my parents for doing that.
You sound like everyone else here 
I think you may have misspelled Alabama. 
Yes. They loved eachother
Was your conception consensual? 
"Sure you did, Pam."
"acts of COMpassion. I love just like everyone else, I simply don't lust."
"many, i can go into detail but the main ones were club feet as a child, and i am sterile. i also have mental disorders i can elaborate on."
No one knows because no ones asked. Im slightly different but people just accepted that like me. I found out long ago when i asked my mom who my dad was and she told me in detail. She had and maybe still has no shame about how she felt.

"I'm indifference to their love, or any incestuous love for that matter. I find it selfish they had a child with inherit disadvantages."
They are siblings
"After you defeat cancer, What are your plans?"
"Hell, that's still better than most of Reddit."
Yes. Philly Cheese steak. With jalapeno
Does anyone else know? Like your friends and stuff? And how did you find out?
"Right, so as I mentioned I had club foot, so how they treated that was they bent my feet back as far as they could and they would cast it, and every week or so they would bend it further until it was normal, which was followed with physical therapy at a young age. And yes, I am sterile so I can't have kids. I have a range of mental disorders mostly depressive in origin. "
Yup.. sounds like everyone in general in 2018. 
"I'm a guy and I'm turning 19. I consider myself asexual mainly because i dont find meaning out of acts of passion. I have had some relationships, with both men and women, but I dont really get sexual so they just keep being my friends, which im fine with."
"No, the pressure from the family forced my dad to leave before i was born."
How much did that cost?
I mean 25 is at mid as you get
"my father left before i was born because pressure from the family. No one approved of them. my mom raised me for a few years but she put me up for adoption. I still talk to her, and she is still messed up."
[deleted]
She loved him. he's gone now. It's not really my place to ask her if it was a mistake. To her it wasn't. To me it was. And how you feel is up to you.
How are your parents related?

What are your views on incest given your experience?
"I have no current health complications, and despite diagnosis of many mental disorders my mental health to me is pretty fine. I have a good outlook on life and im surrounded by those i love."
"I don’t really have any negative thoughts about myself over the incident because I think I didn’t really have a choice.
It did not affect how I value human life.
Yes, I think I could"
"That was great. Like actually, a solid response when defining asexuality"
"Well I was diagnosed with borderline depression and bipolar disorder as well as generalized panic disorder, but it doesn't affect me that much, so i don't take any medication for it."
no. he vanished off the face of the earth. No one knows where he is. 
"The doctors knew, know, and have it on document."
parents being related *significantly* increases the chances of agreeing chromosomes required for shit to happen.
Well my experiences and mental disorders aren't exactly common. So I'm just different. I'm me.
"If you press and hold it, you can move it around op! Edit the post to share this TIL!"
"I too have killed (way different context though) and am curious how it affected you.
Do you have any negative thoughts about yourself or what you did?

Did it effect how you value human life?

Could you do it again if you were forced into a situation where you had to or die?

How much money did you have in total when moving? How much do you spend annually? Roughly of course 
This means nothing to me. Had I not existed nothing would matter to me anyway cause i wouldn't exist.
Pics or it didn't happen
"Make sure you remember they have known you as you were for 24 years, if they don't accept or understand right away, give them a break. You are their kid, they will come around, some do faster than others.  Good luck! "
"What's the weather like up there?

Don't worry, I will see myself out."
no u
"If the prostitute isn’t using protection with you, she’s likely not using it with others either. "
Do you have any genetic issues due to it? 
Are they still a couple?
"No thought. I felt hollow. Eternal bliss.

"Sometimes. I mean, I've never had to deal with periods, I don't have to worry about accidentally getting knocked up, i won't ever lose my freedom and autonomy by having to give up my dreams and raise kids. 

But, there's some downsides to it as well. And for some women with my condition the infertility aspect is unbearable. But for me it's a blessing because I've never wanted little crotch goblins. 

And, I mean, I've lost out on some really great relationships because they were eventually going to want kids and that's something I can't give them. And I've also had some really fucked  up experiences of people dehumanizing me and treating my body like a fetish because of the correlation of intersex and the outdated term hermaphrodite. And I've missed out on relationships because people have worried that  being attracted to me, having sex with me, or falling in love with me would be ""gay"" because so many people think that intersex means neither male nor female. "
When was the last time you had sex without paying for it?

Lmao... nice try 😉
"Stereotypes:
Everything is bigger in America, people are very vocal about their rights, the food is huge portions and everything is genetically modified. There are specific parts of towns and cities that only certain races can go. 

Surprising things: they don’t swear hardly ever, there are a lot of homeless people, security is so tight, they don’t have sugar in a lot of things... high fructose corn syrup tastes awful. The coffee is mainly filtered or instant in pods. They call people African American, Latino American, Asian American, they split all the people into groups, if anyone came to Australia with an American accent, you’re American, that’s it. "
Do you have a favorite sandwich? 
"Thanks for the AMA man. This can't be easy, and life couldn't have been easy for you. You have an interesting story to tell. A theme in your answers is that they knowingly conceived you. Were you intended to be born or were you an accident?"
"I was an accident at first, but they knew not even a month in, and planned from there. Thanks for the admiration but life isn't easy for anyone. I've had my hurdles just like everyone else. "
Go on...... can you tell the rest of us how to do this?
"Most likely for a night 
An overnight booking of a high class escort would be about $2250 for 9 hours."
"Answered 2 questions in 4 hours, great AMA."

"Everyone resented their relationship. my parents essentially cut ties with the whole family in lue of their relationship. i was fostered, so i never became close with my family. I don't go to family gatherings or visit any of them. I'm kind of an outcast."
"It’s the pacific I crossed, I didn’t meet many stupid people at all, most were very friendly and intelligent, some were rude. I wouldn’t say stupid, tv definitely has exaggerated this in my opinion. "
"If you don't mind, please do elaborate"
"Yeah. Pretty much. Externally I've got the usual clitoris and labia, got a urethra, and where my vagina should be it's just a dimple from the outside, there's no actual hole because it's not connected to anything internally... but, there's an unseen canal, and the skin gets wet and stretches, and sex happens. "
I believe that you thought you saw it .
"Do you struggle with romantic relationships, and have you ever developed feelings for any of the prostitutes?"
Where are you from
"Holy shit, the first time I paid about $2k. No wonder I can't keep up with this numbers."

"When/where were you born?

Do your doctors know?"
"Well firstly, no, I do not feel anger or personal animosity for my parents. I do however resent them for said predicament. I resent them in a way that someone committed a crime against me. What happened to me was the result of something else that they wanted, and for being selfish I resent them."
"I believe it's for a GFE or *girlfriend experience*, involving cuddling, intimacy and sometimes even some sleeping. 

Some people also like to go and ""party"" using drugs to keep themselves going longer and then crash afterwards.

It can also be a power move if they want a pretty, charming companion to take to an event, though women in these roles are often very rare and worth upwards of $800 an hour."
"I'm an only child. And I have pretty simple aspirations, which is the help people and maybe leave the world a better place than when i found it."
"My mom 16, my dad 20. "
"My boyfriend tried to get me to do anal once. I said ""fuck that shit!"" And he happily replied ""that's the spirit"" 😜"
"Double arrows, bottom right. "
"Yeah, I have to question a lot of what you're claiming here. "
"Op, I am an investigator. I have software able to track almost anybody in the US. If you would like to find your father please let me know via PM"
"I feel your experience very deeply. I injected heroin, Opana, Dilaudid, Fentanyl, oxy, methadone,  methamphetamine, etc for 8 years. I quit all of that last year finally and 58 days ago I quit everything else; drinking, pot, snorting pills, cocaine, crack... I am about to get my 60 day chip and my life has changed drastically for the better. 

My question for you is have you had any religious or spiritual changes come over you? My sponsor and AA meetings keep telling me that I'll never stay sober without some kind of higher power; I really struggle with that. I've never been religious at all and it's hard for me to change my entire way of thinking about life. Sorry this is so long, I know it's your AMA, not my life story."
Thanks. I’d say the main way that we have coped with this is focusing on ensuring that nothing like this happens again. We moved into a gated community shortly after and had all sorts of security systems installed
"I think every guy wants to be a dad, especially if he never had one. My father vanished when he left, so no i don't talk to him. he could be dead for all i know. i talk to my mom but shes usually busy working for booze or busy drinking it."
"I was about 3, and she just couldn't cope with being a single mother. she still kept in contact so i have memories with her but not of her putting me up for adoption. I am ok i suppose, I have my baggage like everyone else. "
How do you feel about your parents’ relationship? Are you grossed out or do you think it was ok because they loved each other? 
after i started peeing blood i went to my doc and he sent me to a cancer spesialist
"What gender and how old are you? What’s your sexuality? Have you had a S. O. before? If so, did they know about your genetics from the start?"
Different? How?
its ok. I get love from other people in my life.
Just hop over to r/watchpeopledie and tell me how you feel after seeing your destiny 
"I’m from Australia, I went to Orlando for a week, New York City for a week and Niagara Falls for 2 days."
Do you have contact with your dad? 
"1. Go to r/watchpeopledie

2. Search for 'funkytown'.

3. Get the fuck out of there.

Double edit: Someone let me know if this is not it and I'll re-check for it."
"My personal opinion is that this is the most mature, objective, and intelligent perspective you can end with.
It is more rational than emotional, while most importantly still valuing your existence and self in general.
Good on you!"
"Lol. Honestly, a lot of it depends on how turned on I am... if I'm not, sex isn't gonna happen. But if I'm wet and ready, I can generally accommodate an average (6""-8"" medium girth) guy. Also, it depends on what position I'm having sex in, like, if I'm in missionary position then someone with a 6"" penis might feel like they're bottoming out, but if I'm going at it doggy style then the full 8"" and then some can get buried deep inside. 

I have an ex that was much bigger than that and sex was frustrating for him because he couldn't go deep enough to be fully satisfied, but we were married for 7 years so it obviously wasn't so bad that he wasn't willing to stick with me for it. 
"
Could you elaborate? 
"I would use them inside the US too.

You guys actually have some scary STD stats due to a lack of socialised healthcare, shaming of std testing and poor sex education.

Besides, it only takes that one slip...

You're not just trusting your partner is STD free, but everyone else they may not use protection with as well.

Those odds can stack up really quickly even without sex work in the mix."

"I am indifferent. I can't say incest is wrong. Having a child through incest, is wrong."
Can you just break up with her?
"Transgender and intersex are similar but vastly different. And I understand you feeling that way, but please understand that a transgender person romanticizing an intersex body is actually very dehumanizing to both of us, because you're seeing what you perceive to be positives about me without taking into consideration all the negative aspects I've had to live with and deal with from society and the medical community trying to erase people like me. "

"dont have a credit card. i pay for something, its in cash."
Do you have any complications healthwise? How has this affected your mental health?
"Hard to say because your ‘American ‘ might be different to mine. I went to a Wendy’s and I told the lady there that my order was wrong, after she fixed it I said thank you and she did a full African American mm-hmm with the head movement and everything... made my day."
How did you get a diagnosis?
Not sure. From what I gather it started around when my mom was 12. 
That’s an awesome tip. Feel silly for not knowing that. I would just collapse the comments thread and scroll down to the next comments thread.

Also if you double tap a comment it automatically upvotes
"Sounds like she was groomed kind of. Does she regret that, or does she still have feelings for her brother? I know they're not together now, but maybe she still had feelings?"
I wasn't. 
"Sorry. That was probably me projecting. The trans and intersex communities and experiences are closely tied together, and though we have a lot of similarities, we also have many differences. I just too often see people in the trans community using intersex people like myself to justify their arguments or further their agenda, often to the detriment of intersex people. For instance, we both fight for bodily autonomy, though for you it's the right to surgically alter your body however you want, and for intersex individuals it's a fight to keep our bodily integrity and not have the medical community mutilate us to fit the binary... those two things are in direct opposition of one another, even though we're both fighting for the right to make decisions about our bodies. "
"Please, i know you have feelings for her, but you need to get the fuck out of that relationship. It’s not worth it. I’ve lost so many family members because of the fucking cartel. "

"Yes and no. I think everyone encounters a bully. I do my best to be better than those people, and defend others if I can."
This is a great response that could apply to so many things in life.
Based on this ama I'd say you have better mental health and intelligence than most.
Oh no doubt. Best question/answer combo here. 
How old were your parents when you were born
[deleted]
Well my family knew from the start because they couldn't hide it. many people in my family are Orthodox Jewish  so abortion was out of question but they wanted them to not raise me. they refused and many of them cut ties with my parents.

"I think it's the lack of defined, 'real life' social structure. 

You go out, you know no one. How many people know or are supported by their extended families anymore? Neighbors? Friends? Tinder and modern sex Ed and relationship education has even destroyed future potential of stable family structure. 

Technology may make you feel connected, until you really need help. Furthermore, instead of hearing of war thousands of miles away and are somewhat sad - you see pictures and video and feel like it's closer to home. Even if it never has and never will effect you in he slightest. Essentially, the world is on your shoulders. And no one stands beside you.

I work in IT. I like technology. But the implementation has created a hellscape. And in the interest of 'progress' - we've thrown out the rulebook without really understanding what it was there for. "
Thank you! That’s exactly what my therapist said. They don’t know me like I know myself so I have to give them time to adjust. I’m just really nervous. 
Do you use protection?
"Interesting. If you don’t get meaning out of acts of passion, what influences your life most? What are your goals?"
"Wow thats surprising, it pretty much sounds like a normal vagina (well... based on my personal experience..) except it doesn't go anywhere, just the hole.

Also I can't believe you've somehow managed to run into so many big dicked guys. "
Like cleaning my room. Never realized how bad it was until recently.
Beeeeeech you can beat it! In a few years you’ll be sitting somewhere and amazing a bunch of people with the story of how you came out on top :D I’m right here cheering for you 💪🏼
Sex workers are actually far less likely than the general population to get a sexually transmitted disease since it's their livelihood so they're more likely to use barrier protection and access to sexual health clinics is easier than ever before. They also don't have as much same associated with getting tested and treated.
"how big is your dick?

asking for a friend"
"I was diagnosed at 14, they figured something was up when I hadn't started my period. After a few ultrasounds and some bloodwork it was discovered that I didn't have any internal organs but that that my chromosomes are 46 XX - meaning typical female, so the diagnoses was mrkh. "
"Okay i feel kinda of like morbid or maybe like I have too much perverted curiousity, but how big exactly is this ""dimple""

Can you stick your finger all the way in? I dunno as a woman thats the only metric I can think of. You said you have done PiV so I'm kinda curious how that plays out. "
"**OP**

Please make it more clear to people that you are dealing with cartel grows on US forest service land maybe a little bit of private timber companies as well.

Your post kinda makes it seem like this is what mom and pop growers leave behind. While some do (a very small amount of them in the scheme of things) It's not an accurate representation of what it's really like up here. "
What was your exact thought as it hit
I know right?!
"Just throwing out there, you'd use the same terminology for other services too. You'd call a doctor, masseuse, carpenter, etc. ""lower quality"" if their services aren't up to par. So it's not that he's not viewing them as ""real women"" so much as he's separating non-workers and workers, as we all would with other services."
"Good question, but you may be disappointed with the answer. Children born from incest do not show up on those websites since the code does not allow brothers and sisters to have kids. it just says im my mothers son i think. I have been tested and i do ineed posses both their DNA"
"Just came here to say, it sounds like you have a pretty good head on your shoulders. No questions, just acknowledgement for your stoicism. That’s a very positive state of mind to have, especially at your age. Also, it’s very freeing to learn to drive a car, though scary at first and at times scary still. Try manual, in an open lot somewhere, until you get it down. I’ve found long drives with the window down and some music playing used to really help my anxious moments and sour moods. "
"If you have Bipolar disorder, then you have a serious mental condition. My words are harsh, but I hope they help in some way. You are sick, literally. People will not take it seriously and will just say that you need to get over it. Chances are, no one is going to ride over a mountain with horns blasting and come to your rescue. Like anyone else who is sick with a physical ailment, you need to get yourself some help. If a person has a virus, they go to the doctor, the doctor doesn’t come to them. It works the same way with a mental disability. I hope you can find the strength to find your happiness. Medication is very advanced and does help. You might have to continue trying many different things to find the right one. Also, no one is going to magically “need” you. You need to get out into society and become part of social groups and various activities. Make yourself needed. It will help in the long run. Surround yourself with only positive people. Play music that makes you happy. Practice being happy. It is hard to do, but you will become stronger over time. Get a pet, one that will rely on you for its every need. Don’t allow yourself to sit in darkness and be alone. I hope this helps. Good luck to you. "

"I have to say, crotch goblins is now my favorite expression for kids.

Also, I had no idea your condition existed. Thanks for this! It's very informative. "

"It is the best feeling I have ever felt.  I guess the closest word would be euphoria, although there is no description that can do it justice."
Well currently pretty shitty honestly XD 
How did your friends react when this became public or you told them? What about school? Glad you and your family git away with a scare!
My son was born with club feet. Its not necessarily from your parents being related. Just FYI. 
TIL.  Nice find!
"Yeah I would imagine that could really start to warp how you approach women. You’re probably used to a fairly predictable “routine” when you enter a bedroom with a woman, like she either undresses or whatever and starts to seduce you right away with no effort. Having to impress a girl and “earn” that interaction authentically on a date is probably tremendously difficult, or at least an adjustment.

On the other hand, maybe it helps in ways too? For example, in my case I’ve always been, to some extent, intimidated by women. Having the guts to make “the move,” start making out and be physical wasn’t something that was always easy. Perhaps these experiences make it so that you have no fears at all with walking up and kissing a girl for the first time? Maybe it blunts the fear of rejection? That could be a bad thing in excess of course (like if it led to making unwanted advances) but in some ways maybe it boosts confidence on some level. Anyway, curious to hear your thoughts."
How will you feel if you catch something permanent?

No complaints. Other than it's a tight fit.

"How did you and your family cope with this scary experience?

I definitely hope your dad gave you a big reward for basically saving your guys’ lives. 

Glad you’re safe!"
Thanks dude
What about now? 
What kinda gun was it?
"Well, I mean, I'm not horribly unattractive, and  I'm probably a bit older than most redditors (in my 30s) so I've got a bit of experience under my belt 😉 I guess I just got lucky and ended up with a selection of guys that won the penis lottery. "
"How much have you profited in total? How much went into your savings and you retired with? 

Are you famous enough that someone who looked into camming will recognise you? 

How did you manage your finances? How stable was your income? 

What did you sell? "
"Yes, but some people would like that illusion for longer, that's what I'm getting at.

I can buy a $20 neck and massage at the mall through my clothes and a towel, but if I want my neck, shoulders and back done, along with privacy, music and nice oils, it's going to be &gt;$50."
Alabama isn't even in the top 5 incest states tho. Strawman and Roll tide!
"Good for you. I can’t imagine how it must feel to take another life but this was 100% justified, I hope you’re doing good!"
What kind of work do you do to sustain this habit? 
So you think you are a sex addict? 
I am completely fine with it and have seen enough of it in California to think they should just legalize it already. I don't smoke it but most the people I know do and they're people I have good relationships with and weed hasn't affected that. what bothers me is the ones leaving all the trash and deadly chemicals in our forest and water. it kills and hurts the environment and the wildlife so I'd like to put a stop to that part.
"Must be catching. I'm in the worst period of the past decade. I hate my life and I don't understand the point. I'm only here because I won't leave my dog.

Yesterday I forced myself to make some phone calls seeking help. Make yourself do that."
"Did you go to the New York side of Niagara Falls or the Canadian side? Because the Canadian side is absolutely awesome, and the New York side sucks."
"What do your grandparents (their parents if im not mistaken) thought about the whole situation? That their children are together, or that they had a kid etc?"
how they loved eachother and when 2 adults love eachother blah blah sex blah except she explained how siblings feel this way too. 
Holy shit. Well by golly if we didn’t just stumble upon ourselves a honey hole of knowledge. Thanks! Haha

"Was/is your family very religious? While your mother was pregnant did they know who the father was? Obviously I’m not saying you should’ve been aborted, but did that come up that you know about?"
"Technically, it's referred to as a vaginal dimple; internally there's a canal but it doesn't lead anywhere because I don't have a cervix or uterus.

The medical community tried to force me into  having cosmetic surgery to ""fix"" me, thankfully my parents let me make the decision not to do it for a number of reasons. For one, there was a chance that I'd never orgasm again in my life and I was not willing to risk that! And also, even though I have a boyfriend and thoroughly enjoy PiV sex, I thought it was disgusting that the medical community would deem me ""cured"" by giving me a vagina designed to sexually satisfy a heterosexual male. "
"Wow. Lots of questions indeed. 

1) I developed secondary traits, I've got an hourglass figure and hair where it's supposed to be. 

2) As far as I know, my hormone production is within range. Most of my development throughout puberty is thought to be from my pituitary gland. They believe I may have a single ovary in there somewhere, but they've been unable to locate it (I think it's hiding in my big toe 😉) 

3) so far I haven't taken any additional hormones, though as I age I may need to talk to an endocrinologist about it. I've got the rarer form of MRKH-MURCS which means I'm also missing a kidney, and so missing the adrenal gland on top of the kidney. 

4) Yes, I developed breasts (as stated in question 1) and I self lubricate just fine when I'm stimulated, though lube goes a long way to help anyways. And yes, I can orgasm. I definitely orgasm easier with clitoral stimulation but I also orgasm ""vaginally"" through pseudo-penetration of my vaginal dimple. "
"&gt; Maybe a few million total... No more then 4 or 5

I always knew there was a lot of money in camming but not as much as this. Holy fucking hell."

"Initially it was a lot of stress and reward eating. Most of it happened while I was in college. So when I would feel stressed out I would eat a lot of shitty food and then when something good would happen like passing a test, I’d reward myself with food. 

I was also a wrestler in high school and post high school I used to monitor my weight like I did when I was a wrestler. I got tired of doing that. 

Eventually after college (I’m post 2 years of grad.) it has just become a habit. I don’t feel as stressed as I did before but I think after 4 years of eating that, it stuck by as a habit.

I also eat when I’m bored."
"So it was technically statutory rape or some kind of thing like this? This adds another layer to the whole story, she was molested, she was too young to consent "

"I’m noticing the terminology you’re using. “Lower quality” - and in an above comment “I separate sexworkers from real girls” 

You do realize sexworkers are real women right? And although they sell services, as people, they’re not a commodity you should be calling “lower quality”? I sense some incel-like stuff about you. Like you’re very misogynistic but good at lying to yourself and others that you aren’t. 

Edit: grammar "
"When you say lost memories, does that translate to very faded away memories, or just like completely gone? Do you find something in your house and you can't remember where it came from e.t.c.? Also, sounds very scary. Sorry for your situation. Hope it gets better."
Were you in a office?

It horrifies me that op has started elsewhere that he isn't using condoms consistently.
How's the bathroom/toilet?
"My clientele is mostly horny older women, Yes tons of regulars, I'm originally from San Francisco, It depends on the service. Sometimes i do completely non-sexual actual bodyguarding all the way to going on vacations with women for weeks.

The most Japanese thing i think i ever did was roleplay with a couple that i was an American soldier raping a Japanese woman in front of her husband during the battle of Okinawa."
So like an AMA?

"Cool im happy you are not beating yourself up over it. Killing a human is no small thing. Most people cant, even if their life is in danger or it screws them up mentally afterwards. 

On not changing how you value human life; prior to this killing did you ever wonder if you could or even think about it? 

I asked if you could do it again because I know there are alot of people who cant. Had a couple guys in combat who refused to kill after there first or second ones. They didnt say they couldnt but when someone you know to be very accurate starts missing easy shots, you know."
What made you decide to do an AMA and only answer one question?
"How old were you when she gave you up ? Do you have any memories of it ? I hope you're okay, you sound like it. "

My dad's family has completely disowned me but I don't give a shit about them anyway. My mums family don't like it but their feelings about me haven't changed and they're accepting of it.
Wish I could experience something like that. The closest I’ve felt is the time my dog and I yawned at the same time. 
Bless you for sharing that fact with us!
What does heroin make you feel? 
"Congrats on 60 days.
I consider my spiritual expierence to be one of the educational variety.  As in, it happened slowly, and I consider it to have began when the mental obcession to use was slowly taken away from me and I realized that this substance no longer had control over my body, mind, or soul.  It was a spiritual expierence because the chains were removed from my soul.  The mental obcession left after I did my 4th and 5th step, so I would suggest that you do the steps.  My higher power is the creative force in the universe, I call it God, but I am not necessarily religous."
