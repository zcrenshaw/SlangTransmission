Your dad isn't talking to you anymore because he was immensely intimidated by your display of dominace towards your entire family. You're the man of the house now and hes ashamed of his weakness.
"Remember dude -- if you get caught masturbating and stop, you're the weird dude that masturbated in front of his family. If you keep on jerking off, your family becomes the weird one for watching. 


Edit: thanks for the gold stranger :) hope you never have to put this advice to use "
Funny but your parents are overreacting. YOU WERE DRUGGED!
This would be way more awkward if you actually finished... 
Just maintain that you were high off your ass when it happened and things should go back to normal eventually
"If you have any friends who are good at getting what they want from companies (ie: a lawyer or self-important tiger-mom), ask them to help you write a letter to the gym detailing the ignoring of your reports of harassment and suggesting that to allow it to go on created an untenable environment and that it’s their fault. Ask for a refund or a reinstatement of your membership."

I think he should assert dominance and do it again. Just to make it clear.
"Look at me.

I am the dad now."

"Yes but he does say he won’t recount the next few moments...

Edit: oh man I really did not intend on prompting these ensuing comments lol... sorry OP!"
"""Well. Time to move to another country... AGAIN."""
He should do it again when he's not high.  Dad is just jealous he's never had the guts to do it in front of everyone.

"I guarantee now that you’re gone, she’s going to zero in on a new target. People like that never have one specific problem with one specific person. Their lives are just a long string of interpersonal conflicts.

I wonder how many customers the gym is going to lose before they figure out that the common denominator is her."

"My daughter was putting on fake nails the other day and spilt some of the glue. No biggie. Until she screams and rips off her track pants.

I once hit a golf ball with a metal baseball bat. It rocketed off and went through the neighbors window and wall. My dad was pissed. 
"&gt; I said I feel like I’m being harassed and they basically just repeated that she isn’t technically doing anything wrong.

At that point I would've asked to speak to someone above that person. I feel like these kinds of places just aren't interested in actually *managing*; they just want to run their stupid classes and make sure people clean up after themselves and call it a day.

But if you used that language and said ""This woman is harassing me every day"", then it doesn't fucking *matter* if no-one else had a problem with her! How is that relevant??

This gym sucks. If I were you, though, I'd write a letter to whoever actually owns that gym, note the number of times you complained, the number of times you were harassed, the specific things that woman said to you (including intimating that you would masturbate in the fucking shower!), and that you lost your temper after however long of this and them refusing to take your concerns seriously.

This is some BS and I imagine someone *might* care but, at the very least, you'd get the satisfaction of calling them out for failing to actually manage the situation."
"I almost did this. Then my dad, who was watching me said “Don’t do it that way, you’re not aiming it straight enough.”

Yup, then he took the bow from me and shot an arrow straight up. We lost sight of it instantly of course. My dad and brother just stood there watching for it. I ran and jumped into the back of our car, hoping the thin sheet metal would offer some protection. Not too long later, we heard it land in the woods we were standing next to.

I still can’t believe it was *my dad* who did it instead of warning me not to..."

"I’m not a parent so I guess my next comment is unqualified and would be different if he were my kid and all that , but...Why the hell do most parents just fucking SUCK. Not in the sense that they don’t love their kid but in the sense of, when their kid does something like this as an obvious fucking accident , in which they know he’s medicated , they know most teens masturbate , *his dad knows damn well he did when he was younger ..shit he still might do it too* ... Why be all angry *still* , like a bitch and increase the mental scars on the kid, I understand initial anger but to be all angry still! As an adult? Come on get over it, and why over fucking react and consider “sexual therapy” , thusly telling your son what he did was completely abnormal when you know he was blasted on medication . The poor kid right here on Reddit explained exactly what happened ! He was medicated and confused, he didn’t whip his thing out and jerk in front of his family while completely sober. The parents are both adults they know most kids masturbate as their first form of sexual activity , especially boys. They act as if it’s such an insane thing. I just think the best response would be to firstly , be upset that he did that and say you can’t do that in front of others just to not totally justify the behavior but then secondly be a fucking person and understand he was medicated , third, be there for the kid and say “hey don’t be embarrassed, it was a mistake, your not a bad person for that mistake bud, it was kinda fucked up, but we understand you were drugged up and what not”. Nah instead they’ll just mentally scar the kid even more than he should be for this by being a little upset child (dad) and by overreacting to normal sexuality (mom)."
This....would probably be a good investment.

Immediately realised there was a surprised guy sitting in my passenger seat that hadn't been there when I got out, looked around in wide eyed shock and realised I'd got into a complete stranger's car. Leapt out, with the passenger emerging like a torpedo and looking more irate than surprised by this point and asking me what the fuck i thought I was up to?. Skulked away to my own miserable car trying to gather the shreds of my dignity around me while the girl wet herself laughing. Drove meekly out and went home and cried into my tea mug. "

Then he turned around and started saying it to me, over and over.


Mind you at this point we are on a very populated beach. Our family doesn’t really know yet and people are starting to look. My smart ass 10yo self was a bit pissed that I was repeatedly told to go fuck myself so I thought it would be funny to correct him. I ended up telling him that I had made a mistake and it wasn’t  really “fuck you” it was “fuck me”. Needless to say my cousin starts running around saying “fuck me” over and over again. By this point people are staring and my parents finally notice.

I would tell the gym ""I told you she's been bothering me and today she accused me of bringing a vibrator into the locker room - it's my hairbrush - you didn't tell her to leave me alone despite me outlining the harassment I've endured, so I rightly told her to fuck off.""

If they said some shit to me like ""You're banned from the gym"" I'd say, ""No, you need to fix this - tell her to leave me alone. She followed me into the locker room when I went to change and accused me of masturbating. She's stalking, harassing, and now *sexually* harassing me - deal with it or I'm filing a police report.""

Then I'd leave and just come back the next day like nothing ever happened. 

If they gave me shit next time I'd file a police report - make them give me her name, address, etc. - have the police get the information if need be. Be a complete nuisance - eff that noise.

I'd make sure that the police knew my grievances were ignored by the gym staff - the steps I took to mitigate the situation on my own (her switching times also is pretty damning - ""What else am I supposed to do?"").

I don't like being a dick, but when someone fucks me over like that I will say nope.

Telling someone harassing you in the locker room to 'fuck off' after you've complained about them previously and nothing has been done = completely justified."
"I have a similar story, must be about 20yrs ago. Was shooting arrows with my stepbrother in our backyard, which was adjacent to a golf course.

We shot one arrow up in the sky, panicked, shat bricks and ran for cover, then saw a lot of commotion on the golf course. Turns out the arrow very narrowly missed a group of guys teeing off at the nearby hole.

Wasnt hard for them to figure out where the arrow came from what with our targets standing in the backyard. We apologized profusely,  claimed of course that it was an accident and that it just slipped as we released. 

Got away with it. 

Never shot arrows in the backyard again."

I looked to my right and there was a cute girl in her car next to me.

We made eye contact as the light turned green and without breaking eye contact she smiled at me and took off - immediately rear ending the white van in front of her 😂

As I was driving away we made eye contact a second time and the look on her face was absolute shock.

The looked at it, called it a slight 2nd degree burn and coated it with a thick layer of silvadene. Half hour later I was in serious pain. My mom rushed me to the ER who took one look at it and told her I had a severe third degree burn. 

Turns out the cream insulated the heat and it basically cooked my flesh. So yes, for the love of whatever you hold holy, never ever put cream on a burn until you've gotten all the heat out. Best way is cold water or ice packs wrapped in wet cloth. "
These were my first thoughts too. The family is probably super duper religious.
"I once had pains in the appendix area and I went to the doctors, they sent me to the hospital and I had a scan done and it showed an enlarged appendix. The pain went away in the morning and I was let go, I was just dehydrated and had a large organ (not the right one though), but the nurse told me “you are SO lucky that you got the doctor you did, he is the only one that doesn’t like doing unnecessary surgery.” 

The other doctors there must suck. "
"Buy yourself a beautiful plate, only for you, and eat from it every night. 

I get it. It sucks to be left with everyone else's clean up after doing all the cooking as well, but for all the work you do you deserve to pamper yourself - even if it's only by eating off a pretty plate at dinner. Simple things can make so much difference.

You deserve more than eating straight from the pan and burning yourself. Trust me. One more plate to wash is better than this, especially if it's a special one."
