"NONONONONO!

YOU, The Company, gave us the option to suggest restaurants, so I did.

YOU, The Company, decided to put those suggestions into a democratic vote.

YOU, The Company, failed to screen the choices or look into the restaurant chosen as the winner

YOU, The Company, continued to fail to look into the venue as you organized your event, and several managers OK'd all these decisions.

So don't come blame ME, the lowly employee, because YOU were neglectful an undiligent in your duties of planning this event.

"They should've known what each and every suggestion was... I mean, if someone had suggested a $100/plate restaurant, and that was chosen, it'd also be a huge issue. 

Sounds like the person whose as should've been on the chopping block did a lot of finger pointing. What idiot agrees and schedules a company meeting at a place they don't even google? If I had to schedule my companies IT all hands meeting, I'd even go and eat lunch at the chosen resturant the day before, as my boss, his boss, and all the directors would know I set it up!

"Minus the threesome sounds like a story about my wife‚Äôs ant and uncle.  He has a fake leg and she is   schizophrenic. When they get mad at each other she hides his leg and he hides her meds.  But they have been together for probably 40 years so... whatever works.  

A few years ago they were driving on a road trip and she starts having an episode.  She forgets who his is, thinks she is being kidnapped and started yelling at truckers on the highway about it.  She starts to open the door at 70 MPH so he slows down and pulls over truckers do so also and she runs out of the car to the truckers asking them to save her.  One of the truckers pulls a gun and her uncle puts his hands up.  Through an intense couple of mins, he tried to explain the situation. They of course don‚Äôt believe him. Then he finally asks the truckers to ask her what her husbands name is.  She tells them and then he asks the truckers to pull out his wallet and look at his license.  

Turns out the name she gave was his so things started to chill out a little.  Ya know, the trucker puts down the gun.  But still a pretty interesting series of  events.  "

"I'm hijacking this comment to point out that OP is 100% fucking insane. [OP wants to milk hamsters and make hamster cheese.](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/7t0ovp/hamster_milkcheese/)

&gt;I've been curious about hamster lactation for the purposes of making cheese. There's a huge lack of literature on hamster lactation cycles and I'm beginning to wonder if this project is possible. This is a serious project.

&gt;1) how much milk can a healthy hamster produce per day

&gt;2) what species produces the most milk

&gt;3) is hamster milk suitable for making cheese

&gt;4) what kind of equipment (if any) is suitable for milking hamsters

&gt;5) will hamsters keep lactating after they've finished rearing

OP's comments are even better.

&gt;What are you planning on doing with hamster cheese?

&gt;**Eating some, selling the rest.**

&gt;**Can't afford enough hamsters without being sure I can make enough cheese to turn a profit tbh**

"\[Warning: gross\]

I can sympathize--that's pretty much exactly what happened to me early in grad school. I was spending the summer in Seattle with my girlfriend (away from campus in Chicago), and wasn't 100&amp;#37; sure how my crappy student health care would transfer, so I didn't get that nasty infected ingrown armpit hair looked at. Right before we left to drive back home, I had these reddish-white streaks up my neck and extending down my arm, and it was oozing a little, so I finally went in to the local university clinic. They freaked out, put me on an IV antibiotic drip immediately. 

The fun part was how they dealt with the infected armpit abscess, which went in pretty deep. The doctor basically had me lie down and raise my arm, and then they put on goggles, put one thumb on either side of the hole and just put their whole weight on the infected armpit. It geysered blood and pus. It hurt so much, I cannot even. They told me I couldn't leave until the infection reduced, and if the wound closed the abscess would reinfect, so they stuffed the infected hole with a wick-like gauze that stuck out of my armpit to keep it from closing.  Every day, they'd pull it out and pack in new armpit wick, as the inside healed.

The thing is, we had to get back, so my girlfriend was shown how to do it, and on the road trip home, she'd pack my nasty armpit hole with gauze while I screamed/whimpered. (If that isn't true love, I don't know what is.)"

"If the Company is ever sued for any kind of discrimination and/or hostile work environment based on gender of employees, then you can 100% bet a lawyer is bringing up the location of the quarterly corporate meeting.

This is actually discussed in business management classes nowadays, as female employees feel left out and belittled when business related events take place in such establishments.

This isn't OP's fault and I think his employers understand this, but this has a huge potential to bite them in the ass down the road. It just takes one unhappy female employee to sue for this meeting to be brought up and discussed. 

Also, could you imagine what the public reaction would be to hearing this on the news? ""Oh they held a CORPORATE MEETING at twinpeaks... of course the person suing must be in the right. This Company is sexist."" so on and so forth"

OP tried wayyyyyy too hard
"It was cute, but when you havent been laid in over a month. Dammit, it sucks."
Congratulations on accidentally evading putting your dick in crazy. 
"That's a pretty monumental FU. Imagine being the owner and finding the door to your livelihood unlocked and the fucking safe open as well! You're lucky they didn't completely lose their shit.

Protip: When you lock a door, test it. Then test it again, while looking at the door and thinking very clearly ""this door is locked and I checked it"". Do this every single time, without exception.

Now when you get home and think ""oh shit did I lock the door?"" you'll know for certain that you did.

Do this on the safe door as well, obviously."
