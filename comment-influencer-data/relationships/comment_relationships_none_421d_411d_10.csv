&gt;And what are you doing for her in return? Do you help with the kids once you're home? Cook some of the meals? Take out the trash? This post is very ""me me me what I want what she does for me"".

Help out?  He's a father, he'd better do a lot more than help out.  Both my wife and I work but it she was a SAHM when I'm home I'd encourage her to go do whatever she wants so I can spend alone time with my kid.    
"
"“Let’s have a child together” is totally different than “lemme put a baby in you.” Language is telling, this is not some superficial game of semantics. "
How can your gf complain that your Mom doesn't work when she doesn't work either? I don't get that at all.
"This is an excellent point that I didn’t even think about. OP, listen to this person. Spot on."
"Take it or leave it dude. She can easily find someone who doesn't care/is into the same things.

1. Have friend who made a hand puppet out of a roadkill squirrel that was still warm. Is happily married with a kid. 
2. Ok and? Lots of people do this
3. As someone who wants to go to the poison plant garden in the UK - I am awed.
4. So she's more steampunk than 90% of steampunks.
5. Orgy beds are awesome. I'd be all over that bed in a heart beat.

Dude ignore your idiot friends and ask yourself, do her quirks add to who she is or take away from what attracts you to her? Your GF is the sort of person I'd hang out with and if I was single and she was into girls the sort of woman I'd date. Nothing wrong with realizing you want someone mundane, but don't break up with her because your friends are children."
"&gt;he's really not doing anything wrong and shouldn't be expected to read my mind and always act accordingly.


Luckily, there is a pretty easy solution - have you ever said something like, ""Hon, sometimes I am in the mood for that but sometimes I'm not. Can we come up with a way for me to signal that I need something a little more serious?"" 


Like, just tell him you're not in the mood? He shouldn't need to ""sense"" it. "
"Is staying with her parents in the short term an option? I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease when I was in college and took a medical withdrawal for the semester to live with my parents and get my condition under control (in part because I couldn’t/wouldn’t share a bathroom in the condition I was in). I recognize she’s older and probably out of school, but I’d recommend considering that as an option if at all possible. You don’t say what condition she has, but if it’s Crohn’s/UC, it could be many more months or even years before she has any semblance of a “normal” relationship with the bathroom. If her moving out in the short term isn’t possible, I’d suggest finding a 2/2 apartment or moving out on your own. "
"My husband and I are a bit like you and your bf. I will browse imgur and crack up, but he doesn’t even crack a smile at the things I show him. However, I constantly make him laugh with sarcastic remarks and jokes. He often comments that he doesn’t understand how someone so funny has such terrible taste in funny things. 

I used to be offended that he wouldn’t even smile, not even fake smile, but we came to the compromise that he’ll share in whatever it is with me, as long as I have zero expectations from him. "
He's definitely going to need the help of a mental health professional who has experience in these issues. You can check Psychology Today's website and filter by specialties. Losing weight is difficult enough for a person who DIDN'T have a near death experience/traumatic medical experience at a young age. It's especially difficult if he uses food to comfort himself or as a ritual to feel more secure (which is entirely possible since your parents were shitty); he's just turning to his source of comfort to comfort himself after something very scary.
"When my boyfriend and I had only been dating for 4 months, we were still very shy around each other. It's almost been 3 years now and obviously the shyness has faded. But I definitely wasn't comfortable enough to get shitfaced and do stupid things in front of him at the time. But hey, I guess he should've broken up with me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Maybe it's just me, but why do you care? That's their private life and they have no obligation to tell anyone.


&gt;I just feel as though my entire friendship with them is based on something else other than us just being good friends. I feel as though they always looked out for their interests first before they even considered hanging out with me. What they did was 100% casual and open, but it pains me to know that all those days I thought we were friends were just based on them screwing and having me as an option to hang out with afterwards.


Where do you even get this? Just because they bang doesn't mean you come second. Even if they truly were looking after their own interests first, what's wrong with that? They like each other. Honestly this whole thing reads like you had a crush on one of them and now you're upset.  

People have sex."
"The OP says in another comment but basically the bride used to work with them all. She left before OP's girlfriend had enough time to get to know her very well though, so that's why she didn't get an invite :)"
"He was very open with the situation too. After they swapped the kids on Sunday he came home and I asked how it went and he said ""She was being EXTREMELY nice and it was REALLY weird"" and he was very up front and told me that she is trying to win him back and get back together with him. 

So I absolutely 100% trust him, I just don't know how to stay calm/not jealous in a situation where they are alone together discussing custody. "
"This is tragic for all involved. 


I could definitely be wrong on this, but I think that personally I would not reach out to the family. This would be a complex thing for them to process emotionally; obviously it is not your fault in any way that this happened, but I wonder if they would be able to see it objectively right now. I think it could be very hard, as a grieving mother or sister, to make sense of their emotions toward you. I would err on the side of not reaching out, for fear of causing more pain or turmoil during what is certainly an incredibly fraught and difficult period. 


What you could do is do something to recognize his struggles and his passing that felt right to you. Is there a local mental health organization or suicide assistance organization you could donate to, in his name? Or perhaps you know of a cause he felt strongly about during his life that you could support in his name? If he loved animals, for example, you could spend some time volunteering at a shelter if finances are tight. 


Alternatively, if there are any mutual acquaintances or friends you have with him or his family, you could reach out to that person and express support for his family and see what they say. That person might be able to give you some insight into whether contact is welcomed or not. "
"If my relative sexually assulted my SO I would probably have a bad reaction. That doesn’t mean someone has anger issues, that means they have emotions. "
[removed]
"Why are you trying so hard to protect your husband from reality? Your husband would most likely be WAY better off with these people out of his life. Of course he will grieve the fact that he has a shitty family, but better that he grieve them and get over it than to keep *hoping* they will be good to him and keep getting disappointed over and over."
"Boundaries. If your fiance is constantly fighting, it means she's not setting good boundaries. Sometimes you just have to let people believe whatever stupid-ass thing they believe in - by themselves.

I would have one final, very succinct conversation with her that went something like, ""*MIL, we know you do not believe in having a child out of wedlock. However, we do not share those values, and as I have explained to you already, getting married will jeopardize our employment. So we will not be getting married. And we will not be discussing the matter with you again.*"" And if she brings it up again, leave the room, or hang up the call, or whatever. Don't JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain), don't continue to engage, just move on. Let her be pissed off by herself and move on with your life. 

I had a very religious, crazy right-wing, manipulative grandmother, and I was the only person in the family she didn't try much bullshit with, because I cut her off for a year at the age of 20 when she tried to guilt me about religion. I literally hung up on her a few times after politely explaining that I would not discuss the topic, and refused to respond to subsequent furious, blaming letters. A year later she wrote me again, no apology, but was (mostly) as nice as could be from there on out. Everyone else in my family got guilt, shame, and lectures until the day she died. These kind of people will eventually respond to hard tactics if you have the fortitude to wait out their manipulative BS. I bet it will be the same with your MIL - cut her off at the pass a few times, give her 6 months of solitary sulking, and then send her a cute baby picture and I bet she'll be willing to hold her peace in order to see the grandbaby."
"After reading the comments though I love how everyone is all “what about the care these animals need?!?!”

OP has a PhD in herps (reptiles).  They know what they’re doing; most researchers themselves have labs with living herps in them.  OP has also stated that she knows a bunch of people in her field in the event she goes away for an extended period of time, and also I dunno  how much you all understand about herp care but because they’re cold blooded and not daily feeders they’re fine to be left alone for a couple of days."
"Sounds like my abusive ex too! He would always start fights and expect sex to fix things. If I said no, he’d claim I wasn’t working to help heal the relationship. It was very manipulative and abusive on his part "
"I love the ""sit in class with her!!!!"" person because they got so snotty when people said they had jobs.

""You can't tell me you don't have a day off!!!"" Most people's days off are the same days kids arent at school, and they cant just take random days off in the middle of the week to go to 9th grade algebra."
"&gt; Problem is whenever we're not fighting it's a great relationship. 

For you maybe. But if you're really going days/weeks without talking to her, with no end in sight, it's only a matter of time until she dumps you.

I agree that the way she's handling her reactions is immature and unhelpful. But this :

&gt; there might be days/weeks where we don't see each other etc.  people.
&gt;
&gt; talking about my ex, etc. 

Would be a deal breaker for most people. I wouldn't want to date a girl/guy who I only saw every few weeks and who wouldn't stop talking about their ex.

&gt;Funnily enough, this was exactly the reason why I broke up with my ex

And why you'll break up with your next girlfriend, and the next one after that. 

&gt;hence why I wanted to set things straight in the beginning

It's easy in the beginning, when you're blinded by infatuation, to think you can handle this sort if thing. But as the reality of not being a priority sets in, it starts to leave a very bitter taste in the mouth. Especially since I don't see anything here about you compromising with her. It seems to be a very your way or the highway

&gt; but I just can't handle these silly games and meaningless fights.

I agree that the games are silly. Beyond silly, really. They're childish to an extreme. But the fights - they're happening because she's expressing her needs and you're unable, at this time, to meet them. If you think her needs are meaningless, then this relationship is already over. It only remains to be seen which of you will leave first.

Look, you don't sound like a bad person per sé. But between your work and other goals, it doesn't sound like right now you have the time it takes to commit to a relationship. It also sounds like you're lacking the empathy to be a good partner. Maybe this is a temporary thing because of the stress. Maybe this is a skill you never learned that you need to teach yourself. 

Either way, it doesn't sound like you're in any place in your life right now to be in a real relationship. I think you should end this and find yourself a casual FWB situation with someone that's happy to hook up once in a while and do their own thing with other people the rest of the time."
"&gt;She asked him if they could ""talk alone"" this weekend 

Maybe she is concerned about the woman that moved in with her children after dating her ex-husband for five months...

"""I deleted his entire account and app off his phone"" Power move, girl, you go! Yeah, I'd move on to someone who respects you and your exclusivity."
"I'm really not sure what it is. Sometime's she comes off as insecure and I've explained that I'm not going to just run off with somebody I spoke to for 5 minutes but she says she's not worried about it. 

She has these really purist views on being a lesbian and I'm pretty sure she's against the idea of lesbians ever having had sex with a man. This put her into conflict with our relationship and she's taking it out on me like I deserve to be punished for being honest. "
what's the difference
"&gt; I'm also curious . . . How does she feel about bi people?

That's like poking the hornet's nest with her. She has some pretty negative views on bisexuals. Some of those views did cause clashes with other activists on our scene but she's also a popular person and a lot of people don't really challenge her as much as they should because they are worried people will take her side. There are some friends she has around her that hold extreme views who are a bad influence. I don't really like those friends and think they bring out the worst in her. "
Lol at the top physical shape.
"From the language you use, it's clear that you're self aware and have some understanding of your emotional problems. It makes sense that you're terrified of expressing any sort of negative emotion because you learned at a young age that there were dire punishments for doing so. It's also clear that you have no model for what a loving, healthy relationship with mutual respect and appropriate boundaries looks like from your parents. It's not surprising, then, that you were worried when your boyfriend wanted to spend a few hours out with his friends, you interpreted that as him abandoning you. Please understand that him wanting some time alone, or with his friends does not mean he doesn't love you, and that you need to give him that space, and trust him. 

It seems that your communication difficulties and extreme fear of abandonment are causing huge problems in several aspects of your life, and you need to learn some effective ways of being able to express your needs and ask for what you want, methods for self-soothing and self-validation, and healthy ways to manage your extreme anxiety. This is not something you can learn overnight, and I would strongly urge you to seek therapy. I have dealt with some of these issues myself, so I know it's not something that will go away on its own. 

Your boyfriend sounds loving, supportive and emotionally intelligent, and I'm sure he's willing to work with you as you develop the skills that you learn in therapy. I can see that you're aware of that and willing to put in the hard work, so I think you're already on the right track. Now, go do some internet research, make some phone calls, and find a good therapist in your area. Good luck! "
"Your wife is one more pushy phonecall away from being cut off permanently from a relationship with daughter and grandkids.

"Chill out. For the victim of rape, sexual assault, statutory rape, etc. going through an investigation and trial, especially something that could be widely publicized, can be extremely painful and traumatic. Not every victim of abuse has it in them to be raked over the coals and publicly exposed like this, and implying that they have a responsibility to do so is to ignore the psychology of abuse and the public perception of/reaction to abuse victims who speak out."

"You talk a lot about how his sister doesn't work, but *she took care of her sick mother for two years.* That's one of the hardest and most unappreciated jobs you can do. In terms of market value, it's worth a lot more than free rent. Just split the damn money. "
"Omg I agreed with everything up until the last paragraph, please don't dump human excrement on the ground, its disgusting and unsanitary and a breeding ground for disease. Dog shit on the ground is bad enough. Plus it would likely stink up the entire apartment in the summer if you left the windows open."
"&gt; It's disgusting and violating for him to save day to day photos of friends for the purpose of masturbation.

100% agree. And on top of that, I can’t believe he tried to brush it off with “it doesn’t matter, it’s just a nice body”.

That’s just blatantly a lie. If he simply wanted to see a nice body, he’d just look at porn. Instead, he’s specifically looking at pictures of peoples he’s known in the past (including exes).

Whether he’s getting off on the emotional history he shared with these women, or it’s some form of voyeurism, it’s *waaaay* beyond “just a nice body”.

OP, don’t let him convince you that you’re the problem. **He** is the lying creep here."
"I think this is a very strong part of it. 

OP's fiance is looking around her house with OP, at all the things she will be co-owner of when they marry. And she wants them to be *her* appliances, that *she* picked out, not some leftovers from a past relationship. If OP were to say yes to her ridiculous idea, I wouldn't be surprised if she were to immediately come up with a list of very particular top-of-the-line products she's been eyeing off, that she no doubt can't afford on her own salary.

I really do wonder if she really hates that the appliances once belonged the ex, or if she just wants the pleasure of brand spanking new appliances that she can guilt out of OP."
"Dope. This is going to be really long, because I want to make a point.

Over a year ago, I broke up with a guy who I dated for three months. He had done the same sort of stuff that your ex did. I had slept with a couple of people already in college, cause hey, fuck it (literally heh). And all the time, even RIGHT AFTER we would have sex, he'd go off about ""i'll never be good enough for you because you sleep with everyone and this will never be enough"", making me out to be some unfaithful harlot. Anyway. Awful, codependent relationship, so I broke up with him.

He started spamming me the instant we broke up, and, like the above comment, came to a party at my house and took advantage of me after I had too much to drink. I can't remember anything, and I felt so sickened that I didn't do anything about it. Later, while I was studying abroad, he would get drunk and stay up all night just to spam me so I would wake up (due to the different time zones) with hundreds of messages. I thought I couldn't block him because he kept telling me he would kill himself if I did.

When I came back, I went to therapy, because in my head, if I got therapy for the situation, maybe it would go away. Obviously, it did not, because he was the instigator, and refused to believe he did anything wrong, and that **I was somehow the source of his problems**. By this point, he dropped out of college, started smoking cigarettes and drinking every day, and told people his ""whore ex-girlfriend"" was the reason why his life was in a spiral. My therapist, for whatever reason, said that my idea of having some sort of mediated talk with my ABUSER would help, so I went ahead and did that with a few of our mutual friends who had not, to this point, realized how shitty he had been. (Abusers have a good mask, and I hadn't told anyone the extent of what he did.)

After the mediated talk, he would just start spamming me again, with hundreds of messages every night about how I ""embarrassed"" or ""shamed"" him in front of our mutual friend moderators, and how I have ""ruined his life forever"" (this was ten months after our three month relationship). He later made this big drunken show of drunk-driving his truck out to the mountains with his handgun and threatening to shoot himself, and would ONLY communicate to anyone through me. So I had his parents calling me all night till three AM, begging to know why their son would do such a thing. Of course, he didn't actually go through with it--he just wanted to control me again. Like a dumbass, I agreed to talk to him in-person the next morning, because I was scared shitless after having to interview with the police after we had reported him missing. He seemed awfully happy with himself, because he knew how to control me.

After that, I realized he was just playing me. His shenanigans had ruined my semester, and every morning, checking my phone to see him tell me over and over how it was somehow ""my fault"" that he became a fuckass loser dumpster fire was making my brain melt. So I finally got over his threats to kill himself if I blocked him, and just fucking blocked him. Haven't talked to him for four months. Blissful silence. He has since moved to another state, so I don't even have to worry about seeing him by accident.

Last week, out of curiousity, I unblocked him on one account to see if he was still spamming. **Still is, a year and a half after the fact, in a new state, with a new job.** How....just sad. Blocked again.

These people cannot be reasoned with. I wasted a year worrying about the piece of shit who was making my life hell. Please don't do what I did and ""try to work it out""--this is not your fault, no matter what he says, and **you owe him absolutely nothing.** End it now. Permanently. Your ex will show you his crazier side if you bother to entertain the notion anymore. Keep blocking. **Don't give him a shred of hope.**

Edit for grammar"

Get tested and get ready for him to pick not you. He'll either pick her or wait for another time to cheat.

"No way you’re definitely not doomed. Put yourself out there! If you find a girl that you like, take it slow. When you feel comfortable, explain your situation to her. I can 100% promise you that if a girl genuinely likes you for you, she will not care about any of that. "
I think it is both. She can have depression and still be milking poor OP. Her depression doesn't excuse it but I think he really needs to push for her to see her doctor about post partum depression. 
"There's some strange behavior on both sides here. It sounds like he's stalking you, which is really freaky. If I were in your position, I would end the relationship, because it doesn't sound like this guy is respecting your boundaries.

That said, for YOUR future happiness, I question whether some of your boundaries make sense. You absolutely never have to get married again, that's fine. But not allowing your SOs to meet your family? Have you sought treatment for your PTSD? I wonder whether you're living like this unnecessarily because you haven't properly processed your trauma."
His time in the military is what made me agree to take him in. I'm glad it's not just me seeing it.
"Aww, don't read this sub when your'e about to get married. OP's situation is not the norm!

"&gt; She also took care of their mom for the last 2 years as she battled cancer because she was the only person who could (since she lived with her parents). SO's other two siblings have jobs and live 1-2 hours away (as do we) although we all would come up frequently on weekends to help out.

&gt; Sister is expecting a baby in 6 months and they only have husband's income (which is paycheck to paycheck).


I think for these two reasons, you guys should share some of the money with her, or set it up in a fund for the baby. I don't think ou are fully grasping all the emotional and physical aspects that go into someone dying. I don't think it is fair to refer to her as just unemployed, because taking care of a dying person, especially one you love, is a lot of hard, sad, and sometimes gross work. She probably saved the family a shit load of money in home-healthcare costs. 

I'm not saying she deserves all of it, but I think giving them a portion, not even necessarily half, would be a really good measure since she had to take care of her mother and is expecting. Or you could set up a little fund for the baby, or get them a really nice, generous baby gift."
I've lived with an alcoholic. Here is what you do .. you ditch her before it becomes a daily occurrence :)

So what happens if you guys get married? Sister wouldn’t be invited right? You don’t invite people who hate you and don’t support the marriage to the wedding. What if you have kids? You wouldn’t allow someone who hates you or your spouse to meet or have a relationship with your kids?  Where’s the line? When will your BF shut her down. Will you ever have his parents support?
"Yes, and she’s not getting the major thing she needs out of the relationship. He could be a billionaire genius philanthropist and it still wouldn’t matter. She wants to be loved and to be told she is loved. He can’t give her that. They are incompatible."
"If your bf is too anxious to be able to speak at something approaching a normal level, and to the point he'd rather learn ASL, then he needs therapy."
People don’t recall half the folks at their wedding but remember with clarity who attended a loved ones funereal.

"Ok -- not to be ""that guy"" but I saw your post history (basically just living on the r/amihot and r/rateme  subreddits) and if you're spending that much time looking at other peoples physical looks it seems to me like physical attraction is something really important to you and you should let your husband go and find someone who checks your boxes."
"&gt; The problem is, I have no evidence that he actually lied because I can’t prove the thing about the clubs.

This isn't a court of law. You don't have to meet legal standards of evidence or convince a jury. "
"He sounds fantastic. 
&gt; but he has anger problems.
&gt; told me that he was going to ""fuck her, and then show me the messages between them so that I feel stupid as shit"""
"This!! I had the same scary relationship. He’d act like a toddler anytime I wanted to do anything away from him. He’d call me 25 times every time I went out. I’m not even joking. This was before text messages. He’d show up unannounced at my house.

I ended it and cut him off completely. He stalked me for 1 year after, it was brutal.

Run run run. It is a type of emotional abuse in my opinion. I felt stuck in a cage. And he would try and guilt and manipulate me using words like “I just need you” and “I just love you so much”. It was horrible. 

Run run run."
"Christ on crumpets!

It sounds like anything that could be seen as remotely ""non-feminine"" is ""toxic"" to your wife these days.

She needs some serious therapy, and a new mommy group to hang out with."
"I imagine it's because they talk about this school so much that OP sees his son explode about it, whereas I doubt they talk about Mom much (just like this post). So OP sees his son upset about the school and doesn't even think that there might be more to it. Hell, the son might not even realize that much of his anger is displaced grief. Not a lot of emotional IQ to go around, it seems."
"yeah, I used to say that. They'd say ""well, wow, you should move those fragile and dangerous things higer up. What do you expect when there are no toys for Junior to play with"". Wut? SHOULD? in my own home? yeah, dont expect to be invited back any day soon."
"If you can't talk to her about this then you are 1000% not ready for marriage. You *must* be able to talk about things like this with your spouse. She's supposed to be your spouse in one month. A piece of paper and a ring won't change how you communicate, so you have to just do it.

For your own sanity, for your own sake (because you deserve a partner that loves you the way you love them, and not to be strung along), you **need** to confront her **ASAP** before this wedding. She sounds like she's getting majorly cold feet and has already postponed once. These are not good signs. 

""FiancesName, I was using your computer and your search history is filled with articles and searches about not being with the right person/should we breakup/etc. You already pushed back our original wedding date. I need to know what's going on and whether this is what you want or not""


Be blunt. Be direct. If she needs more time then postpone the wedding indefinitely until you're both 100% sure, but be prepared for a breakup. I'm sorry."
No its not appropriate he's being a creep. Dump his ass
"I would honestly be incredibly hurt in your position. Both by his making fun of you to his friends, and his utter refusal to take responsibility for disrespecting you and hurting your feelings. He said something incredibly hurtful, and he's acting like you're some unreasonable woman who can't take a joke or control her emotions?

&gt; if he decides I'm being too dramatic by suggesting marriage counselling.

If he thinks you're being overly dramatic for wanting marriage counseling, you might as well just send him the divorce papers. He hurt you - he doesn't then get to decide that you're overreacting. 

Tell him you want marriage counseling. But I wouldn't be in a hurry to invite him back home just yet.

This is the right reaction. This teacher is being ridiculous. No one would ever use the word daffy as a derogatory term unless they were bugs bunny or from the 60s. She is trying to start drama where there shouldn't be any. Talk to the administration about her actions and her threats against your family's stability 
"All great points! Also, just because she gets married doesn’t mean her role is now solely “wife and mother”. She probably started to feel suffocated and unheard knowing that her feelings wouldn’t be taken into account, that OP’s wants would always take precedence, and could see how this dynamic would play out the rest of her life. "
"You should talk to her. She is your sister, the two of you are close? Voice your opinions, remind her there are other options. Stress that the way he is treating her is being seen by their child, and that could do emotional damage to the kid. "
"&gt;Here’s another example of an incident that happened. He promised that he wanted to propose and then he proposed to me only to take the ring back several hours later and humiliate me in public. He laughed when I cried when he not only ended the engagement, but dumped me at a Starbucks in public. A few days passed by and he called me apologizing and wanting to start over. He blames the entire events on ideas his mother put in his head. Against my better judgement, I gave him another chance

oh OP, WHY. That is one of the worst things I've ever heard."
You sound like you might give me the creeps if you talked to me by the way you described yourself on here
"&gt; So after being told multiple times that it’s unrealistic for us to get an apartment and that her family doesn’t support it, I figured we needed to be more secure finically or something.

Since you can't seem to read between the lines and take the hint, have you considered that she doesn't want to live with you? "
"I feel like OP feels like such a victim even though his gf clearly tried to communicate her feelings and he brushed them off every time.

She clearly stated what she was thinking and feeling and he just told her she was wrong.  Part of being a good communicator is being a good listener and being able to understand.  He feels she has no empathy but the person I see lacking empathy in a big way is him.

His gf would be better off without him and maybe he’ll learn a lesson about what being a partner is.  "

"Do whatever you were doing before because that obviously made him happy (he kept hanging out), and comfortable (he told you). Maybe say, “I’m sorry you’re going through this, but I still like spending time with you, and even though I might not know the exact right thing to do or say, I’d like to be here for you when you want.”"
"I don’t think that anything that anyone can say to you here is honestly going to be able to help you. While I never lost my whole family all of a sudden, both my parents died less than a year apart when I was a freshman/sophomore in high school. My brother and I were orphaned and were lucky to be taken in by my aunt.

Life can be shitty sometimes man. I hate when people told me sorry for my loss, I’m here for you or God has his reasons or to turn to the church. I understand that they are just trying to be nice and help me but sometimes it’s not what you need to hear.

As someone coming from a similar situation, I’d recommend that you seek out professional help to help you overcome the grief and to help you assimilate back into society. This will help you move on from the tremendous loss you suffered.

One way I always tried to live, is to honor my parents by my actions. I always tried to do right, go to school, joined the military and just worked to be the best person I could be.

Once you start feeling better with the help of a professional, maybe you can get back into sports, school and a social life but it’ll take time.

I wish you the best in your life. Always try to remember when it gets hard that life is not over. There are people out there to help you and care for you."
"&gt;We don't know when they want to come in September (didn't even know they were planning to come)

Then yes, absolutely say ""See you another time."" The end. Don't even mention September because they didn't have the decency to mention they'd be visiting or ask if that's ok."
"He’s also likely projecting his guilt on to you. What you’ve said also sounds gaslighting as shit. He’s making you feel guilty for something you should have ZERO guilt over. You did nothing wrong. He is the one who made the choice to end the relationship. Period. The fact that he is sending you on guilt trips now, should indicate to you the type of long-term life partner that he would be. "
It sounds like this arrangement wasn't working out as well for your daughter as it was for you. Maybe things will go better when you don't live together anymore.
That's kinda their point isn't it? Tricking them into hating eachother would cause drama.
It will not be easier to pull off an international move with a newborn. You're either stupid or deluding yourself/her in the hopes of trapping her in the US. 
"But a dude who hides his drinking, drinks most days, and gets SO drunk that he needs to be bodily moved off the couch is going to be a negligent father. You can't be an attentive dad if you're passed out from being drunk."
"First off, not every dollar is equal.  A $ from her is worth more *to her* than a $ from you is *to you*, because it represents a bigger sacrifice.  To someone who is quite poor, losing $5 might mean them having to skip lunch that day.  To a richer person, an unexpected expense of $200 might mean cutting back a little that week.  To a billionaire, a few thousand dollars might be hard to even notice.  Paying half the mortgage payment in a ""pretty expensive area"" will be a bigger sacrifice for her than you.

Second, you're together with her (I assume) because you feel like she's an equal partner that contributes in many ways to the relationship.  Money is just one of those ways, and if she makes less than you, then presumably it makes up a smaller share of her contribution than it does for you.  But you're still getting the benefit of whatever else she does!  (Unless she does nothing else, in which case, why are you even in this relationship?)  You're focusing on the monetary terms (I put in $X, she puts in $Y, then we split the equity 50/50 when we break up...), but there is, or should be, *so much more* to this relationship than the money.  If all you think you're getting out of this is house equity, why are you here?

&gt; I don’t know, am I being unreasonable?

You are being reasonable, inasmuch as you are advocating for something that benefits you, and everyone should always be their own strongest advocate.  However, you *also* need to consider your girlfriend's point of view, and reach a compromise where you guys are both being treated fairly.  Your current proposal (a 50/50 split on a mortgage payment which she can't really afford and which you easily can) does **NOT** treat both of you fairly given the situation you've outlined.

If you don't want to scale the contributions, then here's another solution:  Pick a mortgage payment that she can easily afford, and then you match it.  Yes, you'll end up living in a much, much worse location than you otherwise would, but now you're contributing evenly, and that's the only other viable option here.  Either you chip in more money, or you make more of a sacrifice in living conditions."
"Bipolar meds and weed are a terrible terrible combination.  So it bipolar itself and weed.  Your husband is on meds, which is a start, but what he REALLY needs is intensive therapy to learn to manage his mental illness.

Buying a farm was a super bad idea.  I think you need to sit him down and tell him that the farm isn't working, and neither is the way he manages his illness.  Insist on selling the farm and moving somewhere easier to live and close to mental health treatment.  Insist he go.  If he refuses, you need to leave him.  "
"I wonder if I can get away with this without being blasted for gatekeeping - I swear I'm in no way a watch guy/expert, but:

"&gt; It’s not like she bought the guitar either it was given to her when she was 8 or 9. So really it’s basically my guitar.

"It is your bf's decision.  However you do make it sound as if your desires were a huge part of the decision:

""...the strain that medical school puts on you, the time commitment, how hard it is to have a family, the fact that I wouldn't be able to continue the relationship (I would not be willing to make the huge sacrifices to both my personal life and my career)."" If you say, as you were essentially saying here, if you go to medical school I ma dumping you"" then any defense you have to his parents would be disingenuous.  Breaking up with him is your maximum leverage and it was part of the decision.  My suggestion is that you don't try to do anything with them about this and if your bf is very successful in another career track then maybe it becomes a non-issue.  "
"My (now ex) wife was drunk one time and got pissed off at me enough that she said she was leaving. She didn’t know where she was going to go but she was leaving for the night. Ok. Fine by me. I’ll happily take some peace and quiet for the night. She grabbed the car keys to leave and I confronted her. I said “you can go anywhere you want, but you cannot drive you’re drunk. Call a friend, get an Uber, start walking. I don’t care but you cannot drive.”  She had every intention of driving. I wrestled the keys away from her, and in the process I grabbed her arm and left bruises. 

For years she accused me of beating her that night.  I didn’t beat her, I probably grabbed her arm too hard, but she couldn’t under any circumstances drive.  For the amount of accusation I got, I might as well have slapped her. "
They waited 7 years to punish you for a tattoo you got at 19. You absolutely can't trust them in any way.
"We have plenty of sympathy for your son; he had a number of terrible life experiences in just a very few years. It is completely understandable that he's feeling so rough, but that's neither here nor there.

YOU need to stop talking about that school. Stop. It's over. It's done. There's no changing it. Your older son has a degree, and what you need to do now is handle ALL of these issues better going forward. Your older son needs to be in therapy, and probably medicated - that's not an insult, it's a sincere suggestion. My girlfriend had to drop out of college after a severe back injury + losing her athletic scholarship + her dad cut her off for losing her scholarship. In short, she lost out on her dreams for her education, too, and it hit her HARD. It took time, but with therapy and medication she's doing much better now. This is what you should focus on.

As for your younger son, you've already made your decisions. He's going to ""that"" school, so there's not much to say there. You can't mediate his relationship with his older brother either, and it seems clear that your older son at least doesn't want your input on this topic anyway. Let them work that out between themselves. Focus on the here and now: get your older son in therapy!"
"Fair Warning: He's going to resent you and your younger son for a VERY long time for this, maybe forever. 

Breaking this news to him is also going to send him into a major spiral. So, be prepared for that."
"Right, I understand it 100% sounds like that. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. But what I don’t understand is why her bf would go through all the trouble of meeting her father? And telling her father he would marry her? Also when she has been going to client dinners, the clients have been congratulating her because apparently her bf told them he was going to propose to her soon.   Why would he do all this? 

Of course I told her if I were her I would’ve dumped him years ago. Purely the fact that he hasn’t taken her to America after the first year is absurd. There is no way this scenario will ever work out. I just don’t know how to navigate this with her as I don’t want to be the mean one to point out the writing on the wall."
"If the timing of this was going to be that he wasn't around when the child is born I might have another answer, but I think this is a good solution. Consider it temporary, and something you both need to get through to be really prepared for this child. Work with him to limit this to not extending beyond a date you both define (the 5 month thing makes sense). If it's so much money you can quit your job, you can break the lease at some point even if not right now. 

I hate to say this because I know you have a lot going on, but I'd see it as a selfish choice to ask him to stay with you if it meant remaining in financial hardship and not having a clear path towards preparing for your child's arrival. Don't sacrifice getting your child's life, and your new lives as a family, off to a good start by insisting he stay with you. "
Having sex with you with no protection without your consent is technically rape. He doesn’t care about your sexual boundaries. That’s a huge red flag. You’re dating a shitty selfish asshole. 
"&gt;I turned out pretty decent considering

Huh, it's interesting you feel that way, cause to me it seems like you're just replicating the same dysfunctional environment you grew up in."
"It's not emotional abuse to point out that a relationship isn't working for you, or that he's not going to hold up his end of the bargain. Your ex has shown that he's a user and a loser."
"You're in an abusive relationship. None of this is okay or normal. Tell him that he gets into anger management treatment with a mental health professional or you're leaving. Period. You and your child should not be subjected to this. You have to get out or your child's psychological health will be in jeopardy.

&gt;I just can’t get past the point where I feel like he is my soulmate

That is the abuse talking. A soulmate would never treat you the way this man does."
"Oh well then if you are both going to stubbornly ignore the only obvious and easy and painless solution...

we certainly arent going to provide you with ammunition to bully your wife into changing her (perfectly reasonable ) opinion.

Hyphenate and end the madness."
"Not enough detail here. What mistakes did you make, what are your problematic behaviors? If your wife is saying that she ‘lets’ you do things, perhaps she means that she makes a conscious effort to give you the space to have a life and enjoy your hobbies, and instead of you doing the same for her, she just gets to stay home with 2 kids and one on on the way. Are you just taking her for granted while she drudges at home every day and you are off mountain biking? Or what? Need some details."
"I am not on the spectrum and that conversation would make me uncomfortable, if that helps. 

The bit about ""liking our little conversations"" is creepy. "
"I would. I would be livid at being unwillingly thrust into his adulterous bullshit and would inform the wife without thought or hesitation. 

She deserves to know, if she does not already, exactly what her “husband” gets up to for her own health (regarding potential STD exposure) at the very least. "
"What was the fight with his friend about? 

Sounds suspicious. At the very least, he’s avoiding talking to you about it because he knows you’re upset. "
This is the best answer here.  
You're being 100% reasonable. 5 years is a long time to date for him to still feel unsure. You need to know if he's gonna be your future or if he isn't. 
What the fuck does who started the fight matter? Are you implying that if she was actually the instigator then she would have been obligated to sleep with him after a *2 hour long* argument? 
We’re all on the same page that if there’s a divorce and B gets together with A afterwards we don’t want anything to do with it. If she was so ready to cheat on her husband then I don’t see any reason in the future why she wouldn’t be ready to cheat on him if they end up together. 
"Great idea! After all the comments, I can totally see that I am going over waaay too much when he asks. Sure I bring some stuff to do (homework, books, etc.) but I could be out with my friends rather than sitting there passing time. "
"I'd let your/his manager know, it should be easy enough for them to cerify he hasn't done any of this work. Colin sucks and he is trying to make things worse for you and everyone else you work with."

He sounds like he's a very difficult person to please.

"&gt; My wife says the teacher said it's not enough for her not to call our son ""Daffy"" in class but that we, as parents (and the rest of our family) need to stop calling him ""Daffy"" because it will cause him a lot of mental anguish in his future. She told my wife that for us to continue calling him ""Daffy"" is an issue for protective services and could get us in a lot of trouble. Especially, she says, since she is a legally mandated reporter for instances of child suffering.


Call in the principal and school counselor, and ask them, very seriously if they endorse this teacher's views.  Next call is to a lawyer, if the principal and school counselor do not tell the teacher to STFU."
"Ok, what is weird is counting them, thats weird.
Here is what is happening. She's washing her hair, and running her hands thru her hair, and instead of washing off her hands and letting them go down the drain to clog the drain she's putting them on the shower wall.

Source: every shower in every girls gym has hair on the walls. MY shower at home has hair on the walls. Every shower in every sorority has hair on the walls.

Honestly every time I do it I think ""don't forget to get the hairs"" and every time I forget. And I'm 45. LOL - its just a thing, its not malicious.

But back to my point, you can focus on the teenager if you want to ignore your actual problems, but that won't solve anything. If you want to solve your problems you're going to have to talk to your GF. Its her daughter, she has to address it."
"You've got two issues. First, don't ask out women, compliment women, or interact with women who you don't know while they are walking down the street.  That is not how you are going to get a date, I suggest online dating apps.  Women walking around are not really looking to be asked out by you, especially extremely attractive women who are unfortunately routinely harassed by men when they are just trying to live their lives. Second: your view of women, and the feeling that you need to ask out every attractive women you see on the street or that you need to say hi to them seems to be stemming from a subconscious sexist attitude you have towards women.  This is not an attractive body walking around for your enjoyment, this is someone who was born a certain way that you happen to enjoy, there is nothing this person is doing to call out to you for attention.  This person is not thinking about her body or her looks when she is walking down the street, she's thinking about where she might be going, her friends, family etc.  Think about it, what makes a good relationship? having mutual interests, hobbies, likes, lifestyle.  You can't get that from just looking at a person.  As someone said bellow, women are not just sexual objects.  Women have thoughts, opinions, feelings, problems.  These people walking down the street? They're just like you.  They put their jeans on one leg at a time, poop, fart, burp. "
"I see way too much of myself in your comment. Passionless, never had a spark, didn’t miss him when he was gone, and we went on a tropical island vacation during which he hadn’t even considered proposing; when he did it was such a non-event I didn’t know if I should tell people it even happened. We never did celebrate.

I broke the engagement at 27-nearly-28 and girl, let me tell you, that relationship had been deflating for a long, long time before we finally called it but when we did, I came home that night and broke down in my doorway and just cried. 

I was so *relieved.*

I saw nothing when I thought about our future together. I saw what he wanted, but I was so apathetic I was just going through the motions. I, like you, thought it was a choice between passion and stability, reliability. When I left I was *excited* about the future for the first time in ages. I’d venture a guess I should have felt that way about getting married.

Dating in your late 20s/early 30s is the best. People are upfront, you’re better at weeding out the bullshit, and you know better what you’re looking for. That means *you don’t have to settle.*

Everyone’s stories are different, but about a year ago now I happened to force myself to go on a date I’d already rescheduled twice that I didn’t think would go well. It was lightning striking the second I saw him leaning against the wall waiting for me. He had broken up with his ex-wife in the same month I’d called off my engagement. (The dating market stays busy, promise.) We have (so much) passion, amazing communication, tons of fun, travel lots (without fighting!) and he helps me grow as a person, encouraged me to make a career shift I’d wanted and that has improved my entire being, our friends have all but merged into one supergroup...I smile spontaneously through the day because I’m just so excited that I get to spend my time with him. I can’t wait to get home, every single day.

I don’t expect your story to match mine. But don’t settle. It’s not fair to him, and it’s definitely not fair to you. There’s a reason people are constantly chasing love, actual real full love. It’s out there and it’s great and it’s worth the search."
"Yep, agreed. He's moving way too fast!"
All she did was point out that you can't take your anger out on people. Which is TRUE. She stood up for herself when he bullied her.
"&gt; She gave me the impression she was innocent and shy when I first met her.

&gt; I met her at a club (she slapped my ass to get my attention) and we had sex on the first night. 

Just out of curiosity, please square that circle for me.

But yeah, none of this seems legit me a good idea if you are looking for a stable, committed relationship."

The first thing is weird. The second thing is sociopathic. He ruined his friends wedding for a laugh and his motive seemed to be to try to encourage people to drink too much for his own amusement. 
"I have to say, the way that you guys talk to each other sounds pretty unhealthy to me. Before any of the other issues, I'd take a hard look at how you communicate with each other.

What? How is this healthy?"

"Honestly, after reading through what the OP said in comments I’m not sure she did have concerns. She made what sounds like one joking comment, which he found funny and let go. Then when she was later distant he assumed maybe she wasn’t joking, must have found something in the credit card statements that actually upset her, and got angry at the fact that she was judging him for his past and “violated his trust.” 

She might not have been upset at all, OP seems to just be spinning out because he didn’t just ask his wife why she seemed kind of distant. "
Your boyfriend is being really weird. I'd just tell him (politely) that he should step off it.
"It definitely sounds like the mother being in the household is not helping their marriage, but they have *many* other issues, and the solution should *not* be ""kick your mother out ASAP"" because wow.

This sub gets all the horror stories of parents living married couples and how terrible it can be, but it is very normal to put up a parent for a while when the parent has no other choice and is vulnerable (which considering the mother is trying to get into assisted living, means she is vulnerable). So yeah, not a very constructive take at all."
"Dude, don’t dump her yet. You’re gonna need her to make you a salve for that burn"
Agree - definitely not favouritism. He shouldn't be treating the girls like he treats the boy. He shouldn't be treating the boy that way either. He's just a (sexist) crap parent who is screwing up his kids in two different shitty ways.
"I mean, can't your husband pull himself together enough to ask them to leave? 

"
It sounds more like OP feels like his gf is changing in a way he doesn’t find attractive. I think that’s okay to admit without saying she’s sick or wrong. It does sound like she has taken this to an extreme though with forgoing her other more active hobbies. They could probably work out their differences with a lot more compromise 
"Yes.  And also, I think you should discreetly give a heads up about his behavior to women new to the group so that they know not to invite him over to their place.  "
Don’t like it if they’re doing it right in front of me. I know they’re going to think other people are attractive. So do I. It’s completely normal. But check them out when I’m not right there 
You're not overreacting. This guy is showing all kinds of red flags. 
"A specialist wouldn't describe a normal amount of child empathy as ""low empathy"" though. They mean low *even for a child,* which is concerning. "
"Ewwwww, pack his stuff up and dump him. Tell her parents!! He is a predator. "
"It seems like your brother has allowed his gender role stereotyping to leech into his previous marriage and is probably projecting some feelings and beliefs from his wife onto his children. Unfortunately not a ton you can do since you don’t see them too often and they are most largely influenced by their primary caretaking parent.

I also would stress that it is not necessarily “great” that the boy does not cry or complain often. Maybe he truly doesn’t experience feelings of sadness, frustration etc but it is more likely that he masks them with “I’m ok” to appease his father’s expectations and is afraid to let him down which can create a cycle of toxic masculinity.

Things that you can do include encouraging the boy to express his feelings or provide an emotional outlet whenever you meet. With the girls, role modeling in terms of strength, hard work, engagement can go a long way not only by yourself but also with media figures, stories, movies, books, etc. It’s also important here to not DEvalue stereotypically “feminine” things like caretaking jobs, expressing feelings, dolls, shopping, but that they can be interested in these things and synonymously/simultaneously be driven and successful.

When they get older and the age of consent to seek mental health treatment with a counselor or psychologist, if they show signs of emotional distress, maybe encourage them to see their school counselor."
"You aren't abusive. He's twisting the situation. Let him go back to mummy and daddy. He's their problem now. Don't support him financially. He isn't supporting you in any way. He wasn't ""your rock for a few days"" he acted that way to manipulate you when it suited him. He can't really stop you from ending things. He succeeded once from stopping you from breaking up with him. Don't let him succeed again."
"That part genuinly pissed me off. Blood rising and all.

And i don't even like children that much and don't want any. But even a guy with not a sliver of desire to have a kid understand why OP was upset.

""didn't want us to be able to say goodnight ""

The fucking nerve."
"I read the story... I’m sorry you’re upset but I don’t really see how this affects your friendship. Because you were unknowingly third wheeling? It sounds like they actually do care about you as a friend so I don’t really get the big deal. When you texted them did you want them to say “sorry, I was busy having SEX” instead of “sorry, I was napping”?"
Why don't you take her name if you want everyone to have the same name? Is your name so unique and heritage important that you have a non-emotional logical reason? I agree with your wife that it shouldn't be automatic to put your name on her or the kids.
"&gt; Jokes about hurting me should be off limits. 

That's the key part of this whole exchange, because while making jokes like that might be ""who he is"", not liking them is who you are, and that matters too! While fine, he doesn't mean them, and I'm prone to bad taste/pitch black humour myself, the thing that matters is that you don't like those jokes, they upset you, and you'd like him to stop.

He can make a million jokes about other things, you're not asking him to rewrite his personality. You're making a simple request to not make a specific type of joke about you. He's taking it as some sort of attack, rather than viewing it broadly through the lens of ""my partner's asking me to stop doing something, her feelings matter to me, so I'll make an effort to make this small change"".

Ultimately, you can trust him, know he doesn't mean it, **and still hate that he does it!** If my wife asks me to not leave dirty plates in the bedroom, I'm not going to start analysing why that is, or justifying myself, or telling her why I think she's wrong, because none of that matters. It's a reasonable request, I want to consider her feelings. That's it. He's not doing that, and that's the problem, not the content of the jokes."
"&gt;(she was on the team too, and got tired of the drama)

Perhaps there is something more going on for her, like she had a bad experience, was getting treated differently for being a woman, or getting plenty of unwanted attention when she was just trying to be part of the team/enjoy robotics making her feel like she was forced to quit - or maybe it's just that the team is all teenage drama and she's trying to move on from that.  Perhaps I'm over thinking this, she could have just been done with it, but sometimes there is more going on that what people will directly say and she's projecting all of that onto you, or perhaps perceiving you not quitting in solidarity as some sign you don't care enough for her (which is absurd)

Regardless, you shouldn't stop pursuing your passions for someone else.  It's not unreasonable to make some time to hang out with her, as you have been doing, but still keep pursuing your interests, especially if they help further your career.  It's way too early to make any kind of sacrifice for a relationship, there are plenty of women out there who will love you and your love for robotics.  I only bring up the above points in case a conversation helps clarify what's really going on for her."
"Going to be honest with you, I would leave her out of this. If she doesn't know you very well, your fiance could be talking about you to her (not in a good way) and more than likely she will have his back over yours."
"I agree that it's probably an outlet/stress reliever. The gym thing is a good idea! I'll definitely bring it up. 

Thanks :)"
"Lmao having her over to fuck herrrrrrrr. Dude he clearly wasn’t over his ex and he’s definitely thinking about other people while fucking you, like his coworker. I would leave him, people who love and respect you don’t make that mistake twice, much less even once. That’s bullshit. "
"No. Thanking for having a crush ? No way.  If you had said it at 14, it would have been cute or age appropriate but not now. "
"For one, it's illegal. They could lose custody of their children"
"Yeah, you’re emotionally drained because these two are sucking you dry. Your low life GF is teaching her daughter how to not work for a living and just find some shmuck who will support her in the future. I couldn’t note one positive thing in your favor here. Sorry to put it so bluntly. You’re only slightly older than I am and I couldn’t imagine living in that situation. Leaving will make you feel so much better and lighter and then after a couple weeks you can focus on why you allow people to walk all over you and why you ignore clear red flags while dating. "
"&gt; you're replacing me with a toy and ruining your sex drive. 

But you literally just asked him for sex a few minutes before that?  So obviously he is your first choice??  Yeah, he's making way too many assumptions about sex toys.  Sure, they *can* be a replacement for sex, but you aren't using it that way.  

I think you need to have another sit down conversation with him when things are not already tense and emotions are flaring.  Tell him that you got the toy as an *addition* to your sex life and not as a *replacement*.  You have a higher sex drive than he does and that's okay, just like it's okay to masturbate when he isn't around or doesn't want to have sex.  He is mad about something that *hasn't even happened ye*t, and that's not fair to you.  Take the toy out of the conversation for a second, is he happy with the frequency and quality of your sex?  If he is, then what you do otherwise shouldn't be a concern.  If he's not, then he should start there and not throw around blame and accusations.   "
"I have a similar idea. When I had younger children, I'd give my (now ex) wife $100, get off work early (2:00) and let her have a mommy date. She could do anything she wanted! Hang with friends, buy a book, go out to eat, and I would take care of all household details. I'd do my best to make sure that the house was mostly together and clean when she returned that night or the next morning.

Do that every week or two. We'd also hire a baby sitter and go on extended dates, just us, about as often. "
"You declined to dance with this person, so you can not be accused of  dancing with someone else. You were dancing with your friends on a dance floor, so of cpurse there were other people there, so you can’t be blamed for dancing ”too close” so another man. You were groped against your will, you were assaulted, and no one but a terrible person would try to blame you for that. You immediatly got away from the man who assaulted you, so even the most jealous person should think you handled it appropriatly.

Your boyfriend has no reason to be upset. Much less kick you out in the middle of the night. But the thing is that your boyfriend already knows it’s not reasonable to be upset about this, and doesn’t care. This isn’t about you being inappropriate whilst in a relationship. This is about you being put and having fun with your friends! Abusive people hate it when their partner have friends, independence, or do things to make them feel good, like going out and celebrating a good friends upcoming marriage. So they try to stop you from doing it. The most common way of doing is to wait until just before or aftter and make up and argument wherein they yell and mistreat their partner. Eventually the partner makes the connection that everytime they go out and have fun alone they end up feeling bad and like a bad person, so they do it less and less. Unfortunatly, the connection that their abusive partner is doing this deliberatly to make them do it less and less is more difficult to make.

Your boyfriend yelled at you for being a victim of sexual harassment. Your boyfriend reacted extremly agressive and put you in as bad a situation he could (alone and outside at night, possible drunk). Your boyfriend deliberatly starts fight when you are having fun with your friends. Your boyfriend has done this before. Your boyfriend has done this often enoug that the people that care about you are telling you he is bad. Those are all extremly clear signs that you are being abused!

But sometimes it’s difficult to recognise how bad our relationships are when we are still in them. Please go to the website loveisrespect.org and check out their respurces. They have a quiz you can take to get a more objective look at were your relationship is at, but also take a moment to talk to one of their representatives. You can do it really easily by starting a chat right on the website and they will try to give you advice and support.

Also, don’t lie to your friends to protect your boyfriend. It’s instinctual to want to protect the people we care about, but when we protect others at our own expense or lie to peole we care about, we are compromising ourselves. If you need to be alone and scared to protect your bf from a little dissaproval, then it’s not worth it. It also shows how little you value yourself and that you need to work on improving you sense of self worth to be able to be happy and healthy."
"Not only that, he makes discussion about it difficult by guilt-tripping and name-calling. I think that's the subject of the conversation OP should be having with her husband, before anything else. "
"Exactly this, don’t feed into her jealousy by entertaining her nonstop questions. I’d give blanket answers or just kinda shrug off any specific questions with “oh jeez I don’t even know how many carats, I just love my ring no matter what!” And act kinda ditzy back to her questions. Or just straight up ignore the behavior after a day or so, because if you’re not giving her any attention I’m sure she’ll just drop it. Or maybe she’ll do something else attention-seeking but hopefully won’t involve you in any way. I’m sorry she’s not outwardly happier for you, congrats OP! "
"Hi OP.

I am going to assume you are in the US.  You didn't specify.  There is legal aid in every state.  You can get an attorney for either free, or little cost to you that will either provide you an attorney for the divorce or walk you through the process.  Usually when you call and go through the intake process, you will be given the choice.  Given the complexity of your situation, I'd go with the attorney.  .Unfortunately, most states have a waiting list.  I would google the number for your state and get on that waiting list immediately.

I'm very sorry you find yourself in such a tough situation.  I hope that you will be able to get yourself and your kids into a better environment where you all can thrive.  If you need help finding those resources, feel free to message me.  Good luck!  "
"I don't know if this would give you an angle, but it sounds like your childhood situation was because of necessity, whereas right now your relatives want you to house their children because of *convenience*.

I think you should absolutely draw a line that there is no way these relatives will live with you. The easiest thing to do would be to give an unequivocal 'no' and let that bridge be burned, but your parents would probably draw the brunt of your relatives ire, and it doesn't sound like you're okay putting them in that position. Don't give in to your parents, though (Do they live with you, and would they have to live with the relatives who want to move in? Don't let someone with no skin in the game make this decision!). Instead, see if you can get them to strategize with you on how to maintain this boundary. Can your house be under constant work / constant bug problems / etc that will make your relatives decide they don't want to move in with you? Can you be 'stuck' with a *terrible* roommate they definitely don't want to live with? Can you put your relatives on an information diet (why do they even know you have so many rooms in your house?)

Honestly I think a little of what's happening here is that your parents are hoping you can 'repay' the 'debt' that was incurred in your younger years, but honestly I think this is a debt that will never be repaid. Your relatives will milk their earlier 'charity' for *aaall* its worth, and trying to chase their approval will only bleed you dry (financially, mentally, etc).

OP, you're in a really, really good position at only 27 - do not compromise it trying to placate your relatives, *even if* it means your shitty relatives keep being shitty towards your parents. You cannot fix their cruelty, not with money, and not with love."
"&gt; but it almost sounds like he knew he was going on a trip to Europe so he  broke up with you so he could have the freedom to sleep around on the  trip

yeah he probably tought he could seduce scores of ladies and realized he's not that attractive and going back to the safe backup with a sob story.

pathetic."
"I think it’s normal for a girl to look forward to a proposal, I know I did. And you let what your friends said get in your head. You went on those dates with expectations that weren’t even things you wanted, but you were disappointed because you couldn’t get them out of your head. Next time, maybe bring it up with him? I think the best solution to most relationship problems is communication. If you would’ve just said to him
“Hey my friends are making a lot of jokes about us getting engaged on this trip. We’ve been doing a lot of romantic things and even though I’m not ready for it, I can’t get it out of my head” and then had an open and honest conversation about what that meant for the two of you, and he could’ve assured you he wasn’t proposing and then you could’ve just enjoyed the trip for what it was, a romantic getaway with a man you love. "
"Ya but it seems like grandma is playing a big part in this situation. She’s not getting the kind of access she wants, so her son is divorcing his wife. Not cool. 

The point of right of first refusal isn’t to never allow other people to watch the kid, it’s to prevent someone else from CONSTANTLY taking over parenting duties. 

He doesn’t get to leave his wife, take the kids part time, and hand them over to his mommy. "
"She shouldn’t have to ask for it, honestly."
"You spent a lot of words telling us how great he is, which makes me think that you are taking his lack of attention and affection as an insult. But to me, he sounds like an introvert who lacks empathy. That is his weakness, not yours. His ability to focus solely on his work did allow him to accomplish great things, but the cost is his personal relationships. Love him for who he is from a distance and look to other people for company and closeness."
"Not just for the birth, but moving forward! I have two friends with young kids. They were drinking one night and their little boy accidentally poured scalding tea on himself. Neither parent was in the position to take him to urgent care because of their drinking and his burn ended up being more severe than it needed to be. They felt so terrible they stopped drinking altogether after this incident."
"He's jealous and into your wife.

He is not your friend.

You don't have to create drama, but if some comes your way you can always pitch it back at him."

"Even before the edit op was pretty clear that ‘taking care of mom for two years’ (in the way many are assuming she did) wasn’t what happened. Sister happened to be home because she chose not to work. She didn’t sacrifice a career to care for mom. She cooked a couple meals because she was at home, not working, by choice, long before mom got sick. I’m not sure how people misread this."
"Nice try at academic language, really solid effort so I'll give it a B+. Calling someone a creep is not intended to make them feel good, of course it isn't. It's meant to shame and ostracize them for unacceptable, violating behavior. It's not only mine and everyone else's right to creepshame, it's a social obligation to stamp out the behavior. "
"This. Your mum books a flight and demands a pick up from the airport? Say ""that's nice, but I didn't invite you. I hope you've got a hotel picked out. Did you want me to call you a taxi?""  

Or, better yet, go no contact and stay no contact. It doesn't seem as though your mother adds anything to your life other than steal your belongings, aggravate and disrespect you. And her attempts to extort money out of you are her attaching strings to control you."
"Nope. Dog's don't belong at work. Period. He may be a micromanaging asshole, but he's also correct.

It's unprofessional. Lots of people don't like dogs. You got no business bringing her. What made you think you could? Sure, the president approved it, but the president is wrong in this case. She IS distracting, to you, to everyone around you. And to people who dislike or are afraid of dogs, distracting to the point they can't work. You don't *know* that nobody has a problem with her, they are just too polite or non-confrontational to tell you."
"Eh, I would think more that it’s her way of feeling like she has to ‘compete.’ Maybe ex posted a cute new pic somewhere, or maybe op’s girlfriend is suddenly feeling insecure. I wouldn’t say it’s cheating, just that for whatever reason the ‘ex’ is getting to her somehow and she’s over compensating. Or buttering him up to get rid of the appliances haha."
You have to put your foot down on this one. Some people just arent supposed to be dog owners. They need love and attention and not just walks - the walks are not supposed to be the most time you spend with your dog. They are living and affectionate beings - not a trophy.
"I feel so many emotions reading this post. My dude! Take a step back, take a breather, and think about things logically without emotion. There are things that can be changed and things that can not be changed.

1. You can not, in the near future, move out of your current apartment. You mention you make $31k in NYC, I'm assuming you are in public housing and also receiving other government subsidies. Without any of this there is 0 chance you would be able to find a place to live for just you, let alone your entire family, within 50 miles of the city with that income.
2. What you do with your own money, for your own family, is none of her business. You mention your mother does not have legal status so her ability to gain meaningful employment is minimal at best. You will always need to provide some level of support for your mother and there is NOTHING wrong with that. That said, there is nothing impeding your GF from getting a job. She has 0 excuse for not contributing.
3. Why are you paying for a baby shower? Two financially strapped people should not being blowing money on something superficial. Plan a small party at someone's house, people can volunteer to bake or bring food, and then they can bring gifts. The end. Save that money. 
4. You can have a fulfilling and loving relationship with your child without being in a relationship with its mother. You can co-parent without being together. When the baby is born get a paternity test and once the results are in immediately take it over to Family court and file papers to get a custody agreement ironed out. There are resources available in NYC to assist you if you don't have funds for a lawyer. "
"My parents met at a prestigious university, but they never really held it up as this incredible place where all your dreams come true. We visited there often, we would stop by the places they went to as college students, and I enjoyed my time there, but I never felt pressure to go there. It is an incredibly expensive school. I got into that school, and the big state school, and in the end I chose the big state school because I couldn't think of a reason to go to an uber expensive school that was only marginally higher ranked than the state university. I had a fantastic college experience, my parents are bigger fans of my college than I am. My mom bought all the paraphernalia and decked out our house with it, and still wears shirts and hats from my college all the time. I don't think I own a single item to demonstrate my school pride, but I had a great time in college and I don't regret my decision at all. I don't understand ""legacy"" families."
"Man, fuck your boyfriend. Wanting to be intimate with a transgender woman is not ""disgusting"" or something to be ""ashamed"" of. If you're feeling merciful, tell him that and tell him you're willing to work together to help him realize that being sexual with her was fine and dandy, and that what he should be ashamed of was feeling like she was a shameful secret."

"Your wife is the problem. She has no respect for you. If she did, she would put you first and would not allow her mother to treat you this way.

You've been in couples counseling for 2 years and she still throws you under the bus and chooses her mom over you. I think it's time for an ultimatum. She either goes no contact with her mom until she begins to treat you with respect, or you divorce.

"
"You need to tell your wife.

Do not downplay it as “just a kiss” or some other thing like that. Your wife won’t see it that way and it will act to diminish how she feels about the situation; she’ll be thinking that you are trying to brush it off as ‘no big deal’ and are not validating her feelings and do not appreciate the scope of your mistake.

You fucked up... you need to come clean and take what comes from it. If you don’t there’s a good chance that you’ll make the same mistake again and/or lose that happy home completely.

"I did on the ones where she forged my signature. This is a different issue. My question is more ethical than legal - I don't legally owe anything on this.

She did not literally.kick you. *He* literally pushed you to the ground. 
"It's not a confusing situation at all. He broke up with you in a cruel way, then he almost immediately got another girl pregnant (unless he got her pregnant before he broke up with you).

Now he's freaking out about the baby because he can't just blow off this girl, and he knows you aren't over him so he figures he can just lean on you for emotional support, and probably practical help like shopping for him. Then when his girlfriend gets too far along for him to want to have sex with her, he'll expect more personal ""support"" from you.

In other words, he just wants to use you. He's transparent as glass. I think you should cut him out of your life, as hard as it may seem, and realize how much better off your life will be without him causing you to doubt yourself unnecessarily. "
"OP stated in the post that he'd consider taking a job with less travel if he and his wife had a second kid, so I assume that has been an option all along and not something that would financially ruin the family.  I get the feeling OP made the choice to have this particular job, not that it's something he has to do to make ends meet.  It's not intrinsically wrong for him to make that choice, but it's confusing to me why he'd want another kid when he spends so little time with the existing child.

Also, there's actually nothing in the post indicating OP's wife doesn't work.  If she's doing almost 100% of the childcare, I can understand your assumption that she's not working full-time, but maybe she is and has the kids in daycare or with a nanny.  Or maybe she works part-time.  We don't know."
"Right?  If he's insisting (and moaning about the expense of!) this traditional wedding, she probably said fine, I'll invite some friends. It's embarrassing to have a damn wedding with only his family. Geez.  Then he beefs about her 40 % of the guest list, sort of...

she needs to speak up and he needs to listen.  Therapy if she's even willing to bother is probably necessary here.  I hate how he talks aboit her changes as she gains confidence.  Red red flag."
" (obviously she fucking didn’t) 

Infidelity is a whole lot more complicated than that, and so is love. You have no idea what went on in their relationship. You weren't and still aren't privy to their private moments, conversations, or thoughts. And your brother is responsible for his own actions. He had no choice in her actions, but he had a choice in how to deal with them. He chose to get high and took too much. That's on him, not her.

Get yourself into grief counseling."
"&gt;What I am worried about is the propaganda she's starting to spread to other people who are going to the wedding, most of whom I don't have much contact with. You see, during my youth, my mom kind of poisoned mine and my sister's relationship with our cousins, usually calling them a bunch of losers and moneygrubbers and thieves (none of which were true, I realize now as an adult). But now that my sister is having a big life event, my mom is using the event as a means to reestablish contact with many of them and use her money to pay for their travel expenses and hotel stays.

Ultimately, you can either make a pre-emptive move by just talking to those cousins, etc. on your own just casually and if the wedding comes up, mention that you have to do your surgery instead - or really, if they're not close family anyway, it really doesn't matter what they think of it. They're not important to your life anyway."

Thank you. I still love her but feel like I've wasted some years.
"&gt;  I just feel so guilty for hurting him unintentionally.

If you think about how he *intentionally* hurt you, you'll probably feel a little bit better.

You'll also feel much less guilty once you realize that this is a manipulation tactic of his.  Not necessarily intentional, but manipulation nonetheless, making *you* feel guilty for *his* actions.

"Op, skip counseling. It’s not recommended for situations where one spouse is abusive. Just leave."
"This is the only reason my parents’ divorce took nearly 5 years. My dad accused my mom of sexual abuse. It was *obviously* not true and they knew it right away but *even then* it meant family counseling, social workers, a guardian ad litem, psychological evaluations, and I nearly had to testify on a witness stand. And that was a man accusing his ex-wife.

Not a fun game and not a situation to be trifled with. OP, this is the kind of thing that could land you on a publically available registry, and if she accuses you her daughter will get dragged through this shit, too. It’s not just a thing that happens, it’s an experience that can change a child’s entire personality. I carry it with me in the physical wiring of my brain.

Counseling. Immediately."

"Honestly, in most circumstances I would suggest ways to help her lose the weight, but because she is in recovery for an eating disorder, any external pressure to lose weight could potentially trigger a relapse.

I am in recovery for anorexia and the unfortunate truth is that it is a lifelong illness. She will never NOT be in recovery. That means that you have to decide if you can handle it, and it is genuinely okay if you can't. It doesn't make you shallow; you should be attracted to the person you're in a relationship with. It's not her fault she struggles with her weight post-bulimia, but it's also not required of you to stay with her if you're no longer attracted to her.

What I will say is that she needs to get back into therapy, especially if you suspect she is still purging."

He *is* an alcoholic.
"It might genuinely be worth showing him the New Yorker Shouts and Murmurs piece called ""*If You Ever Hurt My Daughter, I Swear to God I’ll Let Her Navigate Her Own Emotional Growth*."" It's humor, but it points out a really sexist notion that's persisted for a long time. If he had a son, he proooobably wouldn't care if he had to kiss a girl in a play. But for some reason girls are seen as delicate flowers that must be sheltered lest the evil boys prey upon them and taint them because ""purity"" is oh so important. It's gross and harmful for both girls and boys. "
"You both sound stressed out and like you’re taking that stress out on one another. Yelling at him about a shopping list is not appropriate. Having sex without any regard for your pleasure is also completely inappropriate. 

Couples counseling is your best hope. You both need to manage your stress without disrespecting the other person. 

His racism (asking you if that is how it is done “in the jungle”) is a big issue that I don’t feel qualified to offer advice on. But I didn’t want to gloss over it. You do not deserve to be spoken to like that and it is troubling that he sees you (and potentially your children) as inferior due to your race. "
"I'm surprised your Dr would let that many people in the ultrasound room. They are tiny from what I remember.

I would try reminding your wife that an ultrasound is a medical procedure and not show and tell. They will be examining her to make sure the pregnancy is viable and that things look good.  God forbid something goes wrong, but does she really want other people in the room if something is? I'd try to keep it just the two of you.

But maybe I am overly paranoid...I lost my first pregnancy to miscarriage. All I can say is I'm really glad it was only my husband and I in the room when they found the baby had no heartbeat.

Your MIL sounds incredibly overbearing. You may want to check out r/justnomil for tips on how to set boundaries."
I have sat down with her and told her it's at the point where it's ridiculous and she has to find something. She did get a job last summer and worked 3 shifts and quit. I'm completely doubting her drive now. She spends her days shopping and going to cafes or whatever she likes. I honestly don't know what she does half the time
I just wanted to say that I am this person... a woman in her 20s that no one wants to sleep with because she’s a virgin. Thank you for this response. It’s refreshing &amp; I hope OP takes this to heart.

"I'm going to go against the grain here and offer up a possible different angle on the situation.

You initially said that this particular festival doesn't interest you, but you'd go to be with your girlfriend. Is it possible that she feels like she would end up spending all of her time worried about whether or not you were having a good time, instead of having a good time, herself? Or is it possible she thinks that you only want to go to the festival so you can keep an eye on her?

Just offering up a few different possibilities.

**ETA: your responses here have really solidified the opinion that your girlfriend probably feels like she would have to curb her fun to be responsible for your emotional well-being if you went to this festival; seeing as the only reason you want to go is to be with her.**

**It sounds like the ex boyfriend's reaction is an excuse to get some time away from the crushing weight of your expectations that she is the ONLY thing that makes you happy.**

**Let her go and have some time where she doesn't have to be responsible for your happiness. And start working on finding things that make you happy and fulfilled aside from this relationship, because your inability to do so will be poison to this relationship.**"

Dude, seriously. That is the *bare minimum*. You do not get brownie points for supporting her in something that is a default. You need to step up. Don't wait for her to ask for things. Do things. "
"&gt; Tell her she can have the car back and you will be purchasing a car yourself. 

She can have the car back if she wants to pay OP the $4K difference in ""value,"" and then she's free to sell it for the ""$6K"" she bought it for. Free $2k, why wouldn't she want to take that deal? OP is out a ""$2K"" car and the $2K she already paid her mom. She absolutely shouldn't throw that $4K out the window just to appease a greedy boundary-stomper."

"If he was 22 and working retail and didn’t have any emergency funds because he just had to pay for car repairs or something that wouldn’t be a red flag but a 40 year old who presumably makes  80k or more should have an emergency fund that’s way more than $300. That would be a red flag for me. I don’t need my partner to be rich but I want to be able to plan financially for the long term.

More likely he’s just tight fisted. Some people are paranoid that others will take advantage of them financially but happy to enjoy what others pay for. I once dated a guy who counted every penny spent on me but didn’t consider the costs I incurred for bc, travel to visit him, etc. he ended up screwing me over financially in the end and didn’t get why I was pissed. "
"Don’t OPs feelings matter as well? This behavior is so inappropriate. I doubt wifey would like it if he put his dick on a platter and started running around yelling “who wants hot sausage??!! Someone get me a bun to stick my sausage in! I’ve been handling this hot meat all day! Hey you there, you want some of my Polish sausage in your mouth?? By sausage I hope it’s clear that I’m talking about my exposed penis which is laid ever so tenderly on this aluminum platter.”"
"He needs to know his “niceness” is not being nice to you or your daughter when she’s born. His tolerance of their behavior isn’t nice, whether or not he has a few arguments here and there with them. Actions speak louder than words!"
I would make sure either I or my hubby was at the funeral. It’s your family. Who cares about the money or how close you’ve been lately? If you can’t rely on family for such times then what’s the point of having them? But I’m a bit old school and my family is from the old country. What do I know?
"Having read through all these comments, you might feel like one answer (wedding or funeral) is sitting better with you than the other. In this situation, I would go with your gut. It's so tied to your relationship with the bride and groom, and your step-sibling, that I think hearing both sides and seeing what feels right is best. I'm sorry for your loss, as well, and hope everything goes well."
"I won’t be here to see if he comes home. I’ll be on my business trip in another state. I could ask my brother to check, but I don’t know if I want to involve someone else in my CSI’ing at this point. I would have to explain why I need him to check... "
"I didn't even have to know that your wife was a SAHM to know that she spends WAYYYYYYYYYYY too much time on the internet in mommy forums. You know what actually IS toxic??? Just about any internet forum where people spend too much of their time. Because eventually they become these authoritarian, moralistic places and become all about virtue signalling on their own idiosyncratic ""virtues"" which are super far out of step with normal people. But they do not realize it because they are in their own bubble. It's like that open pedophile who was running for Congress recently. He said something like he was open about being a pedophile because lots of people in the general public don't think pedophilia is a big deal and don't want to be so PC about it. You could tell that this person spends all his time in a bubble of a internet pedophilia forum because he truly thought most people were okay with it. 

In conclusion, your wife needs to get A LOT busier and spend a lot less time on the internet. 

Maybe you should tell your wife it's toxic for your family to have such outdated gender roles that you work and she stays home, and that in order for your family not to be toxic, she needs to start working full time."
"""I work with a bunch of 16-17-year-olds and I cannot even imagine dating any of them. I don’t even hang out with them outside of work.""

Are you a mandatory reporter?

In Texas, ""Section 261.101 of the Texas Family Code mandates that anyone who suspects child abuse or neglect must report it immediately. The report may be made to (1) any local or state law enforcement agency; or (2) the Department of Family and Protective Services. All persons are required to make the report immediately, and individuals who are licensed or certified by the state or who work for an agency or facility licensed or certified by the state and have contact with children as a result of their normal duties, such as teachers, nurses, doctors, and day-care employees, must report the abuse or neglect within 48 hours.""

Furthermore, ""Failure to report suspected child abuse or neglect is a
Class A Misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine of up to $4,000.""

(I'm not a lawyer and I'm not giving you legal advice, I just found this by googling the law quickly). 

In every state I've lived in (none anywhere near Texas) anyone who works with children is required by law to be a mandated report and to report this. If you work with 16-17 year olds there is a chance you are one and were already supposed to report this. Especially if you are in a state that explicitly says if you are a mandatory reporter you are one in your personal and professional life. That said, I'm not clear if by work with you mean you work at job giving you some responsibility over minors or you mean that you work in a job where a lot of your coworkers are teenagers and I also don't know what state you are actually in. It makes sense to figure out if you are one and if so what you are risking by not making that report.

Even if you aren't a mandatory reporter you still have the option to call a child abuse reporting hotline (if she is under 18 this is child porn).  That has some potential consequences for you and your relationship to your family, of course. So deciding whether or not to do it if you aren't one is a different thing.  But what is happening now is really dangerous (I think you know that).  If your parents don't understand that this guy may not be who he says he is and may be grooming her for all sorts of purposes including sex trafficking, sexual assault, etc. that your sister is involved in something illegal that she can be charged for by producing and distributing child porn, etc. then you either need to make them understand or consider involving someone who will.

I'd suggest talking to her first and treating her like a peer when you do.  So expressing concern, stating the risks, stating what could go wrong and right, and asking questions like how she knows he is who he says he is or what she will do if he puts her photos on a revenge porn site.  Also ask if she is prepared to face legal trouble over this relationship or understands what such trouble would entail. If you are a mandatory reporter explain that to her and explain what it means. Then based on her response your next steps should be pretty clear.  "
"You sound too removed from it. If someone involved was one of your good friends, maybe. But I would stay out of this one. They’ll find out eventually. "
"I wouldn't continue to trust her. You were just her security blanket/back up plan and still are. Confront her with what you found, apologize for snooping and ask her to explain herself. At this point, I would probably end the relationship. What she was doing was pretty cold hearted and I'd have trouble looking at her the same again. "
"This reminds me of a thread from just a few days ago where a straight female OP and her boyfriend had been putting off sex for their first year of their relationship. When OP got into her boyfriend's pants, she found out that her boyfriend was a trans man and panicked; he has just never disclosed the fact that he was not a cis male (with no intention of having reassignment surgery).

When OP was upset at the lack of disclosure, her boyfriend told her that it should not matter and that making a big deal out of the fact that she happened to be attracted to men and penises, with no sexual attraction to vaginas made OP transphobic.

Throughout the thread, OP was very concerned that she was being a horrible person. She was reassured by many that she was not horrible, nor transphobic for being mad that her boyfriend of A YEAR decided to lie to her and then be a jerk about OP's sexual orientation favoring men with a penis."
"&gt;  When your hair is your favorite part of your appearance don't go to a student.

This is the most solid advice in this whole thread."
Dude your *whole post* is a red flag. All of it. I think your hesitation to proceed with this relationship is completely and entirely warranted. I don't even know you and I know you deserve better. 
"&gt; Also is it weird the girl is highly religious about abortion, but not on the pre marital sex with guys who are ‘very active’ on tinder?

Not really, I don't think. I know a couple Christians who think that the no sex before marriage is outdated and unjustified, but still view abortion as akin to murder. Viewing abortion as wrong is a much more deeply-rooted and emotive subject. "
"Actually you did steamroll her. 

She wanted a small wedding you didn't, you got your way.
Then *you* got stressed about paying for the quickly growing event *you* wanted.

She tells you she'd like to postpone, 4 weeks before the wedding, *not* breakup and you say ""NO you're being selfish!""

You probably won't see the irony in that through your ""man's point of view"", so I'll point it out. You were selfish and relegated your fiance to a bit part in the drama that is *your* wedding.

To back you up, her friends turn in her...probably your friends instigated by you. She's isolated and painted as the troublemaker.

In the major tantrum you have following you try to berate and bully her into line and when that doesn't work you kick her out of her home.

I'm sorry but you're an ass and it's a good thing she thought about your controlling behavior before you trapped her legally.

Let her go and work on becoming less controlling and full of yourself.

Hope she's doing fine."
"Stop giving specific answers. She asks what you did last weekend, you say ""why do you ask?"" She says ""I'm just curious,"" or whatever, you say, ""Oh, I see. Well, look at this stack of TPS reports, I better get right on these!"" and go back to work.

Or just say with a smile, ""Oh goodness, that's more of a personal thing I don't really discuss at work,"" then change the subject to something work-related, or just say ""I'd better get back to this X (whatever you're working on)."" It's especially effective if use the exact same wording and tone of voice every time, even if she follows up with ""don't be such a prude,"" or ""I'm just curious,"" or ""Why, because you don't want to admit blah-blah-blah?"" trying to bati you into answering, just cheerfully repeat, ""Oh, goodness, that's more of a personal think I don't really discuss at work."" every single time."
"Have I taken back people who have cheated? Yes. Though I’m at a point in my life that I have realized it usually doesn’t work out in the end if you stay. Plenty of people get drunk around the opposite sex and don’t make out with them , if that is in fact all they did. In the end It’s up to you and how you’re feeling about the situation. Can you forgive her and move past it? Is she going to continue to be friends with this guy who she obviously has feelings for? Ultimately it’s your choice but id personally lean more towards cutting it off"
"I have found that being drunk really doesn't change your behavior, it just makes you do stuff you want to do, but stop yourself from doing. I think she wants to behave like that sober, but holds it back. Good luck dude, but I know you can find someone better."
"You're going to send yourself crazy if you keep trying to socialise your kids this way. Seriously, take them to the park, kids' yoga, library story morning, kids judo, whatever. Go places that are already set up for it with people who are already committed to being there and kids already there that your kids can make friends with. Go to the mountain, stop trying to bring the mountain to you. "
"My best friend is 25, her fiancé is 26 and he is currently acting very similarly. By day it’s a lot of “I love you, can’t wait to get married.” And by night with alcohol it’s “your horrible, I deserve more.” The difference is that he is an alcoholic, so she sees this all the time. She is currently attempting to move out because she can’t handle all of the anxiety he causes her. They’ve been dating for 6 years. 

At the beginning of their relationship he would constantly comment on how she compared to other women he knew or her friends, which ranked her self esteem. Over the years he stopped, but he still from time to time will make clear that she is inferior to other women. She more recently went out of town for a week for work and when she returned he downloaded tinder because “she left him alone” and “there are other women who would pay attention to him.”

The reason she sees this so much is because he’s an alcoholic. This is what he actually thinks about her. It’s unhealthy, draining, and overtime has chipped away at her. She’s drowning and is trying to escape, which means she is calling off the wedding. 

Your fiancé has shown his true colors. Please understand that he did you a favor because when someone really shows how they feel, you should believe them. In this case, he showed you that you should run. "
"Buddy, you are not always going to agree with your parents.   In fact, as an adult, you are going to seriously disagree on a number of things as the years go by.   You won't always have their approval.   

Furthermore, as much as we love and look to our parents for support, you must understand that our parents (everyones)  are wrong.   A lot.  So why does their approval matter when they're fundamentally wrong?  

If your parents disapprove when it comes to vaccinating your kids, what will you do? 

If your parents disapprove when it comes to teaching your kids evolution, what will you do?  

If your parents disapprove because you don't send your kids to private school, what will you do? 

You won't always have their approval on everything and the things they approve of won't always be right! 

So when are you going to finally fight back and stick up for the things *you* approve of?  

I approve of you moving in with your gf.   You don't need my approval, you only need yours, but you have it.   Live your life on your terms.   "
"Boundaries aren't some kind of punishment. OP's mental health is just as important as the boyfriend's. 

This response, when dealing with emotionally irresponsible people is perfect. It's clear. It's concice. It leaves no room for interpretation or argument. 

Boyfriend is young, and this is his first relationship. He needs to learn what behavior is not acceptable or healthy before he ends up pushing up a wake of failed relationships."
"I personally think you're past this point. He didn't suggest a feeling or desire of his, he dictated your behavior, and rewrote history, knowingly against your will, in public. This guy is manipulative and skeezy as hell. Worst of all, he cares a lot more about his own desires than your preferences, comfort, intentions, or well being. He showed you as much. It doesn't really matter if your room mate is trying to get with you, because frankly it sounds as though you would be worlds better off. Please, please read these comments and take them seriously. I have rarely been as concerned about someone from reading their post, as I am about you."
"Jeez, yeah, tinder is not a ""friends"" app, and i can gurentee no one on there is looking for a friend either. This is a major red flag."
He's not self identifying as a dad yet. Non problem drinking fathers are plenty sober to tend to childhood emergencies. Children need a clear minded attendant. 
"Her anger isn't personal. It's covering up fear and probably points to anger with herself. Lots of passive, unconfident people hold in guilt and anger towards themselves. She loves you. You did the right thing."
"&gt; She pointed out that we only had sex twice in the past month, and I dont initiate

&gt;I dont initiate

By OP's own words, she WAS the one initiating intimacy."
"Lots of ugly people have faithful relationships and lots of beautiful people get cheated on. Your looks are not the problem.

I would bet anything the real issue is that these women all had some red flags in common that you either didn't detect or chose to ignore. Can you think of what those might be? "
"I lost my mind and uploaded every single text message he ever sent me to dropbox and passed it along to his wife, with pictures, things he gave me, cards, etc.  I then blocked him and have never spoken with him again.  I hope he stubs his toe on every step of his life. 

But yeah, people will do the most tremendous mental gymnastics to get what they want and screw anyone else.

"No offense but for most of human history this is what literally everyone had to do, and in this day and age there are still huge groups of people who are paid to do this as a job or engage in it for any number of other reasons as a hobby (hunting, falconry, abatement, etc). People aren't out of line to judge you. But they're your limits and it's your choice. You should give her our contact info though because she has a lot of friends here."
"Here's the thing about people who constantly bring up an unrelated subject, or who fixate on a behavior in others (like cheating): it's because they themselves are obsessed with it. And usually because they're doing it/thinking of doing it themselves.

It's a ""classic"" sign of a cheater, for example, to constantly accuse their partner of cheating and/or worry about their partner cheating. This is because the cheater knows they are cheating, lying, and getting away with it, so they fear the possibility of their partner doing the same thing to them. It's called projection.

Your boyfriend is constantly telling you that any man you see/interact with is only interested in sex....that means that some part of your boyfriend only sees you and/or women as sex objects. Normal people don't constantly assume every person their partner meets is out to bang them.

I'd call it a red flag. Sounds like he only sees women/you as valuable for sex, and he's (incorrectly) assuming that every other man you meet is thinking the same thing.

Beyond that, he's already showing a *lot* of jealousy and possessiveness. The fact that he's doing it this early in the relationship is even worse, because jealous and isolating behaviors only escalate the more the person pushes your boundaries, so a more jealous baseline behavior means a quicker ascent into full-blown crazy jealous behavior.

Trust your gut. Is this guy someone who only values women for their bodies? Does he see threats in *every* single man in your life who isn't a blood relative?"
That's not what gaslighting is. People in this sub love to throw that word around. 
Wow way to bury the lede - you’re a democrat and not a Christian and you’re wondering why this southern blue collar republican isn’t keen on you? It’s prejudice pure and simple.
This perspective feels really dramatic and immature. 
"If you expect this to be a mature, calm break up. It's reasonable to have a conversation. He might prefer a new spot. Maybe even flip a coin with him. 

But if you both want the apartment equally, the person initiating the breakup should move-out. You have the advantage of having some time to think about this, to make a plan, to accept it. You should offer. 

Also, you're entitled to every item you bought. You're economically distinct people, he'll land on his feet. "
"&gt;  It's just something that's really important to me 

Guess what? it's also something that was obviously very important to her too. So much so that she brought it up with you only a few months into dating!

You're doing a pretty poor job of not sounding like a sexist jerk here, tbh.

"Why does your husband have to continue to be in contact? I for sure wouldn’t allow my children to feel the brunt of this type of humiliation.

Why not just say straight out to them” I’ve noticed that we as a family are continuously not thought of on at the same level as the sisters, and before your unequal treatment begins to emotionally harm my children, I’ve decided to make a clean break from you.  You may find the need to feel as if this is only a retaliation for your financial biases, but it’s really the uneven emotional connections you are not willing to offer to us, and because of that I no longer wish to continue having you both in my life”

Who needs these people anyway? Cut them out and make them strangers to you."
"
&gt; How is it manipulative if I make this clear from the very beginning and tell them that they we should just break things off if this isn't for them? It isn't like I pulled some bait and switch, which is arguably what she's doing considering her agreement to this kind of relationship.

It's pretty fucking manipulative. Do what I say at all times and in all circumstances or fuck off. Fuck off from this relationship, fuck off from the house and your entire life because I can't get over shit with my mom.


&gt;I'm not saying this is rational, I'm saying this is my preference and a hard boundary for me. 

Except it isn't a rational preference to draw lines on whatever you decide 'micro management' means

Your wife is crossing a boundary telling you to fire someone but you can't find even an ounce of sympathy for the insecurity she may be feeling? "
We’re discussing that now...
"About the golf clubs thing, I'd be very wary that he's trying to gaslight you. Just throwing it out there. "
You’d be taking care of one less human while receiving mandated financial support. Sounds better to me.
You took him back on the condition that he worked hard to earn your trust back. Most people wouldn't even do that. Sounds like he's failed to hold up his end. What more is there to say?
"Please consult a divorce lawyer. You have a lot of misconceptions about how a divorce would go down. Your husband would absolutely be on the hook for child support, likely spousal support as well given that you’re a stay at home parent. 

Your life doesn’t have to be this way. Right now, you and your husband are modeling to your kids that this is what a healthy relationship looks like. Would you be comfortable with your kids being treated as you are by their spouses?"
"Yeah, this is what I gathered from this whole post. Seems to be all about what OP wants, yet fiance is going to be wearing the ring her whole life, not him."
"I agree with you, while the son's failure and depression isn't directly OP's fault, she didn't do him any favours by putting all that pressure on him. He maybe felt like a failure and a dissapointment to his family from his freshman year, it wasn't just a case of not being able to go to your prefered college "
"You are an adult, and not his property.  You are not required to ask his permission before traveling, regardless of whether it is for work, pleasure, or a combination of both.  And adding a couple of days for sightseeing onto a work trip really ISN'T a big deal.  IMHO, his overreaction to your independently making a decision is a sign of a controlling personality.  Think back - are there any other times when he's reacted similarly to when you've done something or made a decision on your own?"
"It's not a good idea to assume, but with such an OTT reaction from someone who's (according to OP) normally not like that, it's definitely possible. My girlfriend is trans and she told me that she used to say things like 'allowing a trans person to transition is like handing a suicidal person a knife'. If you can't accept yourself, it's easy to project all of your self-hatred and shame onto other people like you. "
"Remind yourself that THEY are the ones that caused this and honestly, bringing a toddler to an event without any other children is pretty rude. Like, once in a while if a sitter cannot be found, maybe, after asking the host if it's okay, but just assuming people are okay with that? 

(Note: I have two kids who are now teens and even still I do not bring them with me to events unless it's been made clear they are invited. Not everyone likes kids. Shit, they are mine and I don't always wanna have them with me! lol)"
"Okay so I grew up in the country and honestly, a lot of people who haven't aren't going to be comfortable staying in a rustic country home for a week. 

So I just took my boyfriend back home to visit my family for 9 days and even though the house is very very clean, the water (apparently) smells and tastes awful. He used a water bottle to brush his teeth and didn't want to shower. 

The basement is where the laundry is done and there lots of creepy crawlies, the basement is a slab, so halfway between concrete and dirt floors. 

The mattress is the best part of the house, super comfy (imo) but no central air conditioning. Window units which he's not used to, he left the light on in the bedroom for 10 minutes and we got some bug friends overnight.  

Staying with my folks for 9 days was also stressful, it's hard to share a home with someone else's parents for that long. It was hard for me too. 

The air, according to him, smelt bad too. He said the house smells musty, but I can't smell it. The smell is ""home"" to me. My mom is so super clean too, she bleaches everything, practically a germaphobe. 

Also the manure. If you're truly in the county, you've got farms nearby and that cow shit smell really permeates the air. 

My bf was a good sport but next time we visit were getting a hotel.

"A brother of mine died. The brother I was closest in age to and went through a lot of stuff with. His was an accident but it doesn't really change the pain. I know exactly what loss you are feeling right now. 

I have about 10 years of perspective on this. I'll never forgive the drunk driver who caused that accident (she fled the scene and hid until the cops tracked her down the next day-sober). But even right after, my father said maybe we should allow this person to the funeral. To witness what they caused but to also let them deal with whatever is in their heart. 

I never understood and still don't. You're not wrong for feeling this way. 

Your mother is taking a different approach. She most likely sees that your brother ultimately had a choice. As painful as that is to hear, he had a choice. My brother didn't. I'm not saying that to make you feel bad. I understand you more than our respective parents. 

Your mom lost a son. I would bet what she is *trying* to do is prevent another young person to fall into such despair that another parent loses their child. I don't know if I could live with that guilt. Could you? Your mom probably realizes that words and actions are ultimately temporary. That nothing can get better if someone is not around. 

Please, please stop trying to put your feelings against your mother's. Trust me, you have enough to deal with right now. "
Sounds like it's time to start making a plan. Can you work? Or are there sources of income you can apply for/pursue?
Does he know that other men have probably seen your real life body naked? The fact that he's being so disrespectful over pictures is a red flag. It's too early in the relationship for this kind of crazy.

"You can't make him 'get it'. He has had the luxury of walking around in public as a dude and doesn't get the level of danger normal women are exposed to.

Good for you on defending yourself. "
"Bi woman married to a straight man here - my husband knows my history and how I identify and has never ever demeaned or spoken negatively about my orientation or my experiences. We have discussions about queerness and identity and gender politics and feminism, and he's told me that being with me has opened his mind in a big way. He doesn't fetishize or objectify my orientation or identity, and he certainly does not react negatively when I ""act"" queer (watching movies/tv featuring queer characters or actors, acting/dressing in a way that could be perceived as more ""masculine"", etc.). In the past I've been with straight men who fetishized that I was ""into girls"" in about every possible way you can think of. It's gross on so many levels and honestly dehumanizing.  


My husband supports me as A PERSON. OPs boyfriend does not support who she is as a person."
"If the only reason he stopped inviting her is because he can’t take the rejection, start a new group because he’ll do this again with the next girl he fancies. If you don’t like it, show that/ tell him.

But if he disagrees, you’ll have to change groups because, however unreasonable he’s being, it’s his house, he doesn’t have to invite her for any reason or no reason at all "
"I feel like that's super reasonable, especially if they are good tenants. "
"Stop participating in these discussions with your mother. When she brings up the subject of grandchildren, don’t JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain); instead, set a boundary like “This isn’t up for discussion” or “This decision is between me and fiancée and no one else” or “every time you bring this up we’re going to add six months to how long we’re going to wait to have kids”. 

See, with people like her, if you let them frame the discussion, then you’re always on the defensive, so shutting it down stops her manipulation in its tracks. 

See /r/justnomil. They’re experts at dealing with meddling MILs. "
Just put it back in her purse when you first get there. Let her keep giving you the same $100 every time.
"agreed, minus the ""if you don't mind"". "
"&gt; That when we do see each other I'm not all there. I am, I'm just tired.

case in point. You're not all there. When you're tired, you're not you at your best. I sure as hell wouldn't want to date anyone who I only see for 5 hours a week and they're exhausted for those 5 hours. That sounds like a nightmare. "
"&gt;and hasn’t told ~~him~~ **her** yet

lesbians exist"
The fact that he emphasized how he'd never be interested in someone so young shows how wrong he knows this is. He manipulated OP and is manipulating the 16 year old. 
"&gt; She had brought up the sex thing a few times before but I hadnt taken it serious enough

Doesn't take a mind reader to listen to someone when they're talking to you"
"At 20 I would say so, but later on probably not. "
How delightfully greedy! Throw the whole boyfriend away.
"Her no porn rule is asking you not to look at other women having sex. Your no vibrator rule is asking her not to use a piece of plastic. It's not the same and I'm pretty sure you know that.

""I just want her all to myself"" is gross and ridiculous. You HAVE her all to yourself. IT'S A SEX TOY FFS, it doesn't have a brain. "
"Uh, no. He isn't the perfect husband. As a guy reading this, I see his actions as ones that are entirely selfish, manipulative, and destructive. All of that ""perfection"" you are evaluating is a show, a pretense, a facade.

Guys can be handsom, smart, successful, and sweet, but they are also human, with human flaws. If those flaws are also held up and known along with all the 'good points', then he probably is a good and decent husband who is trying his best. Ie, the real perfection that can exist. But when his flaw is that he lies, cheats, uses you, etc... you better believe his core is rotten and he has no interest in trying.

I'd bet his wife is miserable."
“Tomorrow it is then!” Should be your response. 
"Screaming at you in public and ""punishing"" you by damaging your property is his way of eroding your boundaries. He's escalating from emotional abuse to physical abuse, but doing it slowly to see how far he can go.


The real question is not, ""Is he abusive?"" The question is, ""Do you want to spend more of your life being yelled at in public?"" If the answer is, ""No, I don't enjoy that and I don't want to live that way,"" then you have your answer. He's not shown any improvement or willingness to change, and he's not going to get better now if you give in and move back with him. He's shown you who he is, so believe him. "
"It sounds drastic, but do you think she would go for one of those portable toilets people use after they’ve had surgery or otherwise immobilized? "
"So I feel you, mostly. I have Crohn’s disease, and the severity of my symptoms varies with time, and yeah having issues like this can be debilitating and humiliating. I know what it’s like to be OP’s roommate.

But I wouldn’t say OP behaved like an asshole. She says they’ve lived together for 5 months and was diagnosed with whatever condition she has a month into becoming roommates. Obviously OP’s at the end of her rope, but it’s been an issue for 4 months, and she’s been beyond accommodating so far. No, her roommate’s need of the bathroom is not in her control, but I can’t fathom putting a roommate through all of that and expecting unlimited empathy and graciousness."
"My friend did that once - moved from a 1bedroom/1bath to a 2/2 in the same complex before the lease was up. It’s more money in the landlord’s pocket since the rent is higher for the larger apartment, so it may end up being a win/win for OP."
"Listen to what you're saying. THOSE were his values for what made a good partner? Being good at sex and bad at standing up for yourself?

When a person tells you who they are, believe them. Run, run, run."
"Dude, you left almost a 100% tip on your bill. That’s RIDICULOUS and the fact that you’re considering offering them MORE is RIDICULOUS. You have more than made this right with them. 

They were most likely in the wrong already. As others have pointed out and you have agreed in other comments, if they were closing the kitchen an hour and a half early but were still able to make 4 burgers and an app in 5 minutes, they were most likely doing that without permission and afraid of getting caught. Which they should be because that’s messed up. 

I’m a server at a restaurant. I get stressful events and I would love to cut out of work early daily but that’s not the reality of the job. I personally would be overjoyed, on cloud nine, somewhere over the rainbow if I was caught trying to close over an hour early by someone who knows the owner, and instead of ratting me out that person just gave me tons of money for my trouble. You don’t owe them anything. This is a nonissue. "
"If you're worried about breaking up later, it's most wise not to purchase a house together....  
If you're adding that in as a 'if in case' (due to infidelity or other reasons), what happens if or when you want to have children? I'm going to assume she'll have to take time off of work, and thus no income. What happens then? If you break up, she'll get nothing from the house because she wasn't working and didn't contribute to the mortgage?"
"You are 21.  If you can afford it financially, and your g/f is comfortable with living together, then you have no reason to stay home.  People can have sex regardless of the living situation. 

Kids move out, that is a fact of life.  "
"Firstly, this is such an outdated and sexist and disgusting view on women having sex. Second, OP should ditch anyone who tells her she's gross and punishes her for having sex. And what creep wants to know the circumstances if every time she had sex wtf. Dump.
Like this commenter said, he needs to find someone whose ideals need to line up with his (sexist) ideals."
"I have a young daughter. I understand being cautious about introducing new people. Kids get attached easily, you don't want to upset their world by having people in and out all the time.

Um, 2 years isn't a short time.

The whole thing feels weird, as you describe it. Really, really weird. There's nothing that explains it logically."
"&gt;sometimes think that poverty keeps more couples together than love does.

and you'd be right."
"You 3D printed a baby with your body. It's perfectly fine to take time losing that weight. What is his excuse? 

I know it's hard to feel like normal while being a new mom...but don't let him shake your confidence. You will reach a new normal at some point. Hopefully he will choose to reach it with you.

"
"You don’t have good evidence? You have very good evidence. He is calling out of work to be with her. He is doing special things he only does with you, with her. He isn’t being honest with you. What exactly are you looking for? A video of them in bed? Love letters? This is absolutely evidence and this is where you tell him it’s time to fess up, break off the relationship and hit therapy together. He is having an affair."
"I hope for nothing but the best for you. This is a difficult situation and even though I’m a stranger, I’m proud of you for being able to type this out and dive into that place. Take care of yourself. I hope that this insight gives you some clarity. "
"&gt; Are you seriously asking if I love my wife? Of course I have an attachment to her

Ooft, lad. Are you hearing yourself? You speak like a robot that has no understanding of human emotions. And yes, I highly doubt that you love your wife. As others have said you speak of her like she's a stick of furniture you know you have to have in your house, not a loved and cherished individual you want in your life. "
Or if OP typed this on the treadmill and made some spelling errors 😂
"I think the difference is, you probably don't flaunt that you have a trust fund. Do you make your own money, live within your means? You mentioned that the only time you used it is to buy a car. The term ""trust fund baby"" implies that you don't work for your money and you are basically living off of the money your parents gave you. Having a trust fund in and of itself isn't bad"
"I don't think your dad literally means ""go outside and play."" I think he wants you to be out in the world, doing SOMETHING - a job (even part-time), volunteer work, a hobby, or socializing.

In a comment reply you said you want to find a passion, but what are you doing to foster that? You've tried a few things. Try some more. Look for hobby groups or meet-up groups or community ed classes or volunteer work. 

Another possibility: You seem to feel kind of ""meh"" about everything, and sound like you feel a bit helpless and unmotivated to change your situation. Those can be signs of depression. Do you think it's possible you're depressed? Might be something to talk with your doctor about?"
"We also just had our first baby in March, congrats! My boyfriend and I go through the same thing every week. He takes so many pictures of her, her and him, her and the dog, but hardly ANY of us together (unless we’re sleeping). It’s exhausting and I feel crazy for making a thing out of it, but I just want those memories. The verbal abuse is a whole other thing though... "
"If you “take some time off to find your passion” you will be an underemployed 30 year old in the blink of an eye. If nothing seems interesting or compelling, you may be depressed. I’m certain you play too many video games. 

Another sure-fire way to find your desire to go back to school is to work at a shuteye job for a while. My brother took a year off college. My dad put him to work at a labor intensive job in the Southwest US desert heat. When bro went back to school he fucking loved it. It was a billion times better than working in the dirt in 105 degree heat. Now he is extremely successful. "
"Not to mention, it was likely a legacy his deceased mom had shared with him. So he loses his mom, thinks he'll still have a connection with her possibly through going to and graduating from this college they'd been working and planning on, and then Dad can't afford to send him there.

Actual counseling instead of Dad just trying to find alternatives, and counseling for the whole family should be in order. there's so much resentment and weird stuff going on here. Dad dismisses his wife's death as having an impact on the kid and blames his trouble more on just not getting into the dream college. And the son is not processing his anger at not making his dream college healthily at all."
"I just don't know how I would say it, my dad tends to think that I'm still a little kid, but I think that I might have to like you said because his mom seems dangerous to me"
"&gt; no consequences

"More and more woman are choosing not to shave these days. That is our choice. 

Maybe she doesn’t like to be shaved for a certain reason, and instead of assuming she’s “lazy” or “doesn’t care about your preference” just ask her what’s up. It’s part of open communication. 

I’m 45 and when I was younger I was shaved. Now I’m just trimmed. When I started dating my bf now he told me that he preferred shaved. My reply was “That’s nice. I’m 45 not 12....I’ve went through puberty. I have hair. Either learn to deal or don’t. Your choice”

Her body isn’t for you to decide what you like and don’t like about it, and it definitely isn’t for you to request changes about. "
You start to wonder why it hasnt happened for you. Then you feel like if people know they will wonder whats wrong with you and might not be willing to help you learn. 
"Yeah, this is actually a really common but little-discussed (because of the incest taboo) phenomenon that occurs between biological siblings and half-siblings who meet for the first time as adults. I suggest reading up on Genetic Sexual Attraction and maybe posting on the GSA forums asking for advice, they're probably going to understand what your brother and his half-sister are going through and the effect this is having on the rest of your family better than anyone here can.

Well I *say* that, but our family has long-suspected something similar happened with my male cousin when he first met his half-sister who was given up for adoption at birth, so feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk things through with."
"Do NOT suggest couples counseling to her, holy shit. Couples therapy is a *terrible* idea for abusive relationships. It’s so easy for an abuser to use the therapist to gaslight their victim, and if the victim dares to open up about something the abuser doesn’t want shared, she will likely pay for it once they leave the appointment. Do not advise this. "
"OP said his wife works part-time from home in one of the comments. It’s pretty telling that it wasn’t in the OP. 

I also suspect that someone who travels for work 5 days a week and acknowledges that he’s glad he doesn’t do the brunt of the childcare wouldn’t be especially happy as a sahd "
And it is HER wedding too.  He talks about it like it is HIS wedding and she is a prop.  
"Let her get hysterical. You are 26 years old with a car and a drivers license. Do not report to her your whereabouts. Do not inform her of your arrival and leave times. You are not ""hurting her feelings"" by doing an errand, taking a detour, stopping to smell the roses or having a long chat after work. She will survive."
"Hard to turn down free childcare from a family member even if she’s less than happy with their relationship. This post is falling victim to something that happens a lot on this sub - taking everything OP says at face value, and not reading between the lines."
"That's great, but get a custody agreement signed, sealed and registered in the courts.  Believe me, having it hammered out and court approved will save you so much heartbreak and dollars in the future. 

My ex and I have one, and it's honestly the best decision we made while splitting.  We argue about things, but it's never the custody agreement.  You can always revisit at a later date. "
If you keep setting the bar lower and lower pretty soon you won't be able to limbo under it anymore.
"If you can remember to text her daily, you can remember to take pictures of her once in a while, which is the thing she actually wants you to do.

When my grandma passed away, there were almost no pictures of her, except a few, formal, posed ones. She was always the one taking the picture. In this way, moms get slowly erased from the very family memories they work to create."
"This happened to me, but with a bachelorette party. I didn't mind too much, but it was a little awkward. It recently came up (four years later). Both the bride and groom were shocked that I wasn't at their wedding, but I wasn't going to go to a wedding I wasn't invited to! "
"Holy shit, 10/10 comment and advice. "
OMG reading  your post I just want to say your ex was an asshole and I'm glad he's out of your life now. So sorry you had to go through that. Wish you the best of luck on your recovery journey. Be happy and live well.
He is. And we are of him as well.
"First, let me say that I’m so sorry for your loss. 

Funerals are really for the living, not for the person who passed. They give those who are left an opportunity to grieve. If there is something about this funeral that you’re uncomfortable with, say something, get it changed. You’re his wife, and you have every right to have a private viewing, or do whatever it is that helps you heal. Don’t worry about what others think of you. "
"&gt;He should at least wear clothes that don't have holes in them.

Or you can choose not to date someone who wants to walk around shabby in their own time. 

I'm guessing his work clothes are in a good condition?"
Reminds me of that episode of Friends. 
"I think it's weird that you continually call your wife a stay at home mom when she's working on a PhD. Housework issues aside, it doesn't really seem like you respect her much. I would be pretty mad too if my husband thought I sat around all day doing nothing when I spent half the day taking care of our kidding and the other half working on my classes. You say yourself that she spends most of her time working on her classwork, but you also seem to think it's not important. I'm concerned that she's picking up some vibes that you think you're better than her because your job pays a lot. Not that you think that, but the way you talk about your career kind of rubs me the wrong way too."

"2 years ago, I [37F] got out of a 10 year (12 together) marriage because I found out my now-ex had been cheating on me for at least 5 years. I'd had other exes cheat on me. And now I'm dating and you know what I'm choosing not to do? Treat him with distrust. Starting a relationship on a basis that trust must be earned isn't going to work, especially since your girlfriend is **ACTIVELY LOOKING** for reasons to not trust you and control you. Dump her, masturbate to all the porn, and find someone more emotionally stable and secure in herself. "
You did the right thing. No doubt. Stick to your decision and dont take him back when he'll come back (which will probably happens).
"I think right now you guys just need to be in survival mode. Your life isnt and shouldn't stay the exact same right after a medical emergency! Your husband just had a brain tumour removed for crying out loud. He's not going to snap back to normal anytime soon, and he may never be 100% again. You really are criticizing someone who just got dealt a pretty low blow by life, and has valid medical reasons explaining his emotional and mood changes!

The kids don't need to be entertained every minute of the day. It's super okay to put on some movies at night or let them play in their room. You can cut back on all their activities that need so much driving. The world won't end if the kids don't make it to ballet class because you desperately need a nap, and this is a good life lesson in putting someone else's needs first. Not sure how old they are, but surely there are many age appropriate ways to explain that daddy just had a serious medical operation and he's not going to be the same for a while since he's healing, so life might be a bit more laid back in the meantime while everyone adjusts. 

For your husband's temper, I would speak to his medical providers for assistance. Medication/therapy might be beneficial for him. I would also call him out on it. ""I know you are going through a lot/ don't feel good, but I am trying to help you. I don't deserve you speaking to me that way. If you can't calm down and speak to me respectfully, I am going to walk away."""
"No! This is what’s driving me bonkers about the responses in this thread. Only 2 people knew about the existence of the money, his brother and his gf. Beyond that, only one of those two people (his brother) knew where he hid it, and only one of those two people (brother again) were alone in his room during that time slot of when he last saw the money and when he noticed it was gone. 

Everyone is jumping on the roommate’s girlfriend and she wasn’t even aware that he got an inheritance? Let alone where he hid it. It makes no sense. "
"There was a big gap between my wedding and when I gave my dad her number. I did it almost as a reminder, kind of? But I didnt wait for her to get back to me because of what she said at my reception. When my brother blew up at me afterwards he told me ""theres no reason for me to lie to you about him not calling me!"". And I agree. I agree that there's definately some miscommunication going on. 

I dont think that my brother or his fiance really want to reconcile with him."
"A new herpes outbreak does not necessarily imply cheating.  Either one of you could have had it for awhile and not shown symptoms.

The other possibility is that you caught it from oral sex.  

"
"This is a tough one. I think it's very, very strange that he decided to drop this one you when you're 7 months pregnant rather than earlier in your relationship. 

Is there a reason he would rather go by his first name? Does it have something to do with his parenting philosophy - like he thinks parenting should be more egalitarian and your kids should see him as an equal rather than an authority? Or is it that he is having issues with aging and the idea of parenthood subsuming his identity?"
"&gt; here is a societal norm for them to change their name.

societal norms on this are rapidly changing. Nor does a ""societal norm"" change how your wife felt and feels about her name. Just like you she had it for her whole life, just like you it's part of her identity. Whatever your personal view of what women expect or are expected to do is, she obviously never planned or expected to change her name upon marriage, and told you so very early in your relationship.

You seem to feel she somehow owes you some concession for not having changed her name. She does not."
"One thing your gf should consider is that if she continues to let this slide because she doesn’t want to create an issue, it’ll go on forever. If you guys get married and have kids, she could start making snide comments under breath about your kids. She could also make your wedding/wedding planning an issue by dampening it with her attitude. Put a stop to it before that time comes. Someone has to say something."
"""She gives no explanation or apology for her weird behaviour and it’s becoming a real problem for the rest of us. I don’t feel like I can bring new guys home with her always creating an uncomfortable and embarrassing environment for them - they get weirded out! My roommates’ boyfriends hardly ever come over because she makes them feel so uncomfortable. I get some people naturally are just a bit prudish, but I don’t understand why she needs to react in the completely over-the-top way she does in front of them - couldn’t she just keep her thoughts to herself?!""

I sympathise with you OP because this isn't easy to live with but if Hannah was brought up in a religious and/or very conservative home she probably has all these hangups about men and sex from church and/or her parents.

That said:

1) None of the rest of you should be ashamed of having a more normal attitude to sex and relationships.

2) She's the one who needs to adapt here.

ETA: Reading down a lot of people seem to think Hannah might be secretly gay. I feel like religious upbringing/conservative family seems more likely. Either way I don't think it's time to burn the bridges yet. Talk to her and explain that her behaviour is not typical and take it from there."
"This is not something I personally would be able to get over with if I were in your daughter's position. 

The creepiness is too much for me. I would not be attending family functions where your girlfriend was present. TBH it would be difficult for me to retain a relationship with you at all.

"
"&gt;I have caught her in lies before. Some were major and some were minor. I just dont know what to do because all of my adult life we have lived together.

And that's the justification to marry a liar? Because it's all you've known for four years? Seriously?"
"This is great advice, especially the last paragraph about asking what you can do to win them back (if you want to and it's within reason). I was trying to read between the lines and think about how a friend might feel, and this is what stuck out to me:

&gt;My friends would invite me to visit them but I couldn’t afford the plane rides or time off. I’d invite them to visit me, it nothing ever worked out until I moved to NYC, since this is basically home base for everyone and people come home for the holidays. 

They might perceive that you aren't putting the same effort in to see them/maintain the friendship, and that they keep up with their part by seeing you in NYC, so the effort is one-sided. (Even if your financial, work, an location reasons make sense for this).

&gt;I’ve been caught up with a new job in New York as well as a long distance relationship for the past year, so I haven’t reached out as often as I should...

You're job and your BF come before they do. Whether you meant to or not, you put them in 3rd place or even lower, priority-wise. They feel left behind. You may not have intended to, but you distanced yourself from them and may have made them feel unimportant. 

&gt; I sent a Snapchat of them walking behind me and captioned it something like “when your friends move out of NYC and now they can’t keep up” or something. 

This probably felt like both a figurative and literal (photo) jab at them, highlighting that you've left them behind. The ""can't keep up"" part may appear that you consider yourself to be superior to them.

Anyway, it could be that your friendship with them has just run it's course, but good luck regardless of what you decided to do."
As a woman who was formerly apart of the 'virgin but maybe im pregnant' club the TLC show 'I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant was the scarriest show I had ever watched. 
"You have 4 years experience as a property manager.  That looks good.  I don't think you'll have any problem finding a job.  

I also think that you might need to recruit your lazy brothers to help you out now.  They obviously want you to keep working and they don't have any desire to work there.  They need to talk to your dad about making you a proper manager/CEO.  You need a raise, a full-time assistant, benefits and a job description.  You need to be able to do your job without dad constantly on your ass.  Your brothers might be able to convince your dad that it's better to pay you to run the company business than to hire an outsider."

"&gt; Please help me to get through to him and to make him see I’m not the person he thinks I am? 

TBH i'd rather get through to YOU and make YOU see that he's not the person you think he is."
If it's that bad than you need professional help. Therapist or a psychiatrist.
"&gt;he said he wasn't

Oh well, thats' fine then. Because people never lie to their spouses about who they find hot, ever."
The kid's mom died during that time. How lucky do you think that made him feel?
"At a certain point you have to look at the last 20 years of your life and think about how your actions hurt your kids. Even the kid that isn’t depressed probably has a lot of problems if he’s from this family that’s had one dream for him his whole life because it was what they did. 

He should see a therapist. His son needs to take control of his own life. But you can’t move past things if you do t even know why they happened. This wasn’t just a bad situation that got worse. This was a lifetime of expectations thrown away. I think the dads urge to people please with his kids is a huge problem and needs help "
Your parents can invite them to their house
"I mean, yes, that's a way to handle the problem. But no matter how stressed he is, he's still treating you poorly. And as mentioned above, things are only going to get more stressful for him in the very near future. Now that you've seen how he acts when he's stressed out, are you willing to stick around for another four+ years?

At a bare minimum, you should have a frank conversation with him about how he's acting. Offer to limit your visits to once or twice a week to lessen the pressure on him, but he also needs to offer something as well. He needs to apologize for how he made you feel, and improve his treatment of you. "
"Yes, that's as close to actual *evil* as you get."
"I can't say enough good things about Al-Anon. Both of my mom's parents are alcoholics, which was tough for me to understand growing up. My mom took our nuclear family Al-Anon and it helped us immensely."
I mean I think it’s embarrassing in different ways. I’m still a female virgin at 25 and I feel SO bad because it’s supposed to be really easy for women to find someone to have sex with but it’s just never happened to me for some reason. And all my female friends talk about having sex and being hit on and it makes me feel so ugly and bad about myself that I never get any sexual attention
"I matched with a woman that ended up being married.   We talked on Snapchat and she uploaded a picture of a guy in her bed.   I asked who’s that?  Well that’s my husband..  alright good talk.. People these days are very shady.   I’d honestly move on to someone that actually wants you and isn’t out there playing games.   Granted I understand your circumstances, do not settle because it’s convenient.     "
"My oldest daughter is named Daphne.  We called her Daffy from the beginning.  As did all her friends and teachers up until her Jr year of high school when her basketball teammates changed it to the daffinator (a spin on the Terminator because she was such a strong defensive player).    That teacher is a nut case.  Personally, I'd mention it to the principal.  "
"You tend to make the closest friends with people who are sharing a new experience with you.  Right now, you are at the beginning of a huge adventure; motherhood.  Have you considered looking into pregnancy/new mom groups you could join?  Look at Meetup.com and see if there's anything that interests you. "
"If she is complaining or venting about him or their relationship, you could mention that you notice she seems to have a lot of concerns about him/the relationship, and let things follow from there. Or if she casually mentions something controlling he did, as though it's normal, you could say, ""Wow, are you okay with that? That's not how reasonable people act? Are you safe and respected in your relationship?"" Or mentioning you've noticed she's seemed more unhappy and less like herself since she started this relationship, and you're wondering if she's okay. Or you could encourage her to get premarital counseling (where hopefully their problems will come to light for her)."

"&gt;""OK I need to talk to her but what on earth is she going to say to me?"" or the typical ""there is no way on earth she would be into me--she is WAY out of my league!""

You need to work on reframing your thought process around women. Instead of these 'what can I do to make her want me' type questions, focus on her as a person. Instead, ask yourself 'I wonder what she wants to do with her life?', 'I wonder what her favourite book is?' or 'I wonder what her secret dorky passion is?'. I'm not saying you should ask *her* these questions (at least not as a cold open), but training your mind to think about any given woman in terms like these, rather than 'will she/won't she have sex with me', is a good way to remind yourself that she is a person, not an objective. Once you start to realise that, it will be exponentially easier and more fun to talk to all kinds of women, because talking to a person like yourself is much more natural than approaching them like some kind of puzzle you need to solve."
"In his case, not EVEN if married. He's gonna drag you down with him"
It is a trust issue.  And it is a completely selfish asshole move not to give the benefit of the doubt to your significant other when they come to you voluntarily admitting they've been groped.
"Er, isn’t the point of a FWB that the sex is amazing?

Find a new FWB."
"I mean, they're not even proper friends right now, so not really? They reached an understanding but she didn't immediately pick up a friendship with J. 

I'm sure they have a lot of mutual friends and that's probably the reason that she wanted to go those events. From what I can tell, she's been open about all of this so I don't see why her wanting to go to an event that J happens to co-organize is a reason to jump to 'she's into J'. "
"&gt; **Would a 4+ year long gap in dating history a red flag?**

No, some people won't date because they don't want to date someone at that time.

&gt;  However the friends that I have who are regularly in relationships often tell me that I'm going about this all wrong, that one is never ""ready"", and dating, serious or not, can really build valuable experience that would really help when it comes to finding the ""one"" to settle down with. 

I'm not sure if ""going about this wrong"" is the way I would word this, but I generally agree. If you are holding out for a time period in which you are the most perfect you can be, you will likely be holding on forever. If you want to work on yourself first, or maybe you feel having a relationship won't fit into your current life and you would rather wait, then that is completely up to you. You can certainly develop yourself while in a relationship too."
My and my wife have fought/bickered about many many things. Neither of us have ever called the other an asshole. Just sayin'.
"**If he doesn't  leave his GF for you, he's not your soulmate.** 

It's really that simple. If *he* felt he was your soulmate, nothing on earth would keep him away from you. He would be desperate to leave her, he'd do anything to leave her, to be with you.  If his relationship was truly unfulfilling, and he's only got 8 months to enjoy you in, he'd leave her in a heartbeat. 

He's messing with you, he's a piece of manipulative crap. He's messing with both of you, actually. He's emotionally cheating on his partner, and he's actually fucking someone else while claiming you are his soulmate. He's an appalling individual.  Cut him out of your life. Spend the last months with people that are honest and decent and actually back up their words with action. If he hasnt already left her for you, that tells you that he doesn't mean it at all. This is all just some fucked-up ego trip for him.
"
"She's either maliciously planning on cheating on you or she's extremely oblivious and self-delusional to the point of comedy. 

You decide what's best."
"&gt;  I don’t feel comfortable being so blunt with a woman I barely know.

If you want to have your SO and children's backs, you're gonna have to polish up your spine at some point :) There will be many more situations as a partner and parent where you will have to stand up for your family, and you might as well get used to it now. 

Enforcing boundaries does not mean you have to be rude. Say something like ""we agreed the kids would not be calling you grandma, so please respect our wishes."" If she repeatedly disregards those boundaries, it might come time for husband to think about whether he even wants dad and step-mom in your family's life at all, and at that point, he can speak directly to dad about the issue. But until it gets to that point, there are absolutely ways to tell her to not do something without being rude about it. "
If you don't have that much time to devote to a relationship you probably shouldn't be in one until you do. 
"While he does have a point that life can go that way sometimes and stuff gets in the way, *that doesn't make it any less shitty when it happens to you*. People cancelling is a bit like that Onion story along the lines of ""'one plastic bottle chucked in the sea doesn't make a difference' say 5 million people"". If everyone thinks ""let's just cancel, it's not a big deal"" then no-one comes, and that *sucks*.

He may not be a people person, but he still has the responsibility to do his share. Not ""help"", because it's both your jobs. If ""we"" have a responsibility to your kid, then you can do it sometimes, and he can do it sometimes. You've done your share, it's his turn. And if he's ""not good at it"", **he can fucking learn.** Or at least try! Or if nothing else, not moan at you to do it more when he's not doing it at all.

Even if he's not got the connections to reach out to people, he could get the contact details from you, organize it, get involved, make it as much his responsibility as yours, then you can both comiserate with each other if it doesn't work out. Regardless, it sounds like he's not great at being supportive and just understanding that it sucks and you can't be arsed with it any more, instead he's telling you ""it's not a big deal"" when to you **it is a big deal!** So maybe start with just trying to get him to sympathise and be understanding, not invalidating your feelings. In turn hopefully you'll be less stressed at each other and can find a more productive way forwards."
pretty sure maniac was a typo
YES!  You phrased that *perfectly*!
"It's odd that he's lying, but there actually are a few cases in which a certain amount of violence can be justified. One is to defend yourself or loved ones, which doesn't apply here, and the other is to save someone from themselves. This could apply here. Maybe. 

You said you were joking, but you were also extremely drunk, and likely he had some to drink as well. He may not have understood that you were joking. You did take the keys and insist on driving even after he made it clear that he was serious that you shouldn't drive. He may have thought it was the only way to prevent you from getting behind the wheel. 

If I was truly in a situation where the only way to prevent a loved one from making a huge, potentially deadly mistake was to use some amount of violence, I would do it. Again, I don't actually know if he thought that was the case here, or what his reasons are. I just wanted to provide a counterpoint to the many people who will say you should break up because violence is never ok. 

If what I've said doesn't match the circumstances, feel free to ignore it. You'll get plenty of advice from others concerning unjustified violence."
"These are all controlling things. Every single time he gets upset with you over something like this is a sign. You are allowed to have a bad day and be in a bad mood (granted, doesn't mean you get to take it out on him), but you shouldn't have to worry about your 'tone' all the time.

The stop sign thing. You should stop for a few seconds, but it seems like this is one of those things where he simply could have stated ""honey, you should stop for longer to be safe.""

Hair in the bathroom? The horror! My husband shaves his head and cleans out most of it from the sink. Not all of it all the time, not sure why it is hard to do, but I am not going to start an argument about it. I take a piece of toilet paper and clean out the rest and move on with my life.

All I am saying is that he is nit picking you to start fights. He is testing his limits to see how much he can get away with. I had an ex like this. He was emotionally abusive. Started with little things, then saying stuff about something that was a thing before we got together and while we were dating (like dying my hair - he hated it so he would argue with me about it). Of course the same guy didn't want me to wear make up, clothes the right size (my shirts had to cover my butt, I wasn't allowed to tuck them in) and lots of crap like that.

Stand up for yourself. Don't tip toe around things. Keep wearing your perfume and when he says ""I thought I told you I didn't want you to wear cheap perfume"" tell him that you have been wearing it for years and you like it. If he hates the smell, different, but to leave it alone until he has an actual reason to dislike it other than to find something else to nit pick about. 

This is the beginning signs to control and abuse. I know you don't want to believe it because we are internet strangers and we just don't know him at all and only know what you tell us. But what you tell us is telling in itself. Don't let this go farther than it needs. Tell him that lately these arguments are bothering you and you two need to work on your communication. See if he is willing to do that. If not... think about what you want in the future.

Good luck."
The worrying thing here is he may still be keeping himself in the shop window.You need to ask him straight out what is your relationship status and do not accept him brushing you off.He either wants to be in a relationship or he doesn’t.
Is there a reason they cant pay rent that hes given?
"Some of these comments are so blowing this way out of proportion. She doesn’t get overly drunk in front of him, so she’s cheating on him? Really? 

Sounds to me like she just doesn’t want to embarrass herself in front of you, OP. The relationship is still very new and she probably doesn’t want to put you off. Everyone is on their best behaviour to begin with! 

Or perhaps something has happened to her in the past to make her not want to be that way around her boyfriend, maybe an ex used to shout at her for embarrassing him or something?

Whatever it is, you’ll never know until you ask her. That’s the simplest answer and the only thing that will stop you making a mountain out of a molehill in your head. "
"You nees to leave him. Run!
This guy lies to you and endangers your health. There's NO reason to stick around!"
"Yeah. This stuck out to me. I know jealousy can definitely be a real issue in how people treat others, but your description of your girlfriend as the hottest woman on earth who has to put no effort in being so hot and also has tons of friends and a perfect life vs. your sister in law who is ugly, fat, and friendless with no one to love her is just...ugh, I could not stop rolling my eyes! Is your GF also a billionaire by total accident and your sister in law on welfare? 

Just the way this was written was so weird. People (not just women) have issues with jealousy but this is such ridiculous hyperbole."
"He had 10 years to say something instead of assuming things were going somewhere. If he’s one thing, he’s consistent. He’s consistently been a coward this whole time, even ended things that way by running away instead of talking to you about it like a grown ass man. Good riddance. "
"It sounds like a great hobby...filled with terrible people. 

How do you behave when you're in that environment. Do you stick up for your gf? If you continue in a mentor role, will make a concerted effort to stamp out that in your mentees?

I don't think you should necessarily quit, but you really should listen with an open mind to your gf's objections and issues and take them to heart."
"1. Regularity breeds attendance and reputation.  Hosting a game night once a month is easier to get a critical mass to show than if you're only doing it once ever.  

2. Work friends are strictly for getting through work.  Once you remove that common ""interest"" nothing binds you together.  Don't take it personally, it's just how it is.  If you want to turn work friends into real friends, you need to find an actual common interest that isn't mandatory to pay a mortgage. 

3. When planning things, have a specific feature in mind.  ""Netflix and Chill"" only works for dates because it's all code for banging, the true specific activity.  If you want folks to show, give them a sense of what the night will entail.  If it's ""Game Night"" list the #1 &amp; 2 games you'll be playing to give an idea of mood. A night of Risk is fundamentally different than a night of Cards Against Humanity, which is different from a Poker night.  

4. You're 25. Drinking and BYOB is implied now. You don't need to say ""have some beers at my house"".  Again, if it's something you'd say to a date as code for banging, it's not what you use to get a group of friends over. 

5. When planning things, get an anchor group going before ""publishing"" the event.  If the core 2-3 people you want to show can't make the date, change the date.  If those 2-3 don't want to go, then do some navel gazing and redesign the event. 

6. Location.  It's gotta be clean, with space and seats for everyone to be comfortable.  You seem like you live alone.  Is the place actually clean? Or are there little piles of things everywhere? Take note of the surroundings of the ""successful"" events hosted by others and compare them to yours. What can you do different? Better? 

And this all assumes your friends aren't total shit.  If that's true, just get new friends.  Reddit Socializing 101: Hit the gym, delete facebook, get a hobby. "
"My guess is this had very little to do with the song. It may not even have had much to do with you. Either he's upset about some other underlying issue in your relationship, or he's stressed about something in his life completely separate from you and he just lost control. 

Wait for him to calm down. When he's calmer and in a better mood, ask him gently and sincerely what that was all about. Does he really think you make fun of him and his interests that much? If he does, hopefully he'll speak up here, but in a saner and more reasonable way, that lets you figure out how to proceed. If he doesn't, he may say what's really been troubling him, whether that's work or family or something else. If he claims it was nothing, I'd point out that his reaction didn't seem like nothing, and you're asking only because you care and want to help. 

Good luck to you both. Hopefully this is an aberration and something you guys will move past soon. "
"Yeah this is something that caught my eye too, the rest I just wrote off as an embarrassing drunken night. I’m not sure if OPs wife would laugh it off if he drunkenly asked for something sexual from one of their mutual friends. 

OP said he’s also scared of his wife relapsing which makes me think that she should not be drinking at all. Either way he should just show her the videos and move on from there. "
"Oh man, I'm so sorry. I think you already know this, but you can't help someone that doesn't want help. Your parents giving her money has just prolonged this weird five year period of unemployment and drinking.  :(  Maybe this will be the kick in the pants she needs, in some way? "
"You should really engage with a lawyer and let him/her decide when it is or isn't worth it. The court may look unfavorably upon you for continually disregarding you ex-husband's inactions with your son and will question why you ""just now"" decided to pursue this as an issue."
"OP I think you may have accidentaly just used your actual names in this comment? Since you're calling your bf ""Kevin"" in the post, I figured you're probably trying to keep the real details to yourself and I thought I'd let you know!"
"I kind of understand what you're saying, but something that really pushed me away from the LGBT community is how snobby, snide, or straight up cruel some lesbians can be to bisexual women, especially younger girls just figuring it out. Or if an ex who is bisexual starts dating a man. We're *bi*-sexual, that's the entire point. 

I got some really stinging words from people I thought cared about me over things like that. I know I don't understand what it's like for another group of people and yeah, it probably is easier for me, but that is not my fault."
"&gt;We exchanged numbers (just as friends) and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about our interaction.

I'm amazed that people think they can say things like this and get away with it."
"&gt;I just want to tell her that I know what's going on and that I'm leaving basically. 

That's great, but get your stuff in order *first*.

Because the first thing a cheater is going to do, is lie and deny. You're crazy. You're overreacting. 

Then, minimization - It was a simple mistake. Nothing happened. We only talked. 

Then, it's time to flip the script and blame you - I only lied because I knew you'd be like this. You're too controlling. You're too affectionate/not affectionate enough. We're both to blame. Your shouldn't have been spying on me. It's your fault for not trusting me.

Then there's the tearful apologies, the promises to change, the offer to let you monitor their communication, etc.

And before you know it, you've let Cheaty McCheatface convince you to ""work on it"" and to "" not give up on us."" 

Only, all the ""work"" will be on you, you trying to smother and deny your pain in order to ""move on,"" you trying to ignore your fear every time she does something shady, you reading the books and going to counseling and doing the work while she just sits there, annoyed that you haven't gotten over it already."
"Nah you want to say those words so she begs you to stay and says she will change and blah blah blah.

She won't."
"Right. If I had that option I would have left a long time ago. But when you come up short every month, it's hard to find money to leave."
"Also I would be way less inclined to show up if someone I don't know very well invited me to ""drop by"" as opposed to for an ""official"" event. I feel like dropping by is something you do with close friends and I would be unsure if I was welcome. "
"OP, my wife and I are both over 30 and neither of us fully realized and accepted we were lesbians until our late 20s. We both dated men, but like you said, always felt that something felt ""wrong"" about it and it didn't click until much later. This is SUPER common among lesbians. 

Look up ""compulsory heterosexuality"" and ""heteronormativity."" If your girlfriend is really the feminist/activist she presents herself to be, she should honestly be familiar with these concepts. As a lesbian, having a romantic history with men is not *necessarily* an indication that you really do in fact have a genuine attraction to men. As I'm sure you know, being surrounded by heteronormative media and all those annoying little things like having relatives ask you ""so, do you have a boyfriend?"" really messes with your head as a young lesbian. You internalize that stuff and grow up not even considering the possibility that you might be gay, so you just act straight and do straight things without giving it much thought. Again, I'm sure YOU know all this, but I think you may need to explain some of these bigger social pressures/dynamics to your girlfriend in order for her to understand how cruel she is being.  It's great that she figured out her sexuality relatively early in life, but many of us are not so lucky and it takes a lot of uncomfortable attempts at dating/having sex with men and a lot of self-reflection before we figure it out. 

If you think doing some googling and showing her a blog post or two on this sort of thing would help put things into perspective for her, go for it and I hope she comes around. If she's an open-minded activist like you said, there might be some really eye-opening reads for her out there. But frankly if she can't get her head around it and see how the aggressively heteronormative world we live in affected you, the person she loves, in addition to tons of other *perfectly valid and completely real lesbians* then I think that shows a real lack of compassion on her part. Comp het is powerful stuff. Don't let your girlfriend's attitude make you feel bad about whatever journey you had to take to get you where you are today. "
"Thank you for this advice! I've already sent some resumes out, but I've barely worked here for three months, and I have to list who my supervisor is on my job applications, and new prospective employers have to talk to this woman. She once casually said, ""Leaving us already?"" because she got a call from a potential new boss who I never heard from again. I'll bet she told them I was a cokehead or something."
"While I never cheated on my late fiance, our relationship was turbulent and we'd fought just before he hung himself. His sister blamed me. Just step back and or maybe take a page from her and have another, more private ceremony to celebrate him after the funeral and leave her out. Don't make it about her, don't make it about you. She didn't kill him. He's the one you're really angry at. People fight and cheat all the time without the end result being suicide.

I would approach this at that sort of higher, meta level, and see if it's something he would be willing to do, before pulling the ultimatum card or just breaking up with him.

"Your feelings are always valid, no one can tell you how to feel. But from personal experience she probably just didn’t like the way she looked in the pictures with you or she just loved being in the moment with you and didn’t need pictures. I get why you’d be upset, don’t overthink it too much. "
"I think your mom overreacted, likely due to caretaker burnout, but I also think what you did is very rude.

I know you canceled them but by making them without talking to her first you put the onus on her to demand you cancel when the courteous thing would’ve been to talk to her first. It’s fair she was hurt that you dropped on her one day before she flew in that you’d made plans for her first night without even talking to her. 

The other piece is, in her shoes I’d be pissed because why would I fly down Thursday if my daughter doesn’t have time for me until Friday evening? I would’ve just flown down on Friday. "

And your reply, hopefully, is what's been pointed out here, numerous times by several people of all genders. 

Hint, it should go something like this: ""It's major surgery that has a long, painful recovery, and can cause a host of other long-term issues, much more severe than the inconvenience of a normal period. There are multiple other options available, such as....."" 


Youre so quick to jump on the ""my body, my choice"" argument, you've completely lost the plot on normal, healthy relationship connections and how they work as soon as lady parts are mentioned. 

You literally told someone that they have no right to be concerned about their partner's health and well-being. That's not okay.

Also, having a roommate is very different from sharing a room with multiple people you don’t know well.

I agree. This is the best advice.

It'll probably also be pretty obvious to everyone after a bit that you were having surgery and not galavanting around saying f your sister's wedding, I'm getting needless surgery. Hopefully your cousins know you better than that.

What it is that ails her being up on her own. I understand that you basically only eat dinner together and then you go to bed. Is she lonely, is she desperate. Do you give her the attentions she craves in the weekends or does she just share an apartment with a guy she never sees?

Wat? Did we read the same thing? OP acknowledges that she has brought it up before and he ignored it and didn't take it seriously. I agree she did get really dramatic but apparently that's what it took for OP to take his head out of the sand and actually pay attention to what she was saying.
That almost feels like the least of the medical misconceptions here.
"Looks like she was trying to talk to him though, more than once. He admits himself that he wasn’t listening. The hysterectomy thing is extreme but after endless dead bedroom relationships you can lose perspective a bit. OP straight up says he wasn’t listening to her. "
"&gt;  I think it’s ultimately time to have a discussion where he has a choice to make - Me and baby or drinking. He doesn’t get both.

So I think you're coming to terms with this faster than anybody can be expected to, so I don't mean what I'm about to say to sound critical of you. I'm not trying to be critical at all. Coming to terms with the fact that a loved one is an alcoholic and what that means is hard, and I say that from experience. But...

Your husband likely cannot make the choice you're presenting above. He has a disease that has warped how he views the world. He may say he chooses drinking and fuck off. But there's a pretty good chance, IMO, that he says he chooses you and the baby, but continues to drink. You need to think proactively about what steps he needs to take to demonstrate that he's actually given up drinking and what you will do when it inevitably turns out he hasn't.* The chances that he stops drinking after you give him an ultimatum and he never goes back to it are close to zero. Alcoholics relapse; this is a fact of life. This is also part of the reason why people are suggesting you go to Al-Anon meetings. Those people will be able to help you understand what you're in for. I know it's not going to be easy to find time to attend meetings because you're 7 months pregnant, but if you can, I really think you would benefit from them. 

*I don't know your husband, but I do know that alcoholics are really good at not being accountable. ""Just stop drinking"" is not a way that most alcoholics stop drinking. The ability to ""just stop drinking"" is what differentiates people who aren't alcoholics from alcoholics. You chose to just stop drinking when you found out you were pregnant because you're not an alcoholic. Your husband cannot do this because he is one. He needs help from people with experience (i.e., not just you.) That could mean checking into rehab, or it could mean going to AA, or it could mean getting a therapist who specializes in addiction issues. But even then, many alcoholics will pretend to go to AA meetings while they're actually getting trashed at a bar. You need to figure out how you're going to make sure he's being accountable and how much time and energy you're willing to pour into that. With an infant, your resources are going to be running pretty low. 

I'm really sorry you're in this position. It's terrible, and it's going to be hard no matter what you do. "
"Break up with your bf because it sounds like you’ve given up on your relationship, not because the new guy is the “one”. The fact that you’re considering leaving a multi year relationship for a man you just met just means you should have broken up with your bf long ago. 

There’s no such thing as the “one”, just compatibility, shared goals, and commitment. What you’re feeling right now is excitement over someone shiny and new, butterflies and lust."
Wait. Ovarian torsion??? Like it twisted?!
"Wow, she needs to block him and stop engaging in his crap. The more she talks to him the more hope he gets and the more she messes with his mind. I think her excuse is BS though, she likes the attention and is being overcome with a wave of nostalgia. It’s great she told you, however, if she continues to talk to him that’d be a deal breaker for me. Continuing contact with someone who is pursing her romantically is an absolute disrespect to your marriage and you. The other concern is she said she is having problems in your relationship and used him as a weapon to make you jealous and insecure . I would not trust her unless contact is ceased and if she refuses with some crappy excuse like he won’t make it mentally with out me BS I would leave . Sorry wish you the best! "
"Very good points! Maybe there's a compromise here; putting the $5k into a college fund for the baby, or something of the sort. That way, OP's father can't argue that OP and her husband are being selfish with the $$, and there's no way for the SIL to piss the $$ away. $5k isn't worth the price of breaking family ties, in my opinion, especially since OP and her husband are financially stable.

But then again, OP knows the situation better than we do."
"She tells you she is ""working through"" her sexuality, but this process does not involve you.

If she was working towards a solution that did involve you, the process of finding this out would, by necessity, also involve you.

At least you can say that your marriage is like the Loch Ness monster - math killed it without ever seeing the damn thing."
"Yeah, that stood out to me too. Apparently she can't bear the thought of someone in her home, but that discomfort goes away if they're paying market rates. Funny how that works out."

Why are you dating someone who thinks it's acceptable to control your masturbation? 
"I know, it's just so hard. I keep initiating contact with him because I don't understand how it happened and I just want an explanation or to know how long he's been lying about wanting to be with me forever or loving me. It's so hard not to question our entire relationship. Everyone that knew us is shocked. His mom keeps reaching out to comfort me and wants him to realize he made a mistake and that love requires continued effort. He says it didn't cross a physical line yet (at least when it all came out a few days ago), but he still lied about it. He was on a date with her this past weekend for at least 8 hours while I was hanging out with **our** friends. He had an elaborate cover story about what he was going to be doing instead. He even bought new clothes the night before. This guy has nothing in his wardrobe but T-shirts and cargo shirts and comes home with 3 brand new button up collared shirts. It all makes so much sense now. I know I deserve to be treated better but I just can't help grieving this life I thought we were living. "
"&gt;  if and when something happens we’d be legal custodians.

No, you wouldn't. Legal guardianship for children just doesn't work like that. Right now, the kid is the responsibility of her (eta: as in, your girlfriend's) parents, that's true. But if they pass away or otherwise become unable to care for the child, even if they write in their wills ""Daughter becomes the legal guardian until child is no longer a minor"" she has zero legal obligation to care for the kid. Nooooone. Whatsoever. If/when she's approached to take the kid, she can say ""Sorry, but no, I am not in a position to care for the child"". Nobody has any legal responsibility for their siblings, or even their parents, unless they choose to accept that responsibility. It can't be forced upon you."
"TBH, the gap is irrelevant and you are the victim here.  You were simply doing what his fiancee requested and gave permission to do.  Period.  Mistake #2?  No no, she should be thanking you for doing her the uncomfortable favor she asked of you.

You need to make sure your brother clearly understands that she gave you permission at your wedding.  And then, he should apologize sincerely for threatening to cut you off, for no good reason.  He's fortunate that you're not mad at him, if anything.

(FWIW, I have a feeling your brother doesn't want to reconcile but his fiancee does, and she might not want to volunteer that she asked you to do it if he'll rage about it.)"

"go to college, get a job, grow and live a meaningful life. it’s unfair that your mother made you play the role of Parent #2 when you were a teenager, you shouldn’t have had to be anything more than a sister. i’m sorry for this struggle your facing, but please don’t put your life on hold."
"She wasn't ""faking it."" She spends exhausted and fed up with the emotional roller coaster this relationship sounds like. There may not be a strong future for this relationship. Do you have any resources for therapy?"
"Honestly, this isn't about your issues. You don't have boundary problems. Dude, if your post is truthful, you need to realize that you haven't actually even done anything wrong. Your family however? Yeah, they definitely have some issues to work through.

Something got lost in translation here. There's a piece of this puzzle you're missing that everyone else has, and you need to figure out what it is. A few options:

1. Something happened between your brother, his fiancee, and your dad that you don't know about.
2. Something happened between your brother's fiancee and your dad that neither you nor your brother know about
3. Your brother's fiancee dislikes you, and this is her masterplan to fuck up your relationship with your brother for whatever reason.

Even though it seems crazy, the information you've given indicated number three to me. She asked you to contact your dad for her, so why would she now want to ban you from the wedding for doing so? Unless this was a set up, or your dad did something to her or your brother you don't know about, that makes no sense.

As soon as you can, call your brother and tell him that his fiancee asked to connect with your dad so she could try and repair the family. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING. Do this now. It's fucking with your head, and it's screwing with your life. Make it clear that you're not accusing your brother's fiancee of anything. Keep it chill. Just tell the truth - that you're utterly confused, and just want to understand why you're getting punished when you haven't done anything wrong.

Honestly your brother sounds really immature. I don't get the camera thing - if I had something that cost as much as a used car that was easily breakable, I'd ask people to keep their hands the hell off of it too. I don't know why that was an issue. How he's handled this has been really immature as well - why didn't he talk with you more or give you the benefit of the doubt? That's not very brotherly of him at all. 

If you repair your relationship with your brother, that's great and I'm happy for you. But if he really has such little loyalty to you or love to you that he cuts you off or accuses you of lying about his fiancee when you talk to him about it, then cutting him out of your life isn't going to be a great loss - don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

"I'm seeing a lot of replies assuring that the baby will be fine, which is almost certainly true. But I want you to know, OP, that in the unlikely event the baby isn't fine, either because of the same random chances present in any pregnancy or even if it were directly because you drank and smoked, it still wouldn't be your fault. I don't want you to take the baby's health as a litmus test of your rightness or wrongness. You had no obligation to live as a pregnant woman when you had no reason to think you might be pregnant. "
"&gt; Some women are really good at seducing a guy

Stop. Stop making excuses.

&gt; A woman who is sensual and forward about being into you can be really dangerous for a married guy

Are you saying that because you’re a man and married something is different for you relative to a married woman? Your wife has probably had many men hit on her and try to sleep with her since you’ve been together. She’s probably had 100x the men accosting her than you have had women flirting with you. Assuming she said no to each one, that would demonstrate self control and respect for you and your relationship on her part.

Don’t get me wrong. Maybe monogamy isn’t for you. I’m not lecturing you on it. Just don’t make excuses to protect yourself from a mistake you made.

It’s defensive to push the blame on everything and anything except yourself, but that’s not a good sign for your marriage and the outcome of a discussion with your wife about this if you’re not fully accepting your responsibility. "

"terrifying

it amazes me how so many parents are so casual about this kind of thing. "
"My dad is in his 50's, he had his first kid at 17. He currently has 7 kids from 4 women, the youngest being a toddler. I love my family, but please recognize that this type of immaturity does not just satiate itself and go away, it just gets worse the more you feed into it. Wanting and yearning to relive his youth turned my Dad into an emotionally avoidant hermit, who constantly avoided reality in hopes of starting fresh. The naivety you describe is the same kind of stuff my Father wanted. He wanted to escape the pain and bitterness of losing people in his life, to escape broken relationships, and to distance himself from things that scared him. Other women and my step-mom were that means, and I'm thankful my step-mom knows my Dad has issues and is getting him help. It is not her job, but she knows that without it he wouldn't have anyone. He went through 4 relationships, destroyed the lives of 5 children, and never accomplished his goal of ""finding himself"". Yearning to relive the past leads one down a path of destroying the present.

Example. Unfortunately, one of my siblings had a terminal medical condition. We lost him 7 years ago, my Father has never even coped or addressed it outside of a few tears in his eyes on the anniversary. He is Peter Pan, and he doesn't address things that feel too real. It makes it impossible to be close to him. His emotional capacity and hopes for his youth to remain have stunted his ability to communicate his feelings and have caused severe avoidance. It wasn't always like this, it has gotten worse- it is just starting to get better with therapy and a lot of self-reflection. He has apologized to me for not listening to me, and has apologized over and over for not being the parent I needed, emotionally, or physically. It sucks to see someone so aware of his failures with significantly less time to rectify them.

You need to look within yourself and talk to someone. So does your daughter, but with you leading the example it will be far more likely she will listen. You are not my Dad, but when I was a kid I also never thought I would be the person telling my Dad that I was worried about him. 

This woman might be the best woman you will ever meet, but you need to address any issues or areas of concern within yourself before you bring your kids or another woman into it. If your love for her is rooted in escaping bitterness and embracing youth, it will not last and you will damage your relationships with all of those who love you. "

She's not the problem, she's not the cause of a problem: she's a *symptom* of how he's not really satisfied with the way you look and treat him.  It's a shame you didn't compliment him and make him feel  he wanted to work out for *you*.

"There’s no universal thing that guys find endearing. Your boyfriend doesn’t like you wearing his clothes, so you should stop. Get some comfy clothes of your own, and consider sometimes wearing more femme pjs, if you can find some you like, since you know it’s something he wants. 

Also, why not wear lingerie sometimes, for a date night, maybe? It’s good that he’s asking for what he wants. Think about whether you’re willing to accommodate him. "

"I'm going to focus on this quote, specifically: 

&gt; I had a weird gut feeling to check his phone. I know I shouldn’t and I don’t often but I followed my intuition and ended up finding an active tinder profile on his phone. 

I don't think this came out of nowhere. Whether he's been hiding his phone from you, things have been a little off in communication lately, he's been out late at night, I think there was a reason you had that gut feeling. It didn't just come out of nowhere while everything is perfect. For that reason, you need to stop blaming yourself for snooping. There was a reason you snooped and it was because, in the end, he was using Tinder and talking to other women and (likely) meeting up with them. 

From your personality in the comments and in the post, I'm wondering if he's going to depend on you to not confront him about it. You seem very anxious to confront him and blame him for this. Instead of thinking about what is best for you in the long run, you're hoping there won't be confrontation and he'll bring it up first before you; he will ""see the error of his ways"" (which, remember, you had to look at his phone to even find out he had a Tinder - meaning he wasn't going to tell you he was cheating until he got caught), and you will continue on as you were before you found out he was using Tinder on his phone. 

In reality: was this relationship really the best before you found out he had Tinder on his phone?  

Polish your spine. Figure out what is best for you and your best self. If you were talking to your best friend and someone you loved, what advice would you give them in this situation? What would you want them to do? Who and what would you want them to end up with in the end? Do that for yourself, whatever that may be. 

And if you break up, stop paying his rent. He's 25 and his father cosigned for his apartment. If he can't make rent, it'll be his father's responsibility, not yours. "
"&gt;I want to add, as a person whose ex-partner wanted a big wedding mostly filled with  
&gt;  
&gt;his  
&gt;  
&gt;family, she probably invited those friends so she had  
&gt;  
&gt;someone  
&gt;  
&gt;there for  
&gt;  
&gt;her  
&gt;  
&gt;.

Your whole comment is spot on, but especially this point.  I had a similar situation where I just wanted a small wedding but that wasn't good enough for my ex and his mom, so I tried to comprimise and say 60 guests - still not good enough.  My ex invited a ton of friends and his mom invited over 30 of her personal friends, many of whom had not seen my ex since he was a child.  I felt so embarassed like I was going to look like a ""loser"" at my wedding having so many people there for him that I started sending out hail mary invites to friends I had not seen since high school.  Since the wedding was in his mom's town (guess whose idea that was), which was hundreds of miles away, all my old friends said no. 

 The few friends I currently had were either pregnant or just had a kid so couldn't travel hundreds of miles for a wedding easily.  I ended up bailing a month before the wedding and I felt so embarrassed that I invited all my old friends after not talking to most of them in a decade - I probably looked like I wanted more presents or something when really I just didn't want to look like a loser.  I still really regret sending them invites because it was mainly to ""save face,"" which is pretty selfish of me, but I just felt so embarrassed that 75% or so of the guests were going to be his friends and family.  It also made me feel like I was going to have a panic attack because I am an introvert and hate big crowds (which my ex knew).  I couldn't help but sympathize with the woman in this story.  I know exactly what it feels like to be steamrolled around every corner and if it happens regarding the wedding, I am sure it is happening other places, too.  And I doubt she met someone at that conference as he wants to imply.  I really needed some alone time to realize that I shouldn't put up with the stuff I was putting up with anymore."
"You are in your early 20s. You should be driving an older car that's cheap to maintain. Check out older Civics and Camrys by the way, they last forever and you can do a lot of the maintenance yourself! And a lease is a terrible financial move. Is he status obsessed in other areas too? To his own financial detriment?  Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter. "
"A lot of people are commenting about how he has the right to his preferences but I just want to say that while it's okay to have a preference, it's absolutely not okay to tell you that he would prefer you if you were medically underweight. That's saying he is prioritizing his preference of how you look over your happiness AND your health - it's completely different from if he said something like, 'Oh, I liked you better with a different haircut.' Especially if he's trying to pressure you with shame by trying to convince you everyone else feels the same when it's not true.

It sounds like the situation itself might have been part of what made him uncomfortable. Think less the lifting and more the fact that it was in the context of calling another guy weak. He probably feels less masculine next to you than before, and was reminded of this because lifting the other girl was done specifically in the context of calling her ex weak. This is an issue on his end, not yours, and it is important to have another talk with him because it's not fair for him to decide that him feeling emasculated means YOU have to change instead of working on his feelings (ideally together)."
"I mean I get he's only known her for a few months, but he notes that the housemate had bad boundaries with his GF, took her ""off"" reaction to that as guilt, and said his housemate seems like an honest guy despite demonstrating a bad character. That's... those are some bad inferences. Not the world's biggest deal, just something to learn from. A claddagh ring sounds like a good idea tho."
"Have you two talked about this at any time other than when it just happened!?

While it sounds like he doesn't have awareness of appropriate contexts to be saying such things (or at least, the level of voice or subtly in word choice that one needs to use when others, especially children, are around), by only talking about it when it occurs, he's probably taking it as rejection (of his fragile male/sexual ego, of his desire for you, that he's good enough or still desired) rather than your real concerns.

If you talk about it when it isn't an issue, say at home when you are both relaxed, you might have a chance to share your real concerns with his behaviour, without him feeling rejected.  It might also give you a chance to talk about his reactions and why they are a problem, and that he needs to be able to talk to you about his feelings as well rather than sulking all day or carrying resentment and making cheap shots.

Edit:  And the response ""why do you keep saying things like that in public?"" isn't really telling him what he's doing wrong - he clearly doesn't understand the inappropriateness of his behaviour.  Perhaps be more direct on the issue like ""Please save that talk/those thoughts for when we are alone"", ""Lower your voice, other people don't want to hear that and it's embarrassing for me"", ""Or there's children around, please be more discreet""  \[Edit2: and I'm not suggesting you are responsible for his behaviour, just a nuanced response might help curb his behaviour and reduce escalation until later when you can really talk about you problems with the situation\]"
"No, do not list your supervisors number. Put in the number for HR. "
"Honestly, I always assume we are only getting half the story here. To me the lack of sex seems a pretty obvious symptom of her boyfriend hating her hobby. When I was younger I used to save up money every year and go to star wars conventions, and even to this day I collect storm troopers. I had an ex who didn't like my hobby, which is fine. Except she hated it. She used to try to humiliate me to get me to stop and talk about how childish and dumb it was. I got really depressed and had to sneak out to go see new movies etc. Finally I realized she was the problem. I was doing my own thing and that made me happy and she kept dragging me down for it. Now I'm engaged to a wonderful woman, she doesn't love stat wars, but she will go to the movies with me and doesn't look down on me for it. In turn I help her and join in her hobbies. I'm not a big gradener but I go out and help pull weeds and stuff. "
"Don't delete everything. A good future partner won't demand that you do, either. I recommend that you go through and set the privacy level of a good chunk of it to ""Only Me"" so that you aren't overloading people with a ton of photos of you and your ex, but leave some of it as well so that it doesn't look like you're trying to write her out of your story.

Anyone you date in the future will know you were married in the past, so it doesn't really make sense to have a social media profile that makes it look like you've always been single. They're going to get into a relationship with you based on who you are right now, which includes your past with her as a series of major formative experiences. Just use your best judgment as far as which photos you set to private and which you keep open for friends and the public, but don't delete anything right now.

As far as it upsetting you to see it, I recommend spending way less time on Facebook so that it's not an issue."
"OP you created a throwaway account on an online anonymous internet forum. Stop dancing around the topic and just share what he's suggesting and what the hell ""spicier"" means. "
I kind of doubt that he's confused.
"I hate to break it to you, but SAHMs are ALSO working full-time and the most common type of post in this sub at the moment is ""I look after the kids all day every day, including weekends, whilst my husband gets to chill out upon coming home from work and I'm really mega stressed, HELP"". Hence my question to OP: what does he do apart from earning a salary? For example, does he take the kids off her hands for an hour when he gets in so she can shower and attend to her own needs? "
"For real, I’ll admit I had to be a bit of a caretaker in my last relationship. It was honestly draining at times to have to stand for the both of us when she couldn’t due to depression. But I would never ever in my life blame her for what she was going through. That’s not on her. 

It’s on her to take the steps to get herself better, which she did. But honestly dude sounds like a total ass."

"&gt; having to live with my mother and shes always around and we have no privacy once kids are in bed.

There's a lot to choose from here and a lot going on. But why on earth are you two still living with your mother? "
"Shes losing her mind over a Facebook post?? That's behaviour of a 14year old.

No you shouldn't remove it, it was a silly post and she's decided to go over the top and behave like a child. "
"As someone who had post part in depression, and completely lost my sex drive.. I just want to weigh in here. 

It can be really confusing to suddenly have no desire what so ever, and she may have been exploring ways to get that back, and I too wondered if I was asexual because I just didn’t want to have sex ever again. I knew I used to like it, I just didn’t want to do it even if I tried. 

So she’s tried me time, tried to make herself feel more attractive and it hasn’t made a difference. Counselling might help. I think with PPD you can have as much “me” time as you like but you are very aware these children will need you for the next 18 years + 

I don’t get all the financial spend though, can’t comment on that. If you are paying for a full time nanny she should be working full time in my opinion, and contributing to the household. I can’t even comprehend having a full time nanny and going out all day every day. 

Cut the nanny hours or tell her to get a job, go to counselling together and if it doesn’t pan out prepare to move on, as you deserve as equal relationship too. "
Hit the nail on the head. Your kink weirds her out and it would weird most people out this is why you chose to hide it from her and she feels cheated bc she grew an emotional attachment to you without knowing that this is something you can’t live without. She invested years into a relationship without truly knowing all of you. 
"Are all of them about controlling or altering your behavior/actions/activities?

From where I'm sitting, it really looks like he might be trying to set up a standard/precedence for controlling you, ramping up to the point where its becomes undeniably abusive (imo, it already is with that ""do what you're told"" bit)."
"&gt;  I cant just throw him out because I think he is too fragile to function alone.

You're enabling a grown man, who you yourself said, figured out how to get to a place 700 miles away. If you don't hold him to any demands or ultimatums, there's nothing here that we could do to help you. "
Sounds like you have an alcoholic bf who prioritizes his nightly beers over a healthy sexual relationship with his girlfriend
"Even better, don’t have sex with her. "
"Both subs apply, actually. At justnomil we accept tales of both mothers and mothers in law!! "
I’d hazard a guess that this girl does *not* come from a healthy household. This is so outside the bounds of normal behavior that I wonder if this girl has ever *met* men outside her family before. Something is very off here. 
"Agreed, though I wonder if she's objectively comparing the lyrics to those of the music she listens to.  NPR has a podcast called Hidden Brain that had an episode ""Rap on Trial"" in which they talked about a study where people were asked to evaluate written lyrics.  When told they were rap lyrics they were rated as more violent/offensive than if they were told they were country lyrics (the test had songs from both genres).  Lots of songs have violence, cursing, etc. in them, not just rap.  If none of the songs she listens to contain that then it's a reasonable line to draw.  However if she's playing songs with comparable lyrics than it seems to be a bias against the genre, a bias which does have some racist tones."
"For your sake I hope she isn't cheating, but whatever the case may be, she has most definitely broken your trust, played with your heart, refused to be accountable, and refused to take responsibility for her actions. These things are not okay, and they're most definitely worth ending a marriage over if she won't understand just how much pain and uncertainty she's causing and commit herself fully to making amends and becoming a better wife. From the sound of it, she definitely hasn't arrived at that point yet and if your patience is already at its end, then that's fine. You don't owe it to her to stick around and wait for her to figure her shit out. "
"I was going to say that you shouldn't do anything that you regret (breaking up) because I know a lot of guys our age can be stupid and be immature, but then I saw he was 24 and he said:

&gt; Then he called me weak for letting jokes go over my head 

He's an idiot. A 24 year old idiot as well. I would understand if he was our age, but man he's dumb for his age. And then he says:

&gt; and that means I am weak and he wont have a weak girlfriend 

Are you fucking kidding me? Did he just break up with you because **he's** being disrespectful? 

Alright, break up with him. There's a difference between calling your GF names (like bitch - **ONLY if she isn't offended, it's playful and she does the same to you**) and saying it knowing your GF would hate it. He doesn't really care about your feelings. Just end it.

I'm astonished that so many guys in their 20's are this stupid and women date them. Nobody deserves to be disrespected, especially in a relationship. "
"Oh yeah she's gonna call it ""MY BAAAAAAAAAAABY"""
"It definitely sounds like, bare minimum, he’s just not that into her anymore. I can’t imagine leaving my boyfriend behind for a wedding - he’s a blast at weddings! Of course I’d want him there. "
"What's with him? Seriously, how can people not see the gigantic double standards that they wrap themselves into. "
"You bring up a lot of very solid points. If I mean anything to him, he should just nip this in the bud because it’s important to ME. He hasn’t even offered to not go to the rave with her, he has only said “after this rave... “ blah blah blah. 

Ugh. This is getting super clear and this sucks."
"Your girlfriend should have been honest about the bloke she slept with but you sound super insecure anyway. You've discussed your thoughts about these friends, she obviously gets something from their friendships so you need to leave her to now use her own judgement regarding boundaries etc."
"As a physician, I often find that it starts with CICO and comes down to a million other factors; time, money, accessibility, energy, mental/emotional health, support network, relationship with food, relationship with exercise, physical ability levels, etc. CICO is the easy part and the part we understand the best. The other factors are much harder to balance and why longterm weight loss is such a difficult thing for the majority of people.

It sounds like his wife wants help, but is so sensitive about her weight and weight loss that she is taking suggestions to be a judgment. I'd offer support and advice in the moment she asks, and also in that moment ask her what she wants that support to look like, and give some examples of times you've offered to help her and how she's responded. It also maybe sounds like she wants someone to share the 'blame' for her 'failure' but there should not be any blame and looking at overeating one day as a 'failure' is a really unproductive way to change your diet. Progress is not always linear, and there will be ups and downs."
"It really doesn’t matter what “strange men” do. What matters is what OP does, and that’s why it ultimately comes down to the boyfriend’s trust in her. 

And, like the other comment mentioned, nothing really makes these men strange. They just sound like regular people who are involved in similar hobbies as OP. "
"You guys are fundamentally incompatible on not just one, but SEVERAL issues - how you'll raise kids, what you eat, whether family will live with you, whether you'll participate in religious events. Even if he hasn't demanded that you convert, it's coming and will probably be a demand that comes up when he proposes. Sometimes love isn't enough when you have compromise on everything that's important to you."

"I scoped your post history to see if you've posted about this anywhere else (I'm always pretty skeptical when someone comes here with a full-on confession of their wrongs) and saw that you have BPD.  I know that people here talk a lot about needing to feel genuine remourse over this kind of behavior before you can hope to fix anything, but you need to remember that this kind of dramatic *display* of your remourse is only feeding into your disorder.  You say you've already been to therapy, so I know you already know this.  You seriously need to dive back into your mental health 110% before this shit escalates any further. "
How the hell are you overreacting? Your ADDICT boyfriend stole from you(likely didn't pay it back) and allows his friends to disrespect you. Why are you still with him? Ditching his friends won't make him a better guy.He will still be a 22 yr old jackass who would rather make himself happy than be a fucking man partner and father. Pack your kids up and GTFO. 
"You need therapy. Your boyfriend cannot be your therapist. That is a lot of pressure to put on someone. It seems like things are okay for now, but if you continue to put this pressure on him, you will lose him. 

Your boyfriend sounds like a decent guy that is getting overwhelmed by needing to be your therapist and your boyfriend. 

Now, your feelings are valid. It's okay to be upset. Your boyfriend didn't handle himself well when he was out with his friends. 

At the same time, I don't really understand how that argument spiralled out of control like it did. Because as valid as your feelings are, his feelings are valid too. Maybe I read wrong, but your boyfriend told you he needed alone time with friends, and you flat out invalidated his feelings as bullshit, which turned into an argument. Needing alone time with friends isn't ""bullshit"" and it's not an excuse to get away from you. Needing alone time with friends is normal in healthy relationships. 

I'm not saying your boyfriend was 100% in the right, because I'm sure there's more nuance there than I'm getting, but it sounds like the argument started because neither of you were in the right headspace and neither of you actually knew what the argument was about. It seems to me like you wanted reassurance that you would get some quality time together soon, and instead he took your words as you invalidating his feelings and not wanting him to see his friends. A therapist can totally help you learn how to express your feelings fully and how to discuss differences, instead of arguing. "

Your boyfriend is extremely shitty if he thinks someone groping you against your will means you cheated on him.  What in the actual fuck.
"&gt;  I will add to be ready to suggest things, or just do something if she is slow to respond. Sometimes when a person is overwhelmed having to think of a task for someone is surprisingly exhausting.

Ding ding ding.  Her having to keep up with what needs to be done in order to tell him what he needs to do only serves to further increase her mental load.  "
"Not the OP, but if you're just getting started on reading women, you might start with the classics. A few names: Toni Morrison, Jane Austen, Zora Neale Hurston, Margaret Atwood, Octavia Butler, Patricia Highsmith, Shirley Jackson, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers, Alice Munro, Anne Tyler, Jeanette Winterson, Maya Angelou. 

Some more modern female fiction writers that I love: Lauren Groff, Jennifer Egan, Tayari Jones, Alissa Nutting, Helen Oyeyemi, Madeline Miller, Hanya Yanagihara (though I should note that she usually doesn't write about women primarily, I just mention her because I love her so much), Jacqueline Woodson, Donna Tartt, Zadie Smith, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Celeste Ng. 

If you're looking for something that's easier, you might try Rainbow Rowell, Jasmine Guillory, Angie Thomas, Jennifer Weiner, or Liane Moriarty - all good storytellers who are a little more accessible and easy to read than the above. "

"IDK if it were me, and my BF's friends were telling me to ""get a grip"" I'd feel pretty cornered and like I had nowhere to turn. OP can chime in to defend this if he wants, but I've been in a situation where my (now ex) BF would insist all of *his* friends were *our* friends, even though they were kind of awful people. It sounds like OP's girlfriend was hanging out with her real friends to get away from him. "
"To be fair to the boyfriend, he did not tell her she could not look the way she looks, he just admitted he no longer finds her attractive.  Also, he commented that he did not like masculine showing off by guys either, so it was not a gender/stereotype thing (though given the circumstances, I wouldn't call it showing off).

They can break up without him being a bad guy."
"This is exactly right. My kids are teenagers and I still have days were I am touched out, especially during school breaks. ""Me time"" is very important for moms. Giving her some time to take a bath, read a book, and just check out for an hour or two can do wonders. "
Exactly. Sunken cost fallacy traps so many people
"Hi! I grew up like you. I remember crowding around the oven because we had electricity but we didn't have heat. And not having enough to eat. We didn't go to cheque cashing places, but Mom did play fast and loose with mailing cheques to get us through the lean times.

I just want to say, yes, that shit leaves a mark on your soul. I'm also much better off now, but I have food enough on hand to last months, because you just never know.

So believe me when I tell you, this is a him issue, not a you issue. And its not so much that he's a clueless gift giver, its that he then attacks you and calls you names when you don't swoon thats the issue for me.

My SO is a terrible gift giver, if I don't give him a specific list of exactly what I want, where to get it, I just won't get xmas gifts (this has happened more than once). And even then, the list has to be very direct. If I give him any leeway at all he'll buy the weirdest things. However, we've been together for 14 years, and any time he's gotten me something I didn't want (or something so bizarre I wonder who it really was for) I laugh, he laughs, and we have a good chuckle. No one gets mad at anyone because its a gift, it should be a happy occurrence, even if its wrong.

But your SO gets mad at you and calls you names? AND then theres the fact that he is ALSO like this with food...

Is he also like this with other things?

Were you able to decorate your home or was it all how he wanted it to go? What about other things like car purchases? Parenting? Is it all his way or the high way? Cuz it sounds like this is bigger than just gifts."

Addicts, self included, often will lash out at the world. And when the world lashes back, we feel our anger is justified.

"Weddings shouldn't be a surprise. He could have told you at any point in the proceedings what was happening, even the day before. As a bride you want to choose your perfect dress, hairstyle etc at least.
 Surely he and your family know you well enough to realise that this might not have been the best idea?
Also hes acting childishly ignoring you, like hes super hurt that it didn't work out like HE planned. This is the worrying part. Is this something that will happen every time he decides he knows best? Major purchases that he doesn't run by you?  Massive life decisions without consulting you? Pouting for days because he got it wrong? 
He needs to have a massive word with himself if things are going to move forward.

"It’s kind of like saying “I am smoking 2 packs a day but I’m fine with it.”

You’re thinking, being obese is not the same thing smoking.  You’re right, it’s worse for your health than smoking is.  You’re more likely to get cancer from obesity than smoking, along with many other diseases.  I’ve had an aunt and my childhood best friend’s dad lose a leg from diabetes from obesity.

Your parents are the guardians of your health.  You’re ignoring them then expecting to be treated as if you aren’t destroying your body/health and telling your parents to get over it.

Why not change your eating habits and exercise a bit and be healthy?"

Sit him down and have a heart to heart talk. Do it when you are capable of speaking to him without anger or sarcasm (it’s tough, I know!), and give your reasons on why he will need to begin his next phase in life. 

He should either re-enlist or work full time

He needs to have enough saved in the next 30 days to get his own place, or rented room from Craigslist 

Depending on how the talk goes, you may need to present him with eviction papers, (not sure if this is needed in your jurisdiction), or a move out date.

At 23, he has to be in school or the military or working full time. He probably can go to school for free, and should begin to look into his options.

Explain to your son, that you cannot support him, and that its time for him to begin adulting.

"OP, can you ask your lawyer what it would take for you to be awarded full custody of the kids, and supervised visits when their mom takes them? This is not healthy for the kids to be growing up thinking that it's normal to have one loving and one neglectful parent and a random controlling grandparent who says negative things about their loving dad. This has to stop. Your 9 and 8 year old, at least, are already being affected by this dynamic, I assure you. If your wife is unwilling to get treatment for her unhealthy attachment to her mother and unhealthy treatment of the kids, you've got a responsibility to the kids to protect them. You are in the right track with your instincts and parenting. Keep with it. "

"I'm sorry you went through that, but this is an incredibly problematic response. 1) Not all men are immature, and 2) saying you don't understand why men spend time with their male friends who ""can't give sex"" implies that a woman's primary value comes from her ability to have sex. Which is just... really offensive on so many levels.

"&gt;but as soon as the situation feels stressful, I ‘nope’ out of there.

This is something you're going to have to work on. When you work in an office you're going to encounter a wide variety of people and/or things that are stressful. You can't always control how people treat you, but you *can* control how you react to the situation. 

You didn't really give specific examples of how he's treating you, so it's hard to gauge if he's just ""opinionated"" about XYZ stuff (and you're taking it personally) or if he's genuinely being a bully. 

Your office is small so I'm assuming you probably don't have an HR department. However, you still have a few different options. You can find a new job. You can choose not to let him affect you and disengage when he ramps up. You can also try pulling him aside and politely asking him not to do XYZ thing that's bothering you. Each option has their own list of pros and cons.

If I were you, I would find a new job. Think about your career rather than your work relationships. Do you really have much opportunity to advance in the position you're in now? Working in a larger office will give you more benefits in terms of experience, culture, and advancement opportunities."
I mean it sounds like if she went over 1 a week it would be better for both of them. She said that he is usually less stressed/up for fun 1 a week so it seems like they should just plan out a day once a week to meet up while he is studying. That he can dedicate time to her on.
"As English isn't your first language can I ask if you're from mainland Europe? The culture for topless sunbathing is very different and normalised so this would make a huge difference.

Tbh if you're both not sleeping with other people and being faithful to one another it sounds like you're both still in a relationship, so i question the 'on a break' part. 

It sounds as if the on a break part, is there incase either of you sleep with someone else there won't be a reason for either of you to get mad.

Maybe you should have a conversation with him, and just define what is going on with you two? 

As it's unfair for him to give you shit when you're both on a break, as this is your time to be single, and you're very entitled  to experiment and see what you want. 

Hope things get sorted for you, and you enjoy your time abroad x"
"At your age I would throw away that relationship in a heartbeat over something like that. That's an extreme level of disrespect and immaturity, and you'll always have those comments in the back of your mind when you deal with him. Your friends are also pretty shitty for trying to downplay it."
"Because jumping on her when she is in physical pain will not lead to an open, honest, and constructive conversation. You can be pissed as hell at someone and still calmly assess a situation and pick a proper time to start a conversation. 

Imagine this: you wake up with your head pounding, barely remembering where you are or how you got there, body in pain. As soon as you realize “oh, I’m home. How did that happen?” someone comes in and starts yelling at you about how you embarrassed them. Odds are it’s just going to end in yelling and arguing, and her going defensive. She probably won’t want to listen to a word he says, even if he’s right. 

If OP shows that he obviously still loves and cares about her, and makes sure she is in the proper mental state to have a serious conversation, then she will be more open to criticism. You can be pissed at someone and let them know your feelings (and that they did something wrong) and still have tact. "
Sexual coersion and manipulation is something you divorce someone over.

OP - it sounds like you put him in a position where you refused to hand over the keys, and escalated things to where getting physical with you was the only way he could get you out of the drivers seat with car keys. That's on you. And it's a colossal fuck up on your part, and for me, if I was with someone who acted that way, that right there would be a deal breaker for me.

That doesn't excuse his gas lighting you. But using the level of force he felt he needed to remove the keys from you and get you out of the driver's seat? You wrote: ""I know I was not acting out of control."" But it sure sounds like you were. I'm shaking my head wondering why anyone should have to use force in the first place to get keys out of a drunk's hands. There's nothing cute and flirty about threatening to drive drunk. Just like there's nothing cute and flirty about drunkenly waving a loaded gun around in a crowd. WTF, OP. WTF.  "
"What do you want? Permission to break up? Granted, then. But it seems like you want to be right and her wrong and somehow the bad guy, as if she did something bad or duped you. That’s not true. You can dump anyone for any reason but don’t act like she’s a problem for wanting time with her SO. If you’re not compatible, end it. It’s that easy. But complaining about her isn’t a good look. Neither is her playing games, so you’re both wrong there and if that bugs you enough to end it, it's reason enough.

Also, working those long hours isn’t healthy or commendable. Your job isn’t going to love you or take care of you when you get that stress-related illness (and I know this from personal experience; I ground myself into dust with my demanding career, now I get to deal with an autoimmune illness til I die, good times).

Dump her so she can find someone who wants to spend time with her but lay off the whining. And comparing people to your exes."
"This, along with him bringing up she's turning out to be like his ex (uhhh...), makes me wonder if he's saying that sort of thing right to her. As in, ""oh, you're acting like ex right now!"""
"Do not see him. thats a booty call for sure. what guy calls a girl he's dumped and says he needs her ""friendship and stability"" "
"&gt;My boyfriend is considering breaking up over this

And he'd be doing you a huge favour by going through with it. He's an arsehole for putting the blame of some creep's actions on you, and I think if you're honest with yourself, this probably isn't the first time he has displayed arsehole behaviour in the two and a half years you've been together. Overreactions like this rarely come from nowhere.

You deserve much better than this. Break up with him, girl."
"Wow, that guy is amazing. Do all the relationship work with him and HANG ON. He's a keeper. I've never once met anyone with that level of self-awareness and empathy. (That's on me though, I make terrible choices because reasons.) "

"Here are some phrases:

""Mmm, great""

""Uh huh, cool""

Stop engaging this woman. Conversation is not a competition either of you can ""win"".  She's sticking her nose into your life so she can feel better about her own. 

Whenever she corners you, make vaguely agreeable noises until she fucks off. If she asks you questions, reply blandly and ask her more questions about herself. It sounds like she enjoys talking about her own shit, use that. "
"Your plan to not keep stuff in the bathroom anymore is a good start, and if you don't have a lock for your bedroom door, do that. You can just swap out the doorknob for one with a key lock. Even if you're not handy, if you have access to a screwdriver, the new doorknob will come with instructions. 

Your parents are the ones setting up your brother. He has a condition that makes certain things difficult, but he's not incapable of learning.  When he destroyed the TV, or when he destroys/damages their stuff, how do they react? Is that worthy of enforcing rules and consequences, and it's only when it comes to your shit that they decide it's not a big deal?

Honestly, your parents are such jerks, that I would just start using your mom's pads and makeup and curling/flat iron to replace yours, even if it's not stuff you'd normally use. Or take something and sell it to get money to replace your stuff. Does your brother have anything of value - video games, action figures, whatever? Okay, maybe not, seeing as how that's stealing. How about something that's more of a gray area, like a piece of your bedroom furniture you don't care about, maybe a bookshelf or a nightstand? You could sell it on Craigslist, and if your parents get mad, claim ignorance ""Oh, I thought that was mine, and I didn't want it anymore, so I sold it for money to replace the stuff Brother destroyed. I didn't think you'd mind."" Or maybe your bike from when you were a kid, or ugly jewelry your mom gave you, old board games, or even taking some books to the used bookstore to sell. Or maybe go around the house occasionally, pointing out things and asking ""Do you use/want/play with this anymore?"" (without mentioning why you're asking), then once you've got a nice collection of stuff that people have said they don't use/want, sell it all. If they complain, say ""Well you said I could. Remember I asked you if you want this anymore, and you said 'no'?""

But mostly get out of there as soon as you can. "

Well, except for the whole pre-marital sex thing.

&gt; Is he just being a complete asshole

Yes.

&gt; Is there anything I can do to help him? 

No, and don't even try.  Best to block him and move on with your life.  He got his variety and is maybe now expressing regrets about it, but that's the path he chose.

"So... he cheats on girls he looks at like his little sister? Umm... Gross? 

You got that right it's predatory as hell. Is 16 a minor where you live? **After** you are no longer living with this guy, let her parents know asap. Can you leave soon? In case he flips out on you, just make sure you're safe first. You can't help her before you help yourself. Remember, she's a kid. He's the adult. He's gross and should know better. 

Then, let her parents know so they can deal with it and just gtfo out of dodge. I don't see any good of trying to confront him. 

At best, I'd just tell the guy he really needs therapy if he's still trying to hang out with teenagers at his age, there's clearly something wrong. That's real weird. "

"I think, before you two agree to be engaged, you need to come to a compromise on this.  A few counseling sessions would help you two.  Neither of you are wrong in your thinking, and both ways work for different couples.  But unless you two come up with a common solution, it's not going to work."

"To his credit, he was downstairs watching TV and I was upstairs cleaning and came down and noticed he was slurring his words today.

"You need to set a bedtime routine to your phone, explain it to her during the day and stick to it.  “Girlfriend, I’m going to bed at 12 every night. This is not a surprise.” The fact that she pretends every night that bedtime is a surprise is like fighting with a five year old about bath time.  Tell her “You need to start your bedtime routine at 11:30 and leave me alone to get my sleep or you will be effecting my mental health.”  You need to tell her this during the day. Bedtime is not a hostage negotiation. 

If she wants to throw in wash after that or play reddit she can but you are going to sleep and she is not to bother you. You need to get her to agree to this during the day. Also...losing her train of thought on reddit? Who gives a fuck? 

I trained myself to stop picking my face. You know how? I convinced myself of the truth. You can do an hour long 40 step beauty routine with $100 cleanser, $80 toner, and $200 moisturizer but you’re wasting your time and money if you stand in the mirror and pick your face. Might as well not bother if you’re going to pick. "

"&gt; I know the woman I'm marrying

I'm not going to challenge you on this, but I will provide a brief check (if you are doing pre-marital counseling, which I highly recommend, then you likely can ignore this) for you to ensure your confidence is on point. Here are the topics you should explore before tying the knot:

- Religion. Are there any religious incompatibilities? Is anyone expecting someone to convert, or to have their ceremony in a specific location or with a specific officiant? Are either of you harboring some notion that the other person eventually will 'come around' to the other's way of thinking? Asking this last question explicitly is not a bad idea! Perhaps more importantly (and specific to you because you likely have this sorted out, mostly?), how will religion factor into raising any children (if children are part of the plan)? What religious beliefs will be offered (or expressly taught), and will this influence school choice or where one will live, etc.? Will anyone resent the other because of religious choices (or lack of expected choices not yet fully voiced) as time goes on?

- Politics. Are there any huge political incompatibilities here? No one needs to agree on 100% of the issues, but if one of you thinks the other is a baby murderer (or the other thinks you fundamentally misunderstand the concept of personal autonomy and a person's right to control their own body, etc.), then you might not be in for a great time in the long run.

- Sex. Are you two actually expressly happy with sex? Have you two, outside of intimate time, discussed openly what you are interested in doing? Are there any unfulfilled expectations, hopes, etc.? What is your ideal (let's say practical ideal and absolute ideal) frequency and duration (and preferred level of effort, which might vary from encounter to encounter)? Have both of you expressly stated your preferences without one of you just saying you agree with the other person? If there is somehow 100% agreement across the board (or yes, 100% agreement on some or many things, that does happen), then great. But that should be clear. Many people are blindsided by things because they just assume everything is fine while the other partner 'puts up with it' or tries to accept it, with resentment growing over time. ""Well, he/she/they didn't say anything, so how was I supposed to know?"" Ask. Ask the embarrassing questions (but respectfully and politely). Tell the embarrassing truths. Leave no stone unturned (at least as far as discussion goes).

- Money. How do you (and how *will* you) apportion financial responsibilities? Is there some sort of tradeoff with other relationship responsibilities? Do you actually both agree to those terms? Will there be a joint account, separate accounts, or some combination of those? What are your highest priorities (debt payments, mortgage, retirement, childrens' college funds, etc.)? What is the largest purchase (dollar-wise or sorted by type, perhaps, if not making it clear on both topics) one can make without consulting the other one?

- Children. Are you both 100% clear on what you prefer here? If one of you is ""absolutely no"" on children, is the other person just figuring they will come around? If one of you wants 2 children but the other one wants 3, is the 3-children person okay with only 2 (or vice versa?). How flexible are you on preferences (e.g., maybe 3 if financially well-positioned but only 2 if barely keeping it together)? How will you discipline children? Is spanking okay? Is it timeouts and removal of rewards only? How do you resolve one child going to the other parent to avoid being told ""No"" by the other one? How do you resolve a disagreement about a ""Yes"" or a ""No"" on something (I at least highly recommend you have the discussion outside the presence of the kids to the extent possible and then present a united front)? What age is the right age for a facebook account or a cellphone? Are you two expecting to buy a car for your children (and if so, what kind; does each child get a car; etc.?). What are expectations for education (private school or not, and what kind) K-12, then of what about college funding, etc.?

- Geography (might not be relevant). Is one of you secretly (or having left 'hints') hoping or expecting that you move back to a particular hometown area, or to be close to a particular family member (or one spouse's family generally)? How will long-term moves relate to career goals and options? Etc. etc.

I'm not looking to have you justify anything to me, and I don't need a response. But I do sincerely hope you two have walked through these questions (if not more) before tying the knot. It's great to even pose hypotheticals (I had a few examples above already, so I will leave well enough alone at this point).

Anyhow, I hope all is well, and I apologize if this was a pointless read for you!"
"Much of what you just said is *more* of a warning sign for alcoholism, not less.

&gt; He's not a sloppy drunk and he handles his beer well. (Which is true.)

He drinks so often, that 6 beers in a night has no effect on him? That's not comforting.

&gt; He works a hard job and he wants to unwind after work. It's what motivates him to finish his work and come home. (""A cold one and you baby is what I look forward to"")

Beer is his highest motivating factor, alongside you. Alcohol can be a nice way to relax after a tough day, but it should not be what motivates him to get through the day, every single day. And it certainly shouldn't be on the same priority level as his SO.

&gt; He actually use to be a hardcore alcoholic a few years ago, before we got together...He got a DUI when he was 21, as well.

So he has an admitted history of intense alcoholism. Yet he's seriously convinced himself that he's ""fine"" now, at 4-6 drinks a night?

Plus, on top of this, from your original post, he can't even sleep well without drinking. That's a borderline physiological dependency. And since he's convinced that he can't have sex after drinking, that means he's consciously making the choice to drink instead of have sex with you. Every single night.

Not to downplay the issues with selfishness in the bedroom here, but honestly this seems like a much bigger problem (and resolving it may help your relationship's bedroom issues as well)."
Also that’s insanely creepy to JO to pictures of friends or whatever and no it’s not something “every guy does” as a guy I can attest. Hope you figure it out.

"Well, this guy clearly objects. Was he consulted? Did he voice his objection? Then how was this allowed?

I mean, if you have permission, you're not personally doing anything wrong, but I have to say, if there is no medical/service need for the dog and it has been allowed over someone's objections, that's pretty unprofessional and disrespectful to your colleague on the part of your employer. I'm not surprised he's salty. He is, however, directing it at the wrong person. "
"Leaving the dogs outside isn’t really a solution. 

That said, it sounds like these dogs are being neglected. Dogs require more than food, water, and cuddles to thrive. They need directed exercise and mental stimulation. 

I’d recommend crate training the boxer, obedience classes for everyone, and a mandatory dog walking schedule. 

If they won’t provide the care and interaction the dogs require, walk. "

"This post made me nauseous, it was honestly that gross. You’re not overreacting for wanting your partner to treat you with basic compassion. "
"Do not listen to this person op. Please. I have a rare cat breed too and she is absolutely an indoor only cat. You are being completely reasonable and sound like a responsible cat owner, I’m sorry your parents are so careless. If you’ve sat down and spoken with them seriously I think the only solution is to keep your cat in your room when you’re not there to monitor (at school or whatever). When you’re home your cat can roam about the house and go outside with you on the leash. Until you move out I think you will just need to be extra careful. Also it’s good you take pet theft seriously. It’s very common with rare breeds and happened once to me when my cat got out :/ not a fun experience."
"In America, cats are preferred indoors. They damage the local wildlife more than you would expect, and they are frequently hit. Any cat that appears to have value may be stolen and sold on Craigslist. Where I live, we’ve had a problem with someone poisoning outside cats. We also have trouble in my area with kittens and small cats being used as bait animals for dog fighting. Overall, indoor only is best. "
"\&gt;  When he's mad he tends to act like a child would, by yelling, throwing things, mocking me, ignoring me, 

it doesn't matter if he's a cheater.  he's treating you badly.  Leave.  

seriously, there's no such thing as a ""late thirties work in progress.""  This is what you are going to get from him, and it's probably going to get worse in time. 

find someone who is actually mature and not just older than you, and treats you nicely.  there's no reason to put up with a bad relationship. "
"In general, I think you'll find that when you tell guys that the only way they get to have sex with you is with a condom, and then you demonstrate that you mean it by not sleeping with him without one, that he'll get over his issues with condoms relatively quickly. 

Condoms are awkward and annoying and sometimes (temporarily) boner-killing, but they're not THAT awkward and annoying. 

This is particularly absurd because he's claiming to be worried about his health. If he's sleeping with people without condoms without HIV tests first, he is being a damn fool and an incredible hypocrite about his health. "

I would not suggest lawyers in the first instance on this occasion although those posters are 100% correct this is a life ending accusation, she needs to be told that this view is seriously damaging and you are getting a professional involved to resolve it as YOU are not equipped to do so

If she refuses........Exit plan

Hopefully she will accept a neutral 3rd party (let her choose if she wants to find it so you can't be accused of manipulating the process)

A lot of guys know about and freer being selfish sex partners, and as a consequence the ""she comes first"" mentality has been drilled in to them. The problem is that sometimes it becomes about validating them either in their sexual prowess or in their willingness to give.

Whether you orgasm or don't, it's becoming about him. His validation."

She's saying she doesn't want to be involved with a father. Not that she doesn't want him involved with his child.
I'd say it's most likely that she's found someone through Pokemon Go and that she's cheating. It's impossible to say without snooping and that's really up to OP's friend. If he did snoop that'd be a violation of trust but what can you really do in these situations. She doesn't sound like she wants to respond so yeah the advice already given of getting a lawyer is fairly sound.

"I’m going to say his willful ignorance of women’s bodies isn’t some inconvenience. It is leading to entitlement and control. 

No one should have a baby they don’t want. But you can try again in a year? Where is the logic there? A year is not a long time. So to me that’s not a solution. It’s just a “do what I say right now and maybe I’ll entertain your wishes later”. It would be different if he outlined some 2-3 year plan. But he didn’t. A year means he’s just shoving this off. 

He understands your chances to conceive aren’t so high. He doesn’t actually care OP. He’s in his rights to prefer not to adopt but look at the ease and confidence with which he makes these decisions. No consideration of you or your realities. Just “this is what I demand. No baby now but biological babies as soon as *I* am ready”. 
His overall tone is worrisome. 

Plan to have this baby, if that’s what you want, alone. You can do it. You’re financially responsible and independent. You will have child support (not for you but for the child so please try not to refuse it; my mother did and it meant so many small impacts like not getting dance lessons, etc).  

Deep breaths. Make the decision best for you. His logic is flawed. You’ll be pregnant for 9 months which is almost a year. Don’t abort if you’re not okay doing so. You know the realities of your condition. And remember this, OP. Partners may disagree on an unplanned pregnancy but he’s being insensitive and disrespectful about it. There’s also a lot of misogynistic ignorance about your body as a woman, and it’s leading to entitled comments and behaviors. Be wary. 

Also know that if you do decide to abort that’s your choice and it’s a fine choice of you’re not ready. But remember his response. Even if you choose termination, remember this lack of support. And don’t for a moment let him act like you’re agreeing with him. These are your own reasons. "
"He went into your personal things. He invaded your privacy. You don't owe him your past. It doesn't belong to him. How did you lie to him? Did you tell him you were never druged and assaulted?

Then his reaction is just so over the top. He asked for hos ring back and kicks you out saying it a ""deal breaker"" but yet he wants to talk next week. Tell him he can stick his talk next week up his backside because you don't date selfish, self centered, snooping, trust breaking, a-holes who want to make a woman's rape about themselves.

"So all she does all day is take care of you, two young kids, and the house, and you wonder why she has no libido? The answer is obvious: no one is taking care of her. Has she gotten any time off since the baby was born? I don't mean ""I took care of the kids while she showered"" I mean ""she got to leave the house for hours and wasn't bothered about the kids the entire time."" Give the poor woman a break.

And you should really be stepping it up if she's cooking for 4 people 3 times a day, 7 days a week. By letting her cook every meal for you and do all the housework you've essentially slotted yourself into the third child role. Women often stop wanting to have sex with their husbands if they're caring for them just as equally as they're caring for their children. You need to step it up and do some of the caring yourself, or you'll permanently lose the marriage you had before kids."

"Yes, one of the worst pains I've felt in my life.  "
I hope you're not planning on letting her babysit...
"It's your sisters wedding,  what she wants goes.  You and your sister need to be a united front and put your mom in her place.  If she pulls the plug on helping, be honest when contacting guests who have already planned on free room and board.  Your sister can not and should not provide that, that was your mothers agreement and any issues need to be taken directly with her.  Don't engage any relatives who give you shit about it,  tell them to contact your mother.  I say you go NO contact and don't even feel bad about it.  Who cares what yrealtived you see once in a blue moon think? You and your sister are caving to your mothers manipulative and cruel machinations,  and you need to cut the tie.  "
"Your husband should tell them they will never stay at your house ever again.  He should also shame them for wishing ill luck on both of you.

If you are religious (or even if you're not) let them know that you've lit a candle (or paid to have one lit at church/temple/whatever) and are praying they will get what they deserve.  It's ambiguous, they'll feel threatened by it, but if/when it bounces back on you it should bring good things to you - you deserve a break, a raise, tranquility in your home, etc.  

"
"The whole point of his numerous threats is so that when he follows through, which he will, he can say he warned you and it’s your fault you didn’t listen. He is telling you what to expect:

- if you do A again, I will get angry and verbally explode (then when you do perfectly normal A thing, he explodes, but you knew he would so you brought it on yourself. Because he warned you. Repeatedly.)

- if you do perfectly normal B again, I will trash stuff (then when you do B again, which you will because it is a perfectly normal and regularly occurring thing to do, he will trash stuff but you asked for it because he specifically told you not to do that)

- if you do C again, I will whip your ass (see where this is going?)

The reason he is upset is because you threw a wrench into the works by letting him know that you won’t be allowing that kind of thing to happen. So he is currently working plan B which is to make you feel bad / guilty / shitty so you will **apologize for standing up for yourself in a perfectly normal and expected way**. Then he can get back to working plan A."
They're fucking in the bathrooms? That's disgusting and it needs to fucking stop. I wouldn't stick my neck out for all that crap about the relationship but that stuff is disgusting and probably violating some health and safety standards. 
"&gt;The issue is that they live out in the country and are big on not wasting money. The house they live in (same that I grew up in) is very old and lacks some of the finer things in life. It doesn't have fancy hardwood floors or plush carpets.

I believe the word you're looking for is 'rustic'.

I grew up in it, although I wouldn't exactly call it 'dirty' as much as I'd just call it 'not totally spotless clean'. 

Has she ever shown any contempt for other 'dirty' places (whether or not they're actually dirty)? Does she ritualistically keep your place totally spotless?

"
"&gt;to convince someone of having a child

Don't try to do this.

&gt;hope that he changes his mind

Also don't do this.

&gt;It's funny though because he has a sister who is a toddler that he adores and his roommate recently had a baby and he's always mentioning her or stopping to play with her.

How is that funny or weird? I don't want children, but I dote on my best friends' children, who all refer to me as their aunt, like crazy.

You guys aren't compatible."
"This is a shot in the dark, but I suspect friend may have been pestering her boyfriend for a while about an engagement ring, and perhaps he thought this would be an okay compromise: she gets a nice ring to show off, but he doesn't have to commit to an engagement before he's ready. 

"
It is. This is amazing. It should go on a wiki somewhere to give people in this situation a step-by-step guide. If I was int his situation having such a well written and detailed guide would help me a lot when i was too upset to think of everything myself.
Frankly I think OP deserves an apology for being referred to as a “b!tch.”  And husband thinks she should apologize for something that frankly wasn’t that big of a reaction from OP in response to her bratty nephew’s rudeness?  Just no.
"Sounds like she uses her tumblr as kind of like a diary and just vents thoughts and feelings from the moment. People who diary don't always mean what they say 100% of the time, sometimes you can have a very self destructive or negative thought pattern that passes when you write it out. So while that feeling could have been true in a period of self-hate or emptyness, it's not her true consistent feelings.   


Ask her about it, try and do so without accusation, and I know this is hard but without letting your hurt feelings speak loudly as well, so as calmly and with as much understanding as you can. Let her explain what she meant and where she really is. 

Don't let assumptions ruin what could be a true friendship, talk it out and go from there."
"So let me get this straight. 

You snooped through your boyfriend’s phone and got mad that he was friends with another woman?

I don’t know how to explain to you how weird, immature and unhealthy you acted. I think he should break up with you. "
"I mean...you made yourself out to be some sort of hero for not cheating on your gf. That's not exactly a ""harmless"" conversation. It's a pretty shitty one.

And then your friend proved himself to be a horrible person by encouraging you to cheat. So I'm guessing she's not going to want to talk to him ever again. "
"No you're not wrong.  

The people who you're hanging out with don't seem like friends. If they're telling you to get over him cheating on you and continue to hang out with him, then they're assholes.  

As tough as it is, find new friends. If they already know the situation between you and your ex than they're not worth it.  

Good luck OP."
"Oh god this is a disaster.  I had to check the ages like three times. 

There is no such thing as the friend zone. You are friends.  If you want more on top of being friends? Then you like her.  If you only want to date her, then you aren’t really her friend. 

Listen to the girl.  She wants to be single.  She’s angry at men who disrespect that.  Presumably she’s told all these men the same as she’s told you. She wants to be single.  

You don’t have to ask her out if you actually want to date her.  You can just let her know your interested and if she ever wants to she can give you a try.  If you’re genuinely friends being honest about this should be somewhat easy.

Do NOT tell her you are in love with her and that you and her are a perfect match; dude that is a two person decision. Not a one person.  Just because you think that doesn’t make it true. 

You just seem to be sat here thinking that you’re not like those other guys - but you are.  That she would never date those other guys because they aren’t like you - you don’t really know that.  That it doesn’t matter what she says because you have a plan and that plans obviously more important than her thoughts/feelings - they ain’t. 

Jesus Christ. Be a real friend to her.  She enjoys spending time with you.  Be honest with her in a non-creepy way about the fact you’d be interested in trying if she ever wanted to.    

You’re genuinely thinking about potentially destroying this friendship and losing her respect just because you “love” her.  That’s not love. "
"OP, this is correct.  She broke up with you, but apparently either she wasn't clear enough that you understood, or you're looking through your rose colored glasses and refusing to see the facts.  I'm sorry you're dealing with this, but you need to get a grip on reality.  And honestly, I agree with the poster who suggested you move out before she comes back.  I don't think you're in a place where you can handle living with her anymore.  Life is going to be easier for you in the long run if you can go no contact for a while. "
"Just remember that if you were with this ex-boyfriend right now, you'd probably be daydreaming about what it would be like to be with a man who treats you well, makes you feel special and loved, isn't constantly away travelling and probably flirting/cheating on you with other women, and most of all isn't abusing you in any way.

I know what it's like to daydream about having money. But life comes at everyone in a million different ways, and I know that the two of you will find your way back up. Go get a treat for your husband to thank him for being a good man, say you want to go for a little date night, and reignite that spark. :)"
"Honestly - I think for me this would almost be... not worse than an actual affair, maybe, but equally bad in a weird way? Assuming he's telling the truth and he just has a massive crush on this girl but she's not interested, he's actively lying to OP just to spend time with a girl who he has a one sided crush on? That's just... so hurtful. "
"I don't see anything to be upset about.  You had a (natural, but unnecessary) possessive/protective reaction over your sister, your GF apologized.

In reality, I don't think your GF violated any serious boundary issues here.  EVERYONE in the US knows the 21 year age limit for drinking is not only nonsense, it creates a really unhealthy relationship between teens and alcohol, but no one has the political courage to change the laws, so it's just ignored unless someone gets out of hand.  Plus, in the unlikely event that that was your sister's first experience with alcohol, it is much better to do it in a space where someone is looking out for her."

"He sounds gross. And he sounds like he's done this before - he's skilled enough to do just enough to creep you out, but not doing anything ""bad"" enough by itself, so that you have to worry you'll look ""difficult"" if you complain about him. I don't know what to do about it , except just try to keep your distance from his as much as you can, and re-direct any personal talk back to work-related matters. Maybe one tactic you can take is to use your ""Danish-ness"" to your advantage. Next time he asks you something personal or comments on your appearance, tell him ""I'm really surprised you say things like that. Where I'm from it's considered inappropriate to comment on personal things like that with co-workers, especially commenting on their appearance and asking about their romantic life. Is it not the same here?"" Maybe you could even add, ""I've wondered if it's just an American thing, but so far you're the only one who does it....""

If you have no problem being direct with him, you could try telling him next time ""Please don't comment on my appearance or romantic life,"" or even ""Comments on my appearance and questions about my romantic life are inappropriate.""  He my bluster and say he doesn't mean anything by it, or he's ""just teasing,"" or ""just being friendly,"" and then you can say ""Well, that's a relief to know. Since your intentions were good, I know you wouldn't want to make me uncomfortable, and the best way to ensure that is to not make those types of comments again. Thanks.""

Sorry if my suggestions aren't very helpful, but I do want to reassure you that it is NOT a cultural thing, and he is a creep."
“And for all you know”?? Girl. Wtf. He’s cool with his friends cheating and that means they know he’s a cheater too.
"I understand why you feel that way.

But if things had gone differently maybe you wouldn’t have what you have right now. Timing is so important when it comes to relationships. Maybe the universe felt like you both needed to go through things before you got together. 

Don’t think of it as time wasted, just think of it as a necessary part of the journey you guys had to take to end up together :)"
"At 26, there’s really no excuse I could think of that justifies what she’s done. I could see how someone younger and more naive could plausibly claim ignorance to how horrible this would look, but that doesn’t fly for a 26 year old. 

Does she realize she could’ve exposed herself to STDs? Does she realize the photographer who took the photos is probably keeping them in a personal stash forever? Does she not think what she’s done is cheating? 

This is a dump-able offense in my book. 

"
"Nope. If he has 4 other people under him and it looks like he is smoozy with one of them, it will be seen negatively still. There is perception of favoritism, there is perception that he can't maintain the boundaries that are necessary at higher up positions in bigger organization (I can see how it won't matter say in a 40 ppl office). 

Her being a woman adds to it, but am sure his bosses would take a dim view if he favored another guy over a period of time. "
"I don’t get it either, especially because if they leave their husbands, it won’t be any harder because their husband wasn’t helping them in any way and they were already doing everything on their own. They’ll actually have *less* work since they won’t have to play servant to a grown man."
"Honey, you are being set up for something BAD. You say you do not know how he knew you needed money? Sounds like an experienced TRAFFICKER. 

Do not talk to him again. Do not take the drugs he offers. Go home to Ukraine where you will be safe with family. I’m scared for what you’ve gotten yourself into. 

I’m praying for you. Please, do NOT talk to that boy again. "
"Where are you looking for these guys?

I was also financially independent through college.  It isn't really that rare.  You aren't typically going to find these people at a bar though, as they are scrimping by and saving money.

Also, if you realize you aren't as emotionally mature as a 30-something year old is (or should be), then you have to recognize that any 30-something year old is *looking* for an emotionally immature partner.  So right from the get-go they're looking to set up a power imbalance."
"Seriously. At some point I will be having a double mastectomy for cancer reasons, luckily my husband isn't going to flip out about how disgusting ""cutting my tits off"" is! "
"I don't know, dude. I think you have some really weird ideas about women as a group. It's not like every 30-40 year old woman is dying to have kids as soon as they find a man. The fact that you had two kids before you were 20 should pretty well indicate that not everybody follows the same life plan. How you managed to live such a nontraditional life and yet still think you have to find a 25 year old in order to not end up with a woman that wants a baby tomorrow is beyond me. "
"Lol “well I used to be engaged, but that ended”....









.... because we followed through and got married.

Lmao sorry but that is some hysterical lawyering on that dude’s part. Yeah the guy is a scumbag and your sister should stay away from him but she’s an “adult” (in years not in maturity or life experience) and as long as she goes into it knowing she’s setting herself up to get hurt I don’t really know what more you can do??"
"It's really embarrassing for her to have these ideas when many of the most iconic contributors to lesbian literature, activism, and history had had relationships with men and even had marriages and children with men.

Has she not heard of compulsory heterosexuality? "
"&gt;His brother was cheated on recently and that completely broke his heart to see.

That coupled with being seperated from you is the most likely explanation for this behaviour."
He says she does work part time. 
"I imagine she's sitting there wishing you'd just listen to her and respect her she tells you she isn't ready to go against her parents on this, but since you won't respect that, she keeps on throwing out reasons hoping she'll land on one you'll actually be willing to respect...

You're calling what she is doing hypocritical, but that is not what hypocrisy is. She's engaging in the immature and fearful tactic of a young woman who knows her partner won't respect her decisions unless she invents a reason that is ""good enough"" for him, so she keeps trying to invent something that is ""good enough"" to satisfy you. You end this bullshit by just respecting whatever the answer actually is (and it's probably ""My parents can't handle it"") and stop making her jump through hoops trying to placate you. "
"I physically shuddered reading this. DEBT IS VERY UNCOOL. OP, not only is he financially dumb as hell, but he's trying to drag you down to his level instead of learning why it is that you make the decisions you do. Please take note of that."
"So you don’t have to keep badmouthing the friend. 

The point is, your gf has explained multiple times that living together is a bad idea. It would be different if she lied to you and said “yeah I really want to do that!” but she doesn’t. It sounds like she points out the pros sometimes whenever you bring it up just to pacify you, but she’s still made it clear that she doesn’t want to do it. Maybe stop pressuring her and think about whether this is a dealbreaker for you or not. 

Honestly 20 years old is so young to move in with a SO, especially if she is receiving family pressure. It seems like you are really putting her in an awkward position here. 

I suggest enjoying your youth and finding roommates. Move in with friends. I loved the period of my life when I had roommates! "
"This. From the sounds of it, if you went to the wedding and (good forbid) something happened, your mom would just be upset you ruined the wedding. :( If your sister isn't the one creating an issue I would probably reach out to her to congratulate her and still send a gift if you would like to.

Also, this isn't the advice you asked for, but as someone that works in medical billing: please ask your hospital/medical group if there is a financial assistance/hardship program available to help with bills. Every hospital I've handled patient accounts for has something, whether it's a charity program or sliding fee schedule, and they're usually income-based (and not just poverty level!) Good luck with your surgery! I hope it goes well."
"&gt;  One night a month away from the kids is NOT enough for self care. 

Right? jfc, I would go insane. It's a wonder this woman is drinking just one glass a night instead of a whole bottle."
"Hey girl - relationship stuff aside, the copay is negotiable. Hospital bills are negotiable. Spend a couple of hours on the phone with the billing dept and save yourself some $$."
"She’s jealous of a picture on your *shoes*.

Just sit back and think that one over real quick. That type of irrational jealousy doesn’t just fix itself or go away on its own.. 

You are absolutely correct, you should not be dealing with that type of jealousy at 28. "
"What is interesting is going back to your first post and re-reading everybody's reaction in light of what we know now. It appears the guilty stays mostly silent. Kane must have really good people skills for you to not suspect him. It's like playing the boardgame Resistance.

It's interesting that Carrie's reaction was concern that you'd think it was her. This is hindsight now, but that sort of expressed concern seems to be concern about your friendship, that she doesn't want you to think so low of her. She was right after all in pointing to Kane."
"To be honest that is my kind of humor. If my bf being annoying I’ll jokingly put a pillow over his head and go “shhhhh”.  I’ve also joked about it being the other way. That if he was gonna kill me at least find a nice lake to dump me in since I didn’t wanna be one of those trash corpses. Is it very dark humor? Yes absolutely. 

That being said neither me or my bf feel unsafe around each other or uncomfortable with the kind of jokes each other is making. If we do we talk about it and make sure we both know where the line is. We both know that we can joke about something but we wouldn’t ever harm the other one. If it bothers you he should be willing to listen to your concerns and try to fix it because it makes you uncomfortable. I would try to have a talk with him again. If he doesn’t change you should decide if that’s something you can live with or if that’s a deal breaker"
"First off, I am so sorry you’re going through this :( secondly, I think you dodged a bullet. Being upset is not the kicker, it’s the reaction. It sounds like he’s been looking for an out and is grabbing at straws to justify it. "
But OP cancelled plans with the friends immediately upon her mom asking her to.  OP's mom would have seen OP on Thursday night if she hadn't cancelled.
"&gt; I do have a son, but never once has that veered a woman.

Damn, burying the lede here. If you're involved in your son's life, then you can expect that statement to change."
"1. Sometimes the introvert is better suited to be a guest than a host. You may be liked, but others may not see you as a host because of your personality.

Surely as a new father there are other ways to ‘feel like a man’ other than mocking your partner who just forced a whole child out of their cervix.. 
"My butthole lost at least 1/2 of an inch in circumference that day from how hard I was internally cringing. I had to watch him as he silently pieced together that the girl he was crushing on was highly likely to be the person who complained. She had been the one who complained to me. I'm sure if I lost half an inch that day, his butthole became a singular point. "
"You've been with him for four years, how had you not met anyone at a wedding that he was a groomsman in?
"
Thank you. I really appreciate the kind words. 
"&gt;You described at least 4+ hours of heavy physical activity for your daughters and then needing the children to be entertained while you cook dinner. That is wayyy too much.

This all jumped out at me, too. My wife had a major medical event last year and was basically down for the count for four months. Life in our house changed dramatically, and our small children accepted that. Days that were usually spent out ""adventuring"" were now spent at home, in the back yard, and they had to learn how to entertain themselves. 

And you know what, it went fine. They learned that they love arts &amp; crafts projects, and inventing games together, and even spending more time reading. Life doesn't have to be go-go-go fun-fun-fun all the time, and I'm unconvinced that it's a positive thing for kids to grow up thinking otherwise. They need to experience boredom and develop the skills to deal with it.

At this rate, OP, you are going to make yourself sick, and that's absolutely no good to anyone. "
"&gt;funny thing is one of my friends did once say she was surprised after we started dating because she thought he was gay...

So, my mom's best friend in college told her *exactly* the same thing. My mom had completely forgotten about it until 37 years later when she found nude pictures of my dad's boyfriend in his underwear drawer.

My dad is probably one of the straightest presenting men you'll ever meet...even now that he's come out and has been living with that same boyfriend for the past 20 years. Being gay doesn't mean you are a walking stereotype.


What also reminded me of my dad was:

&gt;Like I said he's firm about waiting til marriage. He doesn't even watch porn. He's always respectful to other girls, and has some female friends but is normal with them. Nothing flirtatious or suspicious. He is a really great, quiet, sweet guy. He's very attentive and caring of me. We were very close emotionally before we started dating, so dating him is like having my best friend and boyfriend in the same person.


This is exactly how my mom described what it was like dating my dad in college. I'm not saying your boyfriend is definitely gay, but he definitely cheated on you by sticking his dick in *someone* at a glory hole. You should dump him - unless you're cool with being cheated on, of course. 


If you are really doubting everything, there are a few things you can do. First, just Google that location - my guess is that *something* will pop up identifying that location as a glory hole. Another option is to just go there and observe. If it were me, I would totally ask a guy friend to go with me and just have him go in that booth and see if anyone approaches from the back. If he sees someone walking up, he can just leave and walk back to the car. It's not like the person is going to come running around to the front yelling ""Hey! Come back here so I can suck your dick!""


But, all the signs are heavily pointing to him going to this glory hole that is near his hometown. He's lying to you and cheating on you - you deserve better. Don't end up like my mom - elderly, totally betrayed and all alone after raising 3 kids for a man who lied to her about being gay for 30+ years. It fucked her up - she never wanted to be with another man ever again and she retreated into her own little world and became a hoarder. I'm not saying this *will* happen to you, but better to cut things off early on before you invest in a life with him. If he's pulling this sort of crap now, I can guarantee that you are heading for a dead bedroom marriage since you'll have had zero sexual experience with him prior to marriage."
"Agreed on her son being able to make his own connections. 

As the child of immigrants, I don't think my parents ever tried to make friends to give me playmates. By the time I was in second grade or so, I was able to easily decide who I liked enough to invite from class to a birthday party without having been set up by my mother's non-existent mommy group. I honestly can't even recall if there were ever non-hosting, non-family adults at birthday parties I attended - there were certainly never any at my birthday parties because I invited classmates, not families.

I actually hated hanging out with child of my moms friend because we did not happen to get along. There was a presumption that children all get along as the adults hang out, but the girl had a horrible boring personality. "
Op said himself that she tlaked about it a few times and he just didn't take it seriously
"But, like, you reacted by screaming at her that she’s insane &amp; full of shit. You’re literally modeling this behavior for her for handling conflict. I get that children can be illogical &amp; infuriating, but if it’s okay for you as a parent to scream at your child out of frustration, it’s also really hypocritical of you to expect her not to scream at the family out of frustration. "
"###**She doesn’t actually think you’re the bad guy**

"
"In addition, also get the clause that says mom can’t be disparaging about dad in front of the kids (interfering with the parental relationship etc.). I would also find out whether MIL can some how be included in that definition, or have it made mom’s responsibility that MIL behave in front of the kids. "
"Go right now and buy a lock for your bedroom. Make sure they cant get ahold of the key. 

Identify what religion this is and spend a few hours with Google. Find a very interesting and unpleasant curse object you can replicate and make dozens. Leave them openly on their beds and place them on a plate on the dinner table for them. 

Personally I would watch while they pack, drive them to a hotel and wash my hands of them. Some of these curse talismans are super sketchy and I would be furious (and probably purge every food item in the kitchen) if I found one in a food item. Like, dried up chicken blood on feathers in my cereal? Horse hair ( probably not washed and sterilized).  These things, if made from animal products may have traces of feces. 

Just no. They got to go. 

I wouldn't have them in my house ever again. "
"Don't take this the wrong way, but you kind of need to grow a spine here and put your foot down. You've given her options, tried to compromise, but she's being completely unreasonable. Why is it her way or the highway? Especially when YOU support the family financially.

Move your stuff into a room, and let her deal with it just as you've dealt with her ""home business."""
"She sounds a lot like me my senior year of college, before I had to go on medical leave because I was suicidal. I latched on to TV shows HARD because they became a way to escape all my shitty feelings. 

Especially with skipping classes - there’s most likely a lot of underlying depression and stress that she’s trying to cope with, and is afraid to share with you, or maybe she hasn’t even named these feelings for herself yet. 

To be honest I think you need to chill with the judgement, and accept that she’s found a hobby. There is such a stigma around “obsessive” behavior, when all this stuff you describe her doing is absolutely harmless, even if its intensity alarms you. So take a step back, breathe, and try to look at the context. See HOW she’s doing, not WHAT she’s doing."
"Oky first of all your boyfriend is an inconsiderate ass and he should now be an ex boyfriend. Secondly go straight to university housing. Now. Right now. Explain the situation. They may not have anything available but they may be able to put you in touch with other students in a similar situation and you can double up. I'm sorry this is happening, OP."
"\&gt;""just do what you're told"" is utterly unacceptable

Yep, I'd be packing my bags. Some people might think that's an overreaction, but that sentence is pretty revealing about how he thinks of OP--not as an equal partner, but someone he can and has the right to boss around, and, even worse, someone he expects to comply because he said so.

Yikes."
"I have a 12 week old and I would murder my husband if he was acting like yours.   During maternity leave I needed breaks to sleep, eat, shower and sometimes cry. Your husband should be giving you those breaks and you're not unreasonable for telling him ""not tonight"" when he tries to go out.

I've returned to work and my husband is home with our daughter. When I get home I take her for 3 or 4 hours and he's back on to help with bedtime. I'd never dream of staying out until 2 a.m.  I don't know when I'll even feel ok doing a quick happy hour. Your husband is being selfish and unfair. He needs to step up his fathering."
"Let me tell you very clearly this: 

# CUT HER OFF.

Now, it may be hard I know because you think you're in love with her, but that's what you have to do. You're putting her in some sort of pedestal and because of that, she thinks of you as a safety net. The moment she wants to fallback, **she will use you as she sees fit**. She doesn't love you, my dude. You're chasing a magical lead that doesn't exist and never will. 

Good luck."
"I mean this nicely but....time off from WHAT?? Seriously, for your own mental health, go volunteer for a couple of hours a week doing ANYTHING. It's a start. Don't isolate yourself or it will become a hard to break habit.  Walk someone's dog, chat to people.  Your dad will relax a bit if you try it."
"Yeah, the length of time definitely makes it harder.  But the sooner you reach out for help the better, because no matter how long you've been with him, if you're with him tomorrow, you'll have been with him even *longer*, so momentum will make it even *more* daunting.

Good for you for committing to taking this step.  Please feel free to reach out to me via PM if I can be of any support to you."
"It sounds like 1. Emma had some big insecurities for a long time and 2. Derek layed some good material down to cover him. He's been telling her that you might like him. 

At this moment, you're the person she wants to shoot. You're the evil jealous person who just doesn't want her to be happy. She's not going to accept anything you're saying. So for a few weeks, give her space and maybe then send a message. Don't be surprised if you'll be blocked still though. It will need time and evidence that Derek is a creeper for her to change her mind. It's a case of when, not if, because Derek will do this to other friends of hers as well. Until Emma is willing to accept the words of others, she'll allow Derek to alienate her from others. You can't save a friendship alone. Emma will have to want that too and she doesn't at this moment. 

So, give her her space, but do allow the doors for communication to be open with a friendly message. If you're not pushing, you're not influencing her or Derek, so whatever happens in that relationship is not on you. "
"I’m sorry but this is just a completely irresponsible way of thinking. Domesticated cats should be kept indoors and monitored when outdoors for their own safety as well as the safety of the natural wildlife around them. Feral cats are different as they have no choice but to survive on their own (and are considered pests by many people) They hunt birds and other small animals. You might think your cat has enough sense to keep itself safe, which is probably true to some degree. That won’t stop a determined person from hurting or stealing them though. So please consider keeping your cat indoors for not only it’s sake but those around it. That is being a responsible pet owner."
"I’ll tell ya also I really think grown ass men don’t throw books on the ground

Blasphemy "
"Not to be glib, but how would you know? It’s often hard to see the sexism of it’s not directed right at you. It’s hard to see how deeply the comments hurt, or what it feels like to be excluded. Are you sure your team doesn’t have a problem with sexism?"
"It is a big deal if he was mortified beyond belief

"Correct him when he tries to define what a hobby is: a hobby is something an individual does in their spare time for pleasure. 

I myself enjoy birdwatching, one of the most popular hobbies in the country. Birdwatching does not create anything and makes me only more knowledgeable about birds."

Good luck Op. I hope he has the capacity. It does not bode well for the longevity of his commitments that he cannot tell you he loves you. I've seen this go badly."
"Tell him to go with his entire group to the head of the department with this, because it's insane. For advice on what to say when he does so, I'd X-post to /r/academia. What a fucking sadist this professor is :/"
"So you discovered she was cheating, and it was only when you confronted her with what you had seen that she admitted it. If not for you catching her, she was ready to continue lying about it and choosing plans with Brian over you. I think that really says *a lot* here. Beyond this, she's not even willing to nip it in the bud with Brian, which is just disrespectful to you/your marriage. Her actions indicate she doesn't care enough about *your* relationship, prioritizing Brian like this. If I were in your shoes I honestly think i'd be talking to a divorce lawyer.  "
"I experience this with my grandmother also, where she insists on paying me money I don't need or expect for chores that I gladly do for her when she or my grandfather is ailing. My mother said that it's about preserving her dignity, and to just accept the money. It's cheaper than if they were to hire someone to do the work, and then you can use the money to give back to them somehow. I spent some of the money I got for helping out last week to buy a flower for their patio (a luxury she had mentioned not affording for herself this summer) and to buy some cakes to bring over when I visited, so she didn't feel that she had to get something out of the freezer.

It's also possible to just save the money for them, in case something happens where they suddenly need it. Then you could ""chip in"" with the money left-over from your college transfer.

If this is a permanent thing you could talk to her about formalizing the arrangement so she can get tax-excemptions if applicable."
"Honestly, to me, this isn't about whether or not the girl is worth it.  This is about setting a precedent.  You parents are trying to manipulate you into doing what they want.  

I would put my foot down right now, because you better believe this is not going to be the only time you disagree.  I would tell them that you value their input but you will choose what you want to choose.  If they want to treat you like garbage for it, they don't have to be in your life.  

My fiance's parents did not agree with us moving in together, or that I was raised Catholic, or that I am fairly liberal in my beliefs because they are also very Christian.  They know, however, that it is his life.  Him including them in their life is more important than him making every decision they want him to make.   Had he not put his foot down, they may have not come to this realization.  "
"I do not resent anyone for not coming.  I was hurt by the absence of a close personal friend.  I understand that people have reasons they can't attend, but this friend didn't reach out to me until weeks after the funeral.  It sounds as though you woukd talk to you step-sister before hand which I think is very respectful.  The feelings I have surrounding people coming are difficult to explain.  I appreciated everyone's support, but I was extremely touched by the presence of certain people.  It meant a lot to me that so many people did not care to be inconveinced to help hold me together on the worst day of my life.  "
"She, theoretically, will be wearing this ring for the rest of her life. She wants to like it. The money isn't an issue so why are you quibbling over this? Should be an instant yes from you for her to get the thing that will make her happy."
Your sister is in literal felony territory if she's sending him nudes. That's child porn. Full stop. Your parents need to understand how bad this can get and how fast it can happen. 
"The thing is.. if she wants to cheat on you, she’s going to do it. Do you think that constantly badgering her about talking to strangers and looking at her phone makes her feel super attracted to you and not want to cheat on you? Nah, man. Your insecurity is not hot and it would be much more helpful if you realize that you can lose her in this situation. 

Marriage is not permanent. You must always respect and impress your partner. She’s with you for a reason, you know? The reason is because of the way you acted towards her before she decided to become exclusive with you. You didn’t talk this way to her. You didn’t ask where she was between 7 and 9 Friday night because she wasn’t responding to you. That would be inappropriate to do while you are trying to land a partner. Have you noticed that she didnt ask where you were that night? She trusts you. 

The point is though, it’s still inappropriate to do that even now. And yeah, she’s your partner now. She doesn’t have to be forever if you keep acting this way though. Don’t start acting overly suspicious until she actually does something deceitful. Being hot is not a betrayal. "
"What why, Kal was a woman it's not gay to be attracted to someone who then afterwards changes their gender. 


I think the easier explanation is just that he had a crush on her and now she's basically ""disappearing"" as a woman.


If I had a crush on someone and they had a sex change (I'm mostly straight) I'd kinda mourn the loss too. Ofcourse I'd be less of an ass about it.  "
"Why is everyone making this about James being gay or uncomfortable with his sexual preferences or gender?


Isn't the way easier answer that he was just into her and won't be into kal after the transition and that that's why he's angry? 


Just plain old straight infatuation. "

"&gt;I’d move out but I don’t want to be alone. Because even if she resents me, who else do I have? :( 

Use the next couple years to make your long-term plans. What you'll study or where you'll work, where you will live, and how you will pay for it all. Don't move out suddenly now. As bad as your situation is now, your life will be easier if you get her support for at least a couple more years, save money, and move out in an orderly way with some specific goals (higher education, an apprenticeship in a trade, whatever is right for you). 

&gt; I don’t know what I did to make her hate me. 

Nothing. She acts this way because of some problem in her, not because of anything wrong with you. "
"Is sexting another person something you’d consider cheating, because this seems like that to me. "
Keep the job for the insurance but you aren't getting fired for being pregnant you're in sales you aren't selling. It sucks but sales jobs are like that they suck. 
You block her on all forms of social media and block her number. Super easy. And will end the attempts to contact you. 
That’s hard for me. I’m so angry and upset about this that it will Be hard for me to keep calm.  I’ll have to tho or risk losing her to him. The last thing I want is for her to push me out and then be further trapped. 
The thing is that she wasn't asking you to help. She was just telling you the reality of her situation. She wasn't looking for you to change it. Her reality isn't a problem for you to solve. 
"I recommended a lawyer to him. They do not have any kind of prenuptial agreement so I advised him to gather what he could from this as he might get really fucked. They own a really nice house together and share well, everything as they’re married. "
"I laughed hard at this, because ego is an emotion, pride is an emotion, proclaming and even wanting to prove that you have no emotion comes from an extreme response to emotions. If your boyfriend was truly emotionless he wouldn't need to say it. He acts like he doesn't care because he cares too much. In fact he is too emotional. And simply a jerk."
That doesn't really make me feel any better
That fella is smitten. Go visit him. 
"I think it's bizzare to tell someone you're going to end a serious relationship when X happens. I've tried the whole -together till September- kind of thing and it only worked in the most casual of relationships, not long term committed adult partnerships. 

It's hard to say if he said all this in a moment of weakness and didn't really mean it (or might rethink it) but I think you need to take him at his word and not overanalyze it. I think the comments saying to end it now instead of waiting for the inevitable are probably the best for self preservation. 

And no it doesn't make you selfish to listen to/accept it when someone tells you they want to detach."
"""Who the fuck told you to fly to (city)?"""
"&gt;I am considering changing the locks this weekend while he’s off doing God knows what.

Consider consulting a lawyer before doing this. I don't know where you are, so consider your local laws. I just remember a friend of mine divorcing a few years back and being told by his lawyer that he was not allowed to change the locks because under *his* local laws, the matrimonial home is considered a shared possession. 

You may be subject to the same sort of law where you are, and he will most likely use that against you if you run afoul of it. "
"It’s troubling that a grown man has the maturity level of a teenager.  You will outgrow him very quickly.

"Right?

If the goal is to model behavior for a kid, then he's teaching the kid it's not okay to swear but domestic violence is acceptable."
"&gt;  I asked if he thought he could take care of an infant drunk or high he gave me an adamant YES!

And that's how you get your child taken away from you by CPS...if they don't get killed by accident first."
"He did apologize for that. It was a bad day, bad argument and he kind of exploded. He isn't like that all the time. 

I do still like it but I don't want to tiptoe around about wearing it, you know? But honestly, I don't think I'm doing anything bad or wrong.."
In a marriage shit is shared. It's *their* house
I cannot echo this enough. He did not decide this. The OP decided this when she cheated. I have not seen a single shred of concern in the original post for how this all made her poor husband feel. I do hope he finds peace and happiness with another woman.
"Just because you guys are both unhealthy, it doesn’t make it okay. It’s still unhealthy. 

Plus, the equivalent of you not watching porn is her not watching porn. Not using a vibrator. "
"Your GF threw you under the bus.

You need to sit her down and explain how uncool that was.

Boundaries are important, especially as you are starting your own family. Your parents, her parents, etc. no longer get to butt in whenever and however they want. It was rude of your MIL to just decide she would be there with all these other people without even asking first. This type of behavior needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP. Otherwise, you guys just won't survive.

She means well, but it is completely pushy and selfish.

Most likely your GF threw you under the bus, because she is not comfortable setting those boundaries. Well, you are both adults now and about to be parents. It is time to learn to do this thing."
"Not only cheated, but she was absolutely awful to him. I mean, fair play for admitting it but I'm struggling to assign much to the husband here.

That said, it doesn't really read like a true story to be honest."
She sounds like a main character
Did your sister do something awful or did your parents just turn into bad people? I just can't imagine this scenario. Why wouldn't they let her come home on weekends?
"It doesn't matter whether they share your opinion. You let them know that their behavior was unacceptable, crossed a boundary, and that as a result they are not allowed in your home ever again. Period.

Set clear boundaries. Teach people how to interact with you."

"Well, and it could be a dealbreaker for him. 

I have never had a compatible sense of humour with anyone, friend, family, romantic partner - so it's just like a non event for me. But I think funnier people or jokier people might have a bigger issue with it, particularly if that led them to be at all insecure about how I felt about them or viewed them."

"She's being incredibly selfish and you need to understand this request isn't coming out of a desire for forgiveness or reconciliation -- she just feels bad and wants to make you help her feel better without actually talking about her actions. 

She basically wants you to pretend that she hasn't put you through absolute hell, and put aside all of your hurt and uncertainty to be her emotional dumping ground.

She's still not taking responsibility for *anything*. She's still actively hurting you. I know right now you're still in ""damage control"" mode so your first reaction is just to do whatever you can to ""fix"" this and make it go away. But it won't go away. Even if you take her back -- I doubt she will *ever* take full responsibility and instead blame it on you, blame it on her mother, or any other convenient scapegoat. Once you start to feel ""safe"" enough to believe she isn't going to walk back out the door you're going to be hit with a freight train of resentment and bitterness.

She's not healthy, she's not stable, and she's not sorry. She's selfish. You'll always be waiting for the other shoe to drop because she'll do anything she wants to feel better -- whether that's leaving you or coming back -- and your feelings on the matter won't make a bit of difference to her.

It's not a coincedence she's ready to ""have a night and hug"" the moment you told her you're done. Who is going to be her security blanket and emotional dump if you aren't around? She was perfectly fine stringing you along as long as she knew you were waiting at home pining for her return. 

Move forward with the divorce and cut this toxic person out of your life."
"Seconding this.

OP, I feel strongly as an attorney and a mother that you need to separate from your wife. She is a destructive force of chaos. She already drove drunk and injured someone (and I am giving the side eye to your taking her word over that of the officer and the injured party -- the injured party was no doubt completely sober, while your wife was driving drunk, so why are you believing the drunk?). She's already getting sued. She's already neglecting your baby, who is not meeting milestones. You've got to get out of this situation.

Get an attorney. Have your wife move back in with her enabling mother. And she CAN'T be around your baby without you there supervising or someone else supervising who is not her enabling mother. 

You've got to cut your losses and prevent tragedies. Your alcoholic wife is too volatile and dangerous. How are you going to live with her after she kills someone through drunk driving or kills your baby in a drunken accident? And do you want your baby growing up in a home ruled by alcoholism? "
"Herpes can be contracted from skin contact that isn't covered by the condom. 

You're really quick to blame your girlfriend and seem to be looking for a ""she's cheating!"" response. The reality is that both of you could have had an STI/STD without symptoms before you two ever slept together. It could be a flare up of a problem that already existed. Its possible it may not be STI/STD related. The fact is that you don't know how, why, or if. So breathe, get a diagnosis, research once you do, and begin to find a constructive way to say ""we have an STD/STI"" if you get a legitimate diagnosis. Do not jump the gun into cheating territory."
"Exactly. If he’s cheating now, there’s a high possibility he will cheat again. So instead of divorcing, she should not be aware what a slimeball he is?"
"He's a massive child and a loser to boot. Real adults can do their fucking chores whilst they work on a business plan/go to work/ attend school. That's the most ridiculous reasoning I have ever heard. Financially, moving back with folks can be the most viable option whilst one needs to get back on their feet - but so they don't have to do CHORES? Are you freaking kidding me? Run for your life girl. This guy won't find success if he still needs mummy to wash his clothes for him, trust me."
"I used to have a bad problem with checking other women out, now every time it happens I imagine my wife getting plowed by a huge dicked man and telling me how I could never fuck her like that, it really helps. "
"One of the things that can be quite beneficial to dancers are having regulars and sugar daddies. You come back, you buy drinks, you pay the cover charge. She fosters an illusion of a relationship just enough to make you quite interested. Boom, now she’s got someone who will come on slow nights and an assured customer. 

It’s not something all dancers do, it’s not a positive thing, but it really is just the business. You’re from Egypt and you don’t have much experience with these types of clubs but trust me, no stripper really wants to go out with a client. "
"Yes, he’s heterosexual because he sexted with a woman.

Remind him of this. Remind him that he connected with a person, and that’s always beautiful. Remind him that people can be sexually aroused by people that they ordinarily wouldn’t because emotional connections are powerful, and that it’s important not to be embarrassed about caring. Remind him that his disgust is the only problem here."
"As a 23 year old woman that dated a 42 year old man with children, this doesn't work. Even if it feels like you're both on the same level; you're not. She's at a different stage in life and so are you.


It's not fair for you to hold her back. And it's not fair of her to pursue this while you are not suitable.


Your children are most important here despite anything else I've said. So if your daughter can't accept this, which is fair, you should end this. If my dad was dating someone close to my age I would be extremely uncomfortable too, and consider moving out. 


So pick whatever is more important for you."
This is what  I was thinking. Op’s original claddagh ring idea was tacky. 
Can you explain the dumb shit you do and the drama that made her quit? Both of those are glossed over here and both seem very relevant.
"Be smarter.

For one, if your apartment is not free, DO NOT DESCRIBE IT AS BEING FREE. There is a dingus or two in the comments here railing on anyone who dares to use your own terminology for your free-but-not-free apartment. 

For two, you can ask your girlfriend to cover utilities in lieu of rent. That way she's paying for something *tangible* and not just watching you pocket her money every month.

BTW, you say you and your girlfriend live together. How much did you discuss this with her before accepting the apartment deal? Did you just come home and say ""I have a free apartment now! I'll only charge you half what it's worth! Aren't you happy?"" Was this move just dropped on her head or was she on board from the beginning? The level of communication you had with her about this could be contributing to her irritation as well.

ETA: I agree with PaperMacheThrowaway, BTW. Staying where you are with a pay increase + 401k contribution would definitely be a better option. "
"&gt;I'm beginning to wonder if he even takes our relationship seriously

No he doesn't. Dude just wanted the younger girlfriend. "
I spent months fantasizing every day about dating someone who was nice. Finally broke it off in the middle of yet another fight because she said it first. 
"Either you truly don't know or you are trickle truthing here.  You say ""apparently I sent a snap chat"".......no there is no apparently about it.  You sent it.  Your statement sounds more like you have no memory of it.  I'd venture it may have been less about you walking ahead of them and more about your attitude during their visit.  I don't believe 4 women all got so offended by fast walking that they want to end a relationship.  Were you dismissive of them during the visit?  Did you project an attitude on them?   Give it some introspection and see if you can come up with the answer. "
Yes to everything. Getting an investment property that you can't really afford is a bizarre financial decision. It's even more bizarre to go in on this plan as an unmarried couple with a 10 year (!!!) age gap who have only been together for 1.5 years. There are red flags all over the place here.
"Thinking about it from both sides, the ones having the wedding &amp; the one having the funeral, I kept coming back to the same thought:  

At my wedding I wanted my loved ones to attend;  
At my spouse's funeral, I'd need my loved ones to attend.  

Go support your sister."
"Totally agree. Please look up Gaslighting and you'll understand what he's doing OP.

What a creep! 

It's bad enough deceiving you and destroying your trust in him, but to turn it onto you is outrageous. It's manipulative and abusive.

You know this pattern of behaviour won't change don't you? 

I hate to say it, but misery or divorce are really your only options. I'm sorry!"
"...but he married a herpetologist?! What did he expect? People in these types of fields are most definitely not the types who leave their work at work. It's an integral part of who they are. More often than not, these types of careers are more like lifestyles or lifelong passions."
He’s taking her on dates and on overnight trips. I’d be done. I wouldn’t even give an ultimatum because I don’t want to have to *make* someone treat me like I deserve to be treated. I’d just end it.
But he asked about how big the guy's penis is! He is an adult and should know that's deeply inappropriate. This is so different from asking about pronoun usage it's not even funny. Same with the top vs bottom thing.

Your phrasing is still not helping dude
"Sooo was the ""I was looking through yearbooks"" just a flat out lie then, if he's been ""looking for you for years""?

If it's not a bright red flag, it's definitely like. A blood orange one."
She just wants you to show that you care. You don't have to spend 24/7 with her if you can show her she's important to you in another way.  Although honestly the way you write about her makes it sound like you only appreciate what she can do for you and how she can conform to your needs and demands.  Maybe you're the one who is immature
You're counting a child's errant hairs while your girlfriend is super taking advantage of you. Quit worrying about the trees for long enough to notice that the fucking forest is on fire. 
"I would say yes. Even if he isn’t an outdoors type he should be able to respect your hobbies and at least make an effort. He instead spent his time “testing” you and your boundaries and when confronted he buckled down even more rather than being a decent human being. He doesn’t sound like someone who you would ever want to make angry and fights and anger are a normal part of the human experience. You shouldn’t be with someone who could scare or harm you when angry. As someone who has been in a long term relationship with someone with anger issues, trust me, this is a red flag I wish I hadn’t ignored. "
"Girl where is your backbone? Tell him to go fuck himself. Do you realize that this guy kicked you in the heart and now you're letting him use you to feel absolved of his catastrophic fuck up?

He's a real piece of work. It's a HUGE tell of his narcissism that he thought he could call you and you'd pet him and make it better. While he's having a baby with some random. No. 

Tell his mommy she has more work to do. "
"Your girlfriend is one of the blights of the LGBT community that I am so sick of. She's a bigot and you should call her out on it each time she makes a snide remark. Every time, just say, ""Sorry, I didn't think I was dating a bigot"" and keep repeating it.

Better yet, dump her and let her find someone who isn't a bigot."
Way too young to get married. Her church/religion is pushing her to get married and have lots of babies right away. If that is not what you want don't go for it.
"This is good to see, it does seem to me like you got stuck in ""lets get through the wedding and then deal with all these doubts"" whereas she got stuck in ""if the wedding is such a mess what will marriage look like""

Talking is good and it seems you have a pretty good perspective"
"So,...

You broke up with your GF, because she has issues, and now you regret it because she was hot?!?!?!?!

Dude, snap out of it. Hotness does not make for a good relationship. Most likely, you are being nostalgic, mourning the good that you lost, without account for the bad you left behind."
"I don't blame you for not being fine with it. If it were a wedding nearby and just one night, I don't think it would be a big deal. But I think a lot of people, men and women, would be upset and not into this idea if they were in your position. 

I would just tell him that you've tried to be comfortable with it, but with the fact that this is a five day trip with someone who has said disrespectful things about your relationship, you just are not comfortable. I highly doubt he'd be comfortable if the roles were reversed."
"It sounds like this lady was attempting to protect OP by not ""embarrassing"" the male who got out of the truck and started speaking for his girlfriend who he just assaulted. Some women would get a lot worse when they got home if their boyfriend thought he was being ""disrespected.""

It sounds like this lady had some experience with de-escalating similar situations and did her best to prevent anything worse from happening. It ultimately falls on the abused person to step forward and get help, not on a bystander."
"She didn’t kill him though. Suicide often cannot be predicted. People are cheated on all the time without making the same choice. Only those truly troubled IMO decide to go through with it, and at that point anything could have been a trigger. I can’t say I’ve been in exactly your shoes but my close friend has attempted suicide before. I can understand why you’re angry at the fiancée - she hurt him. She did not kill him. She is not and should not be held responsible for his death. Be angry at her for cheating but do not blame her for your brother’s decisions. She will feel guilty regardless. "
"They force her to pay for her necessities, when she is underage. They put the blame on her for his behavior and their lack of responsibility. 


They are narcissists. Go look at that sub. Their behavior is like the other n parents.

I'm not. I'm just saying that there's nothing in this post to indicate that she's into that guy at all right now. 
"She's told you what her stance is. She's tried to take protection away. She told you that ""plan B"" is on the table, but is it really?

That's typical for a first year student. That coursework should still put her at full-time status. If it doesn't...then that's a weird program.

&gt;It is somewhat less awesome if you are the one supporting the professional student and are doing so as the sole income earner.

I've known people in my PhD program who had families to support. They had to take out loans, it sucks. I hope your finances get better once she graduates, these are tough times for our generation.

"I say again, I don't know why the explanation would matter. There is no explanation that makes this ok and there is no way this outburst just came out of the blue.

"Going to say what I say to a lot of people confused about their sexuality. Don't get hung up on titles. Labels are used, in the linguistic sense, to attribute a bunch of descriptions to a ""thing"" so that we can use it as shorthand in everyday conversation without spelling it all out. That is to say, labels, are there to help us describe things faster. When they stop helping us describe things, and only add to the confusion, just don't worrying about them for a second. 

Remove the ideas about straight, LGBTQ, and the such from your mind. You like this girl. Past crushes be damned, you seem sure you know what you feel is real. Whats the harm in exploring it. You find out something new about yourself, becoming a more fulfilled and self loved person  with the chance of adding a strong and fulfilling relationship in your life (this is true if your romantic endeavors are fruitful or not). 

Now I do caution against workplace romance, but that really depends on what type of work you do and how that is handled and how much you actually work together.

Don't stress about what ""is going on"" explore what you know you feel, and see where it leads, there is little harm in trying. Strongly identifying as straight your whole life is hampering your ability to explore your identity. Don't worry about being straight, or gay, or bi, or pan or any of the above. Pursue who and what you want, and see where you land. THEN work from the result and consider what that says about you.

(want to make it clear, alot of people find solace in the LGBTQ movement and the identifying as such. Power to you, its great that you do and i'd never take that away from you, it's just that for a lot of people, it feels like the threshold of entry is prohibitory to exploring one's sexuality)

"Yeah my grandmother is 88 and a devout Presbyterian. She was cool with my Jewish dad, she's been very supportive of my being SUPER Jewish, my cousin has her girlfriend to Christmas all the time, and now she's working on wrapping her head around polyamory. She's a traditional lady, but she loves her grandkids."
"Why are you and your husband kindly hosting them when your in-laws actively wish you ill will?

Their actions may be harmless, but their intentions are rude and nasty. I would toss them out for that alone. What's the worst that could happen?"
I have to say I think that both partners need to know via anonymous note. They can't pin it to you (as opposed to one of the other four employees) and for all they know it could be a random friend that happened to catch them somewhere.
"This, this, THIS!!! 

All of this response is spot on. His behaviour is escalating and he's already grooming you to question who's at fault when he DOES hit you. Classic gaslighting and manipulation.

Get out now while you can. Seriously. "
"This is exactly the outcome my husband speculated. 

I have thought that this is as much her fault as it is his because she refuses to bring it up. First she was in denial, now she thinks he hasn’t brought up his kids because he “must hate his kids and don’t want them” but I told her that can’t be it because why else would he only move blocks away from their mothers home and their school? If he truly did not want his kids then he would just move somewhere else and not have his ex wife send him pics at all hours of the night. 

We all had dinner together once and she asked me to bring up America so I hinted at it a couple times saying how I couldn’t want for us to hang out in California and her bf goes “looks like you don’t need me then, you can just stay with LeilaVanora” basically saying that if Apple came to America that he would not meet up with her or let her stay with him. Wtf???

"I do not tolerate my child’s manipulation or lying at all. She gets reprimanded, punished, and has plenty of boundaries. She is difficult. She is very irritating. There are days I don’t even want to be around her.

But again, she is a child. I understand that she’s going to mess up sometimes and I do my very best to direct her towards proper behavior. He knows how frustrated I get with her, just like I understand his discomfort. But to see him say those things about her just came as a shock to me I guess."
"The phrase ""low empathy"" is really concerning actually. Is there any way to help it according to professionals? "
"The option is OP losing her job and not being able to use her house because of her roommate, so yeah, I actually think roommate needs to take responsibility for arranging something else immediately, no matter how humiliating she finds it. OP has had to do that instead, y'know, peeing in the sink and all that and it is not her medical issue."
"My guess is that it’s almost certainly part of a larger pattern. OP is clearly doing well financially, and after moving in with him (*especially after the engagement*), his fiancée went from working part time to barely working. But that’s ok because she has a blog? I rolled my eyes so hard at that. 

Then, out of nowhere, she instructs OP to get rid of the items. No discussion, no attempt at compromise or understanding, just, “Get rid of them.” And the best part is, OP gets to pay for the privilege. Literally. She’s dictating that he needs to go out and spend thousands of dollars to replace items that he already has! That’s an impressive display of entitlement. 

And, of course, as the icing on the cake, she’s using sex to manipulate and coerce him into buying new appliances.

I ain’t saying she’s a gold digger, but... OP, if I were you, I’d start saving for the day when you do have a kid and she tells you that you have to hire a nanny. "
"Wow , your in-laws suck.  I mean, at 16 I was a candy-striper at a hospital and I knew to be super-gentle to anyone I encountered who looked like they were there as a visitor.  I didn't even need training to tell me that - if someone is sick enough to be in a hospital, then people are probably worried and tense and need TLC.

So your 16 y/o BIL is totally old enough to know better than to be dismissive and rude.  Your MIL/FIL sure as fuck should know better than to refer to you as a ""w""itch.  Your husband needs to firmly have your back, as well, because if he wants his little brother to be a decent human being, a good life-lesson is not being rude to someone who bought you a drink while waiting to hear if their nephew was going to pull through the day."
"I guess I’m going to go against the grain here and say I think that’s pretty odd. In these circumstances, if my coworker asked me to be his plus 1 to a wedding where I sort of knew the bride but was not invited myself, I would not even consider going as his date. I would find it kind of inappropriate to be asked in the first place. Finding a way to attend a wedding where you know the bride but not well enough to be invited just seems awkward to me. 


That being said, you also can’t really tell her not to go. All you can do is say it makes you uncomfortable and try to communicate your reasons why. I personally wouldn’t go to a wedding without my SO, especially not with another dude, and *especially* not if he had a problem with it even if I didn’t necessarily agree. "

"On the other hand, this girl has been stringing you along for 10 years. She knows you like her and she enjoys the attention without having to put in any effort. If she wanted to date you, she would have made some moves. You’re just the placeholder date until someone she likes comes around. 


I suggest you try to get some distance and stop putting her on a pedestal. Your attraction to her still is at unhealthy and her running to you for a shot of ego boost is also unhealthy. Meanwhile she’s absorbing a lot of energy you could be investing in better options. "
"Yup. This is red flag weird. And then the extra sex seems manipulative to get what she wants. A little bit gone girl vibes tbh.

"dude, if this behavior makes you hate hanging out with your friends, you need to address it. all you’re doing is building resentment between yourself and her.

"It's interesting that he wants to buy a house that's more expensive than he can actually afford by an amount that's fairly close to what you already have in your trust fund. 

Are you sure that he doesn't know about it? Have you ever left any documents around your apartment that he could have seen, or found while snooping through drawers?

It's paranoid of me, but most people don't plan to buy a home that's that much more expensive than they can afford unless they think they're set to receive a windfall sometime soon. For some reason, he feels confident about what should actually seem like a horrible financial choice (were he only considering his own resources for the purchase). 

If he truly does not know that you have that money available then I'd start questioning his financial acumen because it sounds like he is unreasonable in his expectations for the kind of lifestyle he's going to be living in the near future. "
I think that’s worth mentioning as its own separate thing. It’s a sign of overall emotional immaturity when someone either can’t tell or doesn’t care when their partner isn’t enjoying a joke. It’s a pretty basic thing to understand that what you’re doing is upsetting to your partner &amp; to stop doing it so that you’re no longer upsetting them. 
"Best advice I ever received (from my Dad who is a psychologist). Loving another person is the easy part- but trusting and admiring them are what is really important. There will be times that you really don’t like or love your partner- they might be driving you nuts or are just being really annoying. BUT you still trust and admire them. Once either one of those go... then your relationship probably isn’t sustainable 

So- I get that you really love your wife. That is easy. But do you trust her?  Not just that she will be faithful - it isn’t just that sort of trust, do you trust her to not hurt you, to back you up, to support you in life? 
And... do you admire her?  Do you admire how she conducts herself in life, how she navigates her way through your relationship? How she will work to better things when she is wrong? Will she admit she is wrong? 

To me...after reading this- I would say that you love her but the other two aren’t there.  What would it take to get those back (if they were ever there).   And... could she do the work with you to get there ? Doesn’t sound like it..

I would leave- make it clear that her behavior is not acceptable. You love you but cannot be with her until she works on her issues and you can trust her again.... (trusting to not to hurt you again and that she is taking you seriously).  From that- you might grow to admire her again as well. 

(At the time- I rolled 17 year old my eyes at my dad when hr gave me this advice. But- he was right- you need all three and love is the easy part). "
"This.  Encourage your father to document his purchases as well, to cover everyone.

"You informed her that she has to be just like the women in your family in this regard, and you insisted on proposing with an ugly little ring you bought off the internet that she told you she didn't like with a tiny, cloudy sapphire. Now you're pissy because she didn't fall in love with this ugly little internet ring after you proposed.

Do you steamroller over her in other areas of life, also? Do you have rigid ideas about how the women in your family do things about more than rings? Hopefully you love and value this woman and aren't expecting her to be assimilated into your family like it's the Borg. 

Go shopping and help her find a ring. She's compromised already by agreeing to a Montana sapphire as the  main stone. "
"send your sister my way if she needs an “experience” convo. 
i started dating a girl from texas who turned out to be a dude, i found after 4 years of being with them. same thing happened to me, failed most my classes, didn’t sleep much, didn’t do anything but be on my phone. 
not only did it take me actual years to get back on track after i found out i was catfished by some obese pedo fuck, it took me more to get him off my back. he knew my address as well, i know, dumb. and around a year later i still kept receiving his letters, since he was blocked on all my social media, and all my stuff has been put on private. he would make countless new accounts to threaten and black mail me. he even once said he will come to my sisters prom, since he knew i had no date to go with. the guilt tripping, saying he would kill himself if i tell anybody/leave him took a massive impact on me back then. (until i realised that i don’t actually give a fuck, and it’s all manipulation games). you don’t want that on your little sister. 

that’s not the worst part, what’s worse that in that age, a child that age cannot, simply cannot carry a burden of a long distance relationship that soon. i support LDR and all that business, but i also think that two people should be old enough, and mentally strong enough to actually make it work.
when i was your sisters age i thought i could handle it, but i grew socially numb. once your sister gets out of there, and i hope it will be soon, she’s gonna have so many problems where she won’t be able to process things in real life. 
she’s supposed to be developing at that age, and she’s developing in the wrong direction and it’s filled with so many red flags and risks.

now to the guy, the dude is 21. holy fucking shit can any of us sane people ever imagine dating someone so fucking young? 
i mean people’s skin doesn’t crawl without a reason when they hear the age gap.
another thing, you mentioned he texted her randomly on insta. key word; randomly. that only means he texted many other girls randomly. of course, it can mean that your sister isn’t the only one he’s playing with. 

given the benefit of the doubt and let’s say the guy is a nice guy (doubtful), and he does actually treat and love your sister good, he would have some sense in his head and say:” ay listen you’re young as fuck, don’t send me the nudes, let’s wait a bit on that part”. yet he didn’t, which proves what kind of shit person he is. 
he made zero effort (i assume) to actually visit her, which is obvious that he’s a catfish, and that also could lead to him lying about his age. 

it’s unnecessary for me to continue the list of red flags so i’m gonna cut it short and say that you need to act fast.
talk to her, sabotage the whole relationship, get involved, confront him, get the police involved or even explain this shit to your parents so you put some fear and rage in their bones, take a pick but you need to do something about this or you’re risking a whole lot of shit.

"Thinking someone doesn't have ""good enough reasons"" to not have sex with you and feeling justified in getting angry with them for daring to refuse you while thinking your ""overpowering need for make up sex"" justifies this is feeling entitled to their body, dude.

"As long as you didn't cheat on your current girlfriend when you possibly impregnated your ex, I think you're being fair, but so is your current girlfriend. If the baby is yours and you want to be involved, it's altogether better to know now that your current girlfriend isn't down to be a step mom.

  


If she doesn't want you involved, you love your current girlfriend...idk. why doesn't she want you involved? Is it better for you not to be?

  


Not being a jerk, but when it comes to kids, I think it's better are blunt with themselves about if they are in a place to be decent parents"
"Your problem is at 31, you still allow your mom to play a way bigger role in your life than she should. I get that you want her to be happy and worry about her health, but you’re doing so at the expense of your own well being and your fiancé’s. 

If you guys want to get married, then get married. Unless your mom is paying for it, I don’t understand what’s burdensome for her. She just needs to show up, or don’t if she doesn’t want to. 

And if you want a dog, then get a dog. Again as long as you’re not expecting your mom to help out with the dog, then it’s not her decision at all. 

You’re allowing your mom too much control over your life and putting too much weight into what she wants. Start doing what you want. "
Yep. She did the best she could in a super awkward situation. Lots of people would have just kept walking. She was low key making sure op was safe and that’s something MANY people wouldn’t do because they don’t want to get involved.

"I'm super glad that you left your relationship if it wasn't making you happy. That seems like it was the right call, even if it seemed sudden for your ex.

I'm not sure I agree with your position that you aren't responsible for the wedding costs. You agreed to get married and you agreed to those vendor contracts, even if you felt pushed into them. You're flaking on costs that you are halfway responsible for and shirking your responsibilities. You absolutely should cough up the half of the money you were responsible for. If they sued you, you'd probably be on the hook for half.

As for your friends, you'll just have to sit down with them one by one and explain what was going on. Tell them that you've been in therapy and the realizations that you came to in there. This is best done **in person** so they can ask you any questions that they have. Just try to be honest and hopefully they will come around. "

And there's the difference between you and OP's husband. He knows she's not going to love his efforts.

But, you said she seems angry with you for some reason, you don't know why, and you admit you get angry and defensive when she does try to bring it up with you? And you're taking other's advice to play passive aggressive games like backcharging her for child care? How is this proving you aren't being defensive, again?

What do you think this post would say if your daughter came here looking to discuss her relationship with you? What do you think her concerns might be?

I think you need to really think about what went wrong here. Offer to pay for a joint counselling session to show your daughter that you're serious about hearing her out!"

"The first thing is bizarre and I would be weirded out. But the second thing would be a deal breaker for me. To go to someone’s wedding and cause chaos for your own amusement is disgusting, selfish, and a HUGE red flag about the type of person he is. I would run and never look back."
"Just a heads up, OP is a she. "
"Just a few generalized thoughts:


I don't mean this harshly, but your apology is meaningless because you won't fix your behavior. I'm not surprised she won't accept it, because your actions have repeatedly shown that you don't care about her boundary, that you aren't interested in fixing it, and that you are sure to violate it again.


Obviously your wife owes you an apology, but you may have better luck discussing this after she has calmed down. She's still angry, and that's not a good time to be pushing the issue when you were the one who started it in the first place. Did she cross a line? Absolutely. But giving her some time to calm down is going to get you the best outcome here.


Finally, *do something about it*. ""Forgetting"" every night for years is disingenuous. You didn't care enough about this issue to fix it for years is more accurate. 


Edited to add: ~~I always get suspicious when OP refuses to interact with any comment that is critical of them, but interacts just fine with comments that aren't.~~ (Edited again because OP did reply.)


I'm gonna edit this to emphasize: OP, you have disrespected your wife for **years**. It seems like you can dish out the disrespect but not take it."

"I realize you do not use that term with her and it really doesn’t sound gross. Your desires are not gross, they are human and wonderful. The problem is is that you are at so different places at the moment that it risks becoming a requirement for her rather than something alluring and exciting. I think you guys need to figure out if there is a way for her to get out of the house every now and again to meet other people, to do adult stuff that she can come home and share with you. For you two to date again and meet as adults rather than parents. And maybe in the meanwhile try to give her more space. "
"If you've told him that the ex was the love of your life, then there's no wonder he's insecure about it. That makes it sound like he's a downgrade from the dead guy you prefer."

"OP, he tried to kill you because you wouldnt say ""I love you, too"". Yes, he tried to kill you. He applied more and more pressure until you gave into his demands. It only takes a few seconds to choke someone out with enough pressure, and it only takes a few more seconds to kill someone with enough pressure to the throat. That is why even during sex it is not recommended, and if a couple does do it during sex it should be faked (pressure to the veins, not the throat itself). "

"I read through the comments in the thread and wanted to touch upon something.  I think the rabbit hole is further than it appears on the surface.  The fact that your parents waited this long to punish you for something that you did a long time ago makes me think it’s not just you they are attempting to “punish”.  Given the behavior that your brother described (gloating, etc), it makes me wonder that somehow they did this hurt your Grandma too.  They knew very well how she would react.  And we can’t assume that she is exactly “happy” about cutting you out (I’m not agreeing with her behavior, but it’s hard to believe that someone you described having weekly contact with can do this without being at least upset about it).

Perhaps something recent happened between your parents and her that caused this? And you simply were the poor pawn in all this? Not saying this is exactly the case, just another angle to think about.  I heard of something very similar happening  to a friend when her sibling suddenly  felt they deserved a larger cut of their grand parent’s will... and pulled a similar stunt when it didn’t end up in their favor.

"I have never been blacked out drunk, so take this with a grain of salt, from my point of  view, he was sober enough to recognize you were upset, he was sober enough to come up with excuses why he abandoned you. So, he was sober enough to know what words would hurt you, and he used them to hurt you. 

If he hadn't been so drunk, he might have been able to control himself, but it still means that he has these thoughts about you in him all along.

"I had to double-check your fiancee's age because honestly, I would expect this behavior from someone 10 years her junior. It's just not reasonable or mature of her to ask of you. It's not like these are things that you're keeping because of their sentimental value. They're tools, they serve a purpose and that's why we own them.

You need to get to the bottom of why she suddenly feels uncomfortable to even touch things that you bought when you were with your ex. Has she ever displayed other signs of jealousy or insecurity before this? It's not like you're ever going to get back with your ex, since you're both playing for the same team now.

I'm not saying break up, but I would definitely consider the fact that you're about to take a pretty huge life step with this person. It's up to you if you want to marry someone who is that petty about something that really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

"Hun, I know you don't want to end it. But this isn't toeing the line. It's crossing it. He doesn't respect you or your relationship. I can guarantee that she will be in your house while you're gone. What they'll be doing is questionable, but I know she'll be there. 

I'm cynical so I say the cheating already happened. Even if it didn't he knowingly lied and hid it because he knew it was bad. He's not worth your time even if he does agree to not see her because he will lie again and still see her. End it and get him out of your home before you leave.

I'm happy to be here for you if theres a blow out."
"People don’t suddenly fall in love with people they rejected after years of little to no contact. In my opinion she is looking for someone safe and validating and she hopes you still have lingering feelings for her. If you do entertain this relationship, don’t be surprised when she abruptly cuts you out once she gets her fix."
Its only spontaneous if you leave out the supporting details. Anyone would be happier with their child getting through a harrowing medical experience and add to that their painfully annoying coworker being replaced by someone nicer and more efficient is bound to lift anyone's mood. 
It sent me into a spiral. I started dreaming about them being intimate and I haven’t had a good nights sleep since because of it. I feel like I’m losing my damn mind.

"Ya, my gf threaten to murder you so I’m cutting you off instead, that makes sense. "
To make him tell you sex stories?! Wtf?? Sexual partners is one things but names and sex stories?? That’s really messed up.

Lol I have a doctorate in this topic- I think I can manage. Half of my daily life is caring for reps anyways.
"Big question is how financially dependent are you on them? Rent/college isn't cheap so you should be doing stuff for them too in general. Would you be willing to forgo that money for not having to do these ""favors'? If so then you can push back and work on boundaries, but if not then you might have to suck it up a bit. Granted like 80% of kids go through these types of things. You need your independence but that means both not having to do what they say and also not getting support from them. It's a balancing act as you slowly decrease both of them."
"Did your fiance get therapy individually about her history of trauma? It sounds like she needs it. 

You need to get her in couple's therapy as well, so you have an objective third party to help you sort through this. It will not end well otherwise. I had a friend go through a bitter custody battle because of the same thing: trauma history, baseless accusations. He came out ok, but one of his kids did not and is still struggling in his relationship with his father due to these accusations.

I also recommend keeping a record of all these accusations, with all the details that you remember of your interaction with your stepdaughter.

I'm so sorry this is happening to you. It sucks and while she's wrong to behave this way, I understand her fear and where she's coming from. That hurt stays with you forever."
"If they each have their own lease then they can choose to break their respective leasees and go find a new place with their teammate. Seems like they're trying to have you move out be side they don't want to pay the costs associated with moving which is fucking rude.

Tell them you're not moving but they are free to move out and find a place with their teammate"
"Marriage is a public announcement about your life-long commitment to each other.

"You are far too uptight for the internet, lol."
"Just to be clear, you're not ""paying the mortgage"" you're paying rent to your landlord, who happens to be your BF's Mom.

This means you guys (should) have tenants rights, and that she should abide by landlord duties, like giving 24hrs notice before entering the premises, and only entering the premises for actual reasons.

Personally, I would get the hell out of there. It sounds like Mom and BF have boundary issues in general and I would not like to live so damn close to my BFs Mom."
"So what, were you supposed to protest and pine for her and remain firmly in denial and try desperately to get her back instead of taking her at her word and letting her go? "
"No, she told me: ""I'm fabulously gay , and I'm really sorry."" Those were her exact words. I don't think you could really interpret that in many ways. "
"I’d love to ask him if he’s said “go fuck yourself” out loud every time his boss or coworkers pissed him off. Or if he’s ever told his mom how easily he could murder her given the opportunity. Or if he yells out comments on the movie when he’s sitting in a crowded theater. 

My money’s on “no.” "
"If you’re looking for backup that you’ve got reason to breakup, then you’ll definitely find it. She is certainly immature and not handling things well. 

But there are a couple of takeaways worth learning here. 

12 hour days and you’re studying in your spare time? And you promise to essentially be unavailable for, at times, weeks at a go? I’d hazard a guess and say very few people would be cool with that. FWB? Sure. Dating? Likely not. Why? Because you’re pretty limited in how much you can grow a relationship if you’re essentially casual friends. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but you’ll need to find someone who treats you as low priority as you treat them. 

Also, don’t dip your pen in company ink. It’s always a bad idea. I get you’re busy and it’s hard to meet people outside of work, but it’s not worth the drama. 

I’m not saying you’ve done anything wrong at all. But those tips should help mitigate repeating the current situation. "
"Eeeeeh, idk about that. Having a 15 year old who is obviously troubled and into drugs get into ""something serious"" and then not even telling his wife? The kid has problems that need to be worked on not secrets that need to be kept. Kind of sounds like OP is rather hands off when it comes to parenting. "
"Agreed. I thought this was going to be a Chardonnay Mom story where she drunk drove to get the kids from school after polishing off a whole bottle. 

2 glassed of wine after looking after the kids alone for 10 days. he should be pouring her the damn glass of wine. "
I would assume you're being inappropriate.  Why else would you so adamantly carve out 'alone time' with this girl and forbid your girlfriend from being there?
"I think they more meant along the lines of “engaging” where you’re continuing in the vortex of their manipulation. Arguing or negotiating or pleading or trying to fix this is what he wants. It gives him the power. 

By utilizing that line in a matter-of-fact tone (with no emotion, no drama) is effectively putting a kebash on the whole thing and moving on while preventing further drama. That way if he throws a fit later or tries to gas light you guys by saying you’re the one who changed the trip, you pull out your receipts (screen shots).

"I DISAGREE. I THINK HE IS OBLIGATED TO PAY FOR HIS PARTNER'S BIRTH CONTROL. PARTNERS SHOULD SHARE THE COSTS OF CONDOMS, IUD'S, BIRTH CONTROL, ETC. IT CAN'T BE ALL ON THE WOMAN. THAT NOTION HAS GOT TO DIE. HOW MANY MEN TO YOU SEE POSTING ON HERE FREAKING OUT ABOUT AN UNEXPECTED CHILD BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO BE ACTIVE ON THE BIRTH CONTROL FRONT?

I ALSO THINK HE'S OBLIGED TO ECONOMICALLY CONTRIBUTE A GREATER PORTION SINCE HE'S IN SUCH A FINANCIALLY SUPERIOR POSITION, NOW THAT THEY'RE AT THE COMMITMENT LEVEL OF MOVING IN TOGETHER. IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE ONE PARTNER MAKES SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE OTHER, IF THE HIGHER EARNER NICKEL-AND-DIMES THEIR PARTNER AND REFUSES TO EASE THEIR FINANCIAL BURDEN, WHILE IGNORING THE FACT THAT THEIR LIFESTYLE IS LIKELY MORE EXPENSIVE, THUS INCURRING A HIGHER THAN USUAL COST ON THEIR PARTNER, THEN THE PERSON IN THE INFERIOR ECONOMIC POSITION IS UNDER CONSTANT ECONOMIC STRESS, OFTEN FEELS PRESSURE TO HIDE THE STRESS, AND DEVELOPS RESENTMENT THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE ""LOGICALLY"" THEIR PARTNER DOESN'T OWE THEM ANYTHING. AND LEGALLY SPEAKING, THEY DON'T. BUT WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OPERATE LIKE TO WHOLLY INDEPENDENT BEINGS WITH NO FINANCIAL OR OTHER ENTANGLEMENTS? THAT'S CALLED A FUCK BUDDY, NOT A PARTNER.

IF YOU'RE AT THE MOVING IN POINT AND HE'S BEING THIS PRECIOUS ABOUT FUNDS, OP, YOU'VE GOT A GLIMPSE INTO WHAT YOUR FUTURE WILL BE LIKE. DO SOME HARD THINKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE WITH A GUY WHO HAS EVERY RESOURCE WITH WHICH TO OCCASIONALLY EASE AN ECONOMIC BURDEN, BUT DOESN'T WANT TO."
"&gt; Next time your wife wants to watch a movie like Lady Bird, OP, accuse her of being obsessed with bad parenting (as that is a theme in that film)!

Well, that might be satisfying, but it's horrible advice if your idea is conflict resolution rather than point-scoring.  I am going to guess you are not married."
"100% agree. Not only has it only been 3 days since they last had sex, it’s only been TWO WEEKS total that she has been feeling depressed. I have had a flu that lasted almost that long. I couldn’t have rolled my eyes harder at him saying he needed to put his feelings first “for once” considering there couldn’t possibly have been that many times in the past two weeks where he wasn’t already doing that. 

This guy is a child who somehow ended up in a man’s body. He’s gotta go. "
"We do more then eat dinner and go do bed - usually we'll go work out together, make dinner, make some progress on a TV series, and then go towards bed.  

Me being more present with her is definitely something I need to work on; both our work tends to pretty consuming, and so we like to vent at each other about it. We spend most weekends doing things together, and usually the weekends are ok because I stay up later since I don't have to work. 

She had been pretty depressed with work for awhile- she has a strong STEM background specifically in research, and had found work at a company that paid the bills but didn't really stimulate her. I started doing more housework so that she could use her nights to apply for better work- which worked out and she moved jobs to something much more stimulating and exciting.  But she never really changed back now that she has the new job- I still do most of the housework, and she sits on the couch ""decompressing."""

"She isn't doing any favors to her boss by not mentioning it to him.  This is one of those reasons why people who own restaurants without experience in the industry often lose money.

This question alone tells me that you do not have the right relationship to have a threesome. If you're not sure if your boyfriend will be okay with you enjoying it why in the hell would either of you want to do it? "
Find a mental health advocacy group near you and find out what is legally  allowed what his rights are.  See how what you have to do be allowed to communicate with your *nineteen-year-old* brother.
"I let a girl stay with me for a couple of weeks one time and she actually had the audacity to barge in and hang a shit when I was in the shower. When I yelled at her, she said ""but I don't mind."" I definitely did tho. I don't want to see and smell you shitting while I'm in the shower. 
She kept borrowing all my clothes too and most I never saw again, including one of my favourite bras. 
Worst houseguest ever"
"You're meeting all his sexual needs, he's not meeting any of yours. Have an honest talk with him about it. Him being tired and the few things you mentioned as to why he's unable aren't reasons, they are excuses.

.

Examples how any of this can be fixed:

Coffee instead of beer after work: bam awake, bam not tired

Have half the amount of sex that you do now in the morning, he'll start to want more sex and therefore have to have sex at night. I'm sure if he has a healthy libido and suddenly is getting half as much, he'll be awake enough to have sex with his gf who will gladly have sex at night (he's 25 not a 70 year old man)

Stopped eating you out? Ask him in a sexy voice how you want him to eat your pussy more because of how much you love it. If he declines, don't give him blowies

If those don't work for him; he's selfish and then you'll have to be completely upfront about what needs aren't being met

.

Edit: im 26 year old guy so I know drinking habits of people our age. I'm also a doctor

You stated you're boyfriend used to be an alcoholic....now you say he drinks 4-6 beers every night after work.....HE'S STILL AN ALCOHOLIC. If he came in and listed 3+ beers nightly on a medical records chart, he would be put under the 'abuser of alcohol, strong alcoholic dependence' in the EHR and I'd technically be required to mention this to him and advice him on sources for help."
"First of all, don't go tattling to his mommy about him.  That's totally unacceptable.

Second, this is not about pizza.  If he constantly lies to you, why did you marry him?  Ask him for marriage counseling.  "
"Practical advice: since your brother is 100% supportive, get him on board if you can and have him be present for your conversation with them. It will be easier to keep the situation under control if they have another part of their family present and being supportive of you. Whether it's soon or December+, enlist the support you have.

All of the reasons you listed for waiting another five months are valid. That said: knowing what you know about your parents, is five months going to be the difference between acceptance and not-acceptance? I would also point out that they might actually prefer to learn this about you *before* you start changing how you present in public--no one wants to be ""the last person to know."" 

I don't know that you need to have a concrete definite plan in place (unless that will help with your anxiety, in which case plan away!). If I were in your shoes, I would probably go with a hybrid of your option (a) and option (b). Hang out with them as you normally would, and if you sense that the moment to tell them has come, seize the moment. If it doesn't feel like time, wait until later. Trust your feelings, and remember: you can't control their reactions, you can only control what you choose to share with them.

You got this. &lt;3"
"That was an overreaction but i would be very pissed if I lived only with dudes and they made fun of periods and said something about ""that was why you were acting like that"". It seems like shes trying to communicate something and she is not good at it, but living with a bunch of men that would joke about women like that is not helping.. Im sure it was just a joke but there's always a bit of what you guys think on the joke. Definitely talk to her how inappropriate her reaction was but also ask her about what she is going thought. Also that the boys didnt mean to hurt her feelings is not enought, they DID hurt her feelings, and I doubt they thought making a big deal out that was making it easier on her."
"I was so shocked by this too. 

OP undermined a totally reasonable disciplinary action her husband was trying to perform (contradicting him right in front of the kids) *and* she rewarded the kid for being rude in the end. 

I am 100% against spanking, so I think he's out of line there, but you do need to be firm sometimes. "
"You need to talk to her about this instead of making assumptions. Tell her, ""I've noticed that you've been distant since you saw my old credit card statements and was wondering if something you saw upset you, or is something else is going on."" Then listen and try not to get defensive. It's possible that she knows her feelings are irrational and that's why she's not bringing anything up. It's possible something else entirely is bothering her. 

Do you have a right to be pissed? I think feeling irritated is reasonable but I'd try to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume it was curiosity. It wouldn't even have occurred to me that my husband wouldn't want me looking at old paperwork. Is there a reason you still even have statements that old?"
"This is a wild guess but typically when people are this paranoid and project this hard, it usually means they're the ones who cheated. So Tom should definitely know because there's probably even more to this story."
At least a napkin will wipe shit up.
"While it would be terrible if the baby didn't make it (non-viable), the issue I am trying to address here is that she could have an early labor and will need his immediate help to get her to the hospital. As a side note, if it is an early birth and viable, the child can have lifelong issues which will take more care and attention than the father seems capable of understanding he will need to give right now."
"We have talked in extent of the future: of marriage, children, and keeping our sex life interesting with threesomes that have rules, but not flat out polyamory. We even discussed early on specifically our expectations and boundaries, where threesomes versus polyamory came up and we mutually agreed polyamory wasn’t suitable for us."
"It doesn't sound like you care about her at all. You're choosing work over her, not putting in any effort to the relationship, putting all your effort so that you can have the lifestyle you want. It doesn't sound like there's a light at the end of the tunnel even, it doesn't sound like there is any benefit for her to stay with you. There are no nice words about her in the post, you rarely see her and when you do you don't put in effort. Do you love her? Or care about her feelings at all? Because it sounds like she's begging for a connection (asking for mundane details about your life,) and you don't really care. "
"I've read through your comments, and it seems you're resolved to be a little more open minded and to tell your friends to piss off. I will just add one thing here.

Don't try to suddenly be interested in her interests.

Instead, be interested in *her passion* for her interests.

It's okay if you don't like cleaning bones and tanning skins. But ask *her* what she enjoys about it, and don't make her feel stupid when she answers. She might go on an hour long tangent about how neat it is that the wings of this animal are shaped this way because they had to hunt in these conditions, whereas the wings of that one are shorter in these spots and longer in these spots because of yada yada, and how amazing is it that nature works that way?

The cool part of a person like this isn't what they do. It's why they love doing it. That's where you really get to the core of who they are. In discovering these things about her, you'll fall deeper... or not. And you'll learn about yourself, too.

Once you know the whys, you may even start to appreciate these things from her perspective and get some weird hobbies of your own. (But it's okay if you don't.)"
Seriously. I guess we're just supposed to continue letting shitty people be shitty 
"You call your Mom's bluff. She isn't going to pull out from financially supporting the wedding, she is throwing a tantrum.  

It sounds like your Mom is used to getting her way, I would head over to /r/justnoMIL or /r/justnofamily for some advice on how to deal with her."
"YOU ARE NOT ONE ENTITY!

This company sucks and I would go to HR, after securing a new job.

Your husband is enabling this companies shitty (and possibly illegal) behaviour, and not supporting you.  he should be fighting your corner and not undermining you.

If you agreed $100 as a raise and then gave $25 to someone else, then that's not on.  It doesn't matter that it's your husband.  You are an employee in your own right.  If you have the $100 raise in writing, I would follow that up.  On a tangent, if your husband thinks ""He sees you as ""one entity"" and why should it matter that he gets paid for your work and you get excluded from conversations that DIRECTLY affect you"", then tell him you're going to get the boss to pay all of your husbands salary to you and you'll give hubby pocket money.  Ludicrous I know, but the example should at least make him think.  That $25 shouldn't be anywhere near your husband.  I have employed family members and you can't give a relative someone elses money!  


There are so many red flags at this company that you need to get out sharpish.  Let this idiotic boys club protect your husbands position.  Why should you?  He's not protecting your position!  
"
"Personally I'd let them use it, but I don't think she's being cold-hearted.  These people aren't looking for a place to stay because their house burned down, or going to Aspen for a funeral and need somewhere to crash.  They're planning a vacation there likely because they think they can use someone else's property and stay for free for nearly a week.

If they let them stay I'd imagine there's a very high likelihood that next year OP's siblings ask to use the house, and then the next year maybe some cousins or an uncle, and the next year when OP's little sister is 20 she wants to use it with some college friends, and the argument will be ""oh but you let so-and-so stay there!""  And then the other side of the family finds out and they want to stay there, and then family friends, and so on.

Putting other people up for their vacation is a slippery slope that's pretty much bound to lead to eventual hurt feelings when you do try to draw a line."
Tell them you can't afford it on your janitor salary sorry.
