Something tells me that would be a hard no.
Affection deficit disorder
"&gt; If I’m not being unreasonable, I don’t know how to bring this up without seeming like a douchebag girlfriend who doesn’t want him to have friends.

Stop worrying about being the ""cool girlfriend"", and start communicating your feelings and needs like an adult. If you two live together, you should be at a place where you can be honest with your boyfriend, instead of just silently letting the resentment build.

Also, your feelings here are completely reasonable. Your BF needs to learn to balance his friendship with his relationship.

If you're looking for a place to start, just say literally everything you said in this post. It pretty clearly communicates how you feel, without you ""seeming like a jerk""."
"Yeah I agree.  This handing-off-the-kid four days a week is what divorced couples do and they call it co-parenting. 

Everyone gets to define their own relationships and do what’s right for them, but I think you guys are sailing toward separation."
"&gt; Some of what you did that triggered these episodes was probably normal behavior.  Some of it might have been bad behavior, and yet you still didn't deserve the abuse that was the apparent consequence.

This is very important.  Even a child who is bratty or disrespectful does not deserve to be abused.  Never, ever.

OP was probably not a brat.  OP was probably simply a normal child who had normal developmental stages that her parents failed to understand or respect.  It is not a personal failing of a two year old to have a tantrum, for example.  It's a normal reaction to not being able to communicate your wants or needs effectively and not being able to regulate your frustration about it.  "
"I would totally agree with you if OP had a family of her own (or even lived with her partner), but it sounds like it's literally just them and they always spend christmas together, I think this is pretty shady of them and I can see why she's upset. Inviting your parents but not your siblings on trips is (IMO) totally fine, but is also totally different to doing that for Christmas when the sibling you're leaving out doesn't have their own family to spend it with.

Assuming she would pet sit for them after they ditiched her for the holidays is almost worse though."
Odds are with you. Go for #4. Really. Dont stop now. This sub needs the laughs.
"Just because teeth are straight doesn't mean they can't be ""bad"" or odd looking. If she really does have pronounced buck teeth those can (and should) be fixed if they're affecting her self esteem to the point where she literally covers her mouth. If this is a recent thing - maybe wait a while. But if she's been self conscious for years, this is something that should be corrected. I had straight teeth with a gap in the front ones that I hated for as long as I could remember. I avoided smiling and covered my mouth like your daughter does. Had them fixed last year and the difference in my self esteem has been incredible. I wish I had done it years ago. I'm still sad that I have almost no pictures of myself smiling during my teenage years. "
"Exactly. My exhusband always told me if something like this happened, that I better just run as fast as I can until I find help and safety. "
"Do not reward your family by taking care of the pets unless they pay you in advance. 

This is probably a great opportunity for you to start some new drama-free holiday traditions with your family-of-choice."
"This brings back memories.  
Not the neglecting the GF part, but the raiding part.  
It's such a time sucker to be raiding.  
Quitting WoW was honestly the best thing I'd ever done.  
I was so committed to being such a diligent raider, making sure I didn't miss any nights, and wanted to bathe myself in the best gear possible, so it enlarges my epeen.  
I would shove away dinner plans, tell my friends I was sick so I could raid in peace, and feel so proud that we completed a raid dungeon.  
All for what?  
Nothing...  Fantasy pixels.  
I had fun... no doubt, it was a hobby which I had fun in. Do I regret it? Nope, it was part of growing up. But would I do it again? Not in a million years. I've had my fun with WoW, and it rests nicely in a little special spot of my heart, but the timesink and negligence towards my loved ones, is not worth it.  
The more I grew up, the more I realise that time could be spent better with family.  
The number one thing muttered by senior people dying on their death beds is, I wish I had spent more time with my family/children."
"When breaking up with a violent person it is best to do so from a safe distance, so don't feel bad. Safety first!

Be prepared for the switch to flip and the begging and love bombing to start. Stay strong; it took you a while but you did it. You got away.  You made the right choice."

"It sounds to me like you've been accused of something very serious, or someone else (possibly your dad) has been accused of something serious that involves or affects you as a minor, although if that were the case it would be fairer to send him away. A crime discovered only three months ago wouldn't necessarily have reached the media or have been publically released yet. I assume from your general bewilderment that you haven’t done anything or had anything done to you so hopefully it'll all be cleared up in time, but meanwhile I agree with everyone saying you should reach out to a responsible adult outwith your family and talk about what you're going through. Even if they aren't able to provide you with information any sooner, they might be able to offer support. Good luck."
"&gt;Is this something you'd bring up to your spouse, or should I butt out of his business?

I would. I'm not sure if that's going to be the advice across the board, but I totally would. I don't like bullies."
"He's manipulating you. Treating sex as some key to 100% trust makes you want him to trust you and therefor have the kind of sex he wants. Then he doesn't even seem concerned it hurts. I wouldn't know as a man, but I still wouldn't feel comfortable carrying on the same way until we figured out her pain first. "
"So even if he was abused in the past, it's still a manipulation tactic? That sucks lol"
"I gotta admit, this is a little worrying to me? If their house is capable of making an adult sick, what could it do to a baby? Is the kid well?"
"I have four sleep disorders and work closely with staff at a sleep clinic. They absolutely advise me not to shower immediately before going to bed as it has been proven that the physical impact of the shower/water on the skin is stimulating and does indeed induce insomnia.

But clearly this guy could shower in the morning or a few hours before bed, or he could take a bath before bed."
"Right!? Like, I’m sitting alone in my office looking around like “anyone else see this?” How do you just...ignore something like this? OP needs to google “missing stair”..."
"I'm actually confused by this. Your sister is an adult. If she doesn't want to live in a rent-free situation because it includes resident cats, then fine. She doesn't have to. It would be madness to get rid of beloved pets because a selfish, apparently useless adult is demanding a free room to her exact specifications. Unless there's some reason everyone else in your house literally depends upon your sister's presence there...tell her the cats were there first."
"A PI is only dishonest if you hire a dishonest PI.  You asked her and she evaded and refused to answer.  It's clear she's up to something and your options are to be prepared for it, or to just wait and see.

If it were me, I'd talk with a lawyer and an accountant at the very least see what your situation is objectively.  

Sounds to me like she's preparing to move on and has been for a while."
[removed]
"Exactly. She's currently tied to a husband who disgusts her (for good reason), and whom she does not want any kids or any real connection with.

OP, if you divorce him, worst case scenario for you? You'll at least be free of him, and your life will otherwise be the same.

But there are also so many bettter-case scenarios, where you find someone who actually respects you, cares about you, and doesn't force their fetish on you (much less release *tons of your nudes to the public*). Your entire future will be open with possibilities.

Please divorce him. What he did was disgusting, and if you stay you'll be wasting the rest of your life in an unfulfilling, shallow, sham of a marriage.

If there's a way to pursue the divorce without the true reason coming out, and you still for some reason want to protect your husband, do that. But honestly, he doesn't really deserve your protection."
"No

Hell no

Fuck no

Any of those would suffice. 

OP, you worked your way through college, got a good paying job, and are now laying the foundation for your life and career. 

You have absolutely zero obligation to do anything for your cousins wedding. They’re the ones making the choice to have an expensive wedding and they want you to help pay for it? Fuck that. 

They treated you like shit growing up and want your money now? Fuck that. 

If you want to help out, you do it because you want to. Not because they asked. Which they have no right to do to begin with. You set the amount you’re willing to give. Not one cent more. I’d definitely make it considerably less than they want. You’re not a bank OP, 


And if they cut you off for it, you’re honestly better off without them, family or not. 

Real family would never demand or expect financial help just because you’re doing well for yourself. 

Real family doesn’t hold your success against you and they wish you well for it. "
"Idk, I didn't know anything about it until I was 17. I thought men masturbated and women just didn't orgasm at all. I was a weird Christian girl, though, so any kind of effective sex ed was not part of the curriculum for me. 

Then I found out I'd been masturbating when I was a child, and ""that was what an orgasm was."" No one bothered to tell me. "
"You don’t even prioritize yourself. Why should he? If you did, you wouldn’t have put up with this for FOUR FUCKING YEARS. It was clear in the beginning but you lived with the hope that once the relationship got serious things would change. Four years later and mommy and daddy have a firm grip on his balls. Marriage? Kids? Darling, you are dreaming. "
Because he is looking for an adventure with the knowledge if things don't work out after 6 days he still has plan B waiting for him back home. 
"This, OP. I am 28 and that is my life. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. "
"I noticed that example too. Except that it was a training program, with probably more than one opening.

The fallacy in Tom's argument is that the coworker wasn't judged based on OP's application, they were judged based on their own suitability. Someone made the judgement call and presumably chose the best candidate(s) for the program, not on who managed to find out about it first.

Also, if it's a training program, it probably is either ongoing, or periodically available. It's not like the coworker can't apply again the next time."
"He claims all of his ex girlfriends are crazy. One he was with on and off for three years but she was cheating on him. Another thought he was cheating on her so they broke up when she asked to see his phone and there was nothing there. When we first started dating I got messages on Instagram from a girl with a fake account who had been messaging him while we were not exclusive and she was sending me screen grabs of their conversations telling me he was a serial dater and horrible person, but he convinced me it was a crazy ex trying to get me to break up with him "
Call the police every single time he violates the order. 
"Working out your anxiety will take time, sure, but you can take small steps in the meantime. She's even given you a starting place: talk to her when you're about to take a detour so she doesn't feel like she's supposed to read your mind. Focus on that, and aside from taking a concrete action towards coping with anxiety, she might have an easier time compromising because she feels she's being heard."
Next time that she calls I'll tell her that until she tells me her intentions clearly there is no chance of me even considering allowing this.
"I don't know about calling the police, in my experience they just want to avoid confrontation and not let anything escalate. 

Source: my sister wanted a divorce from her drunk abusive husband. They basically told her to hold on and just work things out with him for the sake of their kid."
You'll lose more of your relationship with him if you don't go. You'll always resent him for stopping you going and he will think he can control you about all kinds of decisions down the line.
"I have a friend like that and it took me a while to realize that it worked out best when I was just straightforward.  ""Actually, I was planning to keep leftovers for myself.""  ""We want to have dinner just the two of us tonight, but maybe some other time!""  She got used to it quickly and it worked out well for everyone."
"So you are engaged to a guy with a crazy family - this will be your like for 40 years

Still want it?"
"Wow. I'm really sorry for everyone involved.

If I was James r Ashley I'd frankly be concerned and feel unsafe. James should really shut down his social media and talk to friends/family about doing the same so this woman doesn't find his ""secret family"" (ie his real wife and innocent vulnerable child). Who knows how she would react to him having a child with another woman? "
"You should never give up a dream opportunity like this for a relationship. You will always resent the fact that you gave up this opportunity. You can and will find a relationship with someone you care for just as much if not more than her. 

I also think you can't invalidate her emotions with your logic behind why *you* want to move. While you are perfectly justified in feeling the way you do and wanting to move, she's justified in not wanting to move to this city regardless of how you put it to her. Yeah, city life is awesome. Yeah, having a ton of money and living city life is awesome. But to some people it can be torture. I made 6 figures in one of the U.S.'s biggest cities and while all that money gave me access to enjoy it at the end of the day I hated it so much I decided to quit that job and move. Why? The public transit system was intricate but always crowded and filthy. Everything cool and awesome I wanted to do was crowded and had a long wait. The people were assholes and it was a stereotype/something people laughed about how cruel people from this city could be. It was to the point that I couldn't get an ounce of sympathy from hospital employees while my mother was in the hospital dying suddenly. 

Don't invalidate her desire not to move somewhere because you think it logically makes sense, to *you*. This is just the crux of being a young professional who is also in a committed relationship. Sometimes you have to make decisions for yourself that will tear your relationship apart. That's life dude."
Oh good then I'm sure he'll be willing to withhold financial support from the family until she stops taking your stuff.
"No, not all divorces are handled that way. A significant portion are negotiated calmly and with everyone’s best interests at heart. Lots don’t involve lawyers at all and just have an agreement presented to the court for approval as an administrative procedure."
"Seems to me he thinks OP (and himself) should exist to be subservient or some crap, that's all I can really imagine with his strange metrics for proper behavior "
"I agree. She basically said that every time she confronted her before it just escalated into a massive fight. Now she’s saying I’m punishing her for not wanting to return, and that it’s cowardly of me to not want to talk to her mother. Apparently she told her mom I feel unwelcome at theirs and the mother said we should speak as well. I’m new to relationships so I’m not sure how to handle this, but I’m leaning towards the side of telling her “no”, since my boundaries were crossed and she needs to resolve issues at home beforehand since that seems to be the more important issue"
"&gt;Sure he backed off now, but only to get you to relax so he can have another shot at sex. Sex is the prize. He’s not going to give up.

It's only a matter of time before the manipulation starts up again. He freaked out when OP mentioned breaking up, because he doesn't want to lose the person who might have sex with him."
"Tell her you want to see a therapist together. Sexual incompatibility is a huge problem for many people. If she doesn’t care enough to try that, it may be time to just be friends and move on to a new love. "
"Lol if you don't want to marry him then the relationship really has no future, just leave now and find someone who has a sense of basic hygeine "
"&gt; According to Callie, Monica didn't technically hurt her but she incited other people to hurt her instead.

This is a hallmark of a person with a cluster-B personality disorder -- accuse other people of doing exactly what you are doing / have done.

&gt; Monica allegedly got expelled and sent to juvie and some of the older kids went to actual jail.

So now ""crazy"" Monica is actually an evil mastermind who got other students shipped off to the slammer? The girl who cried and ran when you made a joke about not being her brother is actually THIS diabolical? Wow. Ask Callie for the newspaper clippings on this incredibly dramatic story which *surely* would have been covered at a local level."
"Engagement in two years is hardly jumping into it. Im not sure you really understood her-was she asking you to commit right now to proposing in two years or was she saying that if things kept working with you she would be ready to be engaged in about two years and she wanted to know if you were on roughly the same timeline.

Also she wants kids -are you ambivalent or do you deep down inside not want a kid"
"Heyyyyy, we found out why you're invisible to men. All it took was your first comment. I would avoid you and your negative attitude like the plague. "
"&gt;I have been there for her through thick and thin, but the minute he calls out of the blue she drops me to talk to him. I don't know how someone can be so unappreciative when I have been there for her throughout our friendship

Careful, because you're venturing closer to ""nice guy"" territory here. You're not being used, you're *offering* your support. Friendships aren't transactional. A friendship is like any other gift - freely offered. You being there for her doesn't oblige her to be there for you. Of course, if your efforts aren't reciprocated you may want to re-evaluate how much time and energy you spend on a one sided friendship. And if you back off and she basically demands you give more than you get, then yeah, she's a shitty friend.

But she's broadly right. This guy matters to her more than you do. It's that simple. She's not doing anything wrong with that - there's no law saying all friendships must be equal all the time. So don't equate ""I'm not her top priority"" with ""I'm being used"". And **definitely** don't think ""my emotional investment in her must be repaid"". If your needs aren't being met, back off from her, focus on other friends."
"Move out of his house asap. Before you do, tell him to stay at his new girlfriend's house. He should have the decency to at least leave you alone and not rub it in your face."

This post was a bit eyebrow raising. They're clearly using you to try to gain access to him and the new grandchild. Shut that down. Follow your husbands lead.
"&gt;I'm glad someone doesn't think I'm being overdramatic orz  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I really want to make him happy, but I don't know if it's worth breaking down who I've made over the past few years post-high school  
I used to be bad at keeping the conversation ball rolling, which is why I just let his cold shoulder slide for a while, but this seems different somehow; it's painful"
"&gt; Uhh I feel like the time to say that being BFFs with an old hookup is a deal breaker was at the start of the relationship.  Doing it now almost seems sorta...manipulative?

I agree. Especially to go from “I’m fine with this friendship” for *5 years*, immediately to “we’re not getting married unless you completely cut her from your life”.

Again, it’s fine to have this dealbreaker. But it’s kinda shitty that OP didn’t bring it up a long time ago, instead of as part of some sort of marriage “negotiation”."
"&gt;  which I specifically had of a girl in a very revealing bikini so that I would know if my GF had gone through my phone because shed delete it.

"&gt;No one should ever make their SO feel bad about not wanting to participate in a sexual act they are uncomfortable with.  This applies to both women and men

This, 100%. "
"Absolutely. Would I be upset if I found out my adult child had a dui? Yeah. But I'd be a LOT more upset to find out they stayed with an asshole who threatened them, especially if it was because they were *that* worried about *my* reaction to a mistake.

OP you're an adult. Sure you don't want to upset your parents, but shit happens. You've taken responsibility for your mistake. I'm assuming you don't and never will drink and drive again (as a person who's had friends murdered by drunk drivers - please don't). 

If you're honestly that paralyzed by the thought of disappointing your parents then it may be time to consider that they've made some parenting mistakes along the way. You should be able to be honest with them without fear that it will fundamentally change their opinion of you. If it would, then they're the ones who are making a huge mistake. Good parents don't put their kids on pedestals and demand they live up to being there. "
You're projecting pretty hard.

"If she hadn’t run, she might be dead.

"Best of luck to you, I think you are making the right decision. No one should make anyone feel inferior!!"

"I did not mean that as an insult, just a statement of fact. Her behavior towards you in this instance is, in fact, hypocritical. She is trying to tell you how to run your relationship with her mother while failing to sort through her own parental issues. 

It is possible for your wife to still be a good person that you care about while acknowledging that her behavior is hypocritical in this case."

Could he maintain the same lifestyle? Because that's what alimony would shoot for.
Yeah...reality doesn't always match up
"Had a similar situation with a guy I considered to be my best friend at the time, except they were flip-flopping in and out of their bs drama relationship bi-monthly.

And she got pregnant during one of their *off* times, by some random druggy dude. *And* kept the kid.

AND HE FUCKING GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH HER, while she was in the beginning of her pregnancy...

He became increasingly isolated because of her, and I told him I'm done talking to him until he gets rid of her for good ...

That inevitably happened, albeit 2 years later. 

Our friendship never really recovered, I haven't talked to him in about a year atm.

I honestly couldn't have stuck around through that time with him, though - she was always around and made that impossible.

Your situation sounds like less of a clusterfuck, but I still think your friend has to get rid of her of his own accord - otherwise your friendship will be hard to retain."
Can you elaborate more on what you mean by “doesn’t go down well”? Does your boyfriend support you resisting these demands? 
I'll tell a counselor at school but I doubt they can do anything as the only thing my friends ever heard from counselors is that your parents know best. 
"You didn't ruin anyone's life.

Your presence does not ruin anything.

Some people are bad parents.  If someone has a child young, their life is not ruined.  Some people aren't ready, can't handle it, others want to party etc.  

I know that this feels awful.  The feeling of not being wanted at home where you're supposed to feel safe and loved sucks, to put it lightly.

I went through something similar when I was younger.  I hope that you can find a second mom, who can show you that you are worth it and help you find your voice, that how you feel matters.

If you have close friends lean on them.  If not, you may meet others in a similar situation that will be able to relate and help you find comfort.

You are resilient and you will make it through this.  Some people fall into depression and abuse substances to avoid dealing with their feelings.  Don't go down that path because you will only find more hurt.  It will get easier to talk about as time goes on.  I hope that you will have access to a therapist to help process what is happening.  Journaling is also helpful.

In the future, when you are looking for relationships or in one, find someone who responds to problems and frustration unlike your mom and stepdad.  People who are abused can subconsciously pick partners that keep them in the cycle of abuse.  Break that cycle.

Feel what you feel, try to enjoy the time you have left as a teenager and look toward your future.  You can finish school, go to college or work in the field of your choice and thrive.  If you choose to talk to your mom and stepdad that is your choice, but at least limiting your contact will help the healing process.  Don't let them control you or continue to be in your life if they only bring you down.

You can do this.  You deserve to be happy.  You are resilient.  

Best wishes and I'm sending an e-hug."
"You sound significantly younger than 27. I don't know if you are, but you sound it.

He likes you dependent. He likes you dependent so much that he is willing to insist on you being dependent. This is a huge red flag.

Here's a tip. You're allowed to do things (within the normal bounds of decency) to elicit responses that will inform you as to his character and intent. For example, if you'd like to know how he'd react if treated this way to find out whether this is a situation where he is deliberately enforcing a power differential, you are totally allowed to meet his shutting you down with you shutting him down and avoiding more than trite interactions with him for days, busying yourself with other stuff and responding to any gripes with ""oh has it been 3 days... I was just so busy studying, like I got on a roll and it was all making sense so I just kept going""  There is nothing morally wrong with doing this if you feel you might be dealing with someone who isn't entirely forthcoming about why they do things and isn't being open about why they want the things they want. You've got to find the truth out some way to protect yourself if he's really not what you need to be in a relationship with.

So start formulating questions that need answering. is this deliberate manipulation? Why does he need me to be his student, why is it a problem to him when I point out I don't like the patterns our arguments take, why do I feel like I've done something wrong when i know I haven't? Then go get those answers by deliberately creating situations that elicit responses."

But shushing his girlfriend talking about someone else's mental health in front of other randos, or a rando involved with her rando teacher, or some repetitive creeper who should probably fuck right off? That's super ridiculous and potentially problematic because that would encourage people being harassed/abused/mentally tortured to not speak up. And that speaks to upper echelon royalty/megarich WASPyness. I hope he can come around and be more comfortable with this sort of stuff, otherwise their relationship might stall out for inability to communicate."
"I agree that this would be great in this situation.

I really suggest you consider leaving.  In your head set a timer for minimum 6 months no contact. Clean break. Wait till that period where things like: being used to him being around / used to worrying about him all dies down.  Then ask yourself if you now feel better without this depressive angsty mess who treats you like a combination cheerleader, nanny and safe backup girl.

""I feel like I have no love to give anyone because I already gave it all  to him trying to make him feel better and get him out of this  depression.""

Doing all that for him will have drained your resources. Of course you feel empty. Of course it's easier to just maybe sweep this under the rug. Once he's sucked the life out of you, you won't really have the energy to resist an ever shitter-growing situation.

Leave him. Get yourself back. I guarantee that the non-drained, non-addicted to this guy version of you will not give one crap about this idiots emotional turmoil, and will be way too busy being awesome."

"&gt; Saying that yelling is unacceptable, in and of itself, is the same as saying that crying is unacceptable. 

The very large majority of people have no control over whether or not they cry.  Literally every adult, with the exception of mentally disabled people, can control whether they yell or not.

&gt; Happens a lot really

Nope, it's not normal or healthy to yell at your partner.  My husband and I have been married for 10 years and we've never yelled at each other.  We've snapped at each other a few times over the years, but yelling is aggressive and disrespectful so we avoid it."

"So she cheated on you with some guy, who then blocked her when he realized she was already in a relationship and her response to that was to **lie** and say that you are her cousin? And when he didn't buy that, she decided to back peddle and try to get back together with you, all while absolving herself of any responsibility for her actions by claiming that you were ""broken up"" when she cheated on you?  
  
Do I have that right?"
This is not 100% your brothers doing. The brides family partners are still sitting ar thst table. She's playing a big role in this too. Are you close with her? If so consider speaking to her about it but I doubt your brother did this with no input from her too

"Do you *know* he wants more, or do you just think that?

Talk. Ask what he likes, what he wants more of, what he wants less of. Ask if he has a fantasy that he hasn't mentioned before. Ask what his favorite thing in the world is.

Note that you're not required to do what he brings up. You can draw your own lines, and he's not entitled to get everything he can dream up."
No offense but your husband sounds creepy and cringey :/ 
"I honestly felt that way too. Especially just sending the money back without calling or anything.

You should be alarmed, not concerned.

You said your piece and hopefully it was a come to Jesus moment for him. But don't count on it: prepare for nothing to change.

&gt;I feel like I say all the wrong things.

Because you're dating someone who needs a mom and you want to be his partner: of course you're feeling wrong-footed and like you're wearing two different hats.

&gt;I want to help him reach his potential.

He's 28, not 8. You're supposed to be his romantic partner, not his kindergarten teacher: **it should never be one partner's duty or role to ""fix"" the other,** and that's the dynamic you're in now. There's a world of difference between support (healthy) and dependence. He's asking you for the latter."
I definitely will! 
"He doesn’t get it all his way. If he finds it hard to be apart, you move when the first one of you gets a job. If he doesn’t want to move until he gets a job, you need to live apart while the other gets a job. That’s his options. "

"Honesty is generally a good policy, but I’m not sure what telling him will accomplish in this case. It will likely make him feel uncomfortable, awkward, and even hurt- it could harm not just his relationship with OP, but also his relationship with his sister.

Either OP can get this situation in hand, for the sake of the relationship... or she can’t, which doesn’t bode well for the relationship’s future, regardless of what he’s been made aware of."
"&gt;I do truly believe he hasn't physically cheated on me, he's always been so adamantly against it.

"So, the good things are that your girlfriend has been surviving on a low salary and managing to put a little bit away.  That's really pretty good!  She's also working for a university, which is good--they tend to hire and promote from within.

She is 32 years old and has some time in the working world.  The subject of her degree really isn't relevant anymore other than that she has a college diploma.  What she needs to be looking at are jobs that require the skills she's presumably developed over that time:  organization, time management, etc.  As she puts in some time with the university, she'll have experience with that particular administrative system, which will put her in a good position to get higher level jobs.   Her current job doesn't pay that well, but if she keeps her eye open for roles she might be a good fit for within the system, she can probably move up in a year or two."

The difference is you trust your sister enough to make her mistakes, learn from them, and move on. 

Your parents are trying to ""protect"" her from that, and can I just say, as a university administrator, OMG thank you! I meet so many 18yr olds that have been ""protected"" their entire lives and they cannot make a decision to save their life! They're all terrified of failing or doing something wrong, so thank you, on behalf of all my peers, for giving your sister the gift of failure! :)

Ask him to advocate for you with his parents, telling them it’s making you sick and that they have to communicate with you.

If the police need you for anything they could always call you and work with your boyfriend if they have questions regarding your stalker. No need to over think so much, you have a vacation to enjoy after so long and depending on when your flight is, all this trouble shouldnt take long to finish, the police already have the person of interest down right?

"This all comes down to you, her, and your relationship. My gf just got back from a friend's bachelorette weekend. Granted, every single girl in the group was in a relationship, but they all still pull the same trick: smile, make conversation for a few minutes, bat eyelashes, get free drinks, move along. That's just the game. If your gf doesn't WANT to do that, it's on her to communicate that to her friends. If YOU don't feel good about her doing that, it's on you to communicate that to her and talk through what she can do/what a compromise might look like to resolve this.

I personally am not bothered by some flirting on a night out, especially in this context, which is so obviously, almost pathetically transactional - guy gets to feel cool talking to a pretty girl, pretty girl avoids paying for overpriced drink. I know my gf knows and respects what I would and would not be okay with, and I trust her. However, what works for one couple doesn't have to work for another. Maybe this relationship still feels a little young and this dynamic just makes you uncomfortable. That's totally cool. Just talk to her, hear what she has to say, and see how well she can listen to your concerns/how she responds to your discomfort."
"TOTALLY agree with you, but the only thing I would say is it might be even better for the gf to set these boundaries with her friends. Otherwise, it could lead to them just blowing it off like he’s being sensitive. "
"Hi. I wanted to comment to say that I have both depression and a traumatic shower experience...

Nearly ten years ago I had gotten out of the shower and was drying my feet on my bath mat. I noticed a build up of hair on the drain, so I used my big toe to push it out of the way. I then walked off the bath mat onto my tiled floor and ending up slipping and tearing a ligament in my knee.

Even after my knee healed enough to where I could take showers, I had terrible anxiety. I would literally cry while showering because I was terrified I would get hurt again. I ended up being put on a low dose of anxiety meds and things improved a bit.

However, I've always had a very mild depression since my early teens. My depression got significantly worse after the shower incident, but not because of it. Even with stronger meds I'm unable to bring myself to even bathe unless I absolutely have to.

It has cost me most of my friendships and I'm lucky I have an extremely understanding and loving husband who accepts this part of me. I also do things to prevent bad odor like wear deodorant, use baby powder, and lotion my skin. 

I can't tell you if your SO is having mental health issues, but I can tell you that when I was healthier mentally, I made sure to work around my showering issues by either taking a bath or even just using a loofah and body wash to clean myself, then rinsing the loofah out to use to clean the soap off.

I think you need to be blunt. Tell him he stinks and that it's affecting you this much. Then maybe offer to shower together to make it fun? There's always a way to not stink, even if you are dirty."
"I mean it kinda seems like he totally ignored your wishes so if he brings it up tell him that. You don't like sharing private moments and find it embarassing. 

Edit: apparently you weren't exactly clear to him only hinted, he was probably very confused. Tell him what you had wanted was a private moment and apologize for not just being direct about it but you do absolutely want to get married. It's not something you can't get past and honestly you'll probably joke about it in the years to come. "
It sounds like you are making a lot more effort than him. He doesn’t have to resolve the fight because if he waits long enough you’ll bring it up and try fixing things. 
"It’s possible there is some truth to what Callie has told you about the past. Monica truly may have hurt her and the police were involved, as you said. Or, maybe that didn’t happen. The issue is now you are questioning if you trust your girlfriend and if you like her character. What would it take for you to trust her? I would personally have a hard time believing someone who lied to me and encouraged me to think poorly of someone for two years. 

If Monica was sending slut shaming messages to your girlfriend about your girlfriend’s mom (as you stated) and harassing your girlfriend about being a child out of wedlock or whatever else, I can see why Callie would “want it all to go away” and call Monica a liar. That was an immature response and protective mechanism, though. She has to accept the reality that it happened (the events, not the opinion of the events). However, she doesn’t have to accept Monica into her life or believe that her own mother is a slut. It’s just a little too much drama for me though. Best of luck. 

Did Monica attend that school with the purpose to follow Callie and try to ruin her life? It sounds like both sisters need some help. Professionally. "

One thing I've noticed in my time as an arts educator is that a lot of times people like your wife didn't want their kids to be in singing/dancing lessons for the kid's own good, but because they wanted them to do competitions/pageants. It's an easy way for the parent to get recognition.

Do the two of you have plans for her to go back to work?

"Just from a parenting perspective, not that you need someone telling you that you're doing right when you already know it, at our two and a half appointment, the pediatrician told me straight out, hitting and biting means an immediate time out. It's a hard rule, and is the only response from a parent for such behavior. You're doing right. Time out is the answer."
You're right about both
Not being labelled as a beater of his gf is a valid insecurity. You may not think it's a big deal but it kinda is.
"So, the thing that stuck out to me the most is that he's playing dnd multiple nights a week. 

I haven't heard of any game shop that holds one shot, anyone can show up, dnd games multiple nights a week, every week. I've been playing dnd for about 10 years, for reference. 

This makes me believe that he's playing with one group multiple times a week, or multiple groups during the week. Someone that plays dnd multiple nights a week is going to be involved in some sort of campaign (one story over multiple sessions), which requires the same people to show up over and over again, consistently. 

All that being said, this makes me believe that your boyfriend is making plans or committing to play dnd, either hours or days in advance. If your boyfriend treated dnd attendance the same way he treats you, he would have been kicked from multiple groups, or at the very least he wouldn't have the ability to play multiple times a week. 

I would bet anything that he doesn't flake on his dnd group the same way he flakes on you, because he would literally be kicked from the table. He's fine flaking on you since you've made it clear to him that you WILL accommodate him, no matter how flaky and inconsiderate he's being. 

It's not that your boyfriend refuses to make plans in advance. He just refuses to make them with you. Maybe he's still struggling with the end of his marriage and still working through some intimacy issues. Maybe he's just not as into you as you think he is. Maybe he's just destined for bachelor life. Either way, you can either accept him as he is or leave him. "
"&gt;Am I horrible for abandoning him?

you are not his mom, so you can't abandon him.

I could say that he lied to you and  now he has to face the consequences. But there is no need. You chose to break up with him. For reason YOU thought were right and that's enough."
My wife and I would never even consider this lol. Some people are just different. Life's too short and I want to be with her every day that I can.
"They both suck. You have only been friends with will 2 years... it's not like you have a 20 year history and he is really looking out for you. 

On the other hand, Will is right that a guy with girlfriend troubles shouldn't be spending 1/7th of his days with another girl. His ex clearly pegged his crush for you right away and yet he was in denial until she told him she knew. Then it went from being in denial to outright lying. This guy Kyle is NOT in tune with his emotions or wants, and is very likely to develope an ""accidental"" crush again.

Neither of these guys seen like a good fit for you. Start again. "
"I get it. I’m low-contact with my own mother and my husband opts out of most of our family interactions because of the way we have been treated - primarily over religious and political differences.

That said, I didn’t wait until my husband was forced to put his foot down about disrespectful behavior. We agreed her words towards him were disrespectful and discussed boundaries for our family and interactions going forward. I can’t control the way my mother behaves, but I personally don’t allow it to happen in front of me. If it does, I call it out as inappropriate and often cut the visit short. 

I’m not sure what sort of grandmother my mom will be since I haven’t given birth yet. But if she treated the children of my siblings (golden children who are still aligned with her political and religious ideals) better than my own child, you can bet I wouldn’t request, expect or force additional interactions (including caregiving!) between them on behalf of my mother."
Thank you! 100% not taking that call. I’m spending time with my family that isn’t being shitty!
"Your apology?! You dont have any need to apologize. He was going to ditch you for, (you being) very understandably, uncomfortable with the constant hanging with the ex. She can't even go out one night at a different bar? Where you were supposed to be meeting the friends and a family member? I think thats so fucked up. 

Please, expect better. Thats a super messed up situation.  You don't deserve to feel like that. Its not right. "
"No one knows about your financial status unless you flaunt it. Some of the wealthiest people I know drive 10 year old cars and wear normal khakis and polos. They work jobs and live normal lives. That's what ""old money"" people do. And that's how you save money and keep it in the family for generations. You're acting like ""new money"" people who are just throwing around money everywhere and then complaining about the fact people comment on it. "

"When I was young - I had a best friend just like this. EVERYONE told me I could do better. I believed them. I went off and got married. I mean, I was hot stuff. I could get whoever I wanted. My first husband didn't give a shit about me. He didn't care about my thoughts, my dreams, my goals. We divorced. When I came back to my home town, guess who was there? Guess who's been married nine years now? Because as I got older, I realized it's more valuable to have someone that you are a true partner with, than the hollywood sex machines."
I think you misread what that [person posted. They are not saying your BF would abuse his 13 year old daughter. They are saying some homophobic people could try to twist this into saying YOU are abusing this child. Which yes we know isn't true. But you should never underestimate what rumors and bigotry can do to someone's character. 
"""Callie told me that her strategy was to control the whole thing by starting the rumor first, so that nobody would believe Monica. But the whole thing seemed devious and cruel.""

Callie is trickle truthing you -- changing her reasons for doing things based on your latest reaction. It's what cheaters, liars, and scam artists do. Oh, and sociopaths.

Now Callie has told you about some henious act on Monica's part (involving the police, no less) that somehow excuses all of Callie's past deception and cruelty.  The problem is, based on your post, Monica has not lied at any point. She tried to show your gf-at-the time proof of her honesty via screenshots.. tried to get a roommate to listen to someone who witnessed the high school bullying, but both times she was shut down in *ugly* ways. All while Callie kept on lying and got everyone else in your circle to pile on with the malicious bullying -- including you. And now you know Monica was telling the truth.

Yet, for some unfathomable reason you now believe Callie's latest story of what ""really"" happened way back when. You believe Callie, the proven liar with a cruel streak a mile wide. I'm sorry, but I cant help but think you *want* to believe this sadistic woman because then you can excuse your horrible ex-gf's behavior as well as your own. Plus, you don't have to acknowledge that you are easily duped and have crappy taste in women. 

I know I'm being harsh, but the excuses that you offer on Callie's behalf are just enfuriating. Don't you think you've helped blacken Monica's name enough yet? All without one scrap of proof. All based on a known liar's testimony."
"so, because he saw how vulnerable his mom was, he wants to force YOU into that position instead?....Wow he sure loves you a lot, huh? It's not even about ""sharing risk"", it's about the fact he can empathize with his mother but has difficulty to extend it to you. What is that about? Is it because he finds it harder in general to empathize, or is it because he doesn't care as much about you as others in his close circle?

You keep saying he supports your career because he's ok with you working later. Is that seriously your definition of support? The guy sounds like he is only OK in very specific situations, and would never support your career taking off.

You're only allowed to make more by a small margin, even though you said his potential cap is lower than yours. On top of that, good luck getting promotions when you're jobless one month out of every yr and forced to start over.

FYI, not to be a debbie downer, but at a certain age, ""ageism"" becomes a real thing. You will not continue to be able to bounce back quickly with a new offer lined up each time, and some companies will start to question why you're never committed.

Edit to add: After reading your other replies, I think you are giving this guy WAY too many excuses as outs. He had a tough time growing up, I get it. But he's 35, not 15 - at what age do you expect him to start tackling his own issues and baggage? It's not your job to bend to his whims because he has depression and anxiety and a poor mother. Is he in counseling? Does he express any interest to get into counseling? Otherwise, what is your future game plan here?........Your post is such a small issue, drop in the bucket, but if he doesn't fix the underlying causes, it will come up again and again and again. He will never feel settled. He will always feel scared of you having more financial control. It will manifest in different ways over time. This is not going to look pretty for you in a few years. "

&gt;he became angry and borderline violent because it made him look bad

&gt;he had intentionally put our conversation on speaker because he thought it would be funny

&gt;I didn't want to bring this up because it would probably further anger him

These are all red flags. He's clearly displaying abusive behaviour. He doesn't respect you and doesn't have your best intentions in his heart. Would you speak and act the same way to a dear friend?"
"Lets review some more facts:

They were drunk when the first invite happened. We don't know the whole story, so that's fact #1. 

Fact #2, OP did the smart friend move when your friend drunkenly invites a new person, and that's confirm - still cool? 

Fact #3, this is a family affair that not ""all"" the friends were invited too, just OP. Now, we can make an assumption that Ashley over heard them talking, and invited herself. Or another assumption, Jake was feeling fun and mentioned something, got caught, didn't see the harm in saying sure bring your girl - after thinking it over, and maybe you're right about the drama part, he decides against it. But we don't know any of that, so fact #3 is just ""It's a family only thing, invite was just because of drinking - invite rescinded."".

Fact #4 GF seems cool with this, Jake seems cool with it, everyone seems cool with it. And GF mentions being uninvited (lets leave offhandedly or anything out of the mix, we don't know the tone/conversation) to jake, and an argument breaks out.

Jake isn't too polite. He said no multiple times and then had no issue getting into a yelling match when confronted *again* about it.

I hate to dump the blame on the girl, but I think she just causes drama and has just been stirring it up. But I don't know where he didn't have the courage to say no. "
Borderline violent is a stepping stone on the way to really violent. Walk or run away while you can.  
"I don’t blame him for not wanting to invite her, especially since they got into a huge fight recently. If it’s a family vacation he doesn’t want to risk something like that happening again. 

You have to explain to your girl it’s a boys trip or something along those lines. I have a buddy who has a vacation house that we visit twice a year, some of our friend group even have wives and children and none of them are present for it, ever. It’s easier for it to be just us. 

if you are worried about upsetting  your girlfriend you could just tell him something came up and not go."
"Pushing a relationship like this is known as 'love bombing'. Its a sign of bad things to come. It is a ploy used by abusive/manipulative people to get you pulled in quickly, just so they can play you like a puppeteer. 

Please use caution here. There is no guarantee this is what is happening, but it can get very bad very quickly. 

He could also be overly clingy and embarrassed about it. But it sounds like he is playing games with you. 

I suggest you do some pulling back of your own. Cancel that plane ticket before you cannot get a refund. Tell him it just seems like something people only do when the relationship is serious. And since you two are not there yet, its not something you feel comfortable going to with him. 

Back off and he will come after you. Return the sentiment and he runs. This is a love bombing pattern, but also the pattern for a guy that wants but isnt nearly ready for commitment "
"I have had guys call me ugly and all kinds of bullshit to my face to make a friend feel prettier and I have had guys call my friends ugly and other shit to try to make me feel prettier. It’s stupid, it’s offensive, it’s insane and it happened extremely frequently in my younger dating days. "
"The SIL is a nutter for taking it so far, she should have not brought it up. But the fact is that these unfollow issues are totally a new problem in the social media era. People definitely get hurt that they were unfollowed. Yes it’s lame but it’s just how it is? Unfollowing people can lead to headache."
Just drop this guy as a friend. He’s clearly not your friend and your ex is horrible. You’ll find a better friend and you will definitely find a better woman. Just ignore that guy and don’t think about your ex. She was a horrible person and she hurt you.
"Well, shit. This sounds like bad news. Thanks for the comment link, I haven’t gotten this far in the thread yet. :/"

"He takes offense? Fine, let him. He doesn't have to *like* you doing stuff by yourself but he does have to *accept* it. ""I'm going to the gym"" ""I'll come too"" ""Actually I quite fancy going by myself, but looking forward to dinner with you when I get back"" (or similar). Don't let him walk all over you. "
"My husband proposed in a food court. Or rather, we chose a ring together and while we were waiting for it to get ready we went and had dinner at a food court, at which point he said ""Do you wanna just do it now?"". I was like ""Not here"". So we drove somewhere else nice and he gave me a nice speech after we finished our maccas sundaes.

Funnily enough the whole thing kind of perfectly encapsulates our relationship."
She isn’t accusing him more because she knows she’s guilty. 
"I have no idea if shes been cheating on you, or planning to leave you, but overall having a secret bank account, lying about where you are, and avoiding issues is not good. A number of my mother's friends had parents who got divorced after the last kid left for college, sometimes without one of the people in the marriage realizing thats the intention. You need to find a time when your both in for the night and have nowhere to go and have a blunt discussion listing out what you found and asking for an actual explanation. "
"&gt; so this is a bit out of the box and probably not the worst possibility but definitely far from the best- I wonder if one of your parents is not your biological parent and the other just found out, and gave a choice to save the marriage and get you (the reminder of the infidelity) away?

Oh my god I hadn't thought of this at all. It's literally got me shaking."
"&gt; There's no focus on being present anymore, and everyone's so depressed and anxious and self-loathing (or partner-loathing) because someone along the way didn't cum.

As opposed to the good old days, when everyone was *totally* laid back about sex. What is this world coming to! "
I think it's quite sweet that you went out of your way to give her sister a card and gift anyway. I would give some time and space to your girlfriend since she seems to need it but giving you the silent treatment for going through with your compromise id not a mature way to deal with issues.
Feel free to tell the doctor or nurse that you want to be seen alone- they will not allow grandma into the exam room if you don't want her there.
"no, you're being downvoted for suggesting she treat a grown-ass man like a toddler. "
"Does he have other delusions such as this? It's one thing to not realize you smell, it's another to insist you are the sole exception to a completely natural human function. Is there something else underlying such as a phobia relating to showering? 

If he refuses and you've tried other efforts, I'd start telling him plainly that he isn't welcome for a visit until he showers with soap. Tell him you care for him and appreciate his friendship but you can't cause your whole environment to smell when he's been around just because he has a bizarre unwillingness to maintain personal hygiene levels. 

It's a sad situation but surely you are not the only one noticing this about him and it will SEVERELY impact his life if it continues - it will get in the way of personal relationships and quite possibly work, if his work involves being in the same physical vicinity as another human. "
"I'd be very happy too if I got to spend my days playing video games and Netflix, and never had to lift a finger because I had *two* live-in cleaners to pick up after me. "
"You absolutely did the right thing. She was being abused right in front of you, your friends should be ashamed they stood by silently. "
"Agreed. My ex, who was the sweetest girl I’ve ever dated, got violent with me over a comment one of our friends made about her on a night out. She never would have done it otherwise, but for some reason that made her snap and take it out on me. Violent people aren’t a specific type of people, they can be anyone, especially people you least expect. "
"You are 20 - is it possible for you and your sister to get a place together, and you *both* leave?"
"The person who can act shameless in these situations has a big advantage, because we don't expect it and pretty much can't react to it. The OP's entire strategy prior to this point was relying on a sense of shame to kick in, but it's not there. "
"This is awesome I wish all police would handle shit like this! I can’t even get my local pd to arrest a homeless crackhead who has been living next to my apartment door for over two years lol. I have been woken up in the middle of the night by him trying to break in the front door. I have made eye contact with his penis more times than I would like due to him masterbating next to my door or car almost everyday. But according to the CULVER CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT he has rights as a homeless man even though he is a sexual deviant and there’s children and single women in our building. And it’s been a battle for two years. TONS OF EVIDENCE. No shits given. I had no other choice but to take matters into my own hands, buying pepper spray, a baseball bat and a BB gun I spray painted black to scare him off. 
Lol I’m moving tomorrow ✌🏼long story short"
"Well, now I'm laughing at picturing someone dying due to wine inhalation (would that be death by alcoholic poisoning or choking or drowning?)."

"You are ignoring the facts -  Make a list of red flags.

If you want to stay with him because you “love him” or a desperate that’s fine -  it’s up to you but make a list of facts then decide what you want for your future.  "
"Having a restraining order on her record could also support an involuntary hospital stay for Wendy, which she probably needs."
"&gt;breaking up with him

It seems like this wasn't the only problem in your relationship, and it seems like he was acting like a jerk. I wouldn't blame the girl at the theater too much, though. He instigated it, she may have just been playing along."
"Part of the problem is that the accidents she's been in, car may have been totaled, but no injuries to her.  Show her some of the statistics, equate the amount of damage with chance of injury, and ultimately point out that dead is dead / paralyzed for life is paralyzed for life, and so on, regardless of whose damn fault it was.

One accident per year is way above-average, and the common denominator in all these accidents was that she was driving.  So even if it wasn't her fault technically, the facts point towards continued yearly accidents, and ONE of them will result in injury.  She's just tempting fate.

There are defensive driving courses offered all over the place, and they are cheap; dare her to take one to see just how good she is in the eyes of the instructors.  Say that you won't go on this vacation unless she passes one of these courses, because YOU have ANXIETY about car accidents."
"So wait, she has people LIVING WITH HER but she needs YOU, the granddaughter she never acknowledged to help her do things?
How about HELL NO!!
Let her loser grandsons help her. 
Stand your ground OP. Don't feel guilty. Grandma doesn't feel guilty about the way she treated you and your sister.

If your Dad feels bad, that's his issue really. Not yours.
"
"If I was invited to a wedding and didn’t receive a +1 for my SO of 3 years, I’d actually be a bit offended, and I’d stay home. We are a team. I personally don’t want to strengthen relationships with people who don’t respect us as a unit. Everyone is different and has different stances on this, some people might think I am crazy. But you should talk to your boyfriend and use this as an opportunity to discuss what your stance is on this type of thing, individually and as a couple. "
"Was looking for this comment! Coercion is absolutely disgusting and he’s obviously doing this to OP and does’t give a damn about how she feels.

If I could go back in time and tell myself about this happening with my previous ex’s I would have saved myself a lot of time, heart break and terrible “sex.”"
"Wow. Your daughter sounds like my sister in law. She treated me the same way for almost the same reasons. My mother in law always ignored it and guess what? Now we have three kids, been together 20 years, and we don’t allow his family around our children. 

You might want to tell your daughter to mind her own business. "
Have some faith in your parents! They can't love you and want this life for you.
"She wants to be you. That's pretty obvious. It can probably be traced back to your childhood. Did her parents treat her like shit and yours didn't? Did you have friends and she didn't? Things like this happens for a reason, and I'm willing to bet on the ones above, cause even though it isn't limited to those options, those are the most common. 

Anyway, that really doesn't matter. You can't let her have that kind of influence in your life like this. You can run away but, as she might be obsessed with you, she may come back. You can either move out of the city or face this head on, talking with people that are close to you and creating some kind of safe space to yourself, where people know what's happening and will back you up if anything happens. You should also impose yourself more and don't let her manipulate you publicly any longer. And by that, I mean: stop telling her your ideas. Stop grouping with her for class lessons or whatever.  I want to make this very clear: She WANTS to be you. So, in order to do that, she may feel like you need to be put out of picture so there can be only one you: her."
"Sex is like pizza. Even when it's bad, it's good.

Now that the joke's over, you're absolutely right. Everyone has fantasies, but this guy is definitely going to be disappointed by this. I hope he and OP can work through this."
"Yes, this is a ""let's find a loophole so I can fuck around and not be the bad guy"" move."
They sound 16 not 23 and 25 
"I flagged the fact that OP says he's ""not controlling"" and will ""allow it"". You don't ""allow"" your spouse to do something. It sounds like there are control issues on both sides."
"&gt;Sex was out of this world 

&gt;she just doesn't need or even want sex anymore.

This might suck to hear but sex was almost certainly not ever out of this world for her.   She faked it in the beginning and now she is telling you the truth.  I think you two are not compatible and you need to break up."
Treating you like a circus freak is about as far from showing concern as they could possibly get. NONE OF THIS IS RIGHT.
"&gt; But do keep dating guys who sow drama and discord? Boyfriend sounds sketchy at best for telling OP in the first place.

here I fixed that for ya: 

do*nt* keep ~~dating guys~~ *friends* who sow drama and discord. ~~Boy~~friend sounds sketchy at best ~~for telling OPin the first place.~~"
"I have a theory he's been working out/lost weight, something that made him realize other women look at him. By OPs timeline husband didn't have his first kiss in life ever until he met her around age 23. Spent his formative teen/early 20s gaming. 

I'm just getting a *""I feel pretty for the first time and want to see what that would have been like if I was single""* vibe"

"I can't help but think of A Christmas Story...

""I don't know what happened, I was watering my plant, and I...broke your lawn jockey"""
"&gt;When is the appropriate time to bring up the children conversation?

2-3 months ago."
"I don't see how your fiancé/boyfriend could ever trust you again. You cheated on him twice and then adamantly denied it for days before finally coming clean. I think you need to take some time to yourself anyway and figure out why you felt it was okay to act in such a way. You boyfriend is 25 years old, let him go and give him a chance with someone who has any ounce of respect for him."
"It popped into my head.  He might be feeling guilty and wanting retroactive permission for his possible (ongoing) affair.  Also, he might not stop at one fling.  Gets the midlife crisis going and decides it has to be an open marriage.  Then divorce because you can see OP wouldn't be down with that.  "
"It kind of sounds like his minds made up. He seems not ok with only (in his mind) one sex partner for the rest of his life. 

I suspect he's just saying words to smooth things over as an attempt to lessen the pain he's inflicting on OP."
You're seriously asking why you shouldn't play games with a relationship?
"Crying can be manipulative. It can also be a normal and uncontrollable human reaction to stress. 

I think, in a *healthy* relationship where one partner tends to cry during an argument or disagreement, both partners need to recognize, and trust the other to recognize, that the crying is separate from the conversation and doesn't impact who should ""win.""

In other words, you should not expect him to cede the point to you because you are crying; you should do your best to resume composure and then continue the discussion. He should trust that you are not expecting to ""win"" because you are crying, and be willing to give you some time before you continue the discussion. He shouldn't derail it by blaming you for crying. 

Both partners need to act with good faith. If you do expect that crying should lead him to give you your way, you can't expect him to not feel manipulated when the tears come out. 

"
"I completely get this. One of my ex's does amazing artwork and I've thought about having him design a tattoo for me. I love him as a person but I'm not in love with him, nor ever will be again, but I respect him and his work. It would be journaling a beautiful part of your life on your skin, a story of where you've been that made you into who you are today. If they split amicably I could see it being taken in this way and I think it's worth her talking to him about his feelings behind selecting that piece."
Get the hell out of dodge is what you do. This whole situation is a dumpster fire and you do not want to be that guy. 
It seems like OP thinks this is really normal and ordinary :-( Really scary and fucked up situation.
"Break things off with her ASAP. My last roommate was like this, footing with guys including the one she knew I liked “for my own good” “to make sure they were good enough for me” aka a bunch of bullshit. I realized she a little narcissistic and was just trying to feed her own ego. "
"or a symptom she's just not that into her husband any more, tbh."
"There is a compromise. You don’t need to live “waaay” below your means. Save money, sure, but also acknowledge that your partner wants to enjoy his life while he’s young with the money he is earning. 

I’m sure there’s a half way point, since you’re both at opposite ends of the spectrum. 

"
So you guys started dating when you were 15 and he was 19?
"She needs to admit that she was wrong and made some extremely poorly worded comments before you can consider whether this can be saved. If you've never heard anything like this before, there's definitely a chance that something repressed bubbled up inside her and she let herself get out of control and regrets it, but she needs to understand why this would cause you some serious concerns.

Do you have any gut feelings? I would absolutely trust those over anything a stranger on Reddit tells you. You are the only one who heard what she was saying. You're the only one who can really judge whether she was blowing steam or whether there's a hidden truth in her words. Trust your gut. 

Above all, you definitely shouldn't marry her until you've put this behind you and you feel comfortable with her again. "
They are bring ridiculous.  Get there however you and your bf wish. No you dont pay for their gas
That sounds like me and my best friend!! I think she's gorgeous and a model and statuesque. And she loves my curves. Totally different styles but both perfect in our own ways (:

"I agree. About three years after getting a divorce, my ex said to me ""You know, this was the best thing that could have happened to us."" And she was right.

Also, when our daughter was 18 (we divorced when she was 5) I asked her directly about how the divorce effected her. Her answer: ""Well, pretty soon it just seemed like it was normal. I had my Mom. I had you. Going back and forth was kind of a pain, but I got used to it. It just seems like the way things have always been.""

I think your finance had a hard time because her parents 1) had a crappy marriage; and 2) divorced when she was old enough to begin to fully appreciate what was going on. She probably would have been better off if they'd divorced a lot earlier."
"Furthermore, I think if you were really worried about the amount of guests affecting headcount, it would be about MORE guest showing up than you had accounted for, not one less. An extra guest means the caterers have to prepare an extra setting and plate, one less guest just means there's a little bit of food left over. It makes no sense to feel obligated to bring someone just to keep the number of people attending to the exact same."
Not normal and really gross. She must have a shitload of plaque and tarter build up. Yuck. That’s just basic hygiene she’s neglecting. I wouldn’t be cool with that.
You should absolutely go. You can still stay in contact with friends even if you're away at college. 
They helped pay for my education (maybe 30% of it) and planned to do the same with my siblings but their financial situation is changed somewhat significantly and they can't do the same for them. 
"It's 2018, short of locking him in a box or sending him to ""troubled teen"" camp, (something I imagine such controling parents capable of - watch out for that) isolating him from you is impossible. And say they succeed? The moment he turns 18 he knows you are there for him, so he'll come to you and they can't stop him.

they have far less power here than they realise

But I like the ""lie your asses off"" approach.  ""Yeah, I'm paying for her to study accountancy"". And then the glorious moment when she  emails them her diploma in mediaeval underwater cat juggling."
"The fact also, is to start a paper trail. There's a record that you are requiring counseling services to even BROACH this topic because of the situation you've been unwillingly placed into.

Maybe you got an inheritance from some distant relative and your entire family is out to fuck you out of it. Maybe you ain't fessing up to some key details. For all of us here commenting on it, we're about as clueless as you are now.

But if there's really nothing, there is something. Your parents have off-loaded you to a next-of-kin while still being able to manage housing your siblings. That's not cool. If there's some manner of abuse that you're being falsely accused of... I mean, one shouldn't really leave this up to imagination. If you've done no wrong, then there's probably a need for outside intervention should this situation continue much further."
"That's very alarming, along with the violent behavior of the younger brother. It sounds like the kids could be witnessing/experiencing abuse at home."
"All day this. 

This is not a situation you need to be polite in. He sacrificed his right to your common decency when he harassed you for all of high school. Make this weird for him. You’re not being petty or unreasonable by choosing not to see him—you’re choosing not to relive trauma. "
"speaking as an ex addict this reads like this dude is putting drugs up his nose. hookers, sex life talk, ect. who he hell brings this shit up in an office unless they're high?"
It took me six times to propose because my husband kept ruining it and I didn’t want to reuse set ups and make him suspicious. The universe almost ruined my final proposal and I was  so nervous about it that I said “you can say no” instead of will you marry me. We laugh about it so much now but at the time I was completely embarrassed 
Were you in middle school?
She's a predator and you're blaming the victim.
"You're making a deal with your adult sister is completely out of your parents' control, legally speaking. As you already understand, the big risk is that your parents take out their frustration on your little brother. 

While that seems incredibly childish of them, it's a reality that he is under their rule until a certain age. When he becomes an adult, you can execute the same deal you gave your sister with him. In order to make sure he knows that and can stay stong, you may want to start laying out your expectations early so he can see the light at the end of the tunnel if your parents start to act childish.  

On a different note: since you are a higher earner you should probably make sure you get financial advice on how to structure this support. There is a $15,000 annual limit on gifts before they become taxabale at a whopping 40%. Here are a few simple ways to avoid some headaches.

Make sure you pay the school directly for your sister's tuition. Payments directly to schools for education purposes don't have to be reported for gift tax purposes, so they don't use up your annual limit. The remainder of your support can then be stuctured to observe the annual limit and you shouldn't run into two much trouble.

If you wanna plan ahead for your brother, you can look into a 529 plan, which allows you to deposit money now and it grows tax-free to the extent that it is spent on higher education costs. There are some rules but generally this can pay for room and board, meal plans, books, computers, etc. With more time, these plans really save a lot of money on taxes. 

Good luck with the parents, and I think everyone here agrees you're a rockstar of a brother. "
"Yup, I have done the first paragraph almost word for word. Good suggestion, but does not work for him. 

He has read both of those things.

So how do I improve it within the bounds?  I'm just very unclear on what's reasonable for me. Right now it seems the only thing I can expect is to do everything and treat his help as a pleasant surprise that I praise him up and down for, but that also doesn't seem fair to me. I can't figure out the balance between what I want and what I can expect and what I should expect, you know?"
"Red flag.  Couples should be supportive of one another, not dependent on each other.  You are each responsible for your own feelings and how you handle your reactions, though your emotions may be influenced by one another.  You should be able to have your alone time, and he should be secure enough not to be worried that you've lost interest if you don't respond while he knows you're away on a work trip.

The friends vouching for him being a good guy probably haven't dated him.  "
He’s going to kill someone and he doesn’t care. I’m amazed he hasn’t already. I wouldn’t be in the same room as this guy if he so much as looked at a set of car keys.
"The truth is not your friend when the parents are threatening to send the brother to a ""troubled teen"" camp. Children have *died* at those types of facilities. I would advocate doing damn near anything if it prevented that. "
"I think that reaching out to your parents would be a great idea.  Also check out womenshealth.gov to find other resources in your area.

Lol yes. That’s what I was suggesting.

"Your husband is a disgusting creep who needs to be in jail. He violated you in so many ways. I'm pretty sure he's still hiding some other parts too. 

You're only 30, I have a cousin who is also 30 who just divorced her incompetent ex-husband because he was doing nothing but putting them indebt. She is so happy and full of energy now, with a lot of plan to embrace her new found freedom. She told me that she also thought just loving him was enough, that she should be accepting and tolerating his behaviors. But at some points, she realized that he will never prioritize her over his own interests, and no matter how much she loves him, she deserves more than what he was giving her. So she filed for divorce.

She was in a lot of shame, due to our culture, religion etc. But all those things should not tie you down over your own life. She did what was best for her.

I hope you find the courage to do the same.
"
"&gt; How to move on and be happy alone, but stay friends and continue to date him and others? 

That's like saying ""how can I continue eating arsenic and not have it poison me?""

This guy is untrustworthy. He keeps crossing your boundaries. He's not going to stop. He's either going to stop for just long enough to earn your trust back, or he'll just get better at hiding it. Probably both. 

&gt; What steps can I take to keep my heart safe and continue to regain my independence and confidence making it alone?

You need to give up on him. Completely. You need to stop believing in a happy future with him. You need to stop thinking ""him+me"". No more contact. No more overnight visits. 

Yes, it will fucking hurt and you will miss him, for a while. But you'll meet other people, and they will make you happy and turn you on without also making you miserable. 

It's better to push yourself through the break up now than in 10 years time, when you realise that you've wasted 10 years of your life on a guy who already proved how untrustworthy he is."
0.o please stop doing this and just use warm water with a little bit of soap. Please stop. 
"Interesting that a 27-year-old man expects his 20-year-old girlfriend to put up with being an afterthought.

Except not really. 

Truth comes out in times of stress, and methinks you're starting to figure out your truth. Why waste time on someone who doesn't even put in the minimum?"
"Oh, so your gaslighting, lying girlfriend came out with some MORE awful stories to make her seem like the victim when you confronted her, and that doesn't seem... suspicious?

No gfliedtwoyearsthrow! You don't understand! I **HAD** to make up the stories first and get you against her. Here's some more reasons why that I didn't tell you before that make me look like I was justified in being crazy!"
"You know, even when my husband and I fight we always check up on each other in the end. We may have an argument before he heads to work, but I always check-in with him to make sure he made it there safely or vice versa. The fights/arguments we have are temporary- my love for him and his safety is always there and always present. "
"Look, it really shouldn’t be a big deal for both sets of parents to come for Christmas. It’s unreasonable for your in laws to “ban” your parents from seeing you while they see you. You’re all family now. And family doesn’t have to like each other, but they do have to tolerate each other. "
"This is so not true! Don't spread the misinformation, please. You can publish in any genre sans MFA. You just need to get an agent and have a manuscript that they can pitch and sell. I've gotten both my agents through cold slush-pile submissions, like most people do. I know plenty of people with MFAs who aren't published and vice versa. "
I would personally drop her out of my life if she said some cold blooded bs like that to me or any of my siblings. You’re a good person OP because if it were me 2 spots were gonna magically disappear from the guest list. 
"Fuck that shit - here’s a thing you will learn OP. Relationships change people. They are *meant* to. Not in the ‘oh my god you are a whole different person’ kind of way, but in a ‘my life is no longer just about me anymore, it’s about me and the team I am in’. You don’t change so much as grow. 

Him not feeling like himself is basically him saying that he is not mature enough to be in a proper relationship and he doesn’t want to goddamn grow up. You were convenient so long as you were an ATM to him. Good riddance! You are worth so much more than that.

I hope you find someone who you either have more in common with, or someone who is different but balanced for you - and that you can learn and grow together."
"Yeah, he's talking to some other girl who just happens to have the same first name as your best friend and he got them mixed up on his phone or whatever.

This doesn't make any sense unless he thought he was messaging YOU. Like trying to see if you wanted to get together, then you weren't replying. Then when she asks about you, he thinks you must mean someone else with your name and he's confused and asking for more info? And words his question about this other person weirdly? But this is really stretching. And doesn't jive with his explanation after that."
it would mean so much if he was proud of me  because i really do look up to him a lot. 
"It’s pretty obvious that I’m in the video, and she’s captioned it with “I’m dead 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 naked friends.”

I’ve reported it already, but I’m not sure how long Instagram takes to review the reports."
Adults communicate. Not spring mystery vacations. 
"All she did was start crying - he jumped into being defensive even though she hadn’t said anything, he started swearing at her and invalidating her feelings without so much of a “hey I’m sorry it was an accident, maybe we could get it fixed somewhere” I’m sure if he hadn’t acted like the victim from the start, it would have been different "
"I mean, he grabbed the bottom hem of a dress and pulled it. I don't own a single dress that could actually be removed this way! And I'm sure there is no way OP's dress could have been. This is a pretty reckless, stupid accident. I don't think he gets a pass for it. "
"&gt; I straight up had to stop reading when he said he took a day off to hang around his mother's

I didn't get much further after reading that either. OP really needs to stop caving when they put on the waterworks. He's not asking for anything unreasonable either. Next time they ask him to do something that they should be completely capable of I suggests he goes 'I will do this once and show you how. I expect you to learn and do it for yourself next time as I will not be available to help'. Therapy and counselling would also be a good idea because there'll be underlying reasons as to why this situation has gotten way out of hand. I third party might be able to unravel all this much better than OP on his own."
Couldn’t she had also notified him like hours before the dinner letting him know she wasn’t coming???
I feel like something is missing in this story too. Most adults couldn’t care less what their uncles get up to so I’m not understanding their shock. 
You can’t be in love with people you’ve never met.  You are infatuated. 
"Boob job would be a better comparison, because it's the most requested surgical body modification to a partner. You can't remove stretch marks. There is no procedure for that. You can try to lighten it with laser but the results are very very poor."
"I think he's ruined your marriage. I don't think you will ever feel the same about him again.

My first husband wanted something from me that I wasn't comfortable with but I was young and thought I was obligated and it would make him care about me more. It was a slippery slope towards other things and it kept piling up on me emotionally until one day I broke.

I realised he had killed my love for him by making these requests - because they were ALL about him and his wants and needs and nothing to do with me. I was the conduit.

Your husband is putting you in the position of being the decider and that's just simply unfair.

I think right now you need to show him how you feel, be honest, loud and strong. TELL HIM THIS IS NOT OK and then act on it. Move him out and show him his actions have had consequences"
"&gt; she's recently been the beneficiary of some magnificent good luck ...She's had a really fantastic manager that's encouraged her to pursue her interests and strongly advocated for her internally. She's also had people mentor her .... 

OP, speaking as a former manager, this isn't good luck. Your girlfriend sounds like she has a rare combination of talent and personality. Her bosses recognize that and are delighted to work with her because of what she can do for them and what they can do for her. It's a mutually beneficial relationship. Don't let your envy cause you to minimize your girlfriend's abilities. You don't see them all because you two don't have that kind of relationship but her employers do."
"&gt; My boyfriend has seen it before, but saw it again recently and decided it couldn't exist anymore.

Oh, he did? How decisive.  I don't suppose he reflected on the fact that....oh, YOU own the damn thing, not him, and your opinion is the one that matters.

&gt; Then he chopped it up with wire cutters.

/eyeroll.  Guy needs to get himself together."
"Maybe Monica did end up a bit crazy, but can you blame her!

First her dad has an affair while her mum is pregnant with her, and then leaves her mum for that woman (I can tell you first hand this SUCKS!), so the rejection she would have dealt with and hatred towards Callie's mum is probably justified.  Especially through her teen years.  Then she gets rejected by her sister.  Then she gets rejected by all the people around her at school and college.

You can't do anything but look on how YOU behaved.  Ignore what you do or don't know about what is factual, are you proud of how YOU behaved?  Does it line up to your values?  Then, when it comes to your GF, is she truly remorseful?  It doesn't sound like it.  She's pretty fucking manipulative, like frighteningly so.  You would have to believe that you could be a better person, and trust that she could too.  "
"&gt;You can mean for something not to be racist, and it still be racist.

Now if we could just get the 'I'm not a racists' to understand that, then we could start making real changes to the world."
"As per OP, she only started making passive-agressive comments after he ""forbid"" her to openly approach someone about the problem. She used to go up to whomever and say ""sorry, you're blocking the hallway"", and now she doesn't ""get to"" do that anymore so she has resorted to the comments."
"This is the part that got me. She looks down on Jim because his lifestyle is different than hers and is seen as lesser? That's ridiculous.

She thinks sitting on a high horse and casting judgement down on other people makes her better than other people that value physical items and want to have good time in their 20s.

Also, just because someone like Jim isn't that type of person to her, doesn't mean that Jim can't be that type of person to someone else. She's judging someone based on what they bring to a friendship that she's not even a part of."
What makes you feel so strongly that you were able to give consent at 14 years old?
Thank you for the response! I definitely agree that without concrete proof he may not believe us. The only thing is that with all of her best friend's coming forward it may convince him but I'm unsure. It seems that it may never come out I just feel that it is so unfortunate for him to waste his life away with someone that shows so little respect for him. 
This should've come up before you got married... what the hell?
"So it sounds like part of the problem is that you thought you both agreed on what to do while the other parent is having their “night off,” but then you realized that while you’re using this time to bond one-on-one with your daughter, your wife is using at least some of that time to do things she wants to do &amp; is just bringing your daughter along. I would focus on this aspect. Otherwise, you’re just going to get bogged down (as some of these comments already are). I think agreeing to spend one “day on” a week doing things to bond one-on-one with your child may be a fair compromise, but figure out what works for you. Keep focus on wanting to ensure that your daughter gets special time with each of her parents, since it sounds like that’s the issue. "
"&gt; He promises he will get therapy and learn to accept he is a one woman man until he dies.

Bullshit. A week/month/day later after the deed is done, he'll turn it into a ""just one more"" situation. He wants to open up a can of worms and keep it open. "
"&gt;When even this seemed not to do the trick, I dived into the internet ""Manosphere"" and have pretty much devoured every lecture and book on male-female relations I could find.

FFS. Dude, wrong move. Talk to your wife. She's been your caretaker. Your illness has had a huge impact on her too.

All that manosphere shit is not helping you. It's toxic. Couples therapy and communication is what you should focus on, not tracking her hormones and increasing your 'social proof'. "
"I agree. I guess my upbringing is biasing me too.

My mom would bring me to everything. I rarely did ""kid-structured activities"" except at school. Outside school, I would play with friends at my house and theirs. Sometimes we'd go to the park or the pool, especially in the summer. A lot of my free time was accompanying my parents to whatever they were doing, including a tupperware party (lol). It didn't bother me and I never felt deprived. I liked hanging out with adults. "
"Agreed. Candidly, I think that whether wrongly or not, the fact that OP's boyfriend sought out a relationship with a guy 21 years his junior who looks young enough to pass for a high schooler would start people's alarm bells ringing as far as him possibly having inappropriate inclinations, and that makes it all the more likely that someone would be willing to believe that there was abuse going on if given any reason to entertain the idea. "
"He was a 44 year old who went after a man who was closer in age to his *pre-pubescent daughter* than to him. Somehow I’m less than shocked that he’s got poor listening skills and shaky judgement. 

Look hard at what you’re getting yourself into, OP. "
"So many red flags. I'm glad you broke it off, but I'm concerned that the electronic leash he had you on didn't make you more angry. Normal people don't need to be in 24/7 contact with their adult SO. They don't need to know where the other is and what they're doing all the time. Adults recognize the autonomy of other adults. In the future if anyone exhibits this behavior, don't waste your time with them. "
Yeah this man does not like his wife. 
"people are ragging on the gf, but you say that Jake is kind of jealous and doesn't like other people vying for your time? do you spend every weekend with Jake at his family home? if I was gf I wouldn't want to go after that, but I also would wonder why you all are spending every weekend together (if you are) at a place she is not welcome."
"""I immediately told her I knew she was on her period,""

WTF? Why would you say that? The old ""stupid women are slaves to their hormones"" bit? Even if she was crampy and bloated and feeling bad, people (remember women are people) might not be able to control their feelings, but they can control their actions. Please don't use periods/PMS/hormones to justify bad behavior.

That said, you might not be the ""cause,"" but in all the situations you posted, except maybe the one about your friend who reacted badly to news of your engagement, there were visible warning signs that the other person was unreasonable or vindictive or ""dramatic"" or boundary-violating in some way (constant complaining, history of passive-aggressively cutting others off, being argumentative, etc). So as you get to know people, look for those signs, and if you notice any warning signs, pull back a bit, instead of forging ahead. "
"There's a similar heigth difference between me and my husband, but my height is pretty average (for a woman in my country). It has never bothered me, but what did bother me on the 8th day after my child was born was my rabbit biting through the power cord of my phone charger and my husband suggested he could loan a power cord from work. I. Was. In. Tears. Over a power cord. I didn't want a loaner. I wanted my own power cord. I lost my shit over that.

Rationally any power cord that was legally obtained would have been fine, but this was not about what was rational. There's a sudden shift in hormones around the one week mark after giving birth. That does not invalidate your feelings. It actually validates that you are suddenly feeling bothered by things that didn't bother you before. Your hormones will level out soon, but if your concerns stay, talk to a doctor."
"&gt; My main concern is for our sex life, which was already what I would call not great, due to pretty low libido on both sides. I'm concerned that this could be what kills it entirely.

This is the issue you should be focusing on. Sexual incompatibility is one of the most common factors for relationships ending. "
"**So much talking.** We talked about how he would feel if I did the same thing, we talked about how weird it was he used social media instead of porn, we talked about how fucked it was that he saw all his friends through a sexual lense. We talked about how his dad taught him to view women and what it would be like if I viewed men in a similar way. He bought some books on masculinity and really worked on how he thought about being a man. 

I know I'm going to get people saying I over reactacted and people saying I under reacted and he's still looking. I don't think so. We have sex more now. We're happier. We both learned how to navigate out first huge disagreement in a productive way. He actually talks about his feelings now. He nearly cut his dad out of his life. 

"
"I wouldn't let a teenager behind the wheel of something with that acceleration, no matter the cost.

Let's be clear, the worst thing that could happen here is not just worth 300k, the worst thing is the deaths of a car full of teenagers (and their parents suing you for lending a young kid a powerful car you know he can't drive and getting their kids killed). And that's assuming he doesn't hit any other cars full of people.

You know he wants this to show off.  You know what that means.  Experienced adults get killed playing with expensive sports cars and handing they keys to an inexperienced (and clearly impulsive) 16 year old?  Wh9 you know based on his reaction is going to want to play with it?  You're basically signing a death warrant.  And not just for him, likely multiple others."
"Yep he isn't just abusing OP, he is abusing his daughter by threatening to pee on HER clothes also and robbing her mother of happiness and self esteem and has her walking on egg shells in her own home. So tragic. :("
"I think we recently had a similar post where the OP was involved in a male-dominated industry (I think she was working on airport/other short railways), going on similar business trips and the boyfriend was insulting her because he was jealous of her job and insecure (thinking she was cheating with all the male colleagues)."
"Well, he said it's a deal-breaker and he will dump her and move, so the details don't matter.

If she admits but argues that she only cheated that one time, after 7+ years of faithfulness, logically the facts only show that she happened to get chlamydia that one time."
" Same here. My 6'9"" former military ex used to back me into corners and scream at me till he lost his voice. I stayed for a year cause I was too afraid to leave. I wish the neighbors had called the cops. "
"You can’t wait on this man. iF she decides to stay  until your youngest is in college, how much money will she have taken from you and the children? When you are scrambling to cover their college tuition, what about the money she took that could have gone to them?

"You don't just have an aunt problem, you have a SO problem. It's time to have a frank, but empathetic conversation with your partner about this situation and it's impact on you. You cannot dictate his actions, but you can share your concerns and feelings with him regarding the priority he seems to place on his aunt and her feelings over your own. You can share with him the expectations you have of how he will treat you and prioritize you. His reaction to this conversation can help you decide if he is willing to treat you in a way you are comfortable with, or if his priorities do not align with you idea of a healthy partnership. At that point, YOU have a choice to make. You can either accept his treatment of you (and her) or you can end the relationship and look for a partner who more closely aligns with your idea of a healthy relationship.  


You might also check out /justnofamily and /justnomil for some insight on where these situations often lead..."
AND stop putting so much effort into the business if he's essentially kicking you out of it.
"So I'd like to clarify. I have gifts for the other instructors, and the people who wirk there. I'm just worried about making a fool of myself. With the others it'll be fine, but I'm terrified of stuttering and looking stupid in front of him."
"I'm just so confused why you would want to do this and when you would have time. On my wedding I was busy with the wedding preparations, wedding, reception, after party, and after after party from like 8am to 2am. I can't even fathom where in that schedule one would say to themself ""you know what I should do right now? Text my ex that I haven't spoken to in 5 years to let them know what's up""."
"Funny how her ""new"" story somehow twist things to makes her a martyr that lied to protect her abuser. Lmao. This girl is something else. If this story is true. Op good luck if your relationship ever ends. "
Be honest with her about why you can’t go. Don’t  lie. She really should have checked with you before getting the ticket. 
"I don't know how much he's researched the publishing industry but no he doesn't have an agent. 

This might sound weird but honestly I don't know how good he is because I haven't read any of it. I don't even know what his book is about. He's really guarded with it and doesn't like to talk about it. He said he'll show it to me when he's done."
You've put up with it for more than 17 years and somehow now you expect him to change?
"Not gonna lie, this would be game over for me. I wouldn't be able to be friends with them anymore. But it sounds like you are more forgiving than me, so maybe say no more hanging out at your house. Make it clear to them that from now until you deem fit you will hangout with them elsewhere, but never at yours. I would also demand an apology for your parents. They are in the wrong 1000% so you get be pissed at them."
"Oh for fucks sake!@ This guy has his head so far up his own ass about his ""career"" as a ""writer"" that he is communicating through his colon. He really has no idea what he is doing. You are funding his hobby. It's time to find out if you can break the lease and move out. "
"Honestly, it sounds like she is more interested in you as a 'bad boy fetish' or 'dirty little secret' than as a person she's proud to call her partner.

She is more concerned about the opinions of the other people in her life than she is in your feelings.

If she's still embarrassed for her friends, family and coworkers to know who you really are and what you do for a living after dating for a *full year*, I think it's time to move on."
"Exactly this. Learn from this OP for your next relationship. Those you will take advantage of your kindness and then turn around and make it like you were in the wrong are not worth keeping around. Think about the difference in how you would react to a situation vs how the other person does. How you would treat a partner if you happened to find yourself in a similiar financial situation to the one your ex was in.

If you ever offer to give someone money in the future, keep in mind that you don’t then get to dictate what they do with it and change the rules to your liking either. If you can’t afford to give that money, or cannot do so without feeling resentment if they never pay you back, hard rule is don’t pay for anything for anyone otherwise. Yes, that does narrow down that list to barely giving anyone any money ever. 

"
He’s saying that to keep you from walking out the door. And he is giving himself a two-week window to see how serious you are. 
"Yep. People might want to think ""oh it's just verbal, you just need to sit them down and tell them how their words make you feel"", but 9/10 times the abuser already knows how they are making their SO feel, that's the point of the abuse. And sadly 9/10 times it is just a matter of time before it does escalate to physical abuse."

"Say exactly what you wrote here:

&gt;I recently started going to the gym and love it! I’ve gotten stronger and more energy. I would love it if we could get fit together

then add:

""...so would you want to come with me during my next workout? I'm going tomorrow at XYZ time, maybe we could even shower together afterwards ;)""

"Did your brother go through chemo? You can get diseases from mice, you might be able to convince them to get an exterminator if your brother's immune system isn't great considering that?"
"I’m not sure I have an answer for you but these are things you should consider:

1) you’re unhappy where you are. Your career hasn’t been going well. Do you see yourself living in the current place long term? If so, what’s the plan for you to be happier where you are? If not, have you discussed this with your husband? What are your long term goals and plans as a couple?

2) What happens once the course is completed? Will you be coming back to your current location? How will this course impact your job prospects? Will you have more prospects where you are now or will you get better offers where the school is or at some other, third location?

3) You say that the future without this course looks bleak to you. But how does the course change things long-term? It’s a 2 year program, so either you’re coming back to your current city or you’re going somewhere else. If you’re coming back to your current city I don’t see how having done this course will change things compared to how you feel right now. If the plan is to go somewhere else then I understand your husband’s apprehension because this course is the start of a major life change that you’re planning without having discussed it with him first. 

4) Finally, you moved halfway across the world to be with your husband. You plan to stay home and raise kids even though you apparently have a career and you’re interested in. You’re unhappy and don’t have many friends. I’m worried that you’re very isolated and that your relationship seems to revolve around you giving up things. You talk about how your husband labels you as unhappy without acknowledging how your situation is a contributing factor. And a lot of your post seems to be about “escaping” — escaping the city you’re not happy in, and the future you’re not ready to commit to. I have to wonder if maybe you guys need to have a serious conversation about your future as a couple. Maybe it’s time for him to start compromising on things like location and careers. 


Bottom line: you describe this program as if a 2 year course will change your life and increase your happiness, but it seems like it’s actually opening a can of worms with regards to what you want your life to look like and how your marriage supports or hinders that. In a vacuum the decision to join the program is neither good nor bad. But until the underlying relationship issues are addressed, there’s no way to say what you should do.

"Yes and also he's a mysoginist POS who think a woman value is based on the number of sexual partners she had. It's no surprise also he found a barely legal girl. She'll be much more easy to manipulate.

OP please don't cry for him. I know it hurts right now but you will soon realise you dodge a huge bullet. I know you're not in this place right now, but if anything you should feel sorry for this poor girl who is so young and I promise you will go through hell with this mysoginist POS."

"At 39, 400k means she could be at 2m at 65. At 35k, it could mean 0 or 200k? Who knows.

Either person is entitled to do what they want with their money, and should date someone they are compatible with. Being financially compatible is very important to some people. It's a lifestyle choice, future goals, and planning all rolled into one.  If someone was a hardcore bodybuilder, we wouldn't fault them for wanting to date another bodybuilder instead of a layman, since the lifestyle commitments would be shared.

$400k in a 401k isn't that extreme. It's about 6k per year with a 6% match for someone in a professional manager role pretty easily.  Most accounting/finance people I know follow a similar strategy."
"OP’s mother maybe?

In any case it was a mistake to quit a job because it was just “break even” at the time. First because clothing costs are controllable and I bet she was overspending. Second because you can move up in your job and start making better money instead of not having the experience and always staying home because it’s “not worth it.”

It’s an investment. "
"Well, if he wanted to have that tattoo, he should’ve thought someone might ask him what it represents, right? Especially his girlfriend."
"I don’t think it’s right for anyone to put their hands on anyone in that context, nor do I find it appropriate that he called you names and made you feel like that. 

But in regards to him having to include you in everything last night, there’s not much you can do about that. He’s a grown man, and you can’t force him to do anything. Especially when he’s super drunk and out of it like you described. If he’s not the type to drink anyway, he’s gonna get social and out of it and just let loose. I don’t think he’d be very worried about making sure you’re being included in every little thing he was doing last night. 

I can see why you’re upset and I do not believe that it’s right for him to willingly harm you, but if being social and loud is how he gets when he drinks, you can’t really change that. You can’t make him do anything. You can only control your own actions and feelings, not his. 

I am glad to hear he apologized. I hope you guys can work through this occurrence and the past couple of weeks. "

You have enough for a deposit if you want to buy a house, or for major purchases like you need a new car, or to book a nice holiday or just in case of emergencies...why do you need more than that.

"You are one lucky lady! Many women, me included, have experienced unexpected pain, tearing, etc. even during consensual sex with thoughtful partners. "

"I have tried my best. I do care about him, but it's scary to be woken up and told there's clown there in the corner wanting to kill him. I can't imagine what it's like for him to actually be seeing it. Bugs, clowns, people outside the window and things like that. "
"I think there's a lot missing here. No one says ""well, I can't *remember* if I physically assaulted my partner"" if they didn't. What do you think is more likely? That your wife all of the sudden fabricated all of these memories just for an excuse to leave you? Or you don't see your behavior as an issue?

An ex of mine shoved me to the ground during an argument and started screaming at me. The next day he was full of ""I would never want to hurt you!!"" lines. 

I don't really buy this version. And the whole niceguy thing. "
"I'm not sure if people are missing the portion of your post in which you say he's obese and only working on it because of you (and presumably because you're not physically attracted to him), but I really do think that's a valid concern.

If you're not physically attracted to him or enjoying your sex life, and those things are important to you, it's only reasonable that you're having these doubts.  It's up to you to decide whether or not this outweighs the positives in your relationship, but I think sexual incompatibility is a big negative.

Good luck! "
"&gt; your principles regarding race

Honestly it's more like principles regarding **human decency**. I wouldn't take such a strong stand over my mom's political beliefs, but I would (and did) make a big deal about showing basic consideration for other human beings.

"Make the break permanent.  There sounds like there's nothing wrong with you but there is definitely something wrong with her behaviour towards you, she sounds downright cruel and selfish.

""The more I know you, the more I can't stand you most of the time""

""I don't care, it's still your fault. You always want to argue and say it isn't your fault, and you know I am always right.""

Do you always want to argue?  Is she some sort of God that knows your inside thoughts and is always right?

I had a similar experience with an ex.  He told me so much about what a disaster I was at traveling that I genuinely surprised myself when I took a mini solo trip in China and realised that I wasn't making tons of mistakes left, right and centre and was actually having a really good, non-stressful time.  I genuinely thought there was something wrong with me.  He's not in my life anymore and, 2 years on, I'm still recovering from his abuse of me.

Can you imagine having kids with someone like this?  Don't risk it."
"&gt; he's even tied her shoes(I don't know why this bothers me) 

It bothers you because outside of a pregnant woman, it's the kind of weird/cute thing people do to flirt.

I'd be upset,

No you aren't just being insecure.  This is all the beginning stages of an emotional affair."

"Yep! I’m also ADHD and lurve me some fidgety phone apps.

"&gt;Imagine if she were to randomly dye her hair blonde the day of the wedding.

But it's not dying her hair, it's taking off her glasses. More akin to taking off a wig so she can look like herself as she sees her. 

&gt;Obviously, the decision is hers, but she won't even listen to my reasoning.

Does listening mean agreeing? Because it sounds like she hears what you're saying and disagrees. She wants to get married without her glasses, to be in wedding pictures without her glasses. Who cares whether her mom and sister agree with you, this is about her and she wants to not wear her damn glasses at her wedding. Stop pushing this. 





"
"&gt; And if he continues to be dismissive then what? 

This is an issue that I'm seeing more now in our relationship. He is generally respectful and listens but sometimes, particularly now in this moment where he's at his high stress job, he isn't listening. It's not an excuse, I am merely aware that he's in his business mode and compartmentalizes his other responsibilities until he can sit down and address them. He'll be more receptive tonight once he has a moment to focus on this. I'm pretty sure my phone call must have sounded like ""Hey Brandi has a crush on me and told her friends I'm her boyfriend but I took care of that with the school. You need to talk to her."" so in his mind the immediate issue was resolved and she's just being a kid (which she is, but with potential consequences that are large). I don't think he really thought about it because our exchange was maybe three minutes total."
"ummmmmm. no. not the guy you want to spend time with. . .

he only wants you until he finds someone better!!!!


He literally told you that.

he's keeping you on the hook. 



end it.  You want someone who wants you! Not a guy who wants to see what's out there THEN settle for you because he didn't find some other girl who would let him treat them like crap, which is how he's treating you!  Don't be so desperate to be in a relationship and let this douche bag play these bullshit games!! Because that's how the relationship will end up. You submissive and him calling the shots...what...a...shitty....way...to...live..life! 

You want a partner not a douche!!

Be strong!"
"Maybe you arrived to pick her up and a kid asked her who you were and why you were there. Rather than explain why her father was dating someone who appeared to be a teen, she made this up on the fly to seem cool. It doesn’t necessarily mean she has any kind of crush on you."
"exactly, he's avoiding all the risk by throwing the risk on his partner? not cool."
"I think your husband is likely being irrational. Maybe a midlife crisis or something.
Honestly be glad he actually asked you and didn’t do anything because it probably means he does love you.
I’m getting the “I’m going to look back on this in a year and cringe” vibe from what your husband is doing.
I’d talk to him how you have felt about it since."

"I wouldnt jump straight to dementia.

My FIL talked for years about paying my husband back the 28k he gave them to help pay for his youngest brother's schooling. His other brothers did not have to contribute for various reasons. We didnt really expect the money but he kept insisting we would see it one day. Many witnesses to these conversations. 

The day came for us to move out of the apartment they owned and we asked about the money (as they were selling their house and mentioned giving us a portion of the sales). Suddenly it was all ""I never said that"" and ""you misunderstood what i was saying"".

It was utterly ridiculous. He just didn't think we would ever actually ask for the money."
"When layoffs start happening, a lot of the remaining people will be shopping for new jobs.  You won't be the only person jumping ship in the near future."
"Open communication and honesty for the win! I am always surprised by how well it works out when I do that, when it is extremely obviously the right course of action. 

Jason and I talked last night and apparently he is also annoyed with how long his friend stays at our place a lot, but he does not know how to tell him to go home without being rude. But once I expressed how it made me feel he said he will start saying something now. I have no problem with being blunt and I will say something too if this happens again soon. 

It turns out we both don’t like spending time with people for more than a night or 12 hours, except for each other. We even came up with secret phrases to say when we are tired of being with company so we can make excuses to leave. 

I’m happy I was honest. This was such an easy fix. Thanks to everyone who commented you gave me the confidence to bring it up. "

"&gt;  because he won’t let me have my own

This is already a huge red flag in my eyes before the lying comes in, you shouldn't 'not be allowed' to do things just because he said so - especially if he's doing it himself.

"Sometimes people need to be told things.  What you say makes perfect sense, and it would help your friend to hear it (just need space, still want to be friends).  Or maybe you and her make plans to do things with just the two of you in the meantime.  George might be able to move past it quickly if the relationship was as casual as it sounded, or when he gets a new GF.  "
"Trust me, I get being pretty has its problems but come on.... attractive people in general are treated far better in society and if you can’t find someone who loves you for you, then it really IS your personality. I say this as a girl who’s been called pretty/gorgeous/beautiful many times. Pretty sucks in certain ways but no ones gonna trade it for average/ugly looks lol"
"When I told my eight year old daughter we were divorcing, she was thankful. "
"Have you considered suggesting couples counseling instead? This issue does seem to be stemming largely from him, but it’s also possible something that you are doing that you are unaware of has caused him to change his behavior in response - talking this out in couple’s counseling would allow him to see how much this affects you, and would also enable you to see any ways that you may be unintentionally causing this behavior, if that’s the case. Also I think it is easier to accept a partner coming to you and saying “I think we have a problem - let’s work together to fix it” than it is to accept “I think we have a problem - you need to go to counseling and fix it”"

"I think society places too much emphasis on sex being ""successful"" (and therefore, the person is a good lover) only if their partner climaxes - and only if they're the one who makes their partner climax.  There's no focus on being present anymore, and everyone's so depressed and anxious and self-loathing (or partner-loathing) because someone along the way didn't cum.  It's sad!  Sex should be about stress-relief, not adding more stress!"
"I proposed to my girlfriend three weeks ago after touring the downtown core of my home city right at sundown from a neighboring island we took a ferry to get to. It was picturesque and I had promised some beautiful photos of the iconic skyline, and she kept taking shots with her phone while I was on bended knee.

I must have asked her a few times before finally saying ""baby put your phone away, I need you to turn around now""!"
"""Hug for her, roll for you!"" "

"I don’t want to be the guy that tells you to break up with her, but I see some problems here in my opinion.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with talking to an ex. Sometimes you date someone, it just doesn’t work out, you see each other more as friends, and just move along. I’ve had that happen. I’m still friends (not really close, but I’d still consider her a friend anyway) with an ex because we were friends, tried dating, and it just didn’t work. 

There wasn’t a fight, no broken hearts, none of that. We just realized our relationship wasn’t a good idea. We’re both married, our spouses know, and it’s not a big deal. Same goes for my wife. She has a guy friend that she tried dating 15-16 years ago, and they were just better off friends.

This would be totally different if my wife told me “when you talk to ____, that makes me really uncomfortable.” I’d stop immediately. I wouldn’t want her to even have one ounce of doubt that I’d be unfaithful.

If you’ve told your girlfriend multiple times that her talking to her ex makes you uncomfortable, then that’s just disrespectful towards you. "
"Em, sorry: your wife and gf are the same person or two? O_o"
BS reason. I am diabetic and don't get nosebleeds daily. He's either doing drugs of some sort or picking it heavily.
"&gt;he finally confessed recently that he wouldn't feel totally comfortable and trusting with me unless we had PiV sex.

That is straight up BULLSHIT.

Yeah, because you were coerced into unwanted sex!

&gt;I've talked to him but I don't want him to feel like a bad guy. 

He IS a bad guy!!!"
"Yeah I dated this exact kind of asshole for 5 years. Ignored boundaries, didn't listen to me when I voiced my feelings, dismissed me and told me I just clearly couldn't handle a joke. He's hitting on your friends and sister? Honestly run before you marry him"
"I know. And like I mentioned in my post, he apparently can't clean with chemicals because it will make his nose bleed. He claims most things cause his nose to bleed. He blames diabetes, his mood, if we spray any kind of thing with a scent, and apparently he is allergic to this certain kind of pizza sauce at a nice pizza place, so when he eats it it makes his nose bleed... he's delusional lol "
"Well, I don't really know if there's a great time for a break-up conversation, period. But...she knows she wants kids, and she thinks you're just *lying* to her about not wanting them?"

Yes, because she knows she's guilty and she's trying to get you to move on."
"I mean, my husband and I do not ever do each other’s laundry.  We also don’t threaten to piss on each other’s laundry either.  “I only do my own laundry” is fine, in my book.  “I only do my own laundry, and I’m going to threaten and belittle you in the process” is not fine, at all.  The division of laundry is not the problem here."
"I think this is a case of he was shocked you ""caught"" him and he blurted out something without thinking.  That's infinitely more plausible than him not thinking that you're unattractive and he needs it as a crutch.

Real question:  How's your self esteem nowadays?  Are you really mad at your husband and what he said, or did it trigger an insecurity that you've been battling yourself?"
"&gt; thinks his 25 lbs weight loss has turned him into Thor

This is a perfect way to describe his vibe. His attitude is unlikely to take him far in the dating world. "
"On a practical level, my hubs would use every single dish in the kitchen until they were dirty and leave them everywhere.

So I fucking got rid of them.

Childish? Yeah, maybe, but if I'm the one washing all the dishes, I'm not wasting my entire evening.

Good luck."

"Two things.  I don't think that your brother is in a state where he should be seeing his ex fiance.

Secondly, I think you are being a little harsh on someone who was 24 and had her fiance suffer a traumatic brain injury.  It's 11 years later and your brother is still a ghost of who he was.  She wants to see him because she loved him and despite what you think she has been suffering too.  

I saw in another post you say you don't give a damn about her feelings.  Have you ever received any therapy?  You lost your mom at a young age and have now being caring for your brother for 11 years.  That has to be tough on anyone.  Does your life revolve around caring for your brother?  Are you mad at his ex-fiance because she went out to live her life and you haven't?  At some point you need to do the same.

"OP, I just want to drop in here because a lot of the people here are horribly misinformed and giving bad advice.

The main thing you need to understand is that oral herpes, or as it's more commonly called, cold sores, is *no big deal*. Anywhere between 60%(among the wealthy) to 95%(among the poor) have it. The vast majority don't know they have it because it has little to no symptoms. Your boyfriend almost certainly didn't mention it because he didn't realize he had anything.

Oral herpes is different from genital herpes."

"There was an episode of Hoarders where a woman hoarded primarily food.

It sounds like OP’s wife is heading in that direction. "
"Major cause for concern. Hell, I'd be concerned if my girlfriend even remained friends with someone who constantly cheated, because who wants to interact with a toxic, disloyal person unless they're also toxic and disloyal?

Your girlfriend is not only condoning shitty behavior, she's enabling and encouraging it. She talks like someone who has done this before herself. I'd tread with extreme caution if I were you, and I recommend calling her out on it."

Edit. I could contact them yeah. You think it's actually a mental problem? Nothing like this has ever happened during his mental health struggles before, those were pretty much the opposite of this."

This are actions YOU are taking to get closer to coworker and are bordering on an emotional affair.

I feel bad for your fiance. You don't mention anything you like about this person your supposedly love.

Honestly I feel like you should show her this post so she knows the type of guy she's marrying.

If you're going to be this easily swayed by a girl you've only known for a short while (who is already in a relationship) and neglect your fiancee, maybe you shouldn't be getting married to her. "

He *is* going to drink again.
"For anyone else who couldn't remember what FOMO is: Fear Of Missing Out.

I also wonder where he found the time to be looking for someone else if they spent nearly every night together for 2 months. There's no way he was actually going on dates with that kind of schedule, so it's not like he has actual people he's juggling while trying to figure out which one fits him best, which I would understand as long as he was up front about it. He's just continually window-shopping."
Why does he consistently make this “joke”? Is he trying to get you to stop using condoms?
"I'll mull that tip over. I don't scream. I don't even sound intimidating while screaming. I usually save that for myself. 

---------------------------------------
Does he put me down? Yes, but as a joke. I've learned that he doesn't really mean it when he says I'm edgy. It's just a description.

Does he put pressure on me to behave a certain way? Well before he didn't, but now hell yeah he does, but only with the communication bit 

Which is kind of important

So my judgement is a bit bluured there


Do I feel unsafe with him? Yes sometimes, and I've told him that, but he says he does all he can to make sure I don't feel uneasy around him

It used to work, but he used to get upset when I deny him *cough* The Sex™

Also I can't just say no to sex, I have to provide a sexual alternative

(I also considered this point to be a factor in ending a relationship if it became too much)


--------------------
Therefore, I must ditch this relationship 

Hmmmm 
This is valuable information, thank you
I'll have to process it a little more before my brain decides to accept or reject this line of thought"
"Personally, I'd go along with hubby's plan until you have citizenship. Play the long game here. Use that time getting back into the workforce, socking money away, all that. Then get out on your own terms, with the ability to stay in the same country and co-parent there. (Not that his threats should be the deciding factor, but I'm guessing a lot of his commitment to fighting for custody will fall off once you can split and still live close enough for realistic joint custody arrangements, too)."

"Your post is very...scattered, but I think it boils down to three related, yet separate issues.

**Your BF watches a lot of porn**

He certainly watches more porn, and jerks off more, than the average male, especially for his age. I'm not sure it's *inherently* a problem though, since you say you two still have a very healthy sex life.

But in general, he's very clearly stated that he would not reduce his porn habits. So if the *amount* he watches/jerks is a dealbreaker, time to move on. If it's not, you need to stop bothering him about it (specifically, the *amount* he watches).

**Your BF pushes your clearly-stated boundaries around discretion**.

You don't want to see his jerking-prep toilet paper rolls. You don't want to hear him talk about how many times he jerked in a day, or what he jerked to. You *especially* don't want him telling you that he jerks to women ""that remind him of you"".

You need to sit him down and make this boundary 100% clear. What he's doing is incredibly rude and disrespectful. If he wants to discretely watch a lot of porn, whatever - but forcing that part of his life, that you aren't comfortable with, onto you...it's rude and gross.

Personally, *that* would be my dealbreaker, moreso than the amount he's watching.

**Your personal sense of self-worth is tied to your BF's porn habits**

&gt; Every time I see it, I feel inadequate, it makes me want go to the gym more, work out harder, get may hair done sexier, get my nails done hotter, ( I pay for those) so other men can notice me.

Reread that sentence. Reread it again.

Your entire sense of self-worth and adequacy is being demolished by the sight of a toilet paper roll.

Does your BF need to start showing you some basic respect and dignity by handling his porn habits with discretion? Definitely. Would it be overall healthier and better for you to get out of this relationship? Most likely.

But regardless of how the other stuff shakes out, *please* consider therapy. It should help you realize that your BF's porn habits, are *not about you*. How much he watches porn, is *not* tied to how attractive he finds you. No matter how much you go to the gym or get your hair done, it won't affect his porn choices.

It's worrying that just knowing he watches a lot of porn, is enough to drive you to such extreme lengths of personal improvement to try and ""fix it"". I think it's time for you to rebuild your own sense of self-worth and dignity, outside of your BF (whether or not you stay with him)."
"You should probably put this in your OP, it gives perspective on how Monica actually acted and the severity of her behavior. What’s in your OP could be read as a girl desperately trying to defend herself, but this gives a different read on the situation imo. "
"You're going to hurt her and you're probably going to lose her. That's just the reality of the situation here. You need to make amends with that and pull this trigger. Like, this weekend. It's exceptionally cruel, immature and selfish of you to deprive her of the relationship she deserves. She's 20. She'll get over you.

There's no magic combination of words you can say to make this better for her. Real life doesn't work like TV. This isn't season 1 of Girls.

It's totally okay to be gay. It's totally not okay to use this poor girl as a beard. Don't blame yourself for not realizing this sooner, but now that you do know you have to act."
"As a reminder, even if you’re married it’s always ok to break up to get out of an abusive situation. I’m so happy you’re out of those circumstances :) hope things are looking up! "
Tell everyone. His behavior is not okay and everyone needs to know that. He's going to try and make himself out to be the victim and tarnish your name but you have to get the truth out there. Don't worry about getting in trouble for having pepper spray at school. Obviously it's needed for safety. And even if you got in minor trouble for having pepper spray at school it will be quick and over with while this guy's lies and talking bad on your name can last all year if you let it. He sounds like a sexual predator and that type of behavior can't be tolerated. Speak up. You're the victim here.
That's some pretty heavy and deeply rooted distrust she has to automatically assume you're hiding something from her because you have a work phone. That her reaction was so immediate and followed with a ridiculous ultimatum makes her sound too immature to understand the seriousness of the demands of your job and the sensitivity of your client's information. That alone would be a deal breaker for me.
"I'm gonna go against the grain and say that you should tell your friend and try to do something sexual with him. If the feeling of lust continues, then you should continue doing sexual stuff with him to see how it goes.

Sometimes we fall in love with people who aren't conventionally attractive. Sometimes that evolves into really intense, but perplexing, sexual attraction that we don't entirely want or understand. You already know he's into you, so honestly, I don't know how you think a friendship is going to stay the same if it doesn't turn romantic. The friendship as it existed before is dead. You might as well go with what you're feeling right now and save yourself some regret down the line.

If the attraction dissipates the minute you touch him, you have your answer. You can prepare him for this by saying something along the lines of,

""I think I'm developing feelings for you, but I don't know for sure. Do you think we can (insert sexual activity here) and see if this turns into more?"" This can be something as simple as kissing or something as intense as fucking. Depends on your speed.

If the attraction doesn't dissipate the moment you touch him or do something sexual with him, you're probably falling in love with him, and you just have some weird issues with conventional attractiveness that you need to work out alone and/or with a therapist. Mazel tov.

For my part: I primarily date women and genuinely love the feminine form, but ended up falling in love with a man. I don't know if we're going to work things out (we've hit a bit of an impasse for a variety of reasons), but I am genuinely attracted to him, I am in love with him, we've been together for four years, and if we work this out we'll probably end up getting married. It's just, sometimes I look at his body and go ""ewwwwwwww"" inside, even though I also want to do weird, sexual things with that body. It's a strange, perplexing place to be, and I sympathize."
"Well what is it that you need? Do you need a separation? Do you need to scream at him? Do you need him to stop feeling this and realize what an idiot he’s being? No matter how realistic the need may be, it might be helpful to write them out so you have a better understanding of what you’re feeling and you can articulate what it is that you legitimately need. 

Also, endless hugs and support because I’m so sorry you’re going through this and I wish I could give you a hug for real. And then a big bowl of ice cream and a warm blanket. 💜"
"I'm pretty certain for me that I need regular nonsexy physical time with my SO to feel connected in a way that gets me horny; I absolutely could not be separated for four months and then suddenly jump into bed. A lot of connection for me is built up with affectionate touching and doing fun activities physically together.

Additionally I find that if I get busy and don't have sex/masturbate, etc, my body kind of forgets how fun it is, and it can be hard to get me going again : P

tldr; I think this is totally normal (if not what you hoped for!). Try not to stress about it, and use this reaction to plan his/your next visit accouting for a day or two sex-free but romantic things to reconnect. Experiment with ways to keep the spark alive while separated. Long distance is hard, and you can absolutely find lots of internet advice on how to manage it. Good luck!"
"HOLY SHIT! a reasonable response that's top voted? i'd wait to reveal the fact OP knows about the lion painting. ask him about why it went from something small hidden to big and all over his body. and what's the meaning of the lions.  this is to test his honesty.

Yep. I was a bit hung up on an ex when I met my husband but as soon as I fell in love with the now husband I realized what an idiot the ex was and all my previous feelings for him disappeared 
He seems emotionally unavailable. He drops an I love you that early but no relationship? Red flag. 
"You shouldn't be comforting him for him kissing another woman.  
He should have been more concerned about the emotional impact on you and not his feelings about the whole situation.  The ""I did a bad thing against you, so fawn over me"" is so... yuck."
"Society is full of the idea that having kids is the natural, assumed progress of someone's life, so it's not really surprising to me that a teenager would assume that at some point it would 'click' and they'd start wanting children. "
"I'd be cautious of definitively saying that from the very little information we have. It's certainly a possibility, among several others that folks have mentioned (ADD, social crutch, learned habit, etc), and warrants further investigation. But addiction is a diagnosis that might be a big leap from our starting point."
"100000000000000% on her really.  OP was incredibly gracious.

If anything it’s the current GF that could be sketched out. “Hey babe could you leave and help me make it look like you don’t exist for my ex, who will be sleeping here?  Thanks!”"
It's her boyfriends brother! Give it a few years and he will be family. Of course she is going to be kicked out of the group. 
"Why is the timing weird ? She's looking up birth control before her appointment ? She mentioned it 3 months ago anyway . 

Maybe her doctor mentioned last time to think about it if you guys are planning to have kids . The weird hotel thing happened MONTHS ago so aside from the helpful info that she may have cheated it isn't super related. If she just cheated on you she'd be wanting emergency contraception or plan B.

That being said , I think you're tiptoeing around too much . Just tell her you were worried about the sudden Dr request and saw she googled that , she gave you access to her accounts anyway . Ask her what's up . Use your bullshit radar . 

Just as an aside , every time one of my friends talks about their miserable periods I always say stuff like ""seriously look into pills!! They help so much ! "" So there have been numerous times that my friends have spontaneously googled birth control while we get coffee or something. A frequent conversation is ""I don't even know how to get something like that my doctor will think it's weird if I suddenly bring it up"" lol . I'm also 26 so people my age still are kind of clueless about it. It may be something completely innocent combined with her mentioning it 3 months prior anyway "
Or easier to explain to her friends. 
"When I was younger, probably from ages 10-14, I used to yell at my parents that they should just get a divorce already when they were doing their frequent screaming matches.   


They ended up divorcing when I was 17. I was thankful. My little brother (8 at the time) did not take it that well. He has problems in his current relationship (19 with a baby with a crazy lady), and he says he doesn't remember the divorce. But knowing how my parents fought and watching how my brother fights with his woman makes me think they should have divorced much sooner, before he soaked up all that terrible behavior."
Thank you. I hope I can do this

"I missed your first post, but went back to read it before reading this one. 

My honest to goodness opinion from your first post was the sex was the only, cliche to say, ""love language"" he could speak to you in his current state. He wanted your company, even though he wasn't very good company, and the sex was to say ""I love and appreciate you"". I was so scared to come read the update because all I could think was ""I hope they don't break up because they aren't speaking the same 'language' right now"". 

Happy to see things worked themselves out. Never be afraid to have an honest convo about what you need, he needs, and how either of you can show it best. "
"My boyfriend and I are in a similar situation (college, home for the summer LDR). We too have different desires when it comes to how often to talk. I wish he would text more and want to talk a lot, and he doesn't. Often when I reach out he's with friends or busy with something else. Long distance is hard and it can really hurt when you want to talk and your partner doesn't, because it feels like a rejection.

Since she's sensitive about this you have to be careful with how you word things. My boyfriend used the word ""clingy"". Don't do that. Express to her that you miss her, you love spending time with her, and you love hearing her voice, but that the random phone calls often interrupt your day and your routines. Tell her you know it's hard to be apart, but that you are trying to still have a good summer and it's becoming stressful to keep up with the level of communication she wants.

See if you guys can come up with some sort of system. Like find days/times when you know it will be convenient to talk and see if she's willing to limit it to those times so you aren't ambushed. "
"&gt;Unsanitary, yes. But CPS has no time to investigate every unsanitary home.  If it turns into a health issue, (ie: rat infestation or a serious mold problem) then CPS may want to check it out...but lack of sheets and some dirty diapers thrown around wouldn't phase a CPS worker.  Locking the the child outside (even with multiple people watching her) while she screams and refusing her access to her mother, however...

I think he just doesn’t realize sex can be great without orgasming, particularly for women, and therefore he sees orgasming as a hurdle to get over before he can fully enjoy himself without feeling pressure or feeling like he orgasmed too early. "
"This is more often true when it’s the abuse victim doing the calling. Not necessarily a bystander.

Even so, it alerts the victim to the fact that *some*one notices what’s going on in their house, and that that someone thinks it’s wrong. It can also stop an attack in progress and allow the victim time to calm the abuser or to get somewhere safer. Even if she’s not ready to leave yet, it can make *one* day a little less frightening, and start the gears turning in her head. Having fights so bad that the police show up can be the first clue for an abuse victim that what’s happening to them isn’t normal. "
"Yeah I always cry when I get angry, and I won't lie, I felt myself getting upset and flustered, but I still did say what I wanted to say. I want to feel proud.. but just not yet. Maybe a few days later lol."
"Why are you so desperate to hang out with this predator? Are you hoping that he dates you next?

It's pretty disgusting that you think him raping your friend is a joke."
"I can totally see your point. Honesty is a good policy in general ***when dealing with reasonable people***. It doesn't sound like OP's parents are likely to be reasonable. Their narrow view of what are ""acceptable"" college majors for little sis is a prime example of that.

Placating unreasonable people who you do not have the option to cut out of your life (like OP and sister cannot cut out their parents without losing access to their younger brother) is unfortunately occasionally necessary.

It's a crummy situation to be in, but if placating their unreasonable parents for now is the way to maintain access to their younger brother until he reaches adulthood, that might be the necessary course of action.

One of the big life lessons I had to learn for myself was there is no benefit to dealing with unreasonable people by trying to be reasonable.  It doesn't matter how honest, rational, or right OP and his sister could be with their parents if the parents refuse to see reason and hold the keys to access to their younger brother."
I love that! I just cried for so long that he ended up asking again cause I hadn't answered. 
"How about we break this down to the things that actually affect you. Some positives:

&gt; that it's actually given us a new thing to do together. He actually helps me more in the kitchen now, we go grocery shopping together, and we meal plan

&gt; He isn't asking me to go vegan with him. He certainly seems to feel better after switching to more healthy and conscientious foods. I'm more than happy to try new recipes.

And the issues (again... that actually realistically affect you)

&gt; because he gets hangry and then I have to deal with the pouting and sulking.

&gt; Being healthy isn't easy, nor cheap. I can't even cook with butter anymore!

&gt; Now, we spend entirely too much on groceries

Unless you're celebrating the positives or trying to work through the issues then everything else is just judgment, bias and quite frankly a waste of time to think about.

"He’s a successful engineer, he just does improv for fun....but in the last few weeks he highly prioritized it. It’s so shitty. I went to pick up my things from his house while he was at work and I did the thing I never thought I would do: I looked on his computer. I saw that he had been messaging a girl from OKC for the last month and the timelines would match up with our texts where he would send me a text, send her one, and send me another one. When I confronted him about it, he just blocked me on everything. He knows what I’m going through. How can someone be this cruel?? He accused me of having borderline twice when I would bring up things he was upset withz

I’m seeing a therapist because I feel like after everything this was my fault and I pushed him away. He was always talking about building our future together, I don’t understand how someone could flip like that.

It literally feels like I’m having an out of body experience and I can’t even spend time with my mom because I’m too embarrassed and hurt to tell her and she always asks about him "
"In that case, it sounds to me like she may be regretful or jealous of her own issues with alcohol addiction and the fact that you have maintained sobriety for a good amount of time.  It sounds like your boyfriend is making good progress with the amount of time that he has sober now.   

I'd try to address her concerns directly once and then just flat out say, hey Mom, I'm finding it difficult to keep in contact because I feel like this is all we talk about.  Is there anything I can do to make you feel differently? No, ok then you need to understand this is my relationship and I am pursuing it, as well as my studies and career with a level head.  Thanks.  

I'd also suggest continuing to pay towards the money you owe even if she says no.  That way it's not hanging over your head. "
"Could have also been a false negative for the earlier test for either partner, and it's been latent in their system all this time since before they got together. It can be fairly asymptomatic for a long period of time."
"So he can't move to your preferred city for *two years* because he hates it there, but it's okay for you to stay in your current city *forever* even though you hate it?"
"I agree with this. Not every partner is controlling. While her office mates might understand since they hang out with her all the time, not everyone would get it and it's the boyfriend that's at risk, not her."
"I saw the age difference in the subject heading and was instantly like, ""Well, I have a pretty good idea how this is going to go."" And I was right.

Your husband sounds like he's projecting his own sketchy behavior onto you because he is *at best* having inappropriate conversations with other women. If he hasn't actually cheated, it sure sounds like he's tempted to/thinks about it, and so he's assuming his urges must apply to you, too. So he reads guilt into your every interaction with other men.

I honestly don't know how to begin fixing a situation like that, because I'm not convinced it's fixable. I suppose you could tell him what you found and insist on marital counseling, but if he refuses then you'll have to choose between either leaving or staying stuck in an unhappy and quite probably unfaithful relationship."

"He’s full of shit.

I’m very introverted and my boyfriend is very social. It works fine. If he wants to go out and I want to stay in, he can go see friends or we’ll compromise by going out and not staying out too late. Your ex is full of shit. He thought he could do better without you and better than you. He left you as soon as you wouldn’t dish out money for him. He stayed with you to use you financially. You’re so much better off!"
"As someone slightly older than you, most of the guys I have met who are your age and would describe themselves this way tend to have difficulty focusing on other people's lives. They will be the kind of person with whom you could have a lively debate about healthcare, but who might not care about the story behind how you ended up in crutches. There is nothing wrong with that, and I do not know enough about you to know if that description fits you, but most people I have met (men and women alike) want a partner who will show an interest in them as well as in the world. "
"6 weeks and he's acting like this? No, no, no. He doesn't see you as a person at all. When my husband and I started dating, one thing he would always express was how much he loved spending time together, that sex was just a bonus. Your guy's idea of what a relationship is, is havin a sex toy at his beck and call, not having an actual connection with the person he chooses to be with "
"If you had ""done nothing"" in the same way, would he be cool with it? His excuse is bullshit. Anger is just one more way that cheaters try to deflect attention away from their behavior by putting you on the defensive."
I mean you are kind of being a snob. If you really love him then this shouldn't matter. But I get that you have to adjust. If I were you I'd wear simpler clothes around his familyand try to fit in without losing who you really are. 
"This!!! It took a almost year for our deepest issues to start coming out. We had little things here and there before the year mark, but nothing that ever made me consider breaking up until after. "
"&gt;how do I address her past “mooching” without hurting her feelings (she suffers from depression and tends to internalize any critique)? 

Not hurting her feelings should not be your priority here.  Of course you should consider this when you confront her, but it seems her feelings will get hurt no matter how you phrase it, and that's okay.  You need to start standing up for yourself.  It's going to be awkward, but it's very clear Lynn is not going to stop on her own.

"Instead of asking the general question of is she ‘the one’ you need to ask yourself if you can see yourself growing old together. Have you discussed kids and the future and what that looks like together? Do those long term ideas line up? Are you willing to take care of her when she’s ill, and would she do the same for you? You need to look into what ‘the one’ means to you, it’s different for everyone. "
"When you were 18, you had a child with someone.  Then when you were 20, you got involved with a woman who is 23 years older and are planning to marry her.  

Where are you and your daughter living right now?

I think both you and your sister need to grow up."
"You've tried being direct and that didn't work. Now, you could try calling him out every time it happens and reminding him of your conversation, gently at first. ""Boyfriend, are you sure you want to come on this walk? It'll be at least 30 minutes."" If he still insists then complains 5 minutes into the walk, ""I'm going to finish this walk with pupper. See you at home."" Or if he insisted on accompanying you instead of your friends, invite your friends. 

Basically, don't let him change your plans. Once there are consequences for his whining, he might let up. That is if you still want to stay with this guy... it's not good that this has happened multiple times, even after you talked to him. He either doesn't listen or doesn't care.

My theory: when he offers to accompany you, he feels like a good boyfriend. Merely promising you that gives him gratification; he feels no need to consider your feelings during the actual outing because his good deed has already been done. "
"Yeah I’m not pregnant, just crazy (I’m a highly sensitive person apparently), and I’m someone who cries over everything! Literally cried once already this morning in the shower at just the thought of hurting a loved one’s feelings when they are already feeling bad. I’m constantly afraid to be seen as manipulative because of it but I swear, I can’t control it, if someone is bothering me and I hit a nerve within myself then I’m a sobbing mess. 

That being said, if something is bothering me, I try to do something about it. Sitting on Facebook all day while your three year old has the run of the house is definitely going to make you feel helpless about your situation because you’re not doing anything to fix it, pregnant or not. Crying every time she’s told that something she’s doing can’t continue or where she was negligent, cannot fly. At the very least, a conversation needs to be had regardless of the crying, so I like what was said higher in the thread and what you said as well about telling her calmly to pull herself together so they can talk, or talk through the tears. I think it would work for me personally so hopefully it would work for OP too."
"I had an ex tell me something similar to this. We were talking about love and he was like ""Of course I'll never love you like I loved her.""

Now I'm married. To a man who *does* love me that way. And he (the ex) sends me random messages asking how I am. 

The overall point is not that my ex couldn't love that way again-it's that he chose not to/didn't love me that way. Don't ever gloss over people when they are showing you who they are. It doesn't make them bad. But if their desires do not align with yours you are only hurting yourself."
"I made the mistake once of being silent and submissive in a relationship and once I finally left I knew I could never do it again. It made me scared to speak my mind again, but I know eventually I’ll find someone who respects that instead of punishes me for it!"

YES. This is the ONLY way to deal with depression. You have to decide that your illness is your enemy and you are gonna fight it to the death. Every day it wins is a day it gets closer to killing you. Get out of bed. Make yourself get out of bed. Get your pride involved.

"&gt; we're definitely at the stage where it's strange that they don't come to my birthdays or anything

I don't want to sound mean, and I mentioned in another comment on this post that I'm autistic myself. However ...

Did you grow up somewhat ""sheltered"" by your parents? Like, did they maybe make sure to ""shame/beg"" the parents of your former classmates in school to make them attend some of your social parties? That's not unheard of for parents of autistic children to do (and I think it's crap that does more harm then good).

Likewise, did you go to therapy (aba, for example) that involved people from your school? 

You somehow got it in your head that acquaintances are friends, and I don't understand why. I wonder if someone in your earlier life encouraged this. "
"Yep, he's either done it or he's really close. The separation thing was the nail in the coffin - he expected a different response and had so much on the line with the other person that he tried to push for separation. "

"Just send him one last text that says “I no longer wish to hang out anymore” and then block him on everything and make sure to let good friends know so he can’t track you second-hand through their social media.

You could just block him without saying anything, but I feel like that might make him feel he has license to “find out if you’re ok” or “try to figure out what’s wrong”."
I’m guessing mom makes demands and he jumps. Look how he accepts her saying she won’t accept help if it’s from his wife. It’s her power game and he jumps to it. 
"&gt;""Here dad, have my money, please go make me more money"".

"I am sorry, but I don't think you do get my point right now. I think you will, but probably not in the moment.

You're still too young, by a decade, to fully grasp the gravity of a grown man in his mid-late twenties coercing a child who is hardly a teen into sex. It's always a crime, it's always wrong, and if I were your brother I would hospitalize him for it. 

For context, my sisters are eight and nine years younger than I am. If one of my friends had raped my teenage sister I would have slaughtered them."
"Honestly, I could never be with someone again after hearing him say what he did. What a huge betrayal. I would not be able to get over this, and I don't think any amount of therapy will be able to help me get over the idea that my husband wanted to fuck other women"
You probably didn't know how it will all go down with the timelines when you applied for the other position even though you might knew the NGO will crumble. So it's noble of you to consider giving your notice without actually having the other job but it would be unwise for you. Like you presented it you giving notice will still save someone else's job it will just need new planning. So just do what's best for yourself. And it's not fake planning until you actually have the offer on the table.
"Thank you for writing that out, it actually means quite a bit to know that this isn't an opinion only I hold out of anger from her actions.

I live about a 4 hour drive away from her, and this is the first summer since I was 18 that I've not been working due to getting a month off before my new job contract starts, so have been able to go on a family holiday. Won't be hard to limit the time and money I spend with her in the future.

To be honest £120 is eatable, but it's more about the relationship damage this kind of thing does. I don't want her thinking this kind of thing is okay, and I especially don't want her to get away with similar things with my sister once she starts earning."

Godspeed."
"Yeah, I used to play solitaire in college classes. I don't even LIKE solitaire, and it wasn't a way to check out of classwork--I found the lectures in my major genuinely fascinating. It's just that as someone with ADHD I found that something mindless but hands-on like that took up just the perfect amount of mental slack to prevent me hardcore daydreaming or ending up on reddit or whatever.

Later I took up embroidery and that was even better because I got something productive or if it as well. Ran a whole goddamn ADHD fueled Etsy store while maintaining a 3.9+ GPA.

To be honest, even the title of this set off my ADHD radar, and the part about it helping her focus seems absolutely key to the whole thing. But it also doesn't mean that it's okay as-is. If it is caused by something like that, there are a huge range of options from going to a doctor and seeing what can be done there all the way to picking up a less diverting diversion like a handicraft. Something like knitting might keep her head in the game just as well without coming across as nearly so rude--a good compromise to my mind."
And what's a relationship without trust?

"Talk to your lawyer and see what they advise as far as making sure your son isn't around this crap.

No, you are not being dramatic. It is a big deal that your ex is turning your (small?) child into a bully and is acting out violently around him, especially because kids tend to model what a parent does and you may start having trouble with him at school this year if his dad is constantly being physical and aggressive when he's around."

"Did they kick you out because they found something they don't agree with? Drugs, thought you were doing something inappropriate with one of your sisters, suspect you to be gay? I'm just grasping at straws here."
"You keep saying that these things are something you need to work on. Well here's your chance. You don't work on things by ignoring them, or putting your head in the sand, or apologizing to someone who hurt you because it's just easier that way. That's not working on yourself. That's completely avoiding the issue and making the same mistakes you made before.

So I'm going to tell you exactly how you work on this issue, right now.

Firstly, you do not apologize. Right now. Make a deal with yourself. No more ""I'm sorrys"" will leave your lips. Because every time you apologize for something you didn't do, you are actively destroying your relationship, as well as your self-respect. You don't get to say ""I'll just say I'm sorry this one time, to smooth things over for now,  and *then* I'll actively work on it."" Nope. You actively work on it NOW. Do NOT apologize. 

Secondly, you don't talk to your boyfriend until he apologizes to you. Because he owes you an apology, for being a terrible boyfriend. His possessiveness is not okay. It is not normal. It is unhealthy, and it's hurting your relationship. If you tolerate this Behavior, you are actively contributing to your unhealthy relationship, and you're not working on anything. You're allowing another abusive situation to continue. It's one of those things where 5 years from now, you'll look back, and say ""I can't believe I let myself into another abusive situation. I'm going to have to actively work on that."" The time to ""actively work on that"" is NOW!! Why are you waiting for things to get horrible before you're willing to work on things? Work on it right now! Don't wait another minute. Be willing to break up with someone who mistreats you like this!

""Oh but hes nice sometimes and I love him and when he's not possessive and controlling and playing games with my emotions he's SUCH a great listener..."" Save it. Just save it. Everyone says that about their abuser. They're all nice, and sweet, and kind, and kind to animals, and compassionate, and great listeners, until they're playing with your emotions, or punching your face, or telling you what to wear, or emotionally withholding.

You have a choice. Be with a guy who pulls that kind of bullshit, and keep coming to Reddit to cry for the next 8 months about why he's not a better person, or break up with him and be with someone who treats you well."
OP needs to reach out to others to get away from her abuser. Abusers are most dangerous when their victim tries to leave. 
"Oh yes, the kids of sleeping in piles of vomit, there's dog shit on the floor, and piss in their toys, the children urinate on their sheetless bed nightly, and the children punch each other in the genitals, the car has caught on fire with the children in it due to lack of maintenance, and another child was almost run over when he ran in the street while his father was occupied with his screens, but the REAL assholes are those who are judgmental about it!!! Don't judge mommies!!!!!!!!"

"Honestly I don't think there's anything you can say to put their mind at ease. If you try too hard, they might think you're over-compensating, trying to hide the ""real"" story. It's really more on your GF to convey this, but I think there will be the same issues, that they'll worry she's ""covering"" for you. I think you both just need to say what happened, you can mention how bad you feel, and then let it go. The only thing that will ""prove"" the truth to them is time. Over time (given her history, we're probably talking years, honestly) they will see how you treat her, and how she responds to you (if she acts relaxed around you, not ""on edge"" all the time, etc), and they will observe for themselves the lack of ""drama"" in your relationship. Now that something like this has happened, it will probably greatly lengthen the amount of time it takes them to trust you, so that's unfortunate. You're just going to have to be patient.

You're kind of in a tough position. You don't want to seem like you don't care, like you're heartless. But you don't want to seem like you're trying too hard, because they'll think you're covering, or being insincere, you know? And they might be more skeptical of you now, possibly even make an occasional comment or dig at you, and you won't like it, and you'll wonder if you just let it go, is that confirming in their minds that they were right, or if you defend yourself, will that use that to ""prove"" you have anger problems. I don't know what the right way to handle that part of it is."

"This guy has no respect for you at all. In addition to that, it's clear that getting fit has gone to his head. To speak plainly, he feels like he now has access to ""hotter"" women than you and is (unfairly and unrealistically) resentful that you haven't devoted 200% of your time and energy into becoming the Hot Babe he feels he is entitled to. Now he wants out so he can pursue those other women. I say let the jerk go--you can then focus on your actual *health* and not just matching your appearance to someone's demands. You can also focus on finding a guy who is attracted to you, not just attracted to the idea of dating a fitter version of you. "
"My friend had a huge Indian wedding a couple of years ago. Her dad told her he could afford it but he actually borrowed the money from her aunts. When they realised he was broke they started calling the bride, screaming at her that she owes them. She started her married life under huge amounts of stress. Those same aunts don't understand why she doesn't have kids yet.

My point is, does your cousin know about this? I know it's all about face but would she want to start married life with the humiliation of knowing her poor cousin paid for it? 

Anyway. Don't give them the money and re-evaluate just how much being in touch with them matters to you, seeing as you only seem to have worth to them when you have something they want.

"So in addition to you paying his way, he wants you to put your credit on the line as well on the chance that he becomes a famous enough author to live off his novels? That is so incredible selfish and if he's unable to see that on his own, I don't know what on earth will open his eyes other than you moving out and letting him figure out how to pay for his own lifestyle on his future hypothetical earnings."
"It was more than 10 years ago, so it all turned out ok in the end!  I (now) suspect he had schizophrenia because he seemed delusional and disorganized. For example, he wore the same clothes every day and they were inappropriate for the weather. He wore a purple winter cap, a big heavy green jacket, boots, and carried a red umbrella. Even when it was relatively warm and not raining (stalking began in January but we live in Texas).  And he was obviously delusional because he stalked me for three semesters, believing I was his girlfriend, after a casual hello in the hallway. I don’t know what happened to him. He eventually just disappeared and I moved on. 

I never wished him ill because even though I was scared at the time I could tell he was very sick. He really needed help. But I was also scared and didn’t know what to do besides call the cops. 

He may have just been a normal kid whose parents sent him to college and the stress triggered schizophrenia or some other mental illness.  Now that I’m older, I have more clarity and concern for his wellbeing. For example, I realize now that a lot of kids don’t become symptomatic for a lot of disorders until college age, so he was probably just a young man who was away from his family and was suffering from a horrible mental illness and needed an intervention. 

He was a student, so perhaps his immediate family didn’t realize what was happening for a while and then intervened when they did. 

I hope he eventually got the help he needed. "

But that also you are upset that she wasn't there for you and informed you so late. That you would prefer her to be more honest with you about what she expects to be able to do. "

"Copying and pasting to a couple other main comments before calling his parents.


Ohhh my god....I was able to look at what he's been writing once he fell asleep, which was only at five AM. I have never read something so utterly, completely, nonsensical.

This document was OVER 500 PAGES. That was just the first document, he had SIX of these saved on his desktop. He started a new one whenever Word got too glitchy! He's written so much he ran out of room in word, I didn't even know that was possible!!

There was no plot. No logical connection between one sentence and another. I can't even barely describe what it was ABOUT because there was so much gibberish. Ever seen any of those surrealist art-films that are a phantasmagoria of images loosely held together by some reoccuring themes? This book was that just in language form. And those films are meant to be like that, this book he'd been talking about like it was an actual novel. He has no idea what he's actually written.

Recurring themes were ""the stars whispering."" A lot about holes, portals and secret entrances. A lot of reference to himself as the holder of secrets and knowledge. References to other beings (aliens, gods, hell if I know) that do mysterious things. There was a catalogue of what seemed like every animal he could think of in one of the documents, where he listed a bunch of nonsense words after it and gave it a ""ranking"" which was followed by a couple letters or numbers. Sometimes he wrote about things he has no actual knowledge of like complex math things and physics. It was all bullshit. Sometimes he'd repeat words over and over. There were several pages of just the word ""hands""! His spacing was all over the place, sometimes there were blocks of text other times lots of space between single phrases, and everything in between.

I skimmed a lot of this looking for anything that made sense. Sometimes he'd get close, at least the sentence structure was readable but the ideas were just...gibberish. Free association? It was less understandable than a dream sequence. 

I'm having a very hard time explaining exactly what I saw because it defied all linguistic conventions, so I can't really use those conventions to describe it. 

I have avoided him so far today. Something's obviously wrong, people mentioned manic episode and bipolar, it must be something like that. He's never done anything like this before. I don't recognize him in any of this.

So this isn't about how to make him get a job anymore but how to make him get help. He's unwilling to leave the house usually (always writing) so good luck to me even convincing him to get in the car and then going to a hospital.

Will be calling his parents in a minute. After that, god only knows. I probably need to take off work tomorrow. I don't know. Thank you so much to everyone who was advising. I'll try to keep up with comments but well, you know what's going on if I don't."

"Mom telling kid to go to hell because they're gay? Sounds abusive to me. 

&gt;only time you need to cut yourself out is if they are abusing you.

Looks like OP is cutting them out! Good riddance to bad rubbish.


&gt;out of a group of generally miserable people could lead them to be more miserable

Look up the words 'not my fucking problem'. "
"When I was in an abusive relationship, although felt guilted for staying in it, my sister told me: ""Look, you're not married to her. It's not actually wrong to break up with her.""

I realized she was right. I broke it off a day later. "
"Yeah, to me the issue isn’t that they have different criteria for ethics, but that he considers it somehow ethical to put her down for such little things.  "
I think this is really the only answer. Just keep doing your best and everything will fall into place with time.
"Also, if you get a divorce, you should probably still find a therapist. "
"This is really good advice. But also be aware that many STDs are difficult to test for, or have incubation periods, etc. "
"&gt;They're not racists, generally speaking, but they're also around 70 so they're not perfect or completely ""woke"" either.

I have this issue with some members of my family. They seem to think that as long as they don't *actively* or *obviously* 'hate' people of colour then it doesn't count as racism. But if you are willing to (in the case of my family) use ethnic slurs to 'jokingly' refer to ethnic minorities, or, (in the case of yours) retain racist objects despite being told by people of colour that these items are a problem, then they are racist."
Loooool accurate. Can’t afford marriage counselling? How about a baby instead?!
"I think the fact that you guys had sex together (I am assuming from your description that it’s enjoyable sex) while fantasizing means that you guys are just fine.

Yes, role playing seems to be the way to go. And yes, it really will scratch the itch, you’ve been scratching it already! Find some literature on role playing. Pretend to be two sexy professors stuck at a conference. Pretend to be a sexy boss. Just go with whatever gets you guys going.

I would just caution you against role playing explicitly as people you know IRL. It’s very disrespectful to that person, and it’s almost guaranteed to create insecurities and jealousy. It’s much better to create composite characters that borrow from people you find hot."
"&gt;  So is it normal for her to get texts and ignore them?

She normally doesn't keep her phone near her when I'm around. She'll leave it in the other room most of the time.

&gt;  is it normal for these to come late at night?

Thinking more about it. It does seem like she is receiving more texts at night. If I get up to go into the kitchen / other room, where her phone is, there will be the notification light blinking. 

&gt; Is it normal for her to seem nervous about receiving them?
No. And I don't know if her nervousness was on how I was going to react or if she was nervous because she is up to something.

I'll just ask her tonight when I see her.
"
"I think it’s valid to be angry at a woman who is clearly racist. While the phrase may not be the softest, what about the people who have to see her blatant racism on a daily basis? "
She's either too shy/cowardly to break up with you or is trying to in an awkward way.

"&gt; she had been leading me on for the whole length of our relationship (5 years now)

She was not ""leading you on."" She was a TEENAGER. She was growing up.  Just let this ""she was leading me, an innocent victim on, oh the manipulation"" stuff go. 

When I was her age, I was vehemently childfree, and then in my early thirties I changed my mind and had a baby at 34. People change their minds as they grow and evolve. It doesn't mean anyone was plotting and actively deceiving you. 
"
Why are you with someone who can't be self-sufficient?
"His ""plans""  were to put activities for the two of you on hold and wait around until she got herself together enough to actually do something.   That wasn't okay and you were completely justified in not agreeing to waste any of your limited time that way.

When/if there is another opportunity to meet her, plan an alternate activity that will allow her to slip in at her convenience without preventing you from doing something you want to do. "
"It's very common in age gap relationships that start when one partner is in their teens to early 20s for that partner to eventually outgrow the relationship/other partner. The two people are just at fundamentally different life stages, even if there's nothing else problematic involved. That's the risk you take when you chase after 18 year olds when you're 35+ tbh.

That said I don't condone cheating. You need to break up with him. Staying with someone to spare their feelings does neither of you any favours. Would you want a partner who stayed with you out of guilt despite not really being in love with you? Both of you deserve better. It's better you leave now than you wait longer and end up more trapped e.g. with a kid or marriage. "
"To add some context, he's moved around a lot (not always job-motivated, but only ever once he's got one lined up), and I think he badly wants to feel 'settled' somewhere. So when we've been talking about a potential move back west, it's with some sense of permanence in mind. To me, this means it should be a bit easier to contemplate moving there without a job figured out - it's a long-term decision we'd be making together, and he could take some time to find the right position somewhere, while I make enough for us to live comfortably on one salary in the meantime.

He's generally supportive of my career, understanding of late nights or occasionally hours on the weekend when things are very busy, because he knows I value it so much. He's more of a '9-to-5, just give me an interesting enough mid-level job' type of guy, which makes his attitude so surprising to me. "
"Your husband sounds awful. You need someone who sees your marriage as a partnership. Household chores should be 50/50. Imagine having a baby with this guy and, he literally won’t help you pick something up when you physically can’t? Or when a baby is physically there he isn’t a team player and just doesn’t help out? What a night mare. You need to have an honest sit down, or do counseling on this matter because, he is not going to change he’s way at 32 very easily. "
"This is really strange behavior on his part. I cannot ever think of a time when my husband was like ""yeah, I'm not assisting you with anything because I don't think I should."" That's not a partner. 

He actually removed your clothes from the machine. He removed your clothes. 

Maybe you two fundamentally disagree on how to run a household. But if it's this detrimental to you then maybe realize there are bigger issues going on here?

FTR, he sounds like a total ass. And I don't generally say that about people I don't know."
He's got some contempt simmering away under the surface.
"You're not wrong. A lot of older-younger type relationships, regardless of orientation, can be very predatory. I don't believe mine is, but I'm wearing the rose-tinted glasses of being happy in our relationship.

Without cracking open my diary and dirty laundry, we didn't enter in a relationship with the intent of even being boyfriends. We started casually dating and things grew from there (and this is the first year I've had extensive contact with his kids. I've always been present for family events with my now fiance, but he was very guarded and very particular about having any love interest introduced to them). I don't want it to seem like I was some 23 year old who swooped in and inserted himself into a family situation. Everything happened slowly over time and I think we're both kind of surprised but pleased with the outcome.

Every relationship has its pros and cons and, at the moment, my SO has been a really positive influence in having me come in to my own. It's not all sunshine and roses, but it's not all rain clouds either."
"My sib got BC pills not to actually prevent accidental babies but because of the side benefits like: no more periods, better acne/skin, and again, no more periods.

At some point, it's possible she just got sick of bleeding out every month and wants to use BC to stop her cycle.

Or maybe she's now frightened of getting raped by a coworker and having an accidental pregnancy.

Anyway she probably needs therapy."
"I didn't even think of the possible complications, my god. Even if the pregnancy and delivery was all smooth sailing (I was lucky with only morning sickness), you have things like stitches, PPD, breastfeeding issues... tons of very real, common enough things that are hard on any woman. Even with supportive people around! I've heard C-seconds are a nightmare to heal from.


I'm a bit sick at the thought, really. "
"I just want to mention that if he's like this for your wedding... he'll be like this in other aspects of your life, too.

We get posts here all day long about women whose husband's refuse to help out around the house- begging, pleading, cajoling, adult conversations, yelling... none of it ever works. Then they feel resentful, they are no longer attracted to their partner, and by that point the relationship is DOA.

I want you to think about housework. Is it equal, or are you ""in charge"" and he'll kind of sort of help if you ask but never takes initiative? 

Postponing the wedding is an incredible idea, *but only if you can resolve this issue.*  If this is an ingrained personality thing where you are seeing it in other areas of life as well, you may as well break it off because that road leads straight to divorce anyway. 

ETA: I see that you've been having division of labor issues as well. I recommend reading ""The Politics of Housework"" and ""She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink."" These are two very brief but life-changing reads on the fact that housework IS a big deal. I think, after reading them, it will reframe your perspective on spending the rest of your life with someone who can't be bothered to look after the house like an adult."
"You don’t owe them an explanation. It’s very easy for men, who have no fear of personal injury walking alone at night, to say a twenty year old woman should have squared up to a homophobic stranger in the dark. "
"Speaking of blowing through cash...OP, did you say your wife spent $2000 on a PURSE? You need to have a come to Jesus talk with her about money and spending habits. There's no way spending a sizable percentage of your fun money on a single accessory for her alone should be okay unless this was going to be her one and only purchase for a couple years."
If you needed to get advice about dissolving a contract that impacted every aspect of your life from the money in the bank to your retirement accounts...would you hire a lawyer? Well that's exactly what a divorce is. Going it alone is only naive to the horrors that a bitter spouse can pull (mine delayed the divorce by a year with his antics).
Thanks. It seems like it's normal! 
"From a man's point of view, cute and sexy can both be accurate at the same time. Don't think he's saying you're *just* cute. Listen to his behavior and see that he's excited to get intimate with you and trust that he finds you sexually attractive. "
Have you ever heard of bisexuality? 
I have literally never heard of people gaining trust through penetration. Generally you have sex because you do trust them! He's bullshitting you.
"Op, my husband forgets things all the time. He often leaves the hot appliances on after using them, and I have to turn them off. He's always sorry, and he does his best to remember.

Through it all, I don't demean him or tell him that he is stupid for it, or threaten to piss on his belongings. I knew when I married him that he has a tendency to be absent-minded, and that's okay. He has so many strengths in other areas. 


You know, funny enough, as much as I worry about him setting the house on the fire, the only one who's ever had an accident that resulted in one- was me. I was trying to multi-task, putting laundry away and heating some grease on the stove to cook with. The grease hit it's flashpoint and caught my rangehood on fire. Fortunately, I was able to put the fire out, but the kitchen was a total mess, and I felt so, so moronic. 

Do you know how my husband reacted when he came home? He didn't say I deserved it, or I was an idiot, or scold me at all. He held me tight and told me he was glad that I was okay, and that stuff was just stuff and we could fix the range-hood. And then, even after he had just worked 10 hrs and was very tired, he helped me clean up the mess I had made putting out the fire. 


As others have said, it seems like you could possibly be in an abusive relationship. You and your husband should be a team. You work together. It is abhorrent that he would threaten to piss on his family's clothing. Even if you feel like you deserve it, what has your daughter done to deserve having her clothes urinated on?"
It sounds like it's just her go to metaphor for being frustrated or angry with somebody. She obviously doesn't actually punch people. It's not a fantasy. It's just an expression.
He ignored you when you were bleeding uncontrollably so he could continue his game. There's something wrong with this guy and if he can't see it and doesn't want to change then you should walk.
"Get a consultation with a good divorce lawyer.  

Your husband has already checked out of the marriage, stop paying his way."
Does his therapist know he’s on the verge of ruining his marriage?
He alsp drives drunk a lot.  This guy needs to be in jail.
"#WHY ARE YOU WITH HIM????

Seriously. It is a miracle he hasn't killed someone else or himself. You've stated yourself that he doesn't plan for the future at all, so sadly I predict that he will seriously hurt someone or himself in a way that he can't bounce back from. Do *not* tether yourself to this sinking ship!

I mean, seriously. I can't see any reason you would stay with him with so many red flags unless you are addicted to trying to 'fix' him. "
Making mistakes is HOW we learn. Sheltering kids has never helped anyone. Good on ya! I wish inhad a brother like yoi when i was 19. They will see you as someone to respect and admire. Youre a good dude!
I would have done the same thing probably. She doesn't sound like the kind of person that would be reconnecting to help him. 
"Congrats on your sobriety. I was asking because it's genuinely not recommended to date within the first few months to a year of your recovery. 

Honestly I can see your mother's point but ultimately it's your relationship. Pay her back the money you owe her so she doesn't have anything to hold over your head, and don't entertain any conversations about her offer to pay for you to move. I don't think she's really making you choose (yet), so I would try to keep your relationship with her even if it's with a bit more distance. You've only been dating for three months and her concerns are valid, if judgmental. "
Glaucoma doesn't get worse with emotional upset. You are blackmailing yourself with what if...because it would be hard at first.  Totally worth it in the long run. I would rather be alone forever than in such an unhappy marriage.  Your husband sounds horrible. He manipulates you by hurting himself if you ever talk about it. Leave this abusive marriage.
"&gt;Not that that doesn't count as cheating, but I feel the distinction is worth making.

Tell his girlfriend what happened, and I very much doubt she'll give a damn about that ""distinction"".

No, he didn't black out.  Yes, it was damage control.  As someone else said, he's a coward.  Why confront him?  You both know what happened and you both are making plans for it to happen again, although I doubt next time will be limited to just making out.  You are both making a deliberate choice to hurt his girlfriend.  Speaking of whom, remember her?  She deserves to know so she can kick you both out of her life.  Instead of acting like a teenager with a schoolgirl crush, you should spend the day thinking about that."
Run away as fast and far as you can; there is nothing but heartache waiting for you with this one. 
"I don't think so. I showed her the figures and how she's waaaay outspending on gourds compared to all our other expenses. She just said ""Oh yeah that's kind of a lot"" but this was a couple weeks ago and nothing's changed. I reminded her again a few days ago and she got upset, and went online to show me stuff she hadn't purchased because she was cutting back. She said I wasn't giving her any credit. It's hard to give credit when she is still spending the same amount!"
"As long as your mother is not classified as a vulnerable adult, and your sister is not a legal guardian of your mother, your mother cannot report her to anyone for negligence. What you can do is encourage your mother to get in home care or move into an assisted living home.

Not sure on the specific laws of officially classifying someone as a vulnerable adult, but I suggest posting this onto r/legaladvice and seeing if there’s anyway you can get your mother under the care of a state guardian. This way she has someone mandated to take care of her along with any legalities.

But legally you’re able to simply leave her in the dust if you don’t give a damn."
"I'm assuming you guys have seperates finances and each put $4k in the vacation fund?

If so, from her perspective, she was saving all her money up for a special treat (the vacation), presumably making some sacrifices to do so, and then something happened and now that vacation is indefinitely postponed and she can't enjoy the money she saved by taking the vacation - so why not use in on a different ""treat""? You need time to save another $3k, so she has time to save another $4k.

From your perspective, you had $8k, an unforeseen and unavoidable event took it down to $5k, and she blew it down to $1k, potentially pushing back when you guys can take this vacation.

I guess whether you should be mad or not depends on her income/saving reliability. If she will definitely have another $4k by the time you have another $3k, then her spending won't actually affect you or the timing of the vacation and assuming you guys have seperates finances, you should probably let it go. If she earns les or is less good at saving, then you should probably have a conversation about how this was a joint savings goal and her actions have impacted you, so she should have discussed it with you."
That’s still really awful! It’s not okay to go to someone else’s wedding unless you make sure that the bride and groom are cool with it. Your MIL clearly has no sense of what’s socially acceptable. You shouldn’t listen to her opinion on anything. 
"I know, but it still hurts so much."
"I would guess, from knowing a lot of LGBTQ+ and Episcopal people, that this is more your boyfriend's internalized Christianity from childhood Church of Christ teachings than anything that the current priest has said.

Dry drowning. A horrible risk of wine drinking and redditing that no one warns you about. 
"She never asked for you to do ANY diet or workout plan. You taking it that far made her think you think she's too fat. Plain and simple as that, apologize and swear you will never be so presumptuous again."
Mhm! OP found her own strength / “magic”. :)
"Unfortunately, all of these problems are caused by your mom and her husband refusing to blend your family’s properly.

The five year old is crying and acting bratty cause he’s freaked out by this completely new situation. A brand new house and people he doesn’t know living in it. No wonder the kid is acting out. 

The fact that your moms husband made her pull you out of school is extremely concerning. It’s clear he doesn’t know how to raise his kids properly. Is he controlling in other ways?

Can you ask your mom to get coffee or something with you? If you can get her alone, I would straight up tell her that you feel like you don’t have a relationship with her anymore. That you feel sad that you feel like you have no one in your corner anymore.

Don’t mention how you don’t consider your step siblings your family. That’s gonna put your mom on the defensive. Use “I” statements. Focus on how you are feeling. 

Good luck, LW. "

"Please do this. You guys don't have kids yet, and stuff like this is almost impossible after kids. Marriage is about sacrifice. You need to do what's right for your future. You spouse should be supporting you not hemming and hawing and dismissing your current unhappiness."
"&gt; Someone they'd drop anyone to be with again

Oh really? So she'd be very understanding, supportive and still willing to marry you if you had one of those too, right? 

Stop for a minute and think, is someone with that attitude and mindset the one you want to be married to? I don't know about you, but personally I value loyalty and a moral compass above all else in a life partner. "
"All I'm saying is he cared more about the sex he was hoping to have in that moment than the fact that you were sad to the point of crying about an item he knew had sentimental value.

A good boyfriend would have comforted you (even if he didn't full understand in the moment). Your boyfriend told you to ""chill the **fuck** out"" instead and dismissed your feelings by saying it was ""just a dress"" (when he knew it was more than ""just a dress."")

Honestly, I think that anybody would be upset to the point of crying if something bad happened to an item they loved. And you only got angry when he proved he didn't give a shit about what he had done (even if it was an accident) or your feelings. He immediately went on the defensive when you only showed sadness, not even aggression or blame.

Yelling may not have been the best reaction (in terms of de-escalating the situation or getting him to understand the significance of what had just happened), but I would have had trouble reacting differently in your place. It's hard to keep it together when someone shows so little empathy for something *they* had done to you, again, even by accident.

It's not hard to comfort your girlfriend after she is upset by a mistake you made. It's not hard to not say ""chill the fuck out."" It's not hard to not minimize how another person's feeling. He failed on all regards because, again, his sexual gratification mattered more to him."
"Most of my reply to her messages were ""I don't know's"" since I really don't know..."
"OP you are so sweet. It's good you're aware of the situation but this sounds like one of those case-by-case things. I've had friends who were both in relationships hang out/play games one on one because they were friends and really liked the game or whatever they were doing. I've also seen dudes be like ""it's😉just😉coffee😉😉😉😉😉""

Be clear though that you aren't interested, however awkward that may be. I responded to someone else's comment with the suggestion of saying ""I'd love to go get that drink with you and gf when she's back in town."" 

Personally I had a guy from school DM me and start asking about the stuff I like to do around here blah blah and my interests and ""nobody around here ever wants to go do these thongs but I think it's cool *you* do"" so I said ""Yeah that park is really great. Maybe your girlfriend would like to go with you sometime."" He got the hint."
"uhhhh wtf, you can't be serious ... even if they aren't abusive directly to you doesn't mean you have to tolerate them being abusive to others."
Kids with zero self esteem and absolutely no boundaries to speak of. Talk about victimization grooming...
"This is 100% not negging. Negging is when people (usually men) give backhanded compliments in the hopes of making their target want to impress them (eg. ""You're actually surprisingly pretty for your age""). What OP's BF is doing is taking issue with how OP is approaching conflicts, and his view is that she should be honest and all things and avoid conflict wherever possible. BF is being condescending and pretty impractical, but it's definitely not negging."
"Nope. Your body, your choice. She should't have married you with the expectation that you would undergo a cosmetic procedure just for her preference. "
"&gt;I don't get why this should be different

I'm bi. It's not. "
He might just be insecure about the age difference and think that's the only way he can date you. Tell him you are interested in more and see how it goes. Honesty is the best policy here.

"Yeah, that's the difference.  Having this racist stuff out of historical fascination is not bad.  I know people who have Nazi military stuff because they are fascinated with World War II.  It's good to remember where we were.  Displaying it in front of your house is different.  That sends a message.  If a museum had Nazi flags decorating the outside as well, it would also send a different message.  It's the difference between historical fascination and reverence."

"This is what addicts do OP. They leech off those around them in order to feed their habit. He will never pay you back in his current state. You need to either leave, or make him acknowledge and confront his addiction."
This was my first thought
"I think he’s got definite FOMO. My ex too would constantly wonder what it would be like to not only sleep with me, to my face. He pined for other women. 

Reality was that he’s almost 30 and women don’t tend to find an almost 30 year old man trying to sleep around very appealing, especially since he’s after 20-24 year olds. Instead of the bounty he expected, he hasn’t gotten a single bite, even for casual sex. "
"OK, here’s a free thing you can do to improve your social skills and anxiety over speaking in public. Join a book club at the library, they provide the book every month. IME, the majority of members will likely be older ladies, like 60+, and it’s a very low pressure environment. It’s OK if you think you will have nothing in common with them, you’re just there to share opinions about a book. You don’t have to think up topics to talk about, the book is what you’re there to talk about. If you don’t want to chat before the meeting you can wear headphones and bury your nose in a book. 

You won’t be forced to speak during the meeting, but it’s good practice to write down your opinion on the book, a few sentences is fine, so you will be prepared to say something. Aim to speak up at least once at every meeting. The leader will ask a lot of questions so there are plenty of chances to voice your opinion. 

You don’t have to like the book, you don’t have to read all of it. I wish I had $1 for every time I heard someone say “I didn’t finish the book” and it was also common for people to admit they only read 20 pages. They showed up to see friends, to get out of the house, for free coffee/tea and snacks, and to pick up the next month’s book. "
"&gt; having the audacity to wear totally normal clothing

I think that might vary by location. A thong in public is in the grey area for some places, and probably pretty unwelcome in some as well. "
"I strongly disagree, he does plan things out, he just doesn't include OP's schedule or feelings into his plans.  That's is a big difference and something that he's made clear he either doesn't want to or doesn't care to correct.  Almost all the cases OP mentioned: family reunion, ""party this weekend"", party he said he'll go to, etc, are just him doing things according to his own schedule with no regard for other people.

If he's just impulsive that's fine, but he clearly just don't give a crap.  It feels like OP is his option, not his partner and he's old enough to know better."
This is not a sign of a loving and healthy relationship. 
"I'm a married man in a 24 year marriage.  My wife hurt me and our marriage for a long time by keeping us in a dead bedroom.  We have recovered and I've learned a few things.  

You need to communicate with your husband more.  You say that you think you might not be satisfying your husband.  Talk to him to find out.

Be enthusiastic.  Almost every time a question is asked to a group of men on what they would like more of in the bedroom enthusiasm is always near the top.  

Initiate sex occasionally.  It's difficult to feel desired if your partner never acts on a desire to have sex with you. 

Do these things and you'll be great. "

I just read the rest of OP's comments.  She is in denial about how much danger she is in.  I'm legitimately scared for her.
"There are trackers on social media? Wow, I am afraid of adding people now."
"Uh, okay, there is no possible way this is the first time he's behaved like this.


Clearly your husband has anger issues. Is there any way you can convince him to address those? Does he realize that this is an issue? Does he admit to a problem?"
"&gt;On top of all of this, she is growing about 20 pot plants in her closet. She spent a lot of money buying lights, equipment and ended up paying thousands for everything. While I personally do not think marijuana is harmful for personal use, I don’t think it’s appropriate for a recovering addict to grow pot in their closet or even focus on that while her kids desperately need attention. I do know that she did consume pot during her pregnancy’s.

There's a REALLY easy way to get the kids out of their custody, obviously, but you have to be prepared for all the consequences, mostly that your sister and her husband would go to jail for a LONG time. If you're ready for that, and if your mom is ready to take custody of the kids, go ahead and pull the trigger."
There are a lot of logistical reasons I'm here. But also he threatens me saying there's no way he'll let me leave.
"From my experience watching other people, you get more face value perks, but most of your interpersonal relationships are actually a mess."
"Take this as a learning experience. 3 year olds are magnets for danger, and you’ve got to constantly be 3 steps ahead of them. I am SO SO glad that you heard, and could respond in time, but your sister is right. Every time you’re alone with him, she’s going to panic that her worst nightmare is happening. Maybe you could come over sometimes when she’s there to maintain the relationship with nephew and you sister, and at some point offer to take him out. Look for another job though, I think this ship has sailed. "
"First things first: find a new church immediately. Who cares if he goes to the pastor this time. Your marriage isn’t working. You’ve learned a valuable message with all of this. Never ignore red flags just to appease your church’a beliefs about “living in sin”. I can’t even tell you the number of young marriages I have seen fail just because they wanted to rush in to be able to live together and have sex without it being a “sin”, which has all lead to divorce 5-10 years later. 

Get the apartment, sign the lease. Don’t tell him. Get a divorce attorney ASAP so you can get advice on how to go about all of this without ruining your credit and finances. I suggest sitting your husband down after you sign the lease, and tell him your moving into an apartment on your own. Tell him you’ve given this marriage a lot of time to change, as well as himself, and your just too different for the marriage to work out, and it’s time to begin divorce proceedings. He’s going to throw a fit, appeal to your religious beliefs, and rationalize monetary costs as a reason to stay. You just have to remind yourself nothing can improve or change the marriage, and it’s time to move on. "
Congrats on the weight loss! Also your sister didn't earn the ticket so she shouldn't be invited it's that easy.
"So what happens when he gets into medical school? I'm a med student with a family, and even then, I only see my husband and daughter (on average) 2hrs every day due to the amount of studying it entails. Are you okay with this becoming your reality? If not, you should leave."
"I spent years and years of my childhood and teenage years training in martial arts and i never, ever hung out with or spoke to the other students outside of the dojo. Not once. So i never talked to them about anything other than taekwondo, since we were always in class together actively doing exercises and stuff.

I see this as pretty normal."
"The WOMANIZER!!! Agree 200% about the magic wand, but had remembered that there was this one toy that....lol. Alas, it *was* the WOMANIZER.

God, I hate this side effect:(. I'm married and have expressed the same about just enjoying sex for what it is. I'd imagine that tons of ppl are in the same exact boat"
"First order of business: Find your dad's credit card. Now find a vet that offers in-home euthanasia. Make an appointment for the vet to come to the house and humanely euthanize your dog, and charge it do your dad's credit card. Your dog is elderly, miserable, in pain, and in an abusive and neglectful environment. You'd be doing a kindness for your dog. If you can't find your dad's credit card or any money, look for animal rescue groups that will come and get your dog. 

Now the second order of business is getting YOU out of a neglectful environment. The way things are now, is that how they were when your mom was around? If she doesn't know how much you are being neglected and how bad things are, tell her. Or call CPS on yourself. You mentioned Facebook, and having a crush, so you having internet access and knowing real people makes these things possible. Take pictures of your living situation, describe how you are treated and neglected, and everything you are told you have to do, and what you can't do, and feel free to tell anyone and everyone you know, as long as you don't think it will jeopardize your safety if your parents and siblings find out.

The reasons are the bigger red flag to me. They explain how she could have gotten an STI. She doesn't bring up ways he could have. She's trying to explain away how she contracted it. She cheated and is looking for an out.

"No. You're grandma will just end up having to evict them, too.  When they ask for your help, say ""Sure, do you have that list of resources I gave you before? No? Here it is again. I hope you find something that works out for you."" You had the right idea with that. THAT is helping, and they couldn't be bothered to even make one fucking phone call, because they don't want to solve their problems - they want someone else to rescue them. If you did that by opening up your grandma's place to them, you'd be enabling, not helping.

Maybe another way you could help is (with your parent's permission) letting them store some of their stuff in your house/garage/shed/wherever. But giving them housing or money won't help them, it will just kick the problem down the road for another little while. You could also look into some budgeting/money management help, like meeting with an advisor, or even just a website or book that talks about the fundamentals of budgeting in a very basic manner."
"She sees me not wanting kids as me making demands of her. She told me that she thought that she thought I could make a really good father and that we could wait and see if I wanted kids in a few years. I told her that that was dangerous for her because I couldn't make any kind of guarantee that my feelings would change.

Just to be clear: I've never said I wanted kids. "

"""Someone who doesn't bleed once a month"" and ""better than a sock"" 

It's not just that he was talking badly about you. It's that what you read revealed that he is a misogynist. So dump him for that.

But for the future, work on your trust issues. You used those trust issues to explain/justify why you snooped, but that's now how it works. Sneaky snooping and surveillance aren't substitutes for trust. Doing those things doesn't do shit for your trust issues. In fact, it makes YOU become the untrustworthy one, violating people's privacy like that. You've become the thing you fear: untrustworthy. So work on that in therapy. That said, your BF is a misogynist jerk, and you should dump him. But don't let that evidence you found be justification for violating the privacy of your next guy."
"I agree with you about OP's mother, but I wonder if these aren't signs of mental health trouble? If he needs help and treatment and this isn't a permanent issue (he's done better in the past), maybe she needs to have a firm talk with him about taking care of himself and seeking help."
"He did great for the first five months before slacking for the next year and a half. 

I think most likely he was on his best behavior until he felt more comfortable in the relationship.  After the honeymoon period was over he didn’t feel the need to be on his best behavior because in his mind he had OP locked down. He was willing to let his “real” slob self out because he thinks OP is too emotionally invested to leave him, and if she tries to break up he brings out the water works to manipulate her into staying or “changes” for a week or two before going back to his slobbish ways. He knows exactly what he’s doing. "
Agreed. I would tell the EX and your sister this as well. You don't want to reset his progress and he needs to be more stable before he can make the decision to talk to her. I think that is a reasonable request.

"Break up with him, you are so afraid to be alone you will put up with being treated like garbage. 

no discussion needed.

""I see you added EX GF back onto snap chat, yep I snooped, I had a bad gut feeling, I will be moving out, leaving, breaking up ect..."" and when/if he tries to argue, or get defensive, you can say "" look, I am doing you a favor, now you can do what you want, I am just not going to stick around for it""

"You want the truth here?

Because your wife is absolutely correct here. You have basically cheated on her emotionally numerous times (You have only been caught 3 times so far). You blatantly went against her wishes even after she has already caught you twice before. You can't hide this behind some ""midlife crisis"" B here. It is time to grow up and quit hiding behind this stupid ""she doesn't pay attention to me"" attitude. Try admitting to your problems, and maybe she'll show some pity on you a 4th time. If you spent half as much time thinking about other women on talking with your wife you probably wouldn't be here."
"How about stopping this bullshit analysis thing (because there are things that you can't reason away) standing up for your wife (because she's your wife) and telling your mother that you're tired of the passive-aggressive swipes and would appreciate it if she would treat your wife with the respect she deserves?

Your mother knows EXACTLY what she's doing."
It sounds like you are considering believing the woman who you definitively know to be a pathological liar.
"You and especially your SO are asses to Jake. She needs to distance herself from him and stop giving him hugs. And certainly stop asking him if he would sleep with her.

In the future, don't ask people about their sexual orientation unless they give clear signs of wanting to talk about it."

She sounds like bully. But, and I have to point it out, like one who still likes you a lot.


I also think she didn't restrain you. I think she saw you were about to have an attack and she just wanted to hold you and be there for you at that moment. It also shows in her following behaviour.


That being said, she could just have a certain manner you don't like, and you have a reason not to have her in yourblife anymore. You put up with enough drama on her side. If you are not willing to tolerate it, you are not willing to tolerate it.


Around your age, a lot of friendships fizzle out or change in nature.


I know you don't owe her anything. But you could tell her calmly (or write an email) that you indeed had some hapoy moments together, but that her attitude at your wedding and her visit was unacceptable and you do not wish to continue this friendship.


Please make a mental note: sometimes, fate brings people back together years later. It's always better to end on a good note.


"
"Dude. You lost me at ""several thousand dollars [for aging chihuahua]...""
Plus she's leaving you behind after all that? ""Nice"" girlfriend you got there. Her priorities are quite fucked.  I would bail on this relationship. "
"I know that it might be hard to admit but your mother is an incredibly toxic and abusive person and you would be better off with her out of your life. 



Looking at other families it might be hard to accept that unlike other kids you don't have a mother. Because that woman is not behaving like a mother towards you or your brother. Giving birth does not make someone a ""mother"". Taking care of and rasing a child does, which is not something she has done. 



I don't know why you are not living with your father, I know Portuguese judges can be unbelievably stupid when making decisions in custody cases, but if you have that choice, it would be the best option for you (or moving in with your brother, though in that case she might force you back home since he does not have custody).


As for the money issue, ask your dad to go to a bank and open a student account for you, I'm pretty sure my dad opened accounts for me and my brother long before we were 18. (At the time Caixa Geral de Depósitos had student accounts with no fees). You will get a debit card and it will be harder for you mother to demand money from you, just say you ""forgot"" to get it from the ATM. 


For now you can also try and avoid her at home as much as possible, go in the library to study, when school starts stay until the last hour and start preparing to move out as soon as possible. Get a job as soon as you are able to work. If you plan on getting a university degree, there are colleges that allow you to work and study (you don't have to attend all the classes). I studied at ISCAP, and a lot of ppl in my class worked to pay tuition. (Don't know how well that works now though, since wages are stagnant and tuitions keep going up).


Bottom line is you need to cut her out of you life as soon as possible (you'll soon be 18 and legally an adult). She will fight it and try to gilt you with the excuse of being your ""mother"". Just remember she never acted like one, she has done nothing but take advantage of you (stealing money form you) and abuse you (forcing your brother to look at her private parts and making sexual jokes with you IS sexual abuse).

"&gt; Do you have any advice about this situation?

Stop talking to the coworker. Stop going out with the coworker. Reinvest the energy you're expending on this into your relationship. Think about how it would make your soon-to-be-wife feel.

You're almost 30. How is it that you have to be told not to do this sort of thing? How is it that you don't realize that your hormones are at *your* mercy and not the other way around?"
"OR the ""brother"" is actually his secret male lover."
"As someone from a traditional Latino family, I guarantee OP’s grandma doesn’t believe it’s a man’s ‘place’ to be doing things like grocery shopping or ::god forbid:: cooking. My adult male cousins have literally never gone grocery shopping for themselves, and no man in my family so much as boiled an egg while they lived under their mother’s roof. My cousins are shocked that they’re having trouble finding a wife who will treat them like the little princes their mommy told them they were. SMH. "
"No. You should not agree. He should
suck it up and get a better job or stop having children he can’t afford."
"As in it’s been worse recently? Because he stood by and continued to subject you to his mother as a child despite continued, predictable unkindness toward you and your sister. Your mom had to step in and end the visits. All he did was what, tell you afterwards that he loved you. Did he ever actually say “This is not okay”? It doesn’t sound like it. I would be very direct here. "
"There is historical significance -- originally the statues were supposed to commemorate Jocko Graves, a 12-year-old boy who was so dedicated to the rebels' cause that he froze to death keeping watch for General Washington's army during the Revolutionary War.  Washington commissioned a statue for his estate called ""The Faithful Groomsman"" in Jocko's honor.   

That said...   


Google the original statue and you will see a dignified, thoughtful boy.  Google these ridiculous lawn ornaments and you will see a racist, Sambo-style, grinning caricature.   


It's almost as if racists cannot imagine courage or nobility in a young black man so they turn his memorial into a joke!  Huh... whoda thunk.  

TL; DR:  yeah, even with the history, those things are racist as *fuck*.  "
Sure. I also think some bisexuals are conditioned to think they're straight when they're not. Compulsory heterosexuality. Both happen all the time. 
"&gt; No ones job skills are so specialized that they can’t work anywhere else.

This isn't realistic. I'm not saying he can't move to be with her but there are plenty of job skills that are specialized that people need to be in certain locations to work. Have you ever heard of the oil industry? The guys who work as rough necks need to work in areas that drill for/pump oil. Not saying this is what OP's husband does, but there are plenty of jobs that are so specialized that he couldn't work somewhere else.

The tech industry is one of the biggest in the U.S. and its confined mostly to densely populated areas and major cities. If she's asking him to move to a smaller college town and he's in high end IT management for a Fortune 500 tech company she'd not only be asking him to commit career suicide by taking whatever tech job he could find there (support for the University or a Hospital, or any company that needed an IT guy) she'd be asking him to take a huge pay cut. "
DUDE they broke into your house. That's a perfectly sane and healthy and correct place to draw the line. 
"All she did was cry at having something she treasured broken - he instantly took the victim role by swearing and getting defensive instead of apologising in a way that’s caring, “oops sorry” is when you accidentally elbow your partner in bed. He could have easily reacted in a way that was caring and apologetic but he starts swearing at her and getting mad after he broke something - accidentally, which is even more reason to be apologetic"
This. She straight up does not respect you. Move on and rip the band aid. 
If I was a woman I'd whip out the gorilla glue
Wait ten days and then tell him that your phone got dropped off a skyscraper and then you had to go out of town and now you’ve had to get a new handset and the old SIM card has only just been glued back together. 
"Stop trying to stop her.  No matter what you do or say, she will continue down this road.  She's already made up her mind about what she wants to do so save yourself the trouble and stay out of her way.  She's not destroying a marriage, the cheating husband did that.  What your sister is doing is more than likely going to spectacularly blow up in her face.  You have to let her find the bottom of this pit she's digging before she will even consider crawling out of it.  It can be incredibly hard to watch someone you care about conduct such self-destructive behavior but in this case you just have to let it play out and be there for her when it inevitably falls apart."
"I agree. I don’t think he brought it up to be malicious, but wanting to sleep with other women so bad he’d separate from his wife after so long together? Godamn.

After bringing up separation, I don’t think I could move on from that. My husband telling me “hey, I wanna have an open relationship, but only for me, because I *chose* not to explore my sexuality when I was younger” is hurtful enough to consider divorce. But my husband suggesting separation on top of that? That is so heartless and would be a divorce for me. He didn’t even suggest exploring other women by threesomes, just jumped right into him having freedom and separation."
"&gt;  I was also told in no uncertain terms that if I went rogue and sat with my boyfriend, then I would be removed from the wedding without a second glance.

This is some next-level bullshit manipulation. Your brother doesn't get to benefit from your bf's freebies and chauffeur service and then pull this asshole move.  Definitely tell him that neither of you will be attending and he can figure out his own decorations and taxi service.  I'll bet that suddenly the seating arrangements will be more accommodating.


Has your brother always been a jerk?

"You know what OP, your parents were being ignorant-and there is NOTHING wrong about being ignorant to a subject, we don't know everyone's deal, HOWEVER, you took the time to research this object and educated them, this crosses the line into WILLFUL ignorance, and quite frankly, point blank racism. 

I would not visit them until its removed, they know what theyre doing-its not like it pays them rent or adds deep value to their lives, and someone WILL call them out on it, don't be around when it happens."
So much is your mindset. I am 54 I have no problems keeping myself entertained nothing exciting but I like being active and my job is high stress. If I was wealthy I might still work for the mental engagement. She probably wishes there were grandbabies running around and it can suck to see your partner age. She can maybe see a future when she has to care for him. But do not make this your problem. Since she IS wealthy she could afford to hire one of those lifecoach people who help with goal setting and identifying things she wants to accomplish that brings pleasure.

I get a shitton of notices blowing up my phone and yeah the odd IM slips through the cracks. And next time I go to respond to you I notice ""oh hey, you asked me something, here let me respond just now that I've noticed.""

Text messages are NOT a real time communication mechanism and if you are relying on it as such, man are you going to be dissapointed. 

** and you know what, even if he did notice your text last night, or maybe in the morning but didn't respond until a lul at work maybe or after work... so what?

He's also not being very considerate in general. He should feel thankful to have someone who respects her half of the cooking duties, not accuse you of playing dumb for making pasta.

I honestly think him not liking your cooking is very far from the real problem here. Cooking even seems like something he has a bit of interest in, yet he says helping you isn't fair for chore separation. Plenty of couples would consider cooking together a fun date idea. Will helping you with anything be seen as a chore for him?

Honestly in your shoes I'd tell him to cook for himself and I'd just cook for myself. If he doesn't respect your cooking then don't cook for him. I'd probably take it further as well and tell him he needs to respect me more."

But he was not that guy with me and I saw who he was with other people and in a very sick and twisted way I came to blame myself whole heartedly for the way he treated me and the things he did to me.

I don't mean it should all be forgotten, but bringing an entire community into it and turning someone into a pariah, is fucked up."
"&gt;He told me he couldn't grieve for somebody he barely knew

"I’ve also been in a relationship like this.  OP, please move on to someone who has more compassion and cares about your comfort.  There are plenty of guys who prioritize this in your age group.  You will be MUCH happier.  Later you will seriously regret giving this guy the time of day. 

PS Update if you feel like sharing more!"
"I'd like to address this:

&gt;How do I tell him that this is a problem without coming off as a mean, naggy girlfriend, and instead a concerned partner??

After reading your post, WHY are you so concerned about being naggy?

I am an employer, and this is like me coming here saying ""My employee regularly shows up hours late, refuses to do the basics of their job, disrespects me in staff meetings, and has started groping and sexually harassing some of his coworkers. It's totally unacceptable and I am furious! How do I reprimand this terrible employee without hurting their feelings or making them feel at all bad in the slightest, because then I'd feel like an awful person and I can't bear the guilt?"" Um, that's called ""being a shitty boss"" and I would fire MYSELF for tolerating that from an employee! 

How on EARTH are you tolerating this, and worse than that, fretting about being perceived as ""naggy""?? YOU'RE worried about what he thinks of YOU? You're worried that he might be upset with YOU? 
 
Why do you have so little respect for yourself that you'll not only put yourself in this awful, unclean, filthy, infested environment, in the presence of his neglected, abused cat, and then worry that HE might be mad at YOU? 

Everyone is saying he needs therapy for his hoarding tendencies. I feel you need therapy for your self-esteem that is so, so low that you feel this is the best you deserve out of a partner. My heart aches for you, and for the cat he abuses. Please, please, can you see a therapist and get help to see this man and this awful relationship through the eyes of reality?"
"Your husband sound like a generally upstanding guy but had a momentary lapse in judgment. Maybe he was ashamed, afraid or embarrassed over the incident and jumped to trying to hide it rather than be truthful. Hard to tell from just a story. You know him best, so you should decide"
"there's a weird culture around weed for some to think that it's perfectly okay to be high 24/7 (I used to be in it) I know a guy who has a daughter he's 27 and smokes like a chimney. I guess because weed doesn't make you puke your guts our like alcohol some think it's perfectly fine to be high all the time. It didn't hit home for me until my family sat me down and said, ""I just miss being around you not high. why can't you enjoy time with us not high?"" made me take a huge look inward. I wasn't fixing the root of my pain and problems I was using weed to self medicate. don't get me wrong if it were legal here, I would probably consider smoking every now and then but to do it all day every day... its a problem. "
"IMO, this goes beyond compatibility issues. You don't have to share all the same interests; he doesn't have to go with you to everything you want to do; you don't always have to stay in with him. But if he complains *anytime* you want to do something that doesn't fall within his very specific preferences, then he's just being a jerk. What kind of a person can't even show minimal interest in the things their SO enjoys, or just grin and bear it *on their goddamn birthday*?

Being in a relationship means sometimes doing things you wouldn't have chosen to do yourself, because it's what  your SO is interested in. If you're an introvert who is coupled with an extrovert, it means going out with their friends at least some of the time, and being a good sport about it. Who knows! You might even like it! If the only things he wants to do are the things that *he* wants to do, then what even is the point of a relationship for either of you?"
"It's not ""picking a fight"" to ask someone to turn down loud music on a bus, send back a dish that's not done properly, or ask someone to move when they are blocking a hallway/pathway.

If someone is literally blocking your path, what are you supposed to do? ""Well shit, hon, guess we can't go home today because there's someone blocking the stairway and I don't want to pick a fight by asking them to move, so I guess we have to get a hotel for the night!"""
Document every time he violates it by calling the police.  
"""Giving in"" to sex isn't having sex, it's assault by coercion. This guy's attitude and behaviours are massive red flags. Break it off with him before you get in too deep and its much harder to escape."
You're Will's backup plan. Of course he doesn't like you dating anyone.

"Because there is no helping her. The reality is that she's choosing between almost certainly ruining her marriage, or almost certainly being unhappy with her professional life. Choosing either over the other comes with serious consequences that she has to consider herself. This is well out of the ""ask strangers on the internet"" pay grade."
"If you told your boyfriend about a consistent pattern of verbally abusive behavior which made you fear for your own safety and he still responded with this...

&gt;""What would you do if we had a heated argument, If I got frustrated and raised my voice? Just up and leave with no attempt to work things out?""

Then there's something deeper going on. Maybe your boyfriend doesn't fully understand you. Or he doesn't think the behavior you described is that bad. Or he wasn't really listening and just focused in on the text message break up. Or anything other than actually understanding what you said. How did he respond to you pointing out that years of verbal abuse =/= having one outlier heated argument?"

"I really don't think you're being unreasonable at all lol, you asked your boyfriend to be careful and he already has an understanding of the dress' sentimental value - but he disregarded that and fucked it anyway. The lack of sympathy is salt in the wound really. "
"Same! I'm usually completely calm as well. 

A lot of commentators are saying that he didn't know any better or that there was no way he knew how delicate the dress was but as I said in the post, I've explained to him MANY times the significance and delicate nature of the dress. 

The worst part is, I've told him before and all he could say was ""It's just a dress"""
"That’s really not better at all. You were a child. I’m on vacation right now with a 16 year old and an almost 20 year old and the difference is massive. Heck, I’m 22 and I cringe at the thought of dating a 20 year old! That’s super hinky, OP.

Edit: how can you say you knew him for years but then also say he didn’t know how much younger you were? Surely that’s something that had to come up in conversation??"
"&gt;Saying that yelling is unacceptable, in and of itself, is the same as saying that crying is unacceptable. 

No, it isn't. You can control yelling, people yell because they let their anger and frustration take over and fall back on domination by volume to take control of the situation instead of remaining in emotional control and focusing on communication. 

Crying is often a physical reaction you can't control at all."
"She's already chosen her ex though, over and over. She's literally told OP to his face that she'd leave him in a heartbeat for her cheating ex, and sees nothing wrong with that. This is unfixable. 

Even if she comes back saying she's ""chosing"" OP now, we know she's just realized she'll probably never get her chance with the ex and is settling for what she can get. Unless she gets her chance later, though. Then all bets are off."
"The thing is, treating one's partner with respect and decency at all times is *not* perfection. It's the minimum acceptable behavior in a healthy relationship. Someone can be an unskilled communicator, or moody, or disappointed, or disagree with you, or anything else ""imperfect"" -- and still be respectful and decent.

If someone is unwilling to be respectful and decent, it's probably because they don't think they should have to be. Therefore, they see no problem. If they feel there is no problem, they will not work on fixing it -- instead, they'll think you're a jerk for suggesting they change behavior they think they are entitled to engage in. "
"Ask them how the statue makes their lives better. Seriously.

Ask them why they feel the need to keep it, even though it causes friction between you guys. To prove how not-racist they are?

"This. There are so many things that are assumed but not explained here. Why is everyone upset that uncle/brother had a baby? 
Is there a religious aspect here and they object to a child out of wedlock?

"I'm sorry that the children you raised are so unkind. It must be very difficult to look at your own child and see that she is self-centered, snobbish, and demanding."
"I think that you could be on the right track, not necessarily cheating (not ruling that out but bear with me) but is at least feeling guilty about her ""friendship"" with this man who is obviously in love with her. It would explain the major overreaction.

Hippocracy breeds resentment, and resentment kills relationship. It sounds like you need to have a good conversation with her about how you are feeling and bring up this other ""friendship"" in blunt terms."
"Thats the thing about choices- they affect everything and poor ones follow you.  At some point,  you chose to try drugs,  which bloomed into an addiction.  I don't know how bad it got for your friends and loved ones,  but if she is putting up a wall and your family is supporting her,  it must have been bad. The only things you can do is to back off and give her the space she asked for,  stop blaming her husband for hating you/pushing you out,  and work on staying sober.  2 years isn't that long,  especially when you relapsed a year ago.
 This is *her* life,  *her* baby,  and that comes first.  Your want to be included is not at the top her priority list.  "

I mean, it just sort of feels like you're incompatible due to different stages of life. As you said, he's probably going to retire soon, but you'll be working a while. What are you going to do once he retires and gets to go on trips all the time while you work? "
Yep there is no way I would want to have a child with her.
"damn right he does. all these comments have made me realize how he's being incredibly insensitive and half of these might even be slightly intentional.

Do you want to bone this guy?
"I went to lunch with a friend at a place called Moon Crickets and when I got home, my husband said he couldn’t believe I’d eat at a racist place like that. I was utterly confused until he showed me that “moon cricket” was an old slur for slaves because many would sing at night when gathered together, being all noisy and keeping the white folk awake. I was horrified!  I dropped in the next day just to see if the owner understand that interpretation and turns out she did, but believed it was an “affectionate” (and of course historical!) term that slave masters used. I figured that was plenty of reason never to go there again. "
"You kind of buried the lead here. Your friend was sexually assaulted by this guy. Until I read that part I could have chalked it up to him being sexually inexperienced and socially awkward, but now it seems like he was kind of manipulative."
"Fuuuuuuuuuuuck that.

She is absolutely projecting. It's a classic cheater move to project your own misdeeds onto your partner. She says she thinks you'd fuck other girls because SHE would fuck other guys. You try to broach the subject of her bullshit actions, and she deflects, making it about you. 

She's gone so far as to have accounts on dating sites. That's super sketchy and there is no way to explain that one away (does she know you know about her OkCupid account?). There's no easy way to say it - but if she hasn't already or isn't currently cheating on you, she probably will. The warning signs are all there. And as the spouse, you always know, deep down, what is going on. 

Women tell other women this all the time, and men don't hear it enough imo: you deserve to feel heard, be happy and valued. You say you want to make her happy, but you deserve happiness too. Do her actions make you happy? Do you feel valued by your spouse? I'm not telling you to DTMFA, but you guys need to have some real talk.  "

That's a good idea actually. I'll make her that offer when she's old enough to be thinking about personal finance. She just turned 13 so it'll probably be two or three years from now.
"I am really sorry your mother hit you.
In my opinion, you have two options here.
If you want peace now, you can just apologize, but keep in mind that in doing so, you are affirming your mother’s world view that she can never do anything in wrong. In the long term, if you are conflict avoidant, you will eventually have to go no-contact, as your mother is abusive and dangerous and your life and well being is worth more than that. 
Honestly OP, this is what I would choose were I you. Your post history does not spell out healthy long term relationship.

However, you seem to be asking for an alternative.
If you want to continue to have a long term relationship with your mother, you are going to need to start setting boundaries. I don’t have the experience that others do in these matters, but I would suggest having a serious conversation where you tell her how you feel and apologizing for what you personally feel was wrong (not necessarily all of the things she says were wrong) but also point out that you are no longer comfortable with and will not tolerate abuse, and start explicitly stating what you expect from her as a fellow adult if she wants to continue having a relationship with you.

Fixing a relationship this unhealthy is really hard work, but I certainly would not fault you for trying. You won’t be the first.

Whatever you decide, I wish you the best and hope that college treats you well."
"Would it be different if it was a $500 Amazon gift card?

Maybe you can explain to your parents that the cash is equivalent to a gift card but the in-laws are old school.
( $500 is not that much if you leave $100-250 presents.)

I understand both sides, but hope you can convince your parents that the money was not given with malicious intent.  Good luck and update us!"
"He's the one lying by omission by getting a visible tattoo of art his ex made for him after vaguely claiming he was going to get something small and subtle without any explanation of what the design would be or why he chose it. Asking him to explain the meaning of his tattoo without setting up the question beforehand isn't lying by omission, it's giving him a chance to tell the full story behind his tattoo without injecting any bias or accusations beforehand. 

It's better to ask him to explain the whole story without bias and wait to ask for clarification about where the ex's painting fits in as a follow up question. Starting off by giving him the chance to explain the full story is a bigger act of trust than starting off by accusing him of getting this tattoo specifically because of his ex. For all we know, the ex may have been recreating an artwork that had significance to him in his childhood. We don't have the full picture here and I think it's hasty to assume he is tattooing this because of his ex just because that's the only significance his fiancee knows that it has."
Especially since OP said she’d done this with other guys before. 
"&gt; Last time I met a girl on instagram she dropped me after making her a  song saying she's a horrible person and I deserve someone better than  her... 

Had to read this a couple of times before realizing that you made a song, then she was talking about herself. It read like you made a song telling her she's a horrible person... to which I had some pretty good advice (""Don't tell people they're horrible people!""). 

It sounds like you're meeting and interacting with these girls online or through social media, not primarily in person. Social media makes meeting people easy, but it also makes ending interactions incredibly simple too. It's the nature of the platform unfortunately. Yes, it sucks to suddenly be ghosted online when you felt you had a good rapport, but it happens all the time and often has nothing to do with you personally. The only thing you wrote that seems a bit much was writing a song for someone, but that can be seen as romantic and she said it was her own issues and not you, so... chin up. Just keep putting yourself out there and you'll get bites. You might also want to take a closer look at people who are actually in your life physically, as it's a lot easier to get close when you interact in person, and a lot less likely someone will up and disappear.

Just give it time and don't stress too much!

"Here is something I hope might give you some hope. 

My wealthy grandparents enabled my uncle, who is similar to your sister, for decades. He worked dead end end jobs, lived at their house, stole from them, raging alcoholic, in with the worst crowd around. Your sister may not have all those attributes and it sounds like she’s had a hard life, but enabling is enabling no matter the person or problems. 

There was nothing my tiny family could really do until my grandfather died, my grandma was declared incompetent, and my dad got power of attorney and handled the finances. Now, my uncle can no longer be enabled. My dad doesn’t give him a cent. Like your in-laws, we have set up a trust fund for him, but that’s it. Hard because they are brothers, but tough love is still love. 

He actually has found employment now and is doing well with his alcoholism; he’s been sober for a while. And he was a BAD case. Now that the burden is on him to pave his own way in life, things are beginning to look up for him. 

Do not give your sister any more money. Mot a penny. If she gives you a sob story or begs, you have to remain firm. You will only enable her further by even giving her tiny amounts, even a dollar. 

Please take this from someone who spent 22 years of her life dealing with this. I know it’s tough, but so far the “tough love” has worked for my Uncle, and I am confident that it will work for your sister too. Best wishes for this all to work out.

"Definitely not saying there weren't adults rooming together previously (my mum was one of such!) - but it seems like groups of twenty and thirty somethings established in their careers living together is a little new? Many of us, had we been born in a different era, might have spouses, children, mortgages right now - totally aware that this reflects my own social circle and isn't universal though, of course!"
"She is a cake eater.She wants your permission to sleep around but you aren’t allowed the same freedom.
Whether she is straight,bi or gay you need to let her know you want loyalty in your relationship otherwise you need to move on."
How ridiculous. It's something you are passionate about and good at. Who cares if it's cool to others. You clearly love the game. It's not affecting your school work so I see no reason to give it up. She clearly doesn't support you and what you want. Go with what makes you happy
"Don't do this. Playing matchmaker rarely works, and in this case it might get very awkward. Your best bet is going for a platonic friendship instead of a relationship, if she's down for that, and then introduce her as a friend to your roommate. "
Thats not it. This girl doesnt think shes done anything wrong and instead of talking about it they are avoiding her. If they eventually let her back in but never talk about it she will not change.

"My boyfriend is drop dead beautiful and the reason him and I worked so well is that even though he's gorgeous as hell I have always had the same expectations as I've had with any other person I've been with. He had to adjust to a lot of things in our relationship because he realized stuff like not putting effort into special events, etc..  did not sit well with me. I think he got a pass a lot because chicks were and have mostly been interested in him for his looks."
"Wow!  Is it possible she has tried to reach out to you to be a friend and maybe you didn't realize it at the time, and maybe she took this as confirmation you have an issue with her?  idk, that's the only thing I can think of besides that girl is bat shit crazy. hah"
"Think about it like sex. You had sex, it was great, it was great for everyone. 

Then your partner leaves cash on the dresser. 

&amp;nbsp;

See what just happened to your feelings about the sex? Now, instead of leaving cash, your partner left a piece of jewelry, flowers, or similar gift. Objectively, it shouldn't be different - a few hundred dollars cash or earrings that cost a few hundred dollars. But it still does - one of those things is a transaction, and the other is a gift. 

"
From the sounds of his reaction to her previous attempt to leave - this will be far from the most amicable divorce ever. OP is deluding herself if she thinks she can just neatly separate from a man who has been using her as a bangmaid. 
I took the mcat and I studied nearly all day for a month. Idk how you guys pulled off working full time on top of that.
Absolutely not. There’s no way I’d let a 16yr old take my shitty Ford Explorer to a school dance much less a sports car. 
"Dude if you didn’t cheat then it was her. That’s why she hasn’t brought it up again, she knows it wasn’t you. "
"So...couple of things. Congrats on meeting your first narcissist. Hes always been one, but going to law school, earning better money, and having what appears to be a fully functional life is just making it more noticeable. In terms of this brewery blowout, altough he knows your tight on money, he likely has no idea exactly how tight that is, as he isnt in that position himself to relate. Technicially, you were the one who decided to go to an expensive event, buy him an olive branch beer. No one made you do this, you decided to do this yourself, knowing it would tighten your finances further. He doesnt sound like a guy who ever really could understand and appreciate the notion of buying him a beer as an olive branch, but you did try.

A lot of his actions seem like fancy ways to compensate for his own concerns and fears of seeming not as successful and put together. It also isnt helping that hes surrounded by idiots like this all day long to absorb their behavior characteristics.

Ultimately, its up to you if this is enough to terminate the friendship."
"Perfectly put. OP is making this entirely about her or his feelings about her, when it might be entirely about the husband and his own biology. Sounds like their communication generally is lacking. "
y'all should probably kick him out of the friend group
OP is 20 years old. Her granma has NO business barging in to the examination room with her. Thats just rude and controlling.  It would never occur to my elderly mother to attend my teen daughter's appointment.  She would have waited in the waiting room.

"I had this exact same problem with my ex's mother. I butted heads with her constantly because she just simply could not resist bossing me around (well not just me, bossing everyone in the family around...even her toddler grandchildren were her personal team of foot and back massagers *shudder*). I argued with her, tried to point out her shitty behavior, told her no a million times...literally nothing worked, if anything, it made her *more* bossy, naggy, entitled, and demanding. It was driving me insane because she was living with us at the time. 


So, I would hear an endless stream of commands every minute she was awake... 

""I want blueberry pancakes this morning...those plain ones you made the other day were AWfUL""

""You have to drive me to Walmart right now because my photos are ready""

""You need to change my bedsheets, and put a thicker blanket on this time""

...you get the point. ENDLESS. FUCKING. DEMANDS.


I finally realized that so long as she and I were near each other, she wouldn't stop bossing me around and would relentlessly follow me around until I obeyed her command. So, I started training her to realize that as soon as she would command me to do something, I would leave. Like, I grab my keys, walk out the door and drive off. It was a pain, but after a month she learned she couldn't boss me around anymore. Our conversations were now always some variety of this:

MIL: ""You have to take me to my sister's house so I can get that dresser from her. You'll have to bring your handcart because you know I can't lift anything that heavy with my bad back...""

Me: ""Oh darn, I wish you had told me earlier...I already have plans to visit my friend today. Hope you can find someone to help you on such short notice! Sorry!"" (grab keys and head out quickly)


Basically, no matter what she wanted, I *always* had plans. I always said it with a smile and a ""ooh shoot, wish I could have helped you!"". It was also nice to get out of the house and just spend my days doing whatever I wanted. It pissed her off to no end when she realized she had absolutely no power over me and it ""ruined"" our relationship in that since I was no longer playing by her rules, I became useless to her...which showed me that we never really had a relationship in the first place. 


When my ex finally wondered why I was always out of the house, he realized ""My mom needs to find her own place to live"". He was just so used to her treating everyone like her personal servants and never thought it was a big deal.


So yeah, unfortunately it is impossible to change someone else. There are no magic words that can adjust someone's core personality. The only option you have is to remove yourself from the situation, or accept it and live with it. I highly recommend spending your days elsewhere...it's so, so, so awesome to have hours to yourself, spending your time doing all the things you enjoy."

"But he doesn't change for a significant time. 

&gt; And for a while it's clean and tidy, and then reverts back to how it was.

 Just crying and then superficially changing to make it seem as though he's going to change has a very manipulative effect. It gets her to stay a little bit longer.

He's probably not planning it, but he gets very upset about her leaving him, changes for a short time to assure that she'll stay, and then relaxes and stops doing the effort. 

It keeps her strung along, because she will naturally hope that this time, this time the change isn't just temporary. "

"I agree with most of what you said, but it still seems a bit odd. Unless he's really making an effort to spend time with OP and spend some money on her in different ways.

If eating out or a sports game makes OP really happy and money isn't an issue, there's no reason why he can't compromise and go with her now and then and split the bill (or however they want to do it). I wonder if he's more interested in impressing people he doesn't see very often and has taken OP for granted. Or is compartmentalizing. In any case, I do think compromising and doing some of the stuff your partner wants to do without complaining the entire time is important in any relationship. And it's especially odd if he's doing all those things with others without complaining. Complaining can really drain experiences and make the person who wanted to go less enthusiastic about something they love."
"It sounds like she *was* just saying “excuse me” initially until OP got upset at her being “too confrontational” so now she has to resort to indirect, passive-aggressive comments. "
 Sounds to me as if this will never work out for you.  She's a bit of a princess and if you aren't having sex when dating I can promise that marriage won't improve that.  If sex is important to you then cut your losses now.
"I'd probably just say ""Did you honestly think it wouldn't get back to me?"" and then let him spin his wheels trying to figure out who outed him."
You are 18? I would leave...before you get chopped up into little pieces. 
"It is possible she slept with him, yes, and regretted it and recommitted herself to waiting for marriage.

It's also possible they didn't have sex.

Has she ever flat out said ""I am a virgin"" or ""I've never had sex"" , or was that implied/assumed?

All you can do is decide if you want to let this drop and trust her, or if you want to tell her you snooped and talk to her about it.  Either way...premarital counseling is a great idea for everyone, and it would be a safe place to talk about these kinds of things."

"It's different, one of my best friends, if not my best friend is a Female. Never been romantic. My (now wife) has always been cool with it, even when we were just dating. This is because my female friend never did ANY of the things that your friend will did. She accepted it because she's my homie that trusts me to do what is best for me. I hang out with her all the time and it's not a big deal at all because there is trust. 

 **It's not the fact that you have a platonic friendship** that bothers the significant other, it's the fact that that person is very clearly either out of their mind or showing some type of interest in you/being overly protective that gives off that vibe and causes worrying. This is not your boyfriends fault at all. 

Platonic friendships between opposite sex is 100000% normal. But it sounds to me like your friend has some type of weird interest and feels the need to step in there. "

"Nomad burnout is a very real thing. After a while your brain really does tire of novelty and it just leads to depression. Novelty is pleasurable but it is also very short-term and shallow, so too much for too long can lead to depression.

I suggest you eschew novelty for a while. Pick a place to move to and lay down some roots for a while. Make real friends. Develop real hobbies. Build lives. Create routine. Explore everything in that city in depth and then do it again five more times. Find adventure in smaller things, like walking around your neighborhood or making a new recipe in your kitchen. Get a pet or two.

It sounds like you're financially independent. There's no need to get into a rat race, but you can still create goals and set out to achieve them. Consider getting interesting jobs or starting another business, or at least angel investing. Or hell, start a non-profit or something.

And in this normie life, get some couples counseling. Work on the exercises your counselor gives you. Connect emotionally instead of over activities.

"Boundaries boundaries boundaries. 

Abusive treatment allows you to never see the abuser ever again. But it is up to you. 

My other was extremely psychologically and emotionally abusive when I was growing up. Like you mother, mine would never admit it. In the end I told her that I would  not allow her to rewrite history. If she wanted a relationship with me then she would no longer do that. We didn't speak for months until one day she came over unannounced and cooked dinner for me. She didn't say a word about our discussion but I could tell she had changed. She's been different ever since. 


I am sorry that she's got cancer. It's a difficult situation. My advice would be for you to show her the path she needs to walk to be in your life. That path will have boundaries that she needs to respect. If she does not respect them then you need to look after you first. Self care.

On Sunday, he went out to the car for a few minutes and then came inside very confused and asked me if I was sure it was cracked because it looked brand new! He didn't remember at all replacing it less than 24 hours previously. He controls his cholesterol with diet and 1/4 dose now and has far fewer memory issues. "
Stop trying to force a relationship between the two. They can be civil and polite but your sister doesn’t seem like that great of a person to be around. You may be able to see past it but others might not be able to.
"Your sister sucks.  Stop enabling her bad behavior, and stop ruining your marriage by forcing your husband to be around her."

Specifically looking at laundry, sorting through what's his vs hers, removing her clothes, and only washing his?? I can't believe the amount of effort he goes through to be an absolute terrible person. This isn't a case of ""I don't want to help, so I'm going to leave you to do whatever needs to be done"", this is actively making choices to spite his wife, the person he's supposed to love and cherish. "
Forget the kids. At this point I would’ve seriously reconsidered this marriage.   
"If these weekends are a constant thing in your life and she is constantly not invited how is this relationship going to go long term? You’ve been together a year so that’s not a spring fling, if you want the relationship to continue and you’re happy then you will have to back out of some weekends. Your friend doesn’t have to invite her but giving out 6 invites and then coming back saying his sister invited random people (which he has made it seem like before it was only close friends going to these weekends) and she can’t go with you basically says that she isn’t invited and never will be. Neither of them should have evolved into a shouting match, especially drunk, over something in the past but clearly she was hurt by being invited and then uninvited without a care. Him saying that she would have to ‘get used to him taking you’ sounds like a very jealous and almost possessive response. Has he always been like this about your girlfriends in the past? Throwing out what his family has done for you shouldn’t be a defense he is using unless he is a tit for tat sort of friend and you owe him. "
"I'm sorry for this awful news. That's really upsetting. Out of curiosity, has he shown any memory issues or signs of dementia in recent years? For someone who is aging or whose memory is failing, a conversation that happened 3 years ago could definitely be something he distinctly does NOT recall. If his memory is failing, he also might not remember the conversation you had last week. 

If he had purely forgotten, though, what is unexplainable is why he's not willing to now say ""I don't remember that but I'm happy to have you spend the $20k on this instead.""....ie why would his stance about his daughter's use of the money change? That leads me to think, as you mentioned, that he may no longer be in a position to give and ego is getting in the way of him admitting it. 

If you and she otherwise have a good relationship with him, I would chalk this up to an unfortunate inequity between the girls and try to let it go. It would be a shame, especially if he is experiencing cognitive or financial issues, for the relationship to come to an end over this. From the outside, it would look like you cut him off for not giving you money, which would be an ugly picture. That being said, I totally understand why it's a severe disappointment and hurtful when the other sisters got this benefit. Give it some time, say a polite no thank you to the Labor Day BBQ, and get a bit of distance. You may find you're able to maintain a relationship with him after you cool off a bit and get used to your new plans for buying a house. "

"I know he's into her, at least in terms of her being eye candy. I don't think he would ever consider leaving me for her even if she was interested. Never. Now, would he let things go further if she was interested? Maybe?


Why she met up with him?  Not really sure but I'm very sure it's not because she's into him.  I think it's more that she is starting her own business and is interested in getting advice on that (he's very good at that).


Yes, he deleted their messages.  I've asked him to recover them.  He says he will but he hasn't yet."
"The message you are giving your fiancé is that your parents wishes WILL be given priority over what is healthy for your relationship. You can say you were too worn out and tired to argue anymore and that's why you said ""okay"" to your Dad buying the tickets, but you weren't too tired to argue all night with your fiancé. She knows what she sees and what she sees is a future full of your parents bullying you and abusing her.

I highly doubt you want to be abused and bullied by your parents, and have them dictate your life until they die. Get yourself a good therapist and then go to couples therapy as well with your fiancé. "
"This is what pushes it over the edge for me. If he can’t be bothered to take an hour or two out of h is week to save his *marriage*, then he just doesn’t care.

"How do you feel in this moment? After everything he’s done, to go so far as to cancel a vacation with you to go with someone else, do you want to be with someone like that? It’s hard because he’ll likely feed you empty promises and make you smile but think back to this exact moment and how you feel.

I’m always curious what people will say, curiosity does kill the cat though. If you want to see his response then don’t block him but if you want to move on with your life and find a person who will treat you like the amazing person you deserve to be treated as then block him on social media. "
"Think about this from your sister's perspective; ""My mom asked me to plan *an entire freaking vacation* for her and my siblings that I'm not even invited to! How annoying and inconsiderate is that, for me to be asked to do all the work and get to have none of the fun?"""

"(I expect to be downvoted for this)

i’ll be totally honest...lot of social media comes across as braggy because it is. You are essentially showing off  your travel perks, without the context of the work and stress you put in. You’re just giving people the best parts of your life. That’s how everybody uses social media nowadays so I’m not trying to single you out. But you should be aware.

You could be a car lover and not post pictures of every luxury car that you rent on Instagram. Or maybe you just need to be part of a more focused group that shares excitement about cars amongst themselves instead of expecting everybody to understand that you’re coming from a love of cars and not a desire to show how great your life is.

I’m not saying that you don’t work hard, I’m not saying that he should be putting you down, i’m not saying he doesn’t need to admit to some jealousy, and I’m not saying that you can’t have an Instagram account  where you post your travels and your cars. 

But if you’re doing the latter it’s incredibly important to know how it does come across to other people. If he thinks that’s a little braggy I’m sure somebody else does too. It’s a fact that you lose control of how people interpret your life the minute you make it public.

I think this is why many more people are opting to make private accounts. In their case, they know it’s better to share their life with people who know and understand them instead of just sending it out into the world for everybody to see and speculate about.

"I think you just have to cut ties and walk away from this friendship.

He's always seemed to be a fairweather friend and that he views you as dispensable (ie, telling you he has a ""new best friend"" like it's something that needs to be announced 2 months into college), while doing *just* enough every so often to make you think he still cares.

Now the pendulum is swinging further and further towards a completely one-sided friendship, and at this point he is just using you as a beer delivery system and cost-absorber for things he doesn't want to pay for himself. He's using you. And he knows it.

Sorry man, I think he was always an asshole but finally fell down the rabbithole of full-on asshattery. Just ghost him. He's not going to benefit from or change from any kind of explanation or conversation: narcissists like him will always find a way to do mental gymnastics and divert any blame or criticism of their behavior. Save your breath and save yourself a headache and cut this cancer out of your life for good."
"Find a new partner who has similar standards. It sounds like he is relatively normal and you like things done above and beyond a normal standard. The fact that you refer to his way of cleaning as “wrong” is a red flag that you’re probably a bit obsessive and treat him like a child, rather than an autonomous adult.

I agree about the cutting board, but everything else would be a deal breaker for me. I’m not saying you’re wrong for liking things to be cleaned thoroughly, but you can’t make someone change or expect them to do things the same way you do. It seems like it’s time to relax or move on. "
"You are going to find this is a common thing. People tend to gravitate to those whom make them comfortable.  Basically she is gravitating to you subconsciously in her sleep because you comfort her so.

"Since you specifically mentioned ADD, I would HIGHLY recommend that you both check out the How to ADHD channel on YouTube.  The host, Jessica McCabe, talks a lot about her own struggles with ADHD and how she and her now-husband (also with ADHD) manage their lives on a day-to-day basis and the coping mechanisms and strategies that work for each of them.  Her videos are really informative and personable and she has a lot of great information for how to live with someone w/ADHD and set yourselves both up for success.

Oftentimes people with ADD/ADHD struggle with executive functions (a set of processes that all have to do with managing oneself and one's resources in order to achieve a goal) which is something that neuro-typical brains can do with minimal effort but ADHD brains don't speak that language and the pictographs are all dots and squiggles?  So basically, it's not like he's doing this intentionally and it's not necessarily (I don't know your lives) like he's just lazy.  His brain might just keep sending him down increasing rabbit-holes with IMPORTANT!!! blazing over everything and he doesn't realize it's time to clean until you set the visual alert for him by starting it yourself.

That being said...that is still incredibly frustrating.  There's nothing worse that having a long and/or not-great day and coming home to a mess.  Especially when the SOLVE THIS NOW response gets triggered so you do it yourself b/c you just need it DONE.

TL:DR - I hope **How to ADHD** helps you out"
"And a hidden account with tens of thousands is super honest? Leading you to believe she is places she hasn't been in YEARS is honest? 

So you want rug sweeping advice and to be told your wife isn't going to leave you? Get a bigger rug to hide all the dirt under."
"I'll play devil's advocate here and just state that if he doesn't seem to be hiding anything, and you can probably tell by his actions and/or how readily available he is as long as you're not going overboard, he's probably just not comfortable with his brother around you. 

Often family issues have many layers, and out of respect, he might just not want to get you involved. For the longest time when I was dating, I dreaded any of my girlfriends meeting my father. He appears friendly and very talkative when meeting new people in my life, and that's all the girls/friends ever see. None of them realize what I have to deal with after they've left. I often get criticism about why I chose a friend, what he/she can provide as a friend (not sure why this even matters), and lectures about how I'm ruining his sleep schedule because I have someone over at 8 PM. I hardly see him twice a week and we live in the same house. Often these talks just end with one of us being incredibly frustrated and ends up in a shouting match. 4 months is still fairly early, so I would say give it some time and feel it out. "
No don't contact him because he clearly doesn't want to be with you as shown by him blocking you.

"Masturbation/sex in general is one of those topics that is easy to make feel extremely taboo if that's simply how you grew up. If for example your family never closed the bathroom door while pooping, this would feel 100% normal to you later in life but other would think it's super weird. Sex stuff gets even more difficult.  
 
You should ask her what parts she  disagreed with. If it's even talking about masturbation then ask her how she thinks people should figure out masturbation. If she's 100% against it then that might be a red flag. Probably should encourage her to try it out /you can help teacher her so she becomes comfortable with it."

You should sit him down and be honest - nicely - with him, but if he doesn’t change his attitude and become more considerate about you and your needs then cut him loose.
