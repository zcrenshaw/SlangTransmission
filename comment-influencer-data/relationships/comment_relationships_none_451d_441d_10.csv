"He wants to fix things but is still going to Denver? 

He’s already made his choice, I’m sorry. End it. "
"This is ridiculous and signifies a basic lack of common sense. She gives you cash for gas, it doesn't matter what you use the cash for because the money you will use to fill up later will come out of your funds anyway. So it literally makes no difference if you are using the cash she gave you or your own money. This post hurts my head."
"""Sorry, that's unrealistic and isn""t going to happen any more. Why don't we do it at your place?""

Also, er, so you wife doesnt want to upset THEM, but is fine literally kicking her husband out of his own home? Her priorities seem out of whack."
"I'm happy for you dude, but be careful about how high you're building that pedestal you're putting her on. She's not some angelic being."
"Make sure to photograph the apartment so that you can protect yourself should Emily try to damage the apartment after you break your lease. While your landlord may provide your security deposit, Emily may try to sue you for damages incurred ""during your tenancy"" that prevent her from getting her security deposit."
"My mom did this to my dad. They left her home state when I was born, and my whole childhood, it was about if we could just get back. I grew up with a distaste for where we lived and hearing fairy tales about her home state. 

So finally, my dad got a job an hour from her home state. We moved our whole lives. 

But that wasn't really home to her, she missed her REAL state, the people there were different. So a year later my dad got a transfer, and we moved again. 

But we were in a town, and she wanted a house in the county. It turns out she never really needed to be in her home state, she just needed to be in the country. It turned into a country vs. city thing, not the state. 

So we moved to the country. They bought a house, sunk all their savings into it. 

And a year later...she hated it. My dad says now that she hated it the week they moved in, but he refused to let her talk about it at first. She complained it was isolated, she had to drive everywhere, there was nothing to do, now all she wanted to do was move to the city. 

My dad put his foot down. She left him, moved to the city, and actually got sick and didn't live much longer, so there isn't more to the story after that. 

But we all know how it would have gone. She was a broken, sad person. She was running from something. But always framed it as needing to get to a new place. 

She also changed church communities just about as often. She was looking for the feeling of being with her family in their home as a child. But you don't get the feeling of being a child back as an adult. You have to be an adult. 

She lived her whole life sad, and discontent, and completely bewildered why. I don't resent her at all for it, she did a great job being a mom, but as a person she was not happy. And she died suddenly, still lost and alone, and perpetually unhappy with where she was. 

Pushing your wife to face her feelings, by making her sit still, is a loving thing to do. She may leave you. She may have a break down. She may completely deny growth. But don't stay stuck with her just because she insists on being stuck in unhappiness. 

Be happy. Do what you need to be okay, and stable, and happy, and if she can keep up, that's great, but if she can't, please don't tie yourself to her and her unhappiness. She's as married to it as she is to you."
"&gt; When I push it, my husband asks why I’m so defensive and says that’s fishy. Then claims he’s joking. 

That's an unusually cruel thing to do. No more jokes. Have a serious conversation and tell him that his complaining about your baby is hurting you and it needs to stop. He needs to take steps to deal with this. Either therapy or a paternity test. This absolutely needs to stop though."
"Dude, imagine trying to explain it in person to someone who *just graduated college*. "
"Rather than politely deflect, I would opt to firmly cut it out, which can still be done politely and kindly. Saying things like ""I would rather you didn't make this type of comments"", ""that's hurtful"", ""that's not a subject that I want to discuss with you"", etc. The key is to say it in a tone of voice that shows you are serious about this and that bears no discussion.

With that said, the easiest might be to let it slide and ask your boyfriend to  have a private conversation with them to make them stop."
"im sorry, but if your family LAUGHED at what Grandma was saying, and no one defended it, your family ARE racist assholes. "
"Plan something that you want to do tomorrow before you go to sleep today. Then tomorrow you just have to do it, and it will be easier, because you've already made the decision today. 

Take care of yourself. Self-care is always important in difficult times. Do something nice for yourself, whatever form that takes for you. (For me it's expensive chocolate and a day where I just read or play video games, but some people take bubble baths, go hiking, hit the gym, go visit their mother, garden, get a new scented candle, visit a gallery, wrap themselves in blankets... etc. Whatever works.) "
Wait so Dave is Alice’s sisters boyfriend? So she isn’t dating Dave? So why on earth is Dave listening and taking orders about his own wedding from his fiancé’s sister? 
"don't help them. whatever you do, just don't. imagine actually helping them? they're going to continue using you because they know you'd be easy to fool. don't let them guilt trip you. the fact that they're using your fathers death saying ""he would've wanted this"" is SO messed up. 

the things your mother and sister have said are horrible and the fact that they didn't come to your wedding or said much about your wife losing a child, shows how awful they are. they don't deserve your kindness or money. 

i honestly think you should text them, ""hey try working at a fast food place"" and ignore them.

"
"He's got sexual predator written all over him. The less you assocoate with this guy, the better."
"Personally, for me, the trust would be broken at this point. This would be a dealbreaker.  


&gt; She's apparently quite stuck in a loveless relationship: besides the lack of sex, she's not allowed to have friends over, she cannot use/drive the car that they have (she's learning for a driving license just now), she received some harsh words when she paid for a coffee from their joint account, they never cook for each other (they just cook for one and eat outside often), etc.etc. While she confessed this she was crying, and I was also brought to tears a bit. 

Not to be cynical, but you're only getting her point of view. Everyone who's cheating on their spouse has a terrible loveless marriage, and it's always the spouse's fault. Maybe she's lying, maybe she's not. She's already lied to you once, so how do you know it's true?

&gt; she said that she'll probably do it in July/August.

Lots of other men/women are strung along this same way. If you're okay with being the ""other man,"" you need to really really stick to August 31st, no matter what excuses there are."
"I think a car port is a reasonable compromise, and I think you can find a way to be firm but polite about it. ""Wife, I'm glad you love your new car, and I understand why you want to keep it safe. However, as we discussed before moving here, the reason I'm willing to live in this house is to use the garage as a place to work on my cars. Please respect the compromise we made before moving, and we can find an alternative to keep your car safe together.""

On a side note, I notice that you're paying for everything - does she work? If she wants to put some of her own income aside to built a separate enclosure for the car, I think that's more than reasonable too. "
"OP, I just want to point out that each little interaction you’ve had with this woman has been significant to you. You’re describing in great detail these little, insignificant events. And you describe them as a crescendo that builds to this lunch date. But you need to keep in mind that these same events may not be significant to this woman. They may just be small moments throughout her day that perk up her workday a bit. They may not mean nearly the same thing to her that they mean to you. So you just really need to keep yourself in check here that these things are all basically things that friends / acquaintances / coworkers do without any romantic undertones. She could just be a friendly person that enjoys telling a joke to brighten up her work day, you know? Whereas this is the best part of your day, it may just be another part of her day. "
Omg! I actually don't have any advice to offer but I am cracking up at the steak thing!! That is legit funny as hell. 
"This happens so often, money turns people into monsters and is the fastest way to destroy a family.

Your sisters/mother are greedy and flat out wrong. They should be greatful your dad left them anything at all, it was his koney to do with as he saw fit and i think he did a wonderful thing ensuring that he didnt leave anyone out. He most likely felt utterly awful that he could not afford your school fees and this is clearly his way of 'making things right' 

I would simply stop engaging in this topic. Reiterate that this is what your father chose to do qith his money and that you will no longer discuss it.
"
"You and your wife are kind, decent people. To even be considering this bail-out is a kindness that your “family” does not deserve.  Please don’t give them a dime. There are 5 grown adults living in that house. They are the ones who blew a secure future on a whim. They’ve done nothing but treat you with disrespect and contempt for your entire life. Giving them your money will not stop that. Coming to their rescue won’t make them see you in a different light. They’re horrible people. "
"Feeling and doing are two different things. Remember that and you’ll be fine. 

FEELING: Fall in love and enjoy it. Have fun and be open with your heart. Share adventures, laughs and time together. 

DOING: Do not move in together for at least another _____ years. Do not buy a car together (under both your names) until you’re married.  Do not buy a house together until you’re married. 

You get the picture, right? Fall in love and enjoy each other! But don’t do anything, especially financially, as a couple that will make it harder for you to part ways if things don’t work out. "
"So lets say you have a girl, what will happen?

* Will she treat her sons the same as her daughter, or will she show favoritism?
* Will she put unreasonable expectations on this female child to live up to what her idea of 'having a little girl' will be like?
* Will this truly 'fix' her current issues?
* Can you afford another child?

I have 3 older brothers, and I am the only girl and youngest child. My mother and father had unrealistic expectations of me. I grew up with 3 older brothers, so I was a **tomboy**, and they HATED that. They raised me under a different set of rule than my brothers, I resented that as well. They were insanely strict with me, and my brothers could go out and do what ever they wanted, dress how they wanted, and never had a curfew.  My mom was so happy to have a girl, but we are not close at all, because she smothered me growing up, I couldn't wait to get away from her, and moved across the country as soon as I was able.

What I am getting at is this, **having a female child will not solve her problems.** She needs to figure this out. You should both go see a marriage councilor. It's scary that she jumped to Divorce so quickly, and shows that she is in a really unhealthy place."
"&gt;If I bring up her moving out, she loses it and starts crying.

Honestly, so what? So what if she cries. She says she no longer cares for you. You’re doing 100% of the childcare and house upkeep. She needs to move out. "
"&gt;My mom handled everything like a champ. Eventually she even walked right up to Heather super confidently and introduced herself saying, ""Hello, it's so awkward to finally meet you.""

OMG your mom is a badass. Ice in the veins!"
"Your friend is profoundly stupid. She doesn’t realize that she should be giving you money for your trouble whether or not you want to put gas in your car at that exact moment. I would not want to be friends with someone with this combination of stupidity and entitlement. 

You will probably get other reactions to this post with similar sentiments about this friend. I suggest sending her a link and telling her she needs to apologize or start taking the bus. 

EDIT. Now I would forward this thread to your friend. "
"This relationship is 4 months old. He's testing to see what he can get away with. Leave him, preferably after reminding him about how he told you how much he wanted to be dumped when you both first got together.  "
"I feel like this is an issue he's going to have to bring up to his family. They are being incredibly rude and now especially insensitive since they know your medical history (which they are definitely not entitled to in the first place). No more laughing it off, no more ""I'm just joking"" - they need to be spoken to about how their behavior is unacceptable. After that discussion, it would be a good idea to consider limiting contact with them or cutting them out completely if they don't get better about it (read: if they can stop being assholes about it to your faces at the very least).

I'm sorry that you are going through this situation and that these people have no tact. "
"I think it’s reasonable to be upset by this, but I think it’s at the point that no irreversible damage has been done. While it might take a while to feel back to normal, I think it’s something that can be come back from. As a person who is very black and white when it comes to cheating, I think that this relationship is salvageable. However, don’t let anyone tell you that you’re overreacting because he did make a series of decisions knowing the position he was putting himself in. This is a serious problem, but if you WANT to work through it and he shows remorse and wants to put in the effort too, then you absolutely can. "
"Sorry but, regardless of whether she could understand or not, you didn’t actually defend her. 

This post talks too much about her comprehension of the Spanish language rather than the facts - your grandmother is a racist, and you should have felt the need to defend your girlfriend and take her out of that environment whether or not she could understand. Didn’t you want to leave after hearing your grandmother be so horrible? Didn’t it make you mad? Screw making a scene! 

I’m with her on this. 

You can claim the rest of your family was laughing at your grandmother and not with her, but regardless, no one stood up for her. Disown your grandmother if you’re serious about this girl, if not, let her go and find someone who will have enough respect for her not to put her in that position. "
"Wow, it's awesome to read a story about the process working correctly, for a change!"
"John's mother was asking for you to do what you could to make sure he wasn't all alone without her. You went above and beyond to do all you could to not only check in on him, but to treat him like family - to the point of almost putting him before your own husband. I can't imagine that's what John's mother could have intended - she certainly wasn't expecting you to have to spend decades of your life tied to caring for John for her sake. I'm so sorry that John passed away. I'm sure his mother would have been so overwhelmed with the care you showed for him, and through him, for her and her memory. I'm also sure that John would be incredibly grateful for how amazing you were with him. Neither of them would have wanted or intended for you to give up your life to make his a little better.

You should be so very proud of yourself. Very few people would have given as wholly as you did. I really hope you don't beat yourself up for moving away, as you absolutely did the right thing.

You're clearly a very thoughtful, kind, caring person, and I wish you all the best, as it's what you deserve."
I wouldn't even write her a note. She doesn't deserve it. She deserves to wake up and realize that there is no one there anymore and needs to realize that when you do stuff like this people will leave you. What she did was insane. I'm happy that you finally found out what the hell was going on.
"You're right, he does sound like a jerk. It's definitely an asshole move to call fast food workers pathetic, but there's also another problem here that you don't explicitly identify. Three out of your four examples are putting you down specifically. According to him you're not a mature adult and the world doesn't view you as a professional –– and those digs at people from the suburbs apply to you and your family. Seems like he makes fun of the way you talk, minimizes your achievements, and looks down on your background. He's not treating you with the respect and kindness you deserve, and he also just sounds pretty unpleasant in general. Those constant, subtle put-downs can be a real warning sign. Be cautious of anyone who tries to subtly lower your self-esteem in a relationship. "
"I think this is exactly right. I haven't done a good job of posting about her good traits (I was frustrated). She is generous and kind and funny and amazingly spirited. Those are the qualities that originally attracted me to her. I do not like how unfocused and mercurial she can be, but she would turn around and delight me with a good quality whenever I felt annoyed, and I'd put her bad ones aside.

I think you're right though that she's genuinely dissatisfied  with herself. I wish she would agree to therapy."
"Get lawyer.

File for legal separation.

Get a temporary parenting plan/custody order put in place.

Get child support.

If she doesn't use her parenting time, go to court and adjust the parenting plan so you officially get more time and she owes you more child support.

**edit**  Oh my god. For everyone freaking out, I literally started with get a lawyer. I didn’t think I’d have to put a caveat on this. But this isn’t legal advice so calm your shit. The Bar association isn’t going to go after a non-attorney for these suggestions and claim they are attempting to practice law. It’s broad suggestions about a possible course of action that could work in many jurisdictions. 

Calm down. I said consult an attorney. Of course he should listen to his attorney above all else. But it’s helpful for him to have some ideas about what may be possible that he could ask his attorney. Not all attorneys are good after all. So he can now go in and ask about these things and so how the laws in his jurisdiction apply and see what his actual options are in his jurisdiction.

I’m an attorney for fuck’s sake. I’m not stupid enough to try to be his attorney on the Internet. I’m not his attorney and this isn’t legal advice. This is life advice. And step one is for him to get his own damn attorney. "

"I'm a 40 year old woman and I don't think you did anything wrong. You acknowledged that she's changed a little and you told her that you find her sexy as hell. Her reaction is a product of her own insecurities, not anything that you said. You aren't supposed to pretend that she looks the same as she did 10 years ago. That's not realistic or honest."
"If it displaces you 7 to 10 days a month I have no idea why you'd agree to this rather than insisting they just go hang out somewhere else where your presence in your own fucking home isn't an annoyance to them. Stop being a doormat, OP.

Either she's doing some shady shit while you're not around or this is her way of just getting some alone/decompression time away from you. The fact that she refuses to bring it up to them makes it seem like this is coming from her rather than them. Do you spend all your time at home? Have your own social life? Maybe she's just desperate for some down time away from you. I'd straight up ask her if this is the case and if do you can come up with some kind of plan for dealing with this *honestly* that doesn't involve blaming it on her friends and forcing you to leave for long stretches of time.

Anyway, if that's not the case and it really is her friends just being assholes, too bad for them. I think you're past the point of negotiations. Tell her you won't be leaving if you don't want to and be done with it. If she or they don't like it there are a billion other places for them to go in the world. "
"&gt; he's my best friend, but those ""in love"" butterflies are gone and **the reality of being tied to someone forever is making me depressed.**

This is the sentence that stands out among the rest.  It is important that you be honest with your fiance. Do this before you marry.

I say this because I would not want to marry someone who felt about me the way you feel about him. He should know you feel this way before you get married, so he can make an informed decision about whether this situation is still right for him."
Why are you bothering? Just stop giving her rides. She’s an entitled brat and doesn’t understand the basic concept that money is fungible.

"A kid isn't guaranteed to look like one or the other of the parents, he's being unfair. If he's hurt by the random roll of the dice that genetics played here, then he needs to be addressing this in some kind of counseling instead of saying these hurtful things to you. I'd definitely get a paternity test to settle this once and for all. He's gaslighting you for his bad behavior, don't let him get away with this semi-accusation and then treat you like you're out of line for asking to prove it to him."
"Go see a lawyer, the sooner the better. "

"OP, I just want to point out that your girlfriend may be downplaying this because the guy is your good friend. You mentioned that she was somewhat of an outsider amongst a group of friends &amp; that it was a big deal that she was getting along well with this guy friend &amp; feeling more comfortable in your circle. So she may be hesitant to make too big of a deal of this incident with your good friend because she’s afraid of how that will play out. (Will you take your friend’s side over hers? Will your other friends dislike her for making “too big a deal” out of this event? Etc.)

So while I do think your girlfriend should be the one to decide how big of a deal she thinks this is, I also think it’s important that you let her know you’re on her side &amp; will support whatever that decision is. And even if she says she wants to move past it, I would still be really hesitant to spend time together around this friend. "
its your house not theirs.  they can sleep somewhere else if they want to sleep over that badly.
"One of my thoughts too! 
I feel like there are two reasons to be this adamant about not having the husband there 
1. The friend has experienced some type of sexual or physical abuse, and is afraid of men being in her sleeping vicinity or something like that 
2. They are having a sexual relationship 

Other than that I can’t think of any rational reason to insist on the husband being out of the house completely "

"My gf was having trouble starting therapy a couple of years ago. She felt she didn't need it (she for sure did. She was very sexually repressed due to religious upbringing) and every time I brought it up she said that it would be pointless.

Finally what I did was I tell her that I think we could benefit from some couples therapy. I explained to her that it was important to me and that I want to be able to discuss things together with someone. She agreed to that and we went. I'm so glad because we at first were discussing my sexual frustrations and it led into her opening up about her repressed sexuality and eventually she went into her own therapy for a while. 

Maybe you could try bringing up couples therapy? Try to frame it in that you want to strengthen your relationship not that you feel it's in trouble."

Dude.... what are they doing on these overnight visits?
Miscarriages are definitely one of the hardest things that a relationship can go through. I would definitely recommend trying for couples counseling if you can swing it.

"Aside from everything else that's been said so far, I find it really concerning that Amy is so comfortable with this affair and her kids that she sends your husband flippant messages about father's day. I mean that's a woman with no shame who thinks she's done nothing wrong.

Are you sure her husband doesn't know? She doesn't sound smart. Are you sure it stopped between them? It's odd your husband didn't put up any boundaries with her when he married you. 

Given the secrets your husband has kept and the reluctant way he revealed them, I'd be very tempted to grab his phone and take a look at his full message history. I know that's a Reddit no-no but jesus Christ, there's a lot of lying to unpack here.

"Why the hell are grown women having this many sleepovers in a month first of all?

Yeah, you’re not beating your kid. You’re not raising her to be hateful. You’re not starving her. You’re not going to raise her with unrealistic body image. You’re not going to model poor relationships for her. You’re not introducing her to a cycle of abuse. You’re not neglecting or harming her in any way. 

Your judgmental friends and former in-law can choose a finger, sit and spin. 

The choice of how you birthed your child has nothing to do with how healthy or happy she is. 

Your choice to expose your child to media at an age you feel is ok is yours. 

Your choice to raise her without physical harm, mental abuse, and in a place she is loved has no place for their nitpicks. 

Go get a stiff drink, and decide that their opinions are just like their assholes - they stink up close and should be kept at a distance under several layers of material.

"Let me preface this by saying I’m a drinker. 

OK, so playing devils advocate here... your husband is upset because he married a woman with the same morals as him and now he thinks those morals are changing. In all fairness, he is worried that if you enjoy this experience, you will want to start trying to drink a glass of wine once a month or something. 

So what is currently happening is that he is in shock still. He sees you as a party girl now. Where he is really messing up is the yelling and name calling. Tell him you’d like to have an adult discussion about it when he calms down enough, and you’d like him to hear you out. 

It’s really important here to calmly point out that you are certain that he would be very upset if you yelled at him and called him names. Emphasize that him not having his emotions in check is really unattractive and something that is definitely a dealbreaker for you. (Def more of a dealbreaker than having a damn drink!) 

Tell him that he’s your husband and you love him, and ask him what specifically he is worried about with you trying alcohol. There could be a compromise here where he only wants you to have two drinks or something. Ask him if he is actually serious about divorcing you, because that’s a big deal. Ask him how he intends to explain that situation to friends and family. Tell him that if he loves and respects you, he will let you have this life experience. Go from there. 

If my partner did not let me grow and change as a person and constantly continue to figure out what makes me happy, I would seriously consider whether I want to spend my life in the relationship. 

Side note: You guys’ beliefs are anti-alcohol but pro-divorce? Weird. "
"So this guy has PTSD and your man’s response to that is to fuck his wife?

Yeahhh, he’s trash. "
One of my favorites in this vein is “Is your intention to be cruel? Because that is the effect. I’ve told you I didn’t wish to discuss this because is hurtful to me and you continue to bring it up. Why?”
"Set your boundaries - he is not a healthy person. Don’t let him around your kids. You’ve given him plenty of opportunities to make things better. 
Don’t subject yourself to his abusive behavior and protect your child. "
"There is a lot to unpack here. A lot.

I'm wondering about the person who told you all this, and how this person has access to this knowledge about your wife's financial affairs. A sibling? Cousin? What was the purpose? Does this person have a grudge against your wife?

I would also wonder if your wife was advised or taught to keep money hidden by her parents.  Also, while I'm wondering, does she feel like she needs what used to be called ""mad money"" in case of an emergency or in case of a divorce/affair/major illness/death of spouse?

I somehow get the feeling that it isn't as much about you possibly running off with her money, as it might be about her needing that money set aside to feel secure. 

These are all things you need to address with your wife, probably with an uninvolved third party like a financial or marriage counselor."
"People. Start watching catfish. One of the least outlandish plots of an episode was a girl catfishing her cousin because she thought her cousin was promiscuous and she ended up sexting with her cousin to keep her from being promiscuous (look, it rarely makes sense) but the catfishing cousin was able to find guy friends  to talk on the phone with the fished in character. 

This isn’t a Sherlock Holmes case. It’s someone who knows him and they are in love with him in an unhealthy way. I dunno if the caller is the wanna be suitor or if they got roped into being the voice of the operation. It’s either that or this is an elaborate ruse to show to your boyfriend the internet believes you so why doesn’t he. "
"I had a period when I was puking when I ate fatty foods like steak. Turns out, I had a massive gallstone and I needed to have my gallbladder out.

This sounds like a medical thing that she should have evaluated. I don't think it has anything to do with her past eating disorder or her vegetarianism. Vomiting when you consume a lot of fat is a symptom of several possible GI diseases including gallbladder issues, pancreatitis, and GERD.

Have her get evaluated by a doctor."

I was still in school, I had to delay going into university, my ex was a shitty scumbag who spent my hard-earned money for billiard girls and gone most nights leaving me taking care of my baby alone. Abortion was not an option because I live in a deeply religious country where sex before marriage is punishable by jail terms, let alone abortion. I kinda understand your mother's feelings. 

But what makes me different than your scumbag mother is I didn't, I never, I will never, shift the blame to my daughter. I had sex WITHOUT PROTECTION. Yes condoms were not a common thing to buy in my country and sex-ed was nonexistent, yet stupid me still went ahead and had sex. It is entirely MY fault (and the ex's) I fell pregnant and had a kid. Do I regret having my daughter so young? Yes, but I didn't regret having her, I only regret having her SO EARLY and couldn't really give her the best childhood because my financial state at the time was really really bad and my mental state was even worse. 

&gt;I am basically ruining our relationship. Any advice on what I should do? I am left feeling really guilty

My daughter never asked to be born in such condition. She alone is blameless. Blameless, as you are. Remember that. You bear no sin for being born. You don't need to feel guilty. She might be tired of being a mother, she might think her youth was ruined by having kids, but it was not YOUR fault. It is called a CONSEQUENCE, and she has to bear the responsibility for her action. 

As for what you should do, I think the best option for your age is living with another relative who is not a scumbag like your parents. I'm really sorry your grandmother has passed away, it must be hard on you. Try finding an aunt or uncle instead? Is there a counsellor in your school you could talk with about this? 

Another thing, save money like a maniac. It will be your liberator once you turn 18. You said you have a job. It's a good step. Have more if need be, you will need a lot when you turn 18 and move out. Also save some for a therapist. You are clinically depressed, and it needs to be treated. 

Last thing to say, I want to tell you if you are my son, I would be very, very proud to have you, just as proud as my daughter. "
"&gt; Throughout the years, my BF has been disinvited to every single one of Dave’s birthday parties 

I highly doubt your boyfriend is Dave's best friend. Why would Dave invite his girlfriend's sister instead of his best friend? Why does his girlfriend's sister get to decide who is the best man? I think this friendship is not as close as your boyfriend and you think."
"&gt;Now sex for me has always been delicate. She's the second girl I've ever slept with, and first in about 6 years. It was a big step for me emotionally. 

Sorry, does that mean you were having sex at 12? Or have I read that wrong?

I'm sorry you're going through this OP. I know it feels nasty because she made you take leave, but I think she thought doing it over the phone would be worse? I'm not saying it is worse or isn't, but I don't think she made you come to see her just to be spiteful.

What should you do? Block her on every social media. Delete her number. Don't look at photos of her. Find things to do in your local area, download tinder and meet new people.

Can you call your superior at the military and explain what happened, and ask to return now and keep the leave days you didn't use? This is a pretty shitty thing to happen to someone, they might be sympathetic."
That’s correct. And I don’t know. I feel like I’m crazy because I’m the only one in this situation who feels like this isn’t normal. 
Well of course she’s mad. You fucked up her chances with her crush. What an inconsiderate boyfriend you are
"&gt;I realized nobody cares about seeing my nipples through my shirt.

So, that’s probably not quite true. Your mother, for example, cares. And it’s reasonable to think that others in public might be made uncomfortable by it. Yes, it’s natural. Yes, it’s more comfortable for you. But society still expects not to see nipples through clothing on women. Now, I can totally get behind you that this is bullshit and you shouldn’t have to make yourself uncomfortable for others sake, but I don’t think it’s fair for you to say “nobody cares!” Because people do, especially outside of your university bubble. 

I also agree with another commenter that if you are going to be okay with your nipples being seen then you probably need to be comfortable with your mother commenting on that fact. "
"Ignore their pleas for money.   They have no use for you except as a means to continue the life they have always led...without you.

Your wife is a goodhearted person but all your would get would be insults and more begging."
"&gt; My husband is a very black and white person. Things should be one way, and has no qualms about addressing it.

That's a nice way of saying he operates by the 'my way or the highway' philosophy which simply isn't fair or reasonable in an adult relationship. 

You're doing a nice thing, and a reasonable thing given the circumstances. He is trying to control you first by putting doubt in your head about becoming an 'uber service' and then admitting it's because he doesn't trust you to not cheat. I suggest you tell him you will not be modifying your behavior in this way at all and that you insist on marriage counseling, or perhaps individual counseling for him, because he is not coping with prior trauma from past relationships well and it's damaging your relationship and causing him to treat you unfairly. 

In other words, treat this like a 'him' problem that HE needs to solve. If you stop giving the occasional ride, you're putting a bandaid on a wound - it will avoid the fight in the short term (at the expense of a friend) but doesn't address the much more significant issues he has being a good partner.

"FYI Mexico won a football match against Germany and not the entire World Cup, since they still have more games to play in the tournament which lasts for about a month. So this may not be the first time he bails on you. "
"I know a lot of people have already given good advice, but I can only reinforce it by begging you: PLEASE do something. 

I was fifteen when a twenty-five year old man started talking to me under the guise of “friendship.” He ran a business that I volunteered for, and I thought it was so cool that he thought I was as cool as some of the people he knew. I was too young to understand that his flirty attitude and constant requests for pictures were something much more sinister, and it only got worse over time. It was terrifying, having a grown man talk to you about how badly he wanted to “be intimate” with you. I felt like I couldn’t tell my parents the truth, because they’d take away my phone or computer, or prevent me from seeing my other friends who I knew through him. I tried to tell my friends but most of them didn’t see anything wrong either. They were still just kids like me. 

It took me years to finally square up and stand up to him. By this time, I was an actual adult, and had figured him out. I told him he was being creepy, he unfriended me the next minute and never spoke to me again. It seemed like a clean cut. He drifted to the back of my mind pretty quickly. 

But earlier this year, it came out that he had been doing this to multiple girls, for YEARS, leading up sexually assaulting some of them. His name was wiped off all the pages of the people and groups I knew. It was like he vanished overnight, and I suddenly found all these women I knew when I was younger, coming out to talk about their experiences with him. 

I wish I had said something sooner. I wish I hadn’t thought it was “just me” and moved on. And I wish the tens (hundreds, really) of people who knew he was like this said something, too. It took one person calling him out for all of us to realize we’d been hurt by the same person. Justice was served, but way too late to spare more victims. "
"She hid this for 3 years and claims she is going to divorce him ""soon""? Heck no she isn't, if she wanted to divorce they wouldn't be together.  
Walk away from this mess."
"I don't think he is consciously taking advantage of you, but he doesn't have a realistic view of how the finances in a marriage should work. 

I think it's about more than just this summer. Unless he is a hyper aggressive deal making entrepreneur type, he shouldn't try to go it alone as a freelancer. He should put off that dream and go the more conventional route so he can finance his dream later on. 

"
"You’re being gaslit. Danger, danger, Will Robinson! You’re at the start of another abusive relationship. Dip out now. "
"Agreed. Idealizing your partner, especially in the beginning, may skew the way you treat her, and become a turn-off. This happened to me when I was madly in love. It is wonderful to be madly in love, but don't smother your partner with it."
Borderline? It’s outright emotional abuse. He’s highly manipulative. 
"The strangest thing about this.... is that even IF you were cheating on Sam, HOW does that make it your fault that she cheated???? Does she not have free will of her own? Like she sees a friend cheat and instantly thinks that she has to as well? 

Emily  did a great job of distracting her ex and directing his anger at you. Her ex is an idiot though ( in my opinion) to even entertain the idea that it’s your fault. Clearly they aren’t very mature people. Good ridance . 

Edit- to clarify, my questions are rhetorical. I really just asked them to point out the absurdity of the situation. You can all stop explaining to me the concept of making excuses and shitty people not taking personal responsibility. "
Holy shit talk about a power move.
"Your husband is a drug addict. He is abusing the opioid medication. This is not a good environment for you or your children. Honestly, I would demand that my husband, in this position, either go to rehab or we move out/he moves out. This is not safe or fair for your family. You need to stop being passive and accepting it.

Does anyone else think this is really odd? I don’t know if I’m off base but could your wife have something going on with these women?

"If you sponsored him for a Visa, and then 3 months later he is blatantly carrying on an affair while telling you that he ""wants to fix things"" to try to placate you (while he still plans on flying to see this woman)... I'd say there is a **very high chance** that he used you for a Visa.

Edit to add: I see now that he didn’t even book a return trip. Nail in the coffin. 
No one books flights individually like that — it’s heinously more expensive to do so. He doesn’t plan on coming back."
"This is going to be a really long comment, and I’m sorry in advance, but something reeeally similar happened to my best friend, Jen. 

Jen and Rich had been together for a little while, lived together, had a cat together, totally in love with each other.

One day while Jen was staying at her mom’s house, Rich gets a text from Jen’s ex, Taylor. Taylor has screen shots from “Jen” confessing her love for him, saying she doesn’t love Rich and she thinks she might be pregnant with another man’s child. The thing is, it wasn’t Jen. It was a fake number from a burner app. The texting style was completely different than Jen’s. But the story was so batshit crazy that Rich couldn’t justify it being false. 

He went through her computer, through her emails and iMessage, and wasn’t able to find anything to back up these claims, but he did find lots of texts between Jen and myself, not always saying the nicest things about Rich. Nothing terrible, but we’re best friends and we vent to each other about our stresses, which sometimes includes our significant others. 

The texts completely ruined their relationship. For weeks, Rich went back and forth on whether he believed Jen that it wasn’t her. Jen hadn’t spoken to Taylor since they broke up, about six months before she and Rich started seeing each other. Jen couldn’t understand why Taylor would make the texts up, or who might have been the one actually texting Taylor. Rich asked her to take a pregnancy test, which was negative. Ultimately Jen couldn’t handle the constant back and forth of Rich saying he forgave her but then changing his mind, and she ended the relationship. 

Months later, Jen discovered the truth about who had sent the texts. Rich’s best friend, Keegan, who was a nice guy but kind of a pushover, had been dating a girl named Ashlyn, who was a little weird but generally a pleasant girl. She had a hard time keeping friends around for long but seemed to have good intentions. Jen didn’t care for her but Keegan seemed happy so the four of them often got together. Well, Ashlyn thought Rich was too good for Jen, and thought he should be with HER instead. So one night, Ashlyn and Keegan decided to download a burner app and text Taylor, pretending to be Jen. 

Keegan and Ashlyn eventually broke up, and once Jen left Rich, he and Ashlyn got together. This was before he found out that Ashlyn had actually been the one behind the texts. At some point, she decided to tell him because she thought it was so funny, but said it was all Keegan’s idea. 

I guess my point is, people are fucking nuts and the caller/texted could literally be anyone in your life. I don’t have much advice because I know the situation is absolutely insane, but hopefully you can at least take comfort knowing that other people have gone through similar things. "
You should dump him on the basis that he still has videos of past partners he unknowingly filmed. What the fuck? 
"Make small talk for an hour, thank them for a lovely evening, get a ride with the sister, then dump his ass via text message."
"\- He is unsupportive of your professional success and finds it threatening to his masculinity.

\- He considers your mental illnesses to be character flaws and complains about them to other people.

\- He gaslights you.

\- He feels the need to follow up compliments with qualifiers/insults so you don't start feeling good about yourself.

\- He devalues the childcare you provide and makes you feel not good enough.

\- He is inconsiderate of your needs and feelings.

\- He gives you the silent treatment when he's mad.

Look, this not considering you an equal thing is just the tip of the iceberg. This man is treating you like *shit*. Please get out of there. You deserve so much better than this."
"Can’t have friends over. Can’t buy coffee. Can’t drive. But it is more than ok to be out 2-3 days per week and travel the world alone multiple times a year. Yah...ok...this guy is the most gullible person I have ever seen on here. And I’m sure the lady cheating on her husband for 3.5 years hasn’t had sex with her husband once in that time period.

Get a clue OP and some self respect."
"&gt;And he also mentions an article he read about his fathers tend to love children more if they look like them.

What your child looks like is so completely &amp; totally out of anyone's control that for him to bring this up strikes me as pretty shitty. It's a little like saying, ""I'd love my child more if the sky was purple rather than blue."" 

I'd consider going through with the paternity test just to put a definitive end to his suspicions, but he needs to understand that his insecurities have seriously undermined your relationship, and he'll have a lot of work ahead of him to fix it. Is he open to counseling? This type of irrational insecurity should be dealt with by a professional. "
"This honestly should have been dealt with way back when it was only birthday parties. It was just as much bullshit then. Your boyfriend needs to have a serious talk with Dave about whether they should still hang out, especially if his future SIL is going to have so much control over him going forward."
"Therapy AND the paternity test. This is definitely not a ""one or the other"" scenario; his cruelty about it means there needs to be both."
"Seems like a normal situation. A friend she knew that she hasn’t seen in forever, she wants to talk to him. She hugged you and paid for her verything, probably to apologize for bailing early. You said it seemed like she was having a good time. 

Wait it out. See how it goes. Don’t assume it’s terrible and give up now. "
"Why your wife is letting her sister’s husband act like this is beyond me. Your wife claims she wants to protect her relationship with her sister, but if she isn’t honest with her sister about her scummy hubby, what kind of relationship do they even have? 

OP for the record I wouldn’t move past it either. People like that don’t deserve respect or even the polite pretending that nothing’s wrong. "
"Okay, let's recap what happened:

You and a new friend are enjoying a meal together.  She sees somebody she's been friends with for a while, finishes her meal with you, excuses herself, gives you a hug, feels bad about the situation and pays for your meal, then goes to catch up with her friend.

Yeah, the only thing she could have done better here is told you that she paid for your meal, so you wouldn't just sit there waiting for it..  but other than that, I don't see a problem?

You use the word ""date"" in replies, but is that what it was?  It sounds to me like just 2 friends at work going out for lunch.  Maybe that's all it was to her?"
"if you've apologized already, the best thing you can do is not bring up the incident again. instead, go out of your way to compliment her in ways that cannot be misconstrued, compliment her outfits, say and show that you find her very attractive, don't say anything that alludes to the passage of time or implies that she ever looked better than she does right now. if she self deprecates, don't acknowledge whatever she's disparaging about herself, just say that she looks great. keep it simple and it'll be harder to screw up. "
"That's really sweet and I really hope it keeps going well for you both, but be careful. Daily dates, sleepovers and you love her already? 


Take it slow! If it's meant to be, you guys have years and years, there's no need to be so super intense just yet. 


I do hope it continues to go well for you, you both sound smitten and that's lovely :) "
"So.

* She was getting preferential treatment from a married boss. A man who is connected to you, no less.

* You weren't the only person supremely concerned by their closeness.

* She's sad/mad that things are now above brow and professional.


Cool, because it means that their budding affair, which was absolutely brewing in some stage, has not been taken underground. 

I can't tell you what to do, but I'll say this - She's in the grip of an obvious crush, she has zero interest of telling you the truth about her feelings and I would take exactly zero admonition from her bench about how you supposedly ""messed up"" her ""friendship.""

You very likely ""saved"" a ""marriage.""

Some men are so bent on being the ""strong"" partner in a relationship that they can't deal with anybody who isn't feeble and dependent. Your fiancé sounds like one of those men. If you're even interested in salvaging the relationship at this point, I'd insist on seeing a counselor together. "
"So your sister, who is functionally your parent, intervened when she realized you were dating a man who is WAY too old for you, and asked for space because she's too emotional to talk about it yet? 

Honestly, your sister sounds awesome. She sounds like a badass who is doing her best for her family. She has the emotional maturity to step away from an intense situation because she doesn't want to speak from a place of anger. She has the wisdom to know that a 25 year old who's trying to date an 18 year old is a fucking predator nine times out of ten. 

You came home after curfew with a guy seven years older than you, assuming she wouldn't be home. Buddy, you were in the wrong. Your behavior was irresponsible, disrespectful, and possibly really dangerous. Give her space, practice your *apology*, and maybe do some thinking on how much she has sacrificed for you. 

You're not a kid anymore, and the only reason you got to be one is because your sister gave up her childhood to raise you. Why are you working against her instead of with her, as a team and a family? "
"Man this sucks. You should tell her that her behavior caused you to want to burn your journal and that if she hadn't been snooping, you would have felt better about keeping them. In the future, though, if something has the ability to help you professional (like with college or an art program), don't burn it - just keep it with a friend or someplace really well hidden. 

Unfortunately this is just one of those unreasonable things you might have to deal with until you're an adult. I'm sorry. Is she your only parent?"
"He knows it hurts you. Seriously, unless he has an IQ of twelve. He did this on purpose because he wanted treats for himself while you foot the bill for the entire trip. You’ll spend years wasting your life trying to “make him see”. It’s YOU that needs to open your eyes and see. He even deliberately waited until you were five hours out to tell you so you couldn’t drop him back home."
"Alright cool, someone asked about the age thing."
"You should definitely follow up. Sure, the publication is printed, but perhaps even more important are web records for the project, to which your name can easily be added. Insist that you be credited so that people can see it when they Google your name, which will be important when you list it on future resumes. 

And it's perfectly likely that it's an oversight on the part of the awards body, not an intentional slight from your co-workers. So don't go in with a chip on your shoulder - you're just alerting them to a mistake."
"My best friend lived with her (now) husband and his best friend. The best friend was like this. Made lots of ""friends"" with young girls over video games.

You have to have a serious talk with him about how you're feeling and if he does end up quitting this job, I would think seriously about leaving this marriage because you have no reason to trust that this man is able to do what needs to be done to support your family."

"Nope.  Not even comforting you/your wife after a miscarriage?  Never inviting you to family gatherings?   Making antisemitic comments about your wife?  That’s not family, and you don’t need to give them a dime.  "
"You two need to be on Team You Two for this. If that makes sense. :/ 

I've had a glass of wine or three, so bear with me whilst I formulate my thoughts and try to explain:

a) You two should sit yourselves down and discuss how you want to handle this going forward. There's nothing worse than the dread-dread-dread of a far-flung visit, only to get there and it's just as bad as you thought but you're not prepared. You both know it's going to be bad, so prepare beforehand. Have some stock phrases, like, ""Why are you so interested in our sex life?"" and, ""Are you seriously telling my boyfriend to dump me because I've had medical problems?"" and, ""Gosh, do you realise how awful it sounds when you say that my children, who are beloved by your son, are only second-best to a non-existent foetus?"" 

Go for the throat. Exaggerate and use hyperbole. They're not exactly sparing your feelings, so why should you spare theirs, in all honesty? 

b) If you usually stay with his relatives, then arrange a hotel or something for the next visit. When this starts up, have it arranged with your boyfriend that you'll stand up and walk away, and go and speak to Uncle/Auntie A.N.Other. Give one warning, eg ""This isn't up for discussion."" Then, if it carries on, give no explanations - just up and move. 

A) It's his family, so he should be doing the heavy lifting with putting them off these lines of discussion. Talk it over with him, and have him be prepared to spine up and shut things down. It may be a battle at first, but it's worth it in the long run. It's either you and him who suffer X times per year despite protestations, or he goes a bit firm on them and you both stop suffering. Either way, you both suffer, but you suffer less if you set up your boundaries.

I'm probably blathering now, but I got seriously angry as fuck over what you said his father did (staring at him, waiting for an answer to that damn question) and what his mother said (""it's just not the same""). Cheeky pair of sods. If your boyfriend's accepted your girls as his own, then what RIGHT does SHE have to reject them as second rate??? Gah! -.- 

I'm going to take my tipsy self up to bed now. Chat with your man (who sounds adorable, btw) and both of you take control back. 

Good luck. x"
"Tell your girlfriend because I don't think she'll freak out.  I feel like she'll understand given the situation.  It's likely her friend is attaching herself unhealthily to you because she's been neglected and mistreated and probably clings to men who give her any attention.  But you need to make sure boundaries are set and everyone knows them.  It won't help her, anyway, to try and get anything out of you because she needs to heal.  It's good for you to set an example of what a healthy relationship looks like and hopefully she can see that in time and make better choices in her dating life in the future.  I'd also encourage her to get in therapy so she doesn't end up back with her ex."

"OP, you even say, “he wants to fix this and I don’t”. Honor your feelings. Don’t spend time fixing something that can’t be fixed. Move on. "

You need more than this to make your conclusion?"

So what I am getting at is that your response of eating his steak was what was needed outside of the “normal” social cues to make him register that there was an issue.  It’s a wordy description to basically say you were speaking his language to get him to “hear” you.  Rude or not rude is almost beside the point.  The dude must be shown he self-absorbed behavior and you carried the flag.  Well done!!!"

She is jealous. There is very little that you can do about her insecurities. 
"&gt; How do I fix this without hurting his feelings?

You don’t. 

You can either get honest, let him feel hurt, and start *working through it,* or you can continue dancing around the core issue and build up resentment until you can’t see straight. His hurt is his to manage - adding “bubble-wrap husband’s ego” to your to-do list is only going to compound the problem. He doesn’t get to insulate himself from the emotional fallout of issues *he* contributes to. Nor does he get to shove off the work of fixing it onto you. He needs to know exactly where your resentment is coming from if he’s actually interested in repairing the damage. "
"OP, there's no way to resolve this and save your marriage if she's not willing to go to therapy or any sort of mental health professional.

Also...think of what this is going to do to your boys as they get older. She's essentially saying that they're not good enough because they're not girls. They're going to pick up on that at some point.

&gt; I am fine raising her by myself if need to. 

Raising *her.* No mention of your sons at all. She's too busy worrying about her hypothetical daughter that she's not even thinking about the children that actually exist.

Sadly, if she's not willing to get help, divorce might be the best option, for the well being of your sons."
"I would do it in person. I would say something like

&gt; Hi [name], we need to have a talk. I am always here to help out a friend in need, when you first came to me asking about AirBNB I agreed because you were in need. It has come to my attention recently that this is no longer the case, and I am thrilled that you have found your feet. I am glad I was able to help you through this rough financial time, but I am unable to provide a place for you to crash going forward.     

That will be a good, direct kicking off position for a conversation. Be ready for her to be upset, but if she's your actual friend she'll come around."
"There are men and women out there who will have sex with anyone that they vibe well with. They don't care who is single/taken, then don't care if it's a friends partner, they simple just want to bang anyone who they can because they are desperate. These people don't have discipline. It can be a good friend and outgoing person who seems nice down to their core, but you never really know a person.

Let me put this scenario I'm going through right now. I broke up with an ex-gf, and lately she's been hanging out with a friend of mine. I told my friend that I wasn't comfortable with him talking to my ex after such a recent break up, and he said it was cool and he'd back off. He's told me multiple time he'd back off and guess what, he hasn't in the slightest. My point is, just because he is your friend, doesn't mean jack. Some guys are desperate as hell and will try and bang the first girl that shows them interest - and this is your friend. He was not too drunk, he knew what he was doing. He's a smart one, and here's his strategy.

Him: ""I'm going to go into the bathroom and check her out. I'll act surprised and confused if she doesn't send me the right signal or shrieks, but if she doesn't fight me and will cheat on her boyfriend, I'm going to get laid.""

He'll never admit it, because he can't. He'll completely lose face in front of your whole circle of friends. I don't think you're reading too much into this, because I've seen all types of people ruin relationships and marriages because they wanted to bust a nut, which is what I think your friend was trying to do."
"Yo homie pump the brakes real quick. 
Re read that 2nd or 3rd to last paragraph. 
You were  talking about your insecurities with how u look in comparison to the model dude. Then jumped all the way to concluding that now you are depriving her of a better sexual experience. 
Looks have very vey very little to do with the quality of sex my bro. 

Listen I know it’s rough and kinda funky when you have this beautiful girl on the arm but you don’t know why. 

It’s cuz you have all the shit that pretty boy McFoyds don’t have. 
You might not have the greased back hair and 1200 dol outfits with your frosted tips. 
But I know you probably a funny ass dude with one hell of a heart. 
And you’re probably a lot better looking than you give yourself credit for. 
You attracted that beautiful girl. And that girl is all yours my bro. You did that with all the good you got. 
Don’t lose focus and get caught up in your head. 

Never forget, you are the one taking her to bed tonight, and they are the ones jerking off a midst the late night tv glare. 

Hope this helped somehow 😎"
"When people try to push this issue just say:  ""The week before my wedding he told my future husband that I cheated on him in an attempt to ruin my wedding, I will not be associating with him or his extended family""  then tell them to drop it and that you will not reconsider your position.

"
"Yeah, I think the way he framed it is important here.  I think you would feel much different about it if this situation played out exactly the same but he came to you saying, ""Ok, so I thought I was making a new friend --this waitress we saw out at dinner invited all of us to a big lake party and we were all hanging out and having a good time.  It was getting kind of loud and I was interested in the conversation that she and I were having so we took a short walk around the lake, and then suddenly she's asking me if I have a girlfriend and trying to kiss me.  What the fuck.  So I went and grabbed my friends and noped right the hell out of there.  Sorry that that happened, I didn't even realize what was going on until she was coming at me.""  

But he didn't.  He phrased it as ""almost cheated"" and gave the long story about how they met, and played the whole ""do you want me to keep going"" game, because he *knew* what he did wasn't innocent.  He *knew* that she was interested in him, he *knew* that he shouldn't have gotten himself in that situation, and he *knew* that he wanted to kiss her (not sure that I believe they didn't, to be honest.)  He knows he fucked up."
"Pranking behavior always strikes me as a sort of repressed hostility. Underneath it all, it’s not funny. It’s mean spirited.

"Yes. Five adults can make a mortgage payment if they put effort into it. Otherwise, this is a valuable life lesson and maybe OPs siblings will end up knowing how to handle their money better in the long run. 

If OP is concerned about the children, maybe he could set aside a bit of money for them for summer camps or even college. "
I would never do that to my husband.  What you're describing is a date.
"\&gt; my husband responds to me with anger and “I knew it”

Your husband automatically trusts some stranger? Girl, you don't have a good relationship if your husband believes so easily (and saying he knew it means he's already been thinking of it, wtf) that you would cheat on him."

"Hey, I have had the same experience and found a compromise for myself.


I haven't worn bras in years. Also a B cup.


When I go to work of course, headlights are not acceptable even though my workplace is a casual dressing place - so I found a solution to keep all of us happy.


Nipple pasties!! They're lifesavers. You can buy them on Amazon, they just stick on and mould to the size *and curve of your tits, so they're invisible under thin tops or tanks too. I wear them to work and to other places where I need to be 'mindful' of other people's sensitivities. It isn't a big deal, you hardly feel them there and it feels like no bra anyway - but helps with people who are easily offended.


Tbh it's changed my life and could be a solid compromise for you!"
"I’m so sorry for your loss! Before you try to make another child, I feel as though you should mourn the one you loss together, then work on your marriage, to do things that make you happy, go on a vacation. Something that’ll heal you both. 

I know how exciting and eager you are to make a baby, but you need your marriage to come first right now.

Edit : wording"
"I wouldn't bother. Truth is this is probably not the FIRST time BIL has been out of line, in or out of costume. Your bathing suit is not an excuse and as you said - he singled you out. Whether it was a joke taken too far or him being a dog, your friend failed you. Doesn't matter if she was embaressed by the fact he couldn't behave around kids, she dropped the ball. "
"If this was a stranger asking for money you would say no. If it was someone who treated you badly you would say no. It is family who treated you badly. That makes it worse.

They don’t want you, they want your money and they haven’t approached the request with humility, they’ve just demanded.  If the adults living in that house all got jobs while your mother minded her grandchildren, they could set up a payment plan with the bank. But instead they’re asking you for money money they have no right to. What will you do the next time they use the house as collateral? You won’t be able to bail them out twice.

Tell them that you won’t risk your actual family’s future for people who never treated you as family and you cannot believe they had the nerve to ask. They’ll hate it but they’ll respect you more than they currently do. Not that they’ll ever let it show."
"Or this person has an outrageously jealous SO that can t stand the thought of her interactions with another male.

Op, tell them they can go get an airbnb or a motel room. Stop leaving."
"As other posters have mentioned- I cannot tell you how many times a guy has asked for my number and then called or texted me standing right there! For me it is absolutely an intimidation thing- I figure if I give them my number, they’ll leave me alone, and I can just block it later. 

Some people are great at saying ‘no, fuck off’, but I am not that person. My way of dealing with people who approach me is to be as nice as possible until I can get away. 

Don’t assume the worst of her until you can really confirm she’s doing this with bad intentions."
It sounds like your parents lied to you and you should never trust your parents when it comes to your medical issues in the future. 
where the hell do you live that you’re able to support three adults and one kid in a large suburban house solely on a firefighter’s salary 
"&gt;It's kind of a complicated answer, **because at one point (after being together 3 years or so?) I wanted to get married like crazy, but fiance was indifferent and didn't propose. It resulted in us breaking up and me moving across the U.S. without him, but ultimately we ended up back together, he moved into my house in New State, we then had more fights about marriage, and then broke up AGAIN for a year because of this issue. During this year, I dated other people, and then he suddenly came back and proposed. I was reluctant because of all the delaying, so I turned him down and he was honestly heartbroken. Six months or so later after trying to casually date me again, he proposed again and this time, I said yes.**

&gt;**I think all the back and forth about it had created some resentment on my part and I do sometimes wonder why he even bothered proposing the second time, or why I said yes, just because by the time he proposed the second time I didn't care about getting married any more and was really surprised when he did propose again. I had figured by then, that our relationship would just run its course, and I would probably leave the New State that I'm in anyways, and would break up with him at that time and move on. Fiance knows all of this.**

Talk about burying the lede!

OP, this info really needs to be in your OP.  It will cocompletely change the advice given.

Based on this info, **no, you should not get married because it doesn't sound like you want to be in this relationship, period.**

I was with my husband for over 10 years before we got married, and even though I didn't have that 15 year old new love puppy love feeling any more, I was still excited as fuck to be married to him because I **wanted** to spend the rest of my life with him.

You don't seem to want to be in this relationship and it doesn't seem like you've wanted to be in this relationship for a very long time now.

Divorces are expensive and time consuming."
"Please report him to the police. Even if they can't do anything now, they'll have him on file and that's important. They can keep an eye on him. You have the chance to stop a child from getting molested. "
"If you really do have the paper of the doctor circling ""positive"" you NEED to report her. She could be doing this to other patients."
You should be honest with him. Honestly at this point it might not matter. A rejection and this level of deception would convince a lot of people that the relationship is over. I'm really sorry about your illness but you let him believe for three years that he was building towards a life with you.

"Keep evidence either way. Because while you don’t want to leave her, she might leave you, as sad as it is. "
"Your husband played a major role in creating this situation by not going through the courts to establish a custody agreement.  It sounds like he’s had plenty of time address this matter but has chosen not to. To disrupt everyone’s life over his parental neglect is incredibly irresponsible and callous. 

It’s not too late for him to go to the court and have visitation addressed via an order from a judge/magistrate. You are well within your right to object to such a move that would cause the children in your house to suffer due to his neglect. 
"
"So what you're saying is that you gave up school, jobs, and opportunities, in order to raise his children, but he won't even consider your need for emotional and financial safety? "
"Um, dude? She's still with him. You're the other guy.

Regardless, if she blocked you and had her family block you it's very safe to say you're already broken up. Just roll with it. It's a good thing."
One day I'll have to tell him he really did me a favor with that. My therapist told me about it at our next appointment and we spent most of that time discussing the trust inherent in a good therapist/patient relationship. I left feeling she was 100% in my corner and our sessions became much more in depth and effective. And because of that my life has become pretty awesome.
"They are bullshitting you. You are not in danger of losing your inheritance. Your dad was of sound mind and made a clearly reasoned choice (as his lawyer explained). If you want some more concrete advice, post on r/legaladvice. You’ve done nothing wrong and I’m sorry your family are being such assholes. I think the healthiest thing for you is not to expose yourself to further toxicity and just cut off or severely limit contact with them, for now at least. They are hossible, selfish, greedy people. Just go about your own life and only communicate about logistics to do with receiving the money with your dad’s lawyer. Don’t speak to your family and don’t let them pressure you to not keep the money. They are sending out stupid crap through the grapevine to pressure and scare you, don’t fall for it.

I hope you have close friends and extended family and other people in your life you can lean on. You sound like a stable and mature person and I wish you the best of luck. "

"Agreed with everyone here. Grass wasn’t greener on the other side and she misses her security blanket. Too bad though, you don’t get to fuck around and come back after it doesn’t work out. She dissed you and your feelings my dude, you don’t want to go back to that. If she loved you, she would have talked it out and worked it out, whatever reasons or things she had going on instead of just dropping you for ‘something new’. It hurts and I’m sorry it happened but remind yourself that trash belongs in the garbage. You deserve much better than that. "
Has she tried looking at temp agencies for entry level office work?  Can she handle phone calls and receptionist duties?  There's got to be other 'entry' level jobs than retail that she would be a good fit for.  It's time for her to grow up and realize that living costs money.
"Like you said, she is one of those obsessive and possessive women. Which means anything negative you say about her relationship is only going to push her closer to him and further away from you. I wouldn’t engage her anymore when it comes to her relationship. "
"What had your husband accomplished by the age of 14?

He is being amazingly harsh in his views of her. I'd be very surprised if she didn't already know how he feels. Your poor daughter, I feel for her, I really do. I see the example you gave of her coming downstairs looking unkempt because she knows it would be futile, he wouldn't notice or praise any attempt she made. Plus, she sounds like she could be suffering from depression.

He needs counseling, before he undermines your daughter's self esteem completely (what little she has left)."
"&gt;I've tried saying i don't like it so much, but she just laughs it off

Now there's the big issue here. You communicated a boundary and she's not only chosing her wants over your needs, she is dismissive of it. Sit her down (not on your face) and tell her that she's not respecting your space. You have *asked* her not to do it. Now you're *telling* her not to do it. Explain its fine in the bedroom when you're both actively engaged in sex but its unacceptable anytime else. If she's dismissive then reevaluate the relationship. Her not respecting you and your needs is a deal breaker. "
Does she have some end game you dont know about. Early retirement or something. What's the purpose of money if you can't enjoy spending it. I'm mean the purpose of life is not to work. We work to live not live to work. Have you tried talking to her to see what the purpose of the paper chasing is.
"Something I personally would highly recommend is informing your workplace to never accept calls from/ visits from your sisters. Perhaps it is just my wariness ,but don't completely discount the idea that your parents may have already given the sisters loads of personal information..."
"Call CPS and give them an anonymous tip about what your mother is doing. She is neglecting your brother and endangering his life. She is also setting him up for a difficult lifetime of trouble- an un-potty trained autistic 19/29/39 yo who gets violent will be *much* more difficult to help and get professional help for than addressing these issues while he’s still a child. 

Important: Calling CPS does not automatically mean that they will take your brother away from your family. CPS’s main goal is always child safety and welfare, but right after that their next highest priority is to keep families together. Children who are taken from their families are usually in situations of extreme neglect (like not getting enough food/water, no hygiene maintenance, living in filth, etc) and abuse. 

CPS’s preferred first tactic is often implementing an improvement plan with the parent alongside periodic check ins, connecting them to social services that can help their situation, and/or mandatory parenting classes. 

Call CPS and be totally honest with them about what is going on with your brother’s care, his behavioral problems, and his penchant for violence. For now it’s your best shot at improving his situation. "

"She gives you $10 in cash, you spend that $10 in gas on a credit card, you pay off the credit card bill. 


Does Bella understand how Credit Cards work? There doesn't seem to be any sort of issue here. 



If you want to go the nice route:


I would give her one last shot under the assumption she doesn't understand the cash you give her goes to pay the CC bill. Go over how paying a CC bill works. Let her know that _her_ money is going to that bill, and regardless of if you use the physical cash in hand to pay for an ice cream, or go directly to the bank to deposit it, its going towards the gasoline that you spend to drive her around.


If you _really_ like her, you could also (provided she understands how CCs work) ask her why it bothers her so much that the cash she gave you gets used for non-gasoline. Maybe she has a history of people using her for money and you are seeing the result of that baggage. Not that that is a reason for her to act this way, but talking through it may make her realize that her attitude is not fair.



That said, she's now telling people you're untrustworthy because you spent _your_ money on an ice cream cone. I dont know if you want to continue this friendship. Thats a pretty petty move, not one a friend makes.


I dont think you should ""grovel"" at all. Your friend doesn't know how this works. "
"&gt;She said that she didn’t expect Olivia to be so ""dark"" and how she look more “African”, she asked if she came from a good family, and said if my grandfather was alive he would not approve of her and it’s better to date a girl who can speak Spanish since and most black people won’t even bother to learn it. She even said that my last girlfriend was much prettier than her 

This is awful. I would be absolutely mortified in her shoes.

&gt;I tried to explain the whole ""not wanting to cause a scene"" thing but she didn’t buy it at all. She said she felt like an idiot because her friend told her a lot of Cubans are racist and she defended me so much and accused her friend of being a bigoted jerk and how much I embarrassed her and made her feel like crap.

There are some things that are worth causing a scene for and one of those has to be a family member being racist towards your girlfriend. Her bringing up that incident is her way of telling you what her values are - she doesn't abide racism and she calls it out, even when she hears it from friends and it may 'cause a scene'. You clearly didn't. It's not about her defending you so you have to defend her, it's about what she holds dear to her integrity as a person. That's why it doesn't matter if she understood or not, your actions should have been the same regardless because your values would also not abide racism. You telling her that you didn't want to call out all the racist things your grandmother said because you didn't want to 'cause a scene' is you saying that maintaining social niceties was more important to you than standing up for her or objecting to clearly racist trash from your own family.

&gt;I feel like she thinks my whole family are racist assholes as well when it’s definitely not the case.

I don't know about that - if your grandmother was saying this in front of the whole family and only you were attempting to tell her to stop whilst your *dad and brother laughed...* If I was Olivia there seems to be a lot of evidence that your family are racist. You can say they're not all you like, but she's seen actual proof they are.

In terms of what you can do, you need to apologise unreservedly and accept it will be a long time before she wants to see your family again. You also need to talk to your family about how all of that was incredibly rude and intolerant so it doesn't happen again."

Your wife made a major mistake in being a listening post for so long and is probably concerned that her sister may blame her for BIL's inappropriate advances. 

It's not on you to tell but you definitely do not have to keep up false appearances.  Tell her that her desire to protect him is problematic for you and she needs to get her priorities straight."

"&gt; EDIT: I don't know if it changes anything but he said the reason why he was on his phone so much was because I didn't plan enough for his visit, and that he wants to change atmosphere every once in a while, go out and so on. And that's why he kept himself busy with his phone...

And he's incapable of planning because...?

This is a ridiculous excuse and even if it were true, the way adults handle this stuff is by COMMUNICATING, not burying their face in their phone. He presumably has a mouth and can say the words, ""I want to change things up, let's go out."" Pouting and/or punishing you by ignoring you in favor of social media is the behavior of a child.

Also, watching TV while you two are engaged sexually is so beyond unacceptable. You can do so much better than this guy."
"I had a guy that did that kind of crap to me all the time. He would do whatever for a long time and then show up really late when we were planning to hang out. After two years of that, you know how I ended it? He was supposed to come to my place at 8....and at 10:30 he still wasn’t there. Some of my girlfriends called and they were at a bar really close to where I lived. I straight up got up and left and didn’t even tell him I wouldn’t be home. He called super pissed at 11:30(!!!!) and I told him to go fuck himself. It was very liberating.

Don't forget either that you now know that she's the type to externalize blame instead of accept responsibility for her faults and failings. Do you really want to spend your life with someone who does that?"

\&gt;  He told me he saw that James did and said it was only because they were talking about something sad.  

Your husband is being awful.  He is dismissing your feelings, denying his friend's behavior, and blowing it off with sexist comments.  Your husband has placed his friend's feelings and his own comfort over standing up for HIS WIFE.

"$3000-4000 to attend a wedding, as a guest, is crazy expensive. That's about a fourth of what my entire wedding cost.

OP, I think you should tell him what someone else suggested, but do it preemptively, not after you get caught. Just say that you had been planning this trip, had to cancel for work, but are now able to go because your meeting was cancelled. If he pushes back, I would honestly say that it's too expensive to attend and you found out about it way after you saved up for your trip. If he wants to give you $4000, that's the only way you should say yes."
"Oooooohhhhh, girl I am seething for you. Unfortunately, you’ve just learned that your dad would rather protect the honor of a certified creep than his daughter who he has presumably cared for and loved her whole life.

Your response to him was the most perfect thing you could have said in this situation, and it’s incredibly disappointing that his character is so truly weak.

"Why is it embarrassing for her to comment on your nipples being visible, if you're comfortable with them being visible? Would you not just say, ""yes I know"" Or ""I'm ok with that""?

Is it that she's telling you what to do? Is it because it's always awkward to comment on someone's body? Or is it that she's implicitly shaming you for making your own choices?

Isolating specifically why it's bothering you may help you choose an effective response.  It's also worth thinking about because she will probably not be the last person to comment about it and having a response is a good thing. 

Edit: please stop explaining to ME why her mom's behavior is inappropriate. I know. OP benefits from self identifying her reasons for dislike because it gives her the ability to clearly articulate her feelings and makes for greater chance of a successful resolution with mom."
"This is why I always disagree with the people who say you shouldn't break up over the phone, you should do it in person because it's nicer. In cases like this, it's actually cruel and selfish, but since everyone insists on that idea people get it in their heads that it's the only right way to do things. It's like when a friend of mine made her then bf drive an hour to meet her just so she could dump him. He told me later he'd have preferred a text so he didn't waste his gas and time.

I'd say try and find something fun to do with the rest of your time. Maybe visit family or friends you haven't seen for a while, or go do something you've wanted to but haven't had the time for. Something to keep yourself occupied. "

Sorry to tell you this but you have to throw the whole partner away. "
Get a lock for your bedroom door and use it. Your step-son isn't a child. He's a disabled MAN with all of the hormones of a normal young adult and no clear outlet. The way your husband is handling this is demeaning and horrific.

"First of all, your sexual urges are normal and healthy for an 18-yr old and chances are good he has similar urges. And I totally get wanting your first experiences to be with someone you feel safe and comfortable with. But before just diving in with ""Hey can I give you a blow job?"" there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself. 

1. Is it worth risking your friendship? You have no reference point for knowing this now but sex really does change the dynamic of any friendship and I'd hate for you to lose your friend afterwards to the potential awkwardness that may follow.

2. Is he attracted to you? You've mentioned you have recently began to feel an attraction to him but you need to determine whether he sees you as a woman or as a kind of sisterly best friend. 

3. If he is as inexperienced as you are (and from what I understand of your post this seems to be the case) he might not be ready for such intimate contact. Yes, he's an 18-yr old male with hormones and probably has fantasies of blow jobs but sometimes the reality of it can be a lot more intimidating. 

I think ultimately you are determined to give it a shot and that's perfectly okay! But just consider these points first and then have an adult conversation with him about the possibilities. Part of having a mature sexual experience is communicating boundaries and expectations and a frank conversation can also save you a lot of embarrassment if he's not sexually attracted to you. Whatever you do, don't bust out with a straight up offer to blow him. This could catch him off guard and is also something you should work up to - After you get past the first kiss (and a few other basics). 

Good luck with whatever you decide to do! "
"You have to find a way to approach her about this stuff, even if you admit to overstepping your boundaries. She's being much more dishonest with you, so you can't be in the wrong."
"She’s embarrassed.

The only cure for embarrassment is usually letting time pass. 

Just remind her that you don’t think she’s horrible and she’ll eventually get over the whole situation. "

"&gt;She also had left their cat behind, who was neglected and meowing.

You've got this whole narrative that his ex was horrible, she caused the mess at his apartment, she neglected the cat. But he lived there too...and he didn't take care of his home and his cat when his ex moved out. Rather than taking care of himself, his home, and his cat, he let you spend a week helping him with cleaning, unpacking, organizing, and decorating. You're probably taking care of the cat now, too. 

You might see this as a sign that he trusts and respects you, but in fact you took on a ton of work that was his responsibility. Your bf doesn't sound as great as you seem to think he is. 

Also, you know all kinds of gossip about his family, even though they've been avoiding you. That means your bf talks to them, discusses how they don't like you, and then tells you. Examine your bf's role in stirring up this drama."
For me the real dealbreaker would be your GF's attitude towards friendships.

"This is so far removed from being your problem. This is like, your problem’s fourth cousin by marriage. It exists in the same universe, and there’s a chance you may cross paths with it someday, but it’s not something that is going to impact your daily life at all. 

I don’t even know why this idiot called you. What does he want? A shoulder to cry on? Sympathy breakup sex? A godparent for his bad-idea baby? Does he want you to beg for him back? None of this requires any action from you. You sit your pretty little self down and block his number and start actually moving on. He is your ex now, and you need to start thinking of him as such. 

Pain is normal. Fantasizing about what could have been is fine. Letting your ex cry to you about his pregnant rebound? Not on the post-breakup to do list. Cut that shit out. "
"Maybe just say you’d prefer it as immediate family for this photo session, but if he’d like a bigger family photo then he’s welcome to organise one. 

Once he realises how difficult it is to schedule he may give up on this point..."
"Does your BF tend to judge people on their education or appearances (SH's tattoos)? Or did this come out of no where? Does he come from a family that's like that? Or who all have degrees? Some more context would help. 

Regardless, if you feel like dumping him, then dump him. His refusal to apologize, right off the bat, shows that he is not good at compromise, or settling disagreements in a reasonable way, which is a red flag. A 21 year old should know it's not appropriate to talk about your sister like that. "
"&gt; and not placate them anymore than I really need to

You don't need to placate them *at all*.   

And quite honestly, your marriage needs a reset too.  Grown women do not act like a bunch of pre-teens 7-10 days a month.   Is your wife sleeping away from home that often too?  If so, why did she get married at all?  

Tell her that her friends are welcome to sleep over a maximum of one night a month and you will not going anywhere then either.  Then you and your wife need to get busy being an actual married couple doing couple activities. 

"
"Holy shit. Stop planning *anything.* If he's dead set on having a lavish wedding for hundreds of people for $6500 and he's dissatisfied with all your efforts to accommodate him, let him plan the damn thing himself."
"I have always found it so sad when women feel the need to compete with their daughters. It's honestly **gross** to me. I think you need to sit down with your wife, and be honest that you have seen her reactions when her daughter is around. And if she keeps it up, her daughter is going to notice. I'd call her out on her immature behavior so she can no longer pretend she's fooling anybody. It's psychological and borderline creepy she's doing all of that. Actually - no - it is creepy. "

This seems to be the general gist of it: I'm just going to have to put my foot down and not placate them anymore than I really need to. They just need to be respectful of the fact that it's my home.
"&gt; I can't trust myself. My whole life has been around ""well what will he think? **How can I make it so he isn't upset.** Is this what's best for him?"" **He constantly dismisses me and my opinions as crazy, or naive, or selfish.** I end up believing him and in an **effort to avoid conflict**, I always bend to him.

This part is another BIG red flag for emotional abuse. I'm really glad you're in therapy. Keep working with her during your divorce. This guy does not deserve you."

"Am I the only one who thinks these comments are rude regardless of circumstance?  Asking an early 30s female when she will have a baby, immediate family asking for grandkids, etc. I feel like this is always in very poor taste.

"A lot of times I will mentally cross someone off if I meet them while they're dating someone else even if I would otherwise be into them. I think that a lot of people do that. And so, sometimes later when they're not dating anyone, I'll take another look at them for some reason or another, it re-clicks for me. I don't know that you're the backup option as much as someone who re-emerged since she had mentally crossed you off earlier due to your relationship at the time. If you're into her and she's into you, that's all that matters."
"Or even ""I know you don't intend to be cruel but..."" which puts the person less on the defensive and might make them more receptive."
"&gt;she wants to eat my mom's food as PROOF that my mom is attentive and caring.

Why does there need to be proof that your mom is attentive and caring? She’s not dating your mom. Is she planning to hold *you* responsible if your mom doesn’t meet her standards? Does she realize that you can’t control other people...?"
Oh yeah definitely. There had to be some overlap there. Reason #781 why this is a huge deal. He's cheated before. Possibly for the entire 11 years.
"I think your boundaries are reasonable. He tries to sabotage you, he doesn't bring anything good into your life, and he fills you with anxiety and dread. These are all good reasons to not have someone in your life. Hold your boundaries and make it clear to your other family members that you love them but you cannot have him in your life. "
Definitely don’t move in with him. You’ll be stuck with rent and bills. He needs to grow up.

You be cordial, respectful, and friendly.  But you don't hang out with her, or socialize with her, or anything.

"He looks down on the way you dress, the size of your body, and your age and has actually EXPRESSED that he thinks he's better than you. He clearly thinks he's superior and wants to improve you to his standards. 

The only reason he's dating you is because he thinks if he shits all over your self esteem long enough you'll keep thinking he's great even when he continues to reveal what a complete jerk he is. He won't get that from someone who knows better.

He insults you to boost his ego. He may say your age makes you immature but he acts like a 15 year old. 

Do yourself a favor and don't let people walk all over you like this. You absolutely should not be giving your love and affection to people who only like an idealized version of you. He's made it quite clear that he isn't and won't be happy with the version of you that you really are."

"I would suggest going to a PC shop and asking them to look through your computer and remove any spyware they can find.

But first - absolutely the first thing you do - pack up your shit and get away from this guy. This is nuts. 


&gt; I don't really feel like it's fair of me to throw everything away because of spying,

Seriously, this sentence here in particular is so nuts - it's not 'fair'? Of course it's fair!! This guy is not the kind of guy you want to be in a relationship with! Ever!"
You did the right thing. He sounds selfish and uncaring. I'm sure you'll find someone much nicer with time 
"Yeah I’m a millennial in a big liberal city (aka surrounded by people who aren’t supposed to be bothered by it) and the braless thing definitely bothers more people than you’d think. People talk. It’s like when a guy wears really loose shorts where you can see an outline — it’s a lot more than you wanted to see. And you kind of can’t help but know what they’d look like naked. Obviously there are plenty of shirts where it’s not a big deal, but other times it can be very uncomfortable, even if people won’t comment on it or treat you differently.

So I can completely understand how her mother, who grew up in a totally different environment, would be disturbed by her daughter walking around in a way that, especially in front of her acquaintances, would be viewed as inappropriate or sexual. Yes, it’s OP’s body, but people are definitely noticing and forming opinions on her bralessness. She’s perfectly entitled to keep on keeping on, but I happen to think the wiser thing would be to find a middle ground and wear a tank or something when she’s around mom so she’s not entirely uncomfortable looking at her. 

Or at least stop being so dismissive of her mother’s understandable concern.

And OP: You might think this sucks, but depending on what career you’re going into this WILL affect you. People might not say anything but they will be noticing. Going braless is fine in school or weekends, but there are many cases (or groups of people) where it won’t work in your favor."
"Say no.  You don't want to have a 19 year-old party-girl tenant who most likely doesn't intend to pay rent, buy groceries, or clean.

There's a story about why she doesn't have housing... and I don't think you're going to get an honest answer about that story.  Maybe she was kicked out of the dorms? Maybe she has no money to pay rent?  Whatever the reason, it's likely that reason would also be a reason to not let her live with you.

So, tell her, ""We'd love to have dinner with you, occasionally, but we're not interested in having a tenant."""
"Wait a second here, your wife has a graduate degree. You are obviously skilled but she could clearly work if chose to. It’s totally understandable that she doesn’t want to do all the housework, that’s why you get a degree in the first place...tell her to get a job n then y’all can hire a maid :D 

Kinda joking there, but not really."
"&gt;I (26F) asked my husband (26M) if he saw me as his equal. It took him an hour to decide.

"&gt; Why the hell are grown women having this many sleepovers in a month first of all? 

My question as well.

"
"TBF, it sounds like she was extremely sheltered in life and being a SAHW just fed into that.

OP, if you are doing well at your job and like the city then maybe you need to tell her that until you reach X position or Y years of experience, New City is home.  She needs to come up with $XX per month for you two to break even per month, in whatever job she wants to work.  If she wants to take advantage of the city and all it has to offer or not, it's up to her."
"OK OP so I went through this situation almost exactly with my SO. I'm the gal and the messy one, though. 

Warning because this is long, but bear with me:

My whole life I've been messy and scatterbrained. Not ""gross"" in the way of, say, rotting food in the sink or dirty panties in the living room. But I rarely made my bed.  I have a lot of stuff and a lot of clothes, and I tend to grab something I need, then clean forget that it exists; which means cabinet doors get left open, jars aren't put back properly on things, glasses of water spend immeasurable days on my bedside table, towels are left in piles, etc. 

It's like I get blinders on. I'm also a business owner who works from home so I'm normally highly, highly distracted which doesn't help. 

My partner is the opposite. He's super neat -- like, take-a-white-glove-to-the-countertops neat. Bed made every morning, perfectly pressed and folded clothes, no dishes in the sink ever. He has a nose like a shark and smells EVERYTHING in the trash if it goes remotely off, just like his mom -- it was also a huge part of the reason he didn't have pets growing up (we have 2 cats now). I jokingly call him ""the optimizer"" because he has a perfectly efficient, tidy, and smart way of doing pretty much every single thing in the house. 

So when we moved in together, none of this was news to me (we'd been dating for 2.5 years at that point). And I... tried, I really did. But it was never good enough. He'd come home from a stressful day at work and I'd hear him huffing and banging pots and pans around in the dishwasher I'd just loaded ""incorrectly"", or re-spraying the countertops I'd just sprayed because I didn't do a job up to his standards. It made me absolutely fucking nuts, and, like you, it made me want to quit. 

This is a mistake. Because what I didn't realize then, but what I *do* realize now, is that this this is actually an opportunity. It's your first chance to really figure out how you both can meet in the middle on something very important to both of you.

Compromise sounds so easy because you both get pieces of what you want, right? Wrong. Compromise is actually extremely hard to do correctly, because it takes two people making promises to each other that aren't 100% what they want that they must commit to keeping (hence the word itself, heh heh). 

To start, see it from her side for a second. Yes, she is hurting your feelings. That is valid. 

...But she is setting also setting a standard for cleanliness for the house (to avoid bugs, gross smells, vermin, stains -- anything that can leave it in worse condition and threaten your deposit if you're renting, or really cause problems if you own your house), and you are flat out refusing to comply and trying to punish her for it by letting 100% of household duties fall on her shoulders. This is only making her more angry, more resentful, and will probably torpedo your relationship if you let it go on long enough. 

So what happens next? What changed for me?

What it came down to for me was realizing that while I did not *purposefully* wreak havoc or create mess or do things wrong or upset my partner, the things I was doing were having that impact anyway. My intent did not matter. Similarly, I'm sure she's not intending to talk down to you or frustrate you into doing nothing, but when she feels like she's said something 20 times and you say ""Uh huh, yeah, sure"" and then don't do it, it sets her off too, and may make her wonder what else you'll drop the ball on when things are more serious.

You guys have to find the middle here. Sit down calmly and with love (a glass of wine may help) and ask her what she NEEDS from you as far as cleanliness. Then, tell her what YOU need. Then, figure out where the middle is.

For us, it came down to a few things: 

Thing 1: Me trying much harder to follow the rules he gave me more precisely. Whether I liked it or not, the rules were more or less correct. His way of hanging towels/cleaning dishes/ etc. were better than mine, period. I just needed to pay better attention. 

Thing 2:  Him easing up on the rules in general. OK, so I won't wear my street clothes in bed, but the sky isn't going to fall if there was a stray tiny lettuce leaf accidentally left on the counter. But I'd look twice for the lettuce leaf. 

Thing 3: We have clear duties. Since I'm home most of the day, I make sure the dishes are done, counters wiped, and bed made when he gets home. This takes maybe 10 minutes out of any day, less if I'm not cooking. He does the vacuuming, changes the sheets, and cleans the toilet/shower one day a week. We trade off on the cat litter. We also cook on alternate nights, and whoever doesn't cook does the evening dishes, and we never leave dirty dishes in the sink if we can possibly avoid it.

Thing 4: We also have housekeepers who come once or twice a month and that's been a game changer for the sweeping/mopping/dusting side of things. I never mopped, he swept, mopped, and dusted once a week on the dot. It was cutting into the free time we got together, so we decided to get some help for that, and it worked. Both of us are MUCH happier.

Thing 5: I accepted cleaning is stress release for him. Sometimes I've just gotta let him stress clean something that's already clean and not take it personally. It resets his chi or whatever. I just let him do it, even if it was something I cleaned, and we carry on. It does not happen often anymore.

Nowadays friends come to my house and are shocked by my ""transformation"", but really it's just compromise. When he leaves town I regress to my slopoppotamous self for a bit, but it never lasts more than a day or two, because before long I'm like ""Ewww what's that smell? This place is a pigsty, hahaha."" Growth, I guess!

There's this saying ""We judge others by their actions and ourselves by our best intentions"". Make this your mantra for the time being if you want to fix this. You can do it. You will both have to be willing to change a little for the other, but you can do it. You're going to have to go through this process on a range of topics and challenges for the rest of your lives together, so you might as well get your practice in now before things get more serious.

And if you don't want to change or continue the relationship, that's OK too! But this is super common, and can be a chance for y'all to learn new things about each other and who you are as a team. And that is a very cool thing.

Good luck!

"No mention of any kind of support system, being that NA, rehab, counselling... That's the step that he needs to take."
"Tough luck on her not wanting to talk about Sasha. It's sad that she's deteriorated this bad, but it sounds like Sasha has been a carer for years and has missed out a lot on his youth. He's put in a really inappropriate position and now he's supposed to float somewhere on his own. She might not want to discuss what happens to him after, but Sasha's father can take initiative and he should. Start discussing things with that man and work around this without your mothers family. 

It will help to do this in steps. More than likely, Sasha will have to move out before October, because your mother is getting very weak and it can't be the responsibility of a 13 y.o. to witness that or help her out there. He should go to his father, while your grandparents perhaps move in with your mom. "
"Your father is an asshole.

He essentially was using you to manipulate you and try to get out of the money he OWED you. He's using his ""love"" as a weapon to manipulate you. That is not a loving father.

"This is not normal behavior for a shelter employee or owner. At all. Sounds kind of like the food she gave you is a way to make you feel obligated enough to her to let her make inappropriate demands to visit your cat.

Many LGBTQ+ people lose their families when they choose to come out. Even families who are accepting of other people being LGBTQ+ are horrid to family members that come out. It instills a lot of fear and doubt in someone that coming out will end poorly. Your brother did not mean to hurt you, he was likely afraid he would lose you and the rest of your family. 

It might be worth joining your local PFLAG group to meet other people who've gone through a similar experience as you and learn how you can support your brother. "
"You can only have a normal relationship with normal people. Your parents are... not that.

" I think your point of not just automatically allowing her to move in is valid and I agree, it should be a discussion.

I do have to say though, you are being pretty judgemental. 

&gt; but she would only offer vague responses and would quickly change the subject. Everyone seemed to overlook this in favor of the joy they felt at having her back, but I found it odd. What is she hiding? That's what I wanted to know.

It isn't that she is ""hiding"" anything. Seven years being homeless is not easy. Seven years being homeless and having a mental illness is not easy. Seven years being homeless, having a mental illness, and being a woman, is even less easy. A family party isn't the environment for her to spill her guts to you. If she doesn't want to talk about it five minutes after finding her family, she doesn't have to. You aren't entitled to that information. It is up to her, when and if she wants to talk about it with someone. You said she seemed ""haunted by her demons"". Why would she want to talk about those demons with people she's barely seen and knows anymore? You have no idea what she went through, and a lot of it is likely deeply, deeply, personal. 

&gt; An unstable grown woman with a substance use problem who was deceiving everyone with what had transpired in those missing years.

Is this ""substance use problem"" coming from your suspicion of her being drunk? Because if so, you are assuming an awful lot. If she has a mental illness, she may be on medication. And medications for schizophrenia aren't like popping an advil. They can really affect a person's outward behavior. 

You need to understand, it is his sister. Who he cares about and thought he would never see again, and you are being pretty judgemental in this post. I think you need to be a little bit more empathetic and not refer to her as a mentally ill substance abuser. You both need to do research on her mental illness, and I think it would be beneficial for you to do some research about things that homeless women often experience.

"While your sister may have overreacted a bit in the moment, I totally get why she’s trying to keep a 25 year old away from you. By the time I was 25, 18 year olds looked like children to me. A lot of people on reddit probably won’t agree with me but I think it’s really creepy. Our maturity level grows exponentially from 18 to mid twenties and it worries me when people in their mid to late twenties date people younger than 21. There tends to be a reason why those people aren’t dating people closer to their age. Obviously, there are exceptions but chances are this dude is kinda creepy. This is fully grown man who is a stranger that has his age range set to as young as possible on tinder. That sets off an alarm bell in my head. I bet your sister has some experience with dudes like this too and that’s part of the reason she reacted the way she did.

You need to talk to your sister. Right now she’s probably questioning if she made the right decisions in how she took care of you for the past two years. She’s also probably worried of exactly how this guy may have taken advantage of you. Or if you’re back in contact with him. You need to give your sister some slack, she’s only 2 years older than you and got thrust into role of your caretaker. That’s so difficult. She never got to be a kid. Your sister obviously loves you a lot and she has your best interests in heart. I wasn’t responsible for my younger sibling the same way she has been, and honestly in her place I would reacted the exact same way. 

If you get back on tinder, I strongly recommend that you change your age range to 18-22 or 18-23 and unmatch with anyone older than 22-23 too."

They're actually great covers and I've parked under one for years.

A solid car port that isn't one of those gable ones on the side of the road, but one that is 10'x20' pre-fabricated to fit a lean to style carport would run about $2,660 at Lowe's plus tax. A freestanding same size would run about $3,942 plus tax. I sell em for a living and just wanted to give you an idea of cost.

Sounds like he's been googling the shit out of children not looking like their fathers"
"I agree with this. I don't think I would throw away a relationship over this, but her boyfriend isn't blameless. People are setting such a low bar for him. Like doing the minimum of what you are supposed to do in a relationship is something that makes you a great partner or should be celebrated for.

Her boyfriend went on a walk, alone, for hours, around a lake with a woman he met at a bar. In all the hours of talking, he didn't once mention he has a girlfriend until she asked him. That's a recipe for disaster. It doesn't take a genius to not put yourself in that position."
"&gt;I don't know if it changes anything but he said the reason why he was on his phone so much was because I didn't plan enough for his visit,

If it changes anything, it only makes it even more important for you to dump this guy immediately.   He is just as responsible as you for keeping the relationship fun.  If he can't pay attention to you in the short time you have together then he is just not into you and you need to break up.  At four months you should be in the honeymoon phase and you are not."
"Shave it for the wedding, grow it out later and keep it for the period of time the bet requires. 

Also, yeah, if it weren't between friends one of whom is Mexican, ""tortilla slingers"" is pretty racist."
"Guy code? I haven't heard that since middleschool. Your husband is 31 years old, tell him to grow the fuck up or he can't come with you to the wedding."
"Your house, your rules.

As a guest I'd be mortified to demand one of my hosts to move out for the duration of my stay, much less require it."
"*""Telling him he obviously doesn't care about his father. That if he's just going to stay downstairs playing video games he should just call his mom to come get him. That he's ungrateful.""*

Holy fucking hell your bf is a manipulative, emotionally abusive asshole! 

That poor kid. You do realize that the ""love fests"" and sleeping together are probably the poor child's attempts to placate his father and ""prove"" his love, right?

The child's behavior of ""needing approval"" isn't strange, *it's a learned behavior due to his father's abusive manipulation.* Like ffs, you're making it sound like some of this is originating from the child.  It isn't.  The child is reacting."
"Division of labor aside, there is no excuse for not fixing you a plate if they’re already cooking for themselves. That’s just shockingly awful. I mean, family dinner is so basic. To me that is the greatest example of not caring about your partner."
I would bring the bottle of wine home and then request a roommate change 
"No. Just no with this guy. The only way you get over when someone has hurt you is when they change the behavior that hurts you. He seems to be getting worse. You shouldn't need to tell your 25 YO LD BF to put is phone down when you're having sex.

And by the way, if he's fingering you, you *are* having sex. You're just not having PIV sex."
"Your wife does not sound at all mentally well, and this obsession with having a baby girl seems to be a symptom of that. Please don’t have another child with this woman."
"I think the real issue here is not how she's feeling, but that she's refusing to talk to you about how she's feeling and then is withdrawing.  If you've been together 3.5 years, she should be able to talk to you.  I think you should point out to her that you've noticed the change in her mood and behavior."
"How could this situation possibly go on for 3.5 years? Six months? Ok. But this is deceptive on a whole new level, plus how could you be so willfully blind? This is so strange no matter how I try to wrap my brain around it."
"Lisa is the SHIT. You need to start a fucking fan club for her. 

Also, her sister shouldn't pay the bill for the ""security"" that was AWOL when it counted."
"The men who talk like your bf just did are doing you a favour. They are showing you their inner mindset. That they devalue anything they consider feminine and admire what they consider masculine. 

Considering that you are female, and not considering a gender change, it may behoove you to dig further into his mindset to see how deep that goes or leave. Be careful when digging - he may just say whatever he feels he needs to, to keep you while actually thinking a lot of derogatory stuff - stuff that will affect you in the end if you stay with him longterm.

Some guys said similar shit to me when I was dating. The funniest I can remember is a guy saying something along the lines of ""wow you are so different and have deep interests unlike other women who are into handbags and shit""??? Never spoke with him again. 

Bizarre anyone would think putting down *my* gender would make me feel good about him. "
"I feel like this comment section is becoming a bit heated, so do what you've likely been doing from the start: keep things professional between you and Matt. Don't bring this up to him, and treat him like you would any other supervisor. No contact outside of your internship. We have no idea why his wife would say what she said, but it's not your problem. It becomes your problem if you develop a relationship with Matt that goes beyond professional. 

If there are more outtings in the future where you know his wife will be there and it's not a mandatory gathering, don't go. If it's mandatory, exchange hellos and stick with your peers."
"&gt; He always has to be the one to initiate it. 

so he needs to be in control of the sex...

&gt; He’s very physically fit and active and is still in better shape than I  am, even with all of my progress. Which is why it surprises me that he  hasn’t been supportive. 

he is uncomfortable with you improving your looks...

&gt; I enthusiastically said I wanted to clean it. He responded that I was making him feel like a failure. 

he needs to be in control of the household stuff...

&gt; Last night he was being very rude to me regarding everything, 

he needs to be in control of your emotions...

&gt; Then he starts being nice to me again immediately. Like a switch was flipped. 

He is only happy when he feels like he has power over you. Your instincts are spot on. your partner should celebrate your life victories, not be threatened by them."
"&gt;For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday."
"OP isn't much better.  He's basically trying to excuse his racist old grandma's behavior by blaming it on the fact his gf understood.  


I have a racist old windbag of a Hispanic grandmother too. Any time she started with her racist crap we all collectively walked out on her leaving her alone. She learned to shut her ignorant mouth.  "
"she's being unreasonable. the minute she gave the money to you, it became yours to do with whatever the hell you want. does she want you to go into the gas station every time and give them 'her' $5 to use on pump 3? ridiculous. you're still spending your money on gas, she's just reimbursing you for what you spend.

lightning edit: if this is the hill that she wants your friendship to die on, so be it. now you know she is a shallow friend that will only give out money with irrational strings attached"
"What your mom did when she was 16 was risky, and she knows it.  For every story like hers and your dads, there are many more that come out really badly.  Aren’t there things you did when you are younger that you look back on fondly but that (say for example) you’d say “no” to if you were babysitting a kid.  

Like maybe you had some times you stayed up past bedtime and had a good time!  Yay!  But if you were babysitting a little kid, you would be really irresponsible to let them stay up all night just because they wanted to.  Would that be hypocritical too?  Or there may have been times when you were younger and you didn’t eat your vegetables, will it be hypocritical for you to tell your (hypothetical) kids to do so?  Seriously, let this whole “hypocritical” thing go, ASAP.

That said, I don’t think this is really that big of an age gap, at all.  But maybe wait till you’re actually 18.  It’s not that far off.  "
"I came here to say exactly this.  Enjoy falling in love and being in love!  But do not mistake intense chemistry for true compatibility.  True compatibility takes time to uncover.  It's entirely possible that you guys have both intense chemistry and true compatibility. If so....great!  Just don't make any large financial or life decisions until you've taken the time to discriminate between those two things, and you'll be fine.  "
"Honestly from the sounds of it, if she can’t see the potential major harm this can have on your relationship then there is a much bigger underlying issue. Definitely tell her exactly how you feel and that her staying out late with a single, not well known guy, who is obviously into her is not an okay activity in your relationship. Like really I get having fun and hanging out, Ive got single male friends of my own. But Im not staying alone at their place and ignoring my SO into wee hours of the night. What she did might not have been ill-intended but it wasnt a good thing to do. Especially not getting back to you for 2+ hours while they were just “talking”.

Tell her Dave’s a nice guy but he sounds like he wants to be more than fast friends."
"She's a flaky friend.  It doesn't mean she's not a nice person or fun to be around, but she clearly isn't reliable.  

If you want to maintain the friendship, you could resolve to only plan things with her that are going to happen whether she's there or not.  Meaning something like: you and a bunch of people are getting drinks; you invite her too.  If she flakes, you'll still go out with your other friends.  Or ""Hey friend, three of us are going to this concert; if you're interested here's the link for tickets.""  Don't give her rides places, or let her know that she may need to Uber home. Don't make any more financial commitments that rely on her sticking with a plan (and don't let her use your Amazon account.  The idea is to minimize entanglements).

If you decide that dealing with her flakiness is more than you choose to put up with, that's fine too.  You don't  need to blow up the friendship; just don't make any more plans with her.  She asks you to get drinks? You're busy that evening.  I wouldn't go off on her, that's just going to result in her complaining to all your mutual friends about how you got mad at her for having foot pain.  But you're entitled to put up some boundaries and decide how much unreliability you can deal with."
"This is so sad because although this behaviour is totally inexcusable, he must be in a lot of pain with his wife dying. Personally I wouldn’t tell his wife, she’s already got so much to deal with and this would only cause even more distress. I would probably mention it to your parents however (maybe not the full extent) so they don’t invite him around for a drink when you are around. As for you, I’d absolutely tell him you are not interested and that his behaviour needs to stop now. Block his number and make every effort to not be around him again. "
I have no advice but you are my goddamn hero.
"How frequently are his outings now? How often do you get out? Also, you mentioned family lunch, you don't go to family lunch too? Or does he ever being your daughter to family lunch?"
"So ya'll are just going to gloss over the racial shit in the first paragraph?  Who the hell calls people ""tortilla slingers"" and thinks that's ok?  Why the hell did you even include that in your post?"
"What would I do in that situation?

Probably scurry around desperately trying to find security. Because I am a chicken and hate confrontation. (Ask me about the time I hid behind wine in Whole Foods to avoid running into my boyfriend’s ex who I’ve never met and is probably just as scared of me).

What did your girlfriend do?

Be kickass, amazing, take charge, defend her family, and all around the hero of pretty much anyone who has ever seen a crazy person show up at a wedding in a wedding dress when they’re not the bride.

Keep telling her you respect her so much and think she’s awesome. That it was the single most badass thing you’ve ever seen. She stopped it right in its tracks pouring a drink on her fake wedding dress. Exactly what that crazy ex deserved.

Of course you don’t champion violence. So you don’t say that. You tell her what you do admire about what she did (stood up for her sister. Took charge when security wasn’t around. Stood strong in a tough situation.)"
"My wife and I married last October. Before the wedding, she told me that she was having second thoughts. We both attributed that to nerves. 

We signed our divorce papers yesterday. 

Do yourself AND him a favor and don’t marry unless you have no doubts. This doesn’t mean that you have to end your relationship. "
"I think if you focus on why you're making the resquests you are of them,they can understand you better. ""Will you help me by picking up your toys/clothes/dishes because with the new baby I'm feeling overwhelmed doing this all by myself"" and ""will you g back and wash your hands because we are trying to stay extra clean this summer due to dad's surgery and new baby."" "
"Send both posts to Emily's ex, expose Emily as a lying crazy girl. 

You're doing the right thing but i would ensure this is all documented. Someone this crazy can't be trusted. The simple accusation of domestic abuse will destroy someone's life. If she is willing to turn on her partner/ ex then she could do far worse. 

Also please say your bf knows about this. She may try to contact him. "
"I also think OP's response was fine, but I don't think even he was suggesting he should have lied. Just maybe not commented specifically on the way her body is different. Something more general, like ""Are you kidding? You're gorgeous, come here,"" would have been just as true and maybe more reassuring to her in an insecure moment.

Again, to be 100% clear, I don't think OP did anything wrong here. This wasn't a cruel comment, even accidentally, and his partner seems to understand that logically even if she's havjng a hard time at the moment with her self-image. Lots of affection and a bit of patience and (all being well) this should blow over soon enough."
"*we stopped being able to leave the bathroom door open, because the cat will shit on the mat or in the sink.*

"Possible translation: He's dating around, was lukewarm about you but whatever he had going on with another chick didn't work out so he's trying to bounce back to you. You're absolutely right when you say he doesn't seem to give a shit about you."
"Sit down with GF and watch *My Big Fat Greek Wedding*

When it is over, rewatch the scene with the aunt having difficulty figuring out what to do with a vegetarian, where she concludes ""I make lamb.""

Then say to your GF, ""That's what you are dealing with with my mom. Very well meaning and caring, but she is just not going to get it. You'll tell her you are allergic to lamb, but lamb is so central to what she does, it won't register.""

Then bring your own food and an epipen just to be sure, no matter what your GF says."
"For real, everyone is here like ""stay away from him"" or ""yeah it's ok to tell her parents."" Uh, what the fuck? He's offering drugs to a minor and can't stop talking to underage girls. Call the fucking police."
"Does she understand how the rewards card works? Is there a chance she thinks it's basically giving you free gas?

I also totally agree with another poster that she should be grateful to have a friend who is willing to drive her around. Even if she pays for the gas you're still giving her time out of your day. I would just stop giving her rides tbh"
"I feel like you're being used. You're driving her around, helping with her cosmetology classes and now you're taking care of her dog.

She's not even your friend. She's the ex-fwb (4 months) of your current BF, so I am not sure why you're doing all these things for her? You can still be friendly, but this is too much. "
"This is such important advice that could save a lot of women a lot of heartache and frustration. Being upset by someone’s actions doesn’t make you ‘hysterical.’ Having expectations doesn’t make you ‘unreasonable’ and stating those expectations doesn’t make you ‘high maintenance.’ 

So much pressure is put on women to be the ‘cool girlfriend’ which basically boils down to minimising your own wants and needs, whilst catering and mothering a man. No. That’s not good enough and it’s unacceptable. 

Ladies, stop buying into this nonsense- the ‘cool girlfriend’ is an image perpetrated by men so they can accept as little responsibility as possible whilst having a woman shoulder it all, and not even being able to question that behaviour less they be viewed as ‘uncool.’ "
"&gt; A kid isn't guaranteed to look like one or the other of the parents\

"Uh it's your brother's wedding, not your mom's. It's your brother who needs to know if you'll be bringing a +1, not your mom. You didn't complicate, manipulate or ""orchestrate"" anything. You're an adult, and all of this is none of your mom's business anymore. If she decides to have a hissy fit at/about the wedding about this, that's on her. 

I don't think you had anything to apologize for. I think from here on out you should grow a spine and assert yourself."
"7 years you've been together and this is the first time she caught you beating off? RESPECT, OP! 

But seriously, her reaction is really quite over-the-top and I wonder if there's more going on here. Your anniversary is this week, and you've been together 7 years.  Has she been expecting a proposal? "
"&gt;Boyfriend of 5 months didn't respect my consent this one time

Nah. this isn't ""he didn't respect my boundaries"". Your boyfriend raped you. And I'm very sorry that happened. This isn't a red flag. A red flag is something that alerts you about dangerous people and dangerous behavior. This guy IS a dangerous person and exhibits dangerous behavior. This isn't a red flag, this is what red flags are supposed to tip you off about.

PLEASE leave this dangerous man. Just because he said ""oh sorry"" after he did it doesn't mean he won't do it again. and it doesn't negate the fact that he did it in the first place.

This was rape, and I need you to know that in no uncertain terms. 

Rape play or rape fantasy are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from forcing yourself on your sleeping girlfriend who is telling you to stop and is unable to physically stop you. That is just regular old rape."
"I’ve personally had autoimmune illness that significantly impacted my health, personality and physical appearance. I think I can understand some of what you’re feeling: you’re already very aware of how you’re seen by people, feel crappy about how you look and your inability to control it, and you feel pretty crappy in general. 

The first thing I’ll say: how you feel about yourself has nothing to do with anyone but you and your experience. No one telling you you’re beautiful “inside and out” makes you feel beautiful inside in out. Their intent is good but when you know you look “like a bright red boiled lobster in a flaky skin snow shower” and it is what it is. 

The next thing I’ll say: you’ve already got an uphill battle in your life right now with accepting your reality. You don’t need someone bringing you down intentionally or by a lack of self awareness. In my book, it doesn’t matter if someone intended to hurt your feelings or did it accidentally, their actions had consequences and you don’t need the burden of their personality in your life. 

I had a lot of issues when I was at my lowest point health wise in that I was married to an amazing guy who people find attractive. I couldn’t figure out why he’d want to saddle his life with my health issues and give up sex (intimacy was very painful due to some of my illness side effects not to mention when you feel bad about your appearance you don’t really induce “sexytime”signals.) For me, I was motivated towards being as healthy as possible because it was important my husband knew I was working on being better. I had his full support and we’re still married. He was just....fucking fantastic and I am still grateful and in awe of what he helped me get through. 

It doesn’t sound like your boyfriend is fantastic. It doesn’t even sound like he’s trying to be. I don’t know what your illness is but I know this: you should have an army of people who want nothing but the best for you on your side and willing to help you work for it. Anyone not on your team doesn’t deserve your time or energy. If he isn’t “Team Biscotti” material, that’s a quick 185 pound weight-loss program, right there.  "
Your comment helped me. Thank you. 
"&gt;during the next month or so K generally kinda avoided me and started making plans to move out. 

He knows it's creepy as fuck and weird, he doesn't care. 

You should never have to explain normal human behavior or emotions to people. I can't imagine any good can come from trying to confront in a situation where they know what they're doing is wrong. 

&gt; before K completely blew up and started lecturing me about how I should mind my own business. 

As I said... He throws a tantrum and tries to deflect in response to your normal reaction. He knows. 

I don't really think there's anything you can do. The guy sounds like a fucking nut case. Short of shaming him publicly, I dunno. I don't recommend doing that either, i'd likely just make you more of a target.  I guess you can be happy it sounds like he's moving out. "

"Holding back in therapy and not being honest aren't doing you or him any favors.  


You can't get over it until you work through it.  Stop trying to protect his feelings and lance the wound already.   That's the whole point of the whole thing.

"No.

Your BF needs to replace ALL the bras that his cats have destroyed.

My spouse's dog had this problem too and he thought it was _hilarious_. Until he had to buy me 4 new bras. Then he wasn't laughing anymore and now he takes it seriously."
"Ok what the fuck is wrong with your husband? Like that is the most suspect and irrational response ever. I was suspicious before, but now? You need to have a come to jesus talk with him away from small ears and find out what the hell is going on."
"Since she comes from a wealthy family, it would come as no surprise to me that she was talked into/persuaded/convinced by her family to protect the money in the event of divorce. It’s very possible they know an awful lot about divorce and it’s weighty effects on the wealthy spouse. Perhaps it’s also possible that your wife didn’t do this to intentionally hurt you or undermine you, but was talked into it as a paranoid precaution. 

That being said, you have every right to feel hurt by this. This decision means she didn’t trust you enough, even though she married you. She cherry-picked her vows, in a way, and that’s pretty sad. 

You should indeed tell her how this has made you feel, how you found out, and also let her know you don’t actually care about her money. You care about how she sees you, and apparently she sees you in such a way that she was led to believe you might try to divorce her and take her money. "
"""My spouse doesn't love me and we haven't had sex for ages!"" is a piece of bull every cheater sells to their lovers. Look, she has already proven she is a skillful liar. How can you trust anything she says? "
"Sometimes the person who usually figures everything out just doesn’t want to have to be in charge of figuring out one more thing. Like, if the baby is fussing in his high chair right next to you and saying all done, do you need me to tell you he wants to get down? Do I need to ask you to do that?

It’s often not really the actual work, but the feeling like everything household rests on your shoulders, and if you didn’t organize every little thing, nothing would get done.

It sounds like she’s feeling overwhelmed with feeling like it all rests on her. I don’t think that putting a set the table test in there is necessarily the right way to approach it, but it does sound like she doesn’t feel like you’re partners, but that she is responsible for making sure all household things get accomplished. I think that if you asked her if that’s how she felt, there’s a really high chance that she would burst into tears of relief that you got how she was feeling."
"You want to fix this? Great! That’s 50%.

First take all the screen shots, of everything, not just the bits you think are incriminating. Then go see a divorce lawyer. Get everything in place for your preferred custody agreement should you need it.

Remember she’s at home, looking after your kids. Drunk. Planning an affair. You are a fire fighter, what happens if she goes to make grilled cheese and falls asleep? You know exactly what happens.

Now that’s plan b. Should everything fall to shit you have your ducks in a line and you know exactly what you want. Kids stay with you, she moves out, gets them at the weekend or whatever.

Plan a. You can’t really tell her about the Facebook access. You need to play it as ‘you’ve been strange, something is off, is there someone else? Regardless of the answer you suggest counseling for you both. You work a lot, but you’ve noticed a lot of wine/beer/spirit bottles when you get off shift and you don’t think it’s healthy for your relationship etc etc.

Then you see how it plays out.

Protect yourself and the kids, then try to fix things. Not the other way around."
"She had another kid only **two years** later, with another man - presumably the stepdad.

OP doesn’t hold any blame for being born, but this should show the stolen youth claim is bullshit.  She’s pulling this shit over two years?!?!"
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I think it’s disgusting that your parents blamed you for it; can I ask why you still have such a close relationship with them after they did this to you? 
"This is not a ""borderline"" inappropriate relationship.  Your husband was in a full blown emotional affair with another woman and is sulking about having to break it up.  He's done a half-assed job of breaking it off and hasn't even take the first step in healing a relationship -- which is to take responsibility for his own actions.

Stop being a doormat and sleeping on the couch.  Tell him that he's already made a start on being exactly like his dad and it's time for him to stand up for his own marriage or get help."
I'd suggest that asking people about pure romance parties at work could be considered sexual harassment.
There’s nothing to apologize for. They sound like toxic enablers who wanted you to spend your life enabling them just like they enable your brother. You’re breaking out of the cycle and that’s awesome! It’s the healthiest thing you can do. Hold your ground. The last thing you want to do now is make them think that you think they’re right.

"I would flat out say no. It was rude of her parents to suggest it without asking you first and that’s on them. Obviously you are not in a situation where you are ready to have a (out of control) teenager move in with you. Sorry she doesn’t have housing, but that isn’t your problem and your family members should not have tried to make it yours. Your health should come first. "
"&gt; She was looking for the feeling of being with her family in their home as a child. But you don't get the feeling of being a child back as an adult. You have to be an adult.

This is a great note that really resonates with me, and probably many others, at 23. I live with my partner, I’ve finished college, and life is good... but man, I so miss the security of childhood. Now my brother and I don’t talk as much and my parents are divorced and they’ve moved several times from where I grew up — we left when I was 10 and I don’t think I ever felt the same security ever since — and I would give so much to have the safety of being a warm and cuddled in my childhood home again. But I can’t, and that’s okay. It’s up to me to create a new home. It’s up to me and my partner to create **our** home. And really, I know I’m conveniently remembering the good parts. My childhood home wasn’t happy — I just didn’t know it. So I miss it. But if I went back now, it’d be worse than what I currently have. Realising that — and more importantly, *remembering* that — is hard."
"I didn't even need to read the post to know this was the problem. That's a BIG gap in terms of age and life experience. Like in those years, I moved 3 times, graduated high school, graduated college, graduated law school, broke up with boyfriends, got jobs, paid bills, took care up myself, and grew way the fuck up. I'm 26 now and the thought of going after an 18 year old is GROSS. They're CHILDREN with no common ground. I can't imagine being interested in one. Like he can't even take you to a bar??? Your sister has your back on this one, OP. 

Taking phones and deleting contacts sounds extreme but it's what I'd do if I were your parent/pseudoparent. And she's asking for space so she can come back and have a fruitful conversation with you."

"Stop being best friends with her younger, hot best friend (come on, dude). Start dating her. Go to marriage counseling. Make her feel secure - and suggest she see a therapist, because you probably can’t assuage her fears alone. 

Re: your update - so while your wife went home to take care your child, you got drunk with her hot friend. Cool. Wonder why she’s insecure. 

You made vows to your wife. This is the sickness part of sickness and health. Help her get better and stop being an ass."
**Don't marry this guy.**
Why isn’t your girlfriend worried about inconveniencing your mother? She seems immature and very selfish. 
"It reminds me of this comment:

&gt;  I don't want my co-workers to think my husband is an asshole

Well yeah, most people wouldn't want their co-workers to think that...but if its true, then its true. She needs to listen to her gut. Even her body is telling her that this is not right.

"
"I don’t think he was necessarily comparing you to your friends, but I don’t think you’re over reacting either. Talking about “makeup” and “girly shit” in that derisive manner is sexist and misogynist. I wouldn’t tolerate a partner being so broadly rude and clearly sexist like that. "
"Taking care of a child too young for school is typically considered a full time job, such that if one partner is working for money and the other partner is doing all the childcare while they're at work, it's reasonable for the remaining childcare time and housework to be split evenly; it's typical for a single adult not to have time to do much housework while caring for a child. However, ""evenly"" means *you each do half* during the time you're both there, not that you do all the work once you get home!

And, separately, your MIL is there too - which means they're *splitting* a full time job and should have roughly 20 hours a week, each, to spend on housework before their household contributions equal yours. In this situation it is totally reasonable to expect that you have to do ~1/3 of childcare during hours you're not at work and negligible other housework. 

Edit: I'm getting a lot of comments here that say caring for a young child is not a full time job, and to be clear, by this I mean that while toddlers range in difficulty and time investment, they fit into roughly the same range of difficulty as do full time paid jobs, which *also vary in difficulty*. Lots of people work ""forty hour a week"" jobs where they only actually do about 10 hours of work, and people don't go around saying that white collar office workers aren't contributing fairly to their household if they don't do thirty hours of extra logistics and budgeting and freelance projects in their downtime. Forty hours a week is forty hours a week, and a single adult caring for a toddler is required to pay attention for those entire forty hours just like an office worker on Facebook is still expected to be physically at their desk. 

OP's situation is *not* that, because there are *two* adults at home who absolutely do actually have 20+ hours a week while he's at work during which they should be doing housework and honestly if the whole house isn't sparkling every day and the yard perfectly gardened and dinner on the table when he gets home he's being massively taken advantage of, but *in general* two-parent families with one stay-at-home parent should consider it a bonus if the stay at home parent has time/energy to do chores while they're on sole childcare duty, just like it would be a bonus if the working parent had time/energy to run errands on their lunch break. Again, forty hours a week is forty hours a week, though, the stay at home parent needs to contribute just as much during times both parents are home - they don't get to ""tag out"" and expect the working parent to do all the rest of the work. 

The point I'm making here is that if OP's mother-in-law weren't in the picture, OP would not be justified in expecting not to have to do any chores, but his wife thinking he's obliged to do everything once he gets home would still be quite unreasonable - and given that the MIL is there, the situation is not just unreasonable but outright completely unacceptable. "
"Even then, nobody made OP sit there for 20 minutes waiting for the bill. If you’re done, ask for the bill. "
"&gt;3 girls in a room. One teenage, one elementary, and one toddler. 

Screw. That. 

Your husband is being unreasonable here. You going along with this will cause your daughters to resent you. 

Do what is best for your kids. "
"Give them NOTHING, OP. They have neither earned it, like you have, nor have they been the best family members to you. 

I am (also) the scapegoat in my family, and was treated almost identical to how you were growing up. 

I'm getting a degree in Engineering and my Gold Child brother works in a casino dealing cards, but my mom has made it VERY clear that she loves my brother more than she ever could love me. 

They disrespected you your whole life, ridiculed all of your amazing achievements, never accepted your wife and had you started a family (I am so sorry for your loss, OP) they probably would have shunned that child too. 

Is this really ""what your father would have wanted""? His only son made to feel horrible about himself, and his personal choices (from what college he went to, to who he chose to love), and at the mercy of 3 vindictive women? 

From what I know about your dad (who seemed to love you, even if your mom pushed him around) from what you put here, the answer would be NO. 

They did this to themselves, you are already not part of the family(they've made that VERY CLEAR), and thus, this is not your problem. Tell them to kick rocks. Not your circus, not your monkeys.

Good luck, OP, stay strong. You are an valuable, amazing human being, who did amazingly well for yourself and your adorable little family unit, despite your rotten Family Of Origin's bad influence and discouragement. "
"buy yourself a lockbox to keep your journals in. I do think you were kind of cutting off your nose to spite your own face by burning the art portfolio, but I'm sure you can create more in enough time to use it for college and other programs. Truly, your mom has only herself to blame and you were pretty badass to do this.

**edit:** I just wanted to revise my ""cutting off your nose to spite your own face"" comment, upon reflection. Other commenters have pointed out that your current portfolio would be well out of date by the time you apply for college, so getting rid of it would not be a factor there. That art was yours to do with as you wished, and using it to make a point with your mother about boundaries/autonomy? As an economist might say, ""highest and best use""."

Sounds like there’s something deeper going on than just your mom’s distaste for dolls. That’s some seriously controlling behavior.
"I don't really know what to tell you, man. My boyfriend is an artist, but doesn't have much output nowadays due to working two jobs-- it hasn't changed the way I see him at all, and I certainly don't struggle to find things to compliment him on. There are a billion things I love about him and his hobbies are just one tiny speck of who he is as a person. I still love his unique view on the world, his generosity, his kind heart, his sillyness, his patience, his determination, his wonderful sense of empathy, the way his laugh fills the room, his loyalty and reliability, how he picks me up when I'm down and I could go on but those are just off the top of my head. So I have to say, I don't really get where you're coming from here when you say her hobbies were all she had to offer.

If you truly can't find anything nice or admirable about your wife now that her hobbies have fallen away that might be a sign that you didn't marry her for who she was, you married her for what she did. Superficial things that change over time. Idk, the way you talk about her isn't very respectful and the fact that you intentionally mention the kardashians and whatever else makes it clear you look down on her. 

You barely even mention any sort of personality traits throughout the whole post. I don't know if that's because there are none that exist for her or if you simply don't appreciate them. But people aren't *only* an amalgamation of the things they do and look like. There's a soul in there you barely seem to acknowledge, but if it's not enough for you then yeah, maybe it is time for you to move on."
"As a woman, I would feel quite violated.  J made a very aggressive move on her.

Please have a talk with your GF, OP.  I'm cynical enough to think that he will try something again someday, because he wants her and thinks that his wishes should prevail.  GF needs to be very, very wary of this person."
"re the bit where he says

&gt; ""I don't think I'm better than anyone else. Just different""

I think this is right at the border of gaslighting and plain old being full of shit. your boyfriend very much appears to think he's better than you. a) he's wrong and b) if he thinks that, he shouldn't be dating you. but clearly, if you combine the contempt for Taco Bell employees with all the verbal abuse, it's just absurd to say that he doesn't think he's better than other people.

also ""am I over-reacting?"" and ""am I just being insecure?"" are minor red flags for abuse. I say minor red flags because they can also be totally reasonable questions to ask yourself, under some circumstances. but pair that with the verbal abuse and the most likely scenario is that this guy is probably already doing more harm to you than you realize."
"Exactly! 

I think your girlfriend is the mvp in this situation. She removed herself respectfully from the environment because you didn’t do it for her. "
"The behavior is borderline inappropriate, but the bigger issue is that you told him that something bothers you and he ignored your feelings and did it again anyways. That is unacceptable behavior and you should tell him so. "

"You should talk to your mother and ask what she wants. It’s her birthday, not your father’s. "
"Tell him you're happy about his passion, but it doesn't really interest you much. You don't mind talking about it sometimes but you two should find a shared hobby you can talk about with each other.

"Give it a while and you might get used to it. I love the beard myself and am always sad if it gets shaved, but after a week or so I would get over it lol. 

Also there’s nothing wrong with you saying, btw the beard really turns me on. I never once told a man I didn’t like it when he shaved the beard. But I definitely made a point of how much I loved the beard. Next time it grew back... it didn’t get shaved off again lol. 

Edit: just imagine the dude only likes long hair and you cut the hair. You wouldn’t respond as well to “ I don’t like your haircut.”  But if you heard how much he LOVES your long hair and finds it a total turn on, it might make you want to leave it a bit longer when it grows back. "
"I really don’t see how this could be an accident. She announced that she was going to shower, you can tell when the shower is running without opening the door and he didn’t leave upon ‘realising’ that someone was in there but only when she shrieked after realising that he wasn’t you.

Regarding your edit, you do have a difficult decision and I do understand your reluctance about making your GF wary of other people. That being said, I think it would be better for you to tell her so that she is aware of his potential creep status and therefore can make an informed decision on how to proceed with him. In her shoes, I would want to be aware of someone who was potentially unsafe. 

Edit: Grammar"
"A lot of people seem to be missing what was just implied in your post: you say your partner doesn't want to *have to deal with*

Why do you say so? Is he responsible for paying or proving some kind of moral or psychological support on this? Is he responsible for arranging the whole thing (like talking to the doctors, arranging the meetings and such)?

If that is the case, you might want to mention this more clearly in your post, people might be getting the wrong idea about this situation."
"Not to mention ""called my private therapist and told them lies to sabotage my treatment"". Brother is a real piece of work, isn't he?"
"\&gt;so now we're juggling not letting them over

You shouldn't think of it this way. They're still welcome to come over; you just won't be making an outrageously inconvenient accommodation in order for them to do so. If you talk about it/think about it as not letting them over, it unfairly makes you wanting to sleep in your own home into you denying her time to chill with her friends. "
"How is this possible, you ask? *This is how it always works.* Abusers don't fully remove their masks until they have their victim well and truly bound up in their clutches, like being married to them. You need to call a women's shelter and get yourself out of that situation. He will not get better. He will only escalate. Is your life worth staying with him? Most women who are murdered are killed by their significant other. A shelter can help you make an escape plan and get out while minimizing danger to yourself because the most dangerous time is when you try to leave. "
"Distance will help. I'm not saying cut her off, but start spending less time with her and focus on yourself or your dating life outside of her for a bit."
"That moment, right then, defined your relationship.  They both told you loud and clear exactly who each of them are, I hope you’ll listen. 

If she was some great moral leader who deserved some superiority then the son she raised would never, ever have sex outside of marriage.  He knew full well that having sex in his mother’s house was the forbidden fruit which is why despite your reluctance, he kept at it.  It was so exciting to be naughty.  And when he gets caught, you pay the price with not only the shaming and a physical assault, you also get assaulted again by him for not just taking it all without a fight.  

So, this is your future, the two of them working on tearing you down for the rest of your time with him. Those two, pairing up and shutting you down for any dissent.  Now, go behave yourself and apologize to both of them. "
Right? Teens are just half cooked adults. 
"Not to be harsh but what makes you so sure this was a 'date'? Unless you specifically used that word with her, you might be making the wrong presumptions. She may just see you as a really good friend, as of right now. I know I've gotten along super well with guys and getting food with them was simply that - eating food with a friend. However I've later found out that their perception was entirely different. Also, paying for the whole bill would be a possible way I could reinforce that friendship boundary. Your self-admitted lack of experience with dating might be clouding your view here...

I'd try to get clarification on that before trying to progress things in that way."
"Yeah, that stood out to me immediately!

/u/lenabeaner why the fuck is he still going to Denver after it came out he booked that trip to see another woman?! The fact that he didn't immediately cancel it and block all communication with this woman says everything you need to know.

"If that doctor/NP did indeed lie to you about your test results she's way out of line professionally and can get in a lot of trouble for that. And if she did it at the behest of your parents, it's even worse. Maybe contact your state's medical licensing board to make a complaint."
"Your husband is addicted to opiates. It's blatantly obvious. He needs to get serious therapy. This is a *very* slippery slope. Seriously, if you do not stop this now, he's not far off from becoming a full blown addict and switching to heroin when it becomes too expensive to maintain and impossible if you keep the pills from him. 

You need to stop enabling him and stand firm here. "
"I think the thing you’d hate to see is your beautiful, all-vegan meals going uneaten. Then you’re really wasting a lot of money on a product that wasn’t used, and could have gone to other perks for your wedding. 

If you have non-vegan friends (sounds like you do), can you bring two or three to taste test your menu? That way you can get some opinions about what will work and what really won't. 

I will say, in a pinch, a cheese plate really goes a long way with guests from all walks of life. If your wife can compromise with you (as I think she should--it's your wedding too) that might be a good alternative. "
"Unfortunately, when someone has a brain tumor, their behaviour can and most certainly will change. My parents were in the same situation as you, although not as extreme. I suggest talking to his doctors to get some coping mechanisms (my dad told me this really helped), and therapy will definitely help too. Try looking for support groups as well, there are plenty for cancer patients and their families (the hospital should be able to give you some info on that I suppose)."
Thank you for your perspective
"Your wife’s depression is likely a lot more severe than you may think. If she suffered from post-partum, then the fact that she dropped out and gained weight likely added to her unhappiness with herself. Persistent pessimism and feeling unworthy of love are very common symptoms of depression in general, too. I’d encourage you to come clean about what you know because you’re concerned about how she’s feeling about herself and your relationship. Provide assurances that you love and are faithful to her, and then tell her that you would really like her to see someone about her self-loathing because you want her to see herself the way that you see her (smart, attractive, etc). 

As for the dress incident, I have overweight family members (also used to be much thinner) who do things like that and after talking to them, I’ve concluded that it’s because a) shopping is a reminder that they’re overweight and it makes them feel shitty to confront that, b) they don’t want to buy new clothes in their current size because they believe they’ll lose the weight soon, and c) they’re convinced that they’ll look bad anyway because they’re overweight so they self-sabotage themselves to ensure that they do — almost like a defense mechanism, like, “If I look really rough in general, maybe people will focus on that instead of my body.” "
"That's fine.  Encourage him to go alone.  If you need to see one together as well, talk about that in a completely separate conversation.  Let him have his private therapy session though.  He needs it.

"You don't need all that background. Just say ""No, having another person stay here isn't something that works for us."" Giving reasons and justifying why it's a bad idea will just give her reasons to argue back (""But I can help when you're not feeling well,"" or ""I won't be any trouble,"" ""I'll take allergy meds,"" etc).  It doesn't need to be a confrontation, and you don't even need to talk to her parents about it - she's the one who asked, just tell her no. Feel free to say it in a way that expresses disbelief, like ""I can't imagine why your mother suggested this, how odd."""

"It sounds to me like he's trying to ""flex"" a little bit. You said he grew up poor, so now he's got a good job in a lucrative field and is probably doing pretty well for himself. What he seems to have lost, in doing so, is his humanity. He clearly thinks of himself as being so far superior to anyone in his past position, but he can't see that he would have felt awful if someone treated him back then the way he's treating people now.

Continue to call him out on it, because it's not right. Use a lot of ""I"" statements, like ""I feel bad about myself when you disrespect people you think are lesser than you."" Question him. Get to the root of why he thinks the way he does, and dismantle his way of thinking. Ask ""Why?"" a lot.

""Look at that sign. Start your career at Taco Bell, that's so pathetic.""

"The biggest red flag to me is that you said straight up this isn't the first time this has happened. You addressed it before and he's made no effort to change the behavior.

Not only did he fail to respect your plans--which is just rude--but he doesn't seem concerned over you as his girlfriend, which is kind of part of the deal. When you're in a relationship with someone, you sometimes have to put them first even if you don't particularly feel like it. He doesn't make any effort to change because he doesn't want to put you first unless he feels like it. That's not a reliable partner. 

You guys started dating when you were teenagers. He may have been a great boyfriend for you when you guys were 18 but he's obviously not ready/interested in having a more adult relationship. "
"Yep, in his mind, ""she got in my car and went to lunch with me as the next step along the way to us kissing/ fucking/ getting married. But she left in the car of a different guy, so that means she betrayed me in order to proceed with kissing/ fucking/ marrying that gross old dude? How could she?""

I know you're not assuming THAT much, but to you, her leaving with another guy violated your ""date"" to go on a ""date"" with him. Neither thing is a date!

She could be equally ""serious"" with both of you, which is to say not at all. She got lunch with you as a friend, and ran into another friend. "
"It really doesn't sound like you should be marrying him, honestly. You've broken up that many times presumably for good reasons, and you only agreed to marry him because you were surprised that he asked. Why *are* you marrying him? "

-""I'm not interested.""

-""if you don't like the product you can give it as gifts, are you not wanting to support ""manager's name""?""

-""I'm not interested.""

Just become a broken record. You're not interested. If they ask *why*, it's because you're not interested. If they ask you to explain more or listen or try or do or whatever. You're not interested. You don't have to say it angrily or aggressively, I think it's better to just say in a good natured, matter of fact tone ""I'm not interested.""

And if you've been taking T for your transition I can see that possibly being an obstruction to your approval. Some places want you to be on a waiting list and won't come in to harvest your eggs until they have a couple ready to receive your donation. You'll be pumped with female hormones that cause your body to release multiple eggs at once so the docs have a better success rate.

I do think he is responding poorly to it. But I do get the disappointment in having a child that looks nothing like you. My second one is the spit of me. So we now have one each that resembles us.

"I was raised like OP, watching my mom play resident evil at 4 years old. One of my earliest memories is one of the Hellraiser movies. I actually remember (very vaguely) a conversation about movie and video game monsters, and my mom explaining that they're fake and fake things can't hurt me. I don't think being exposed to these things hurt my development or scarred me at all. My mom's decision that I was old enough to handle them was based on her perception of my maturity. 

I want to caution you though, because that perceived maturity extended too far. My mom didn't filter *anything* and I was exposed to a lot of stuff I shouldn't have been and it's really fucked with my coping mechanisms as an adult. I always strove to ""be mature and deal with it"" as a kid to impress my mom, and now I have trouble acknowledging and reacting when things bother me as an adult. I was never protected from the harsh realities of the world as a kid, and I resent that, and it's taken a lot of therapy to try to work through the issues that caused. It doesn't sound like this is what's happening with your kid, but I wanted to bring it up because your situation and hers is similar enough to mine for it to be relevant. 

You didn't talk about anything really but the horror stuff and the c-section. The comments your co-parent's sister had seemed to stem from a place of sexism (horror isn't a *girly* enough interest) and bullshit. If your kid likes horror, she likes horror.

It's a hard illness to have and it's hard for the caregivers, too. 

I don't necessarily think she was hiding anything by not wanting to talk about what's happened to her over the last years. She could have been horribly abused for a long time and didn't feel like sharing. I was too until I got my illness to a more stable point.

Maybe ask him what point he's trying to make.  Best case, he becomes aware of just how often he's making these kinds of remarks. Worst case, he doubles down, but at least you know what you're dealing with and can act accordingly.  

Based on his comments about being a ""professional"" (cue the applause he's so clearly expecting), I'm also guessing your bf is an engineer. This professional arrogance/classism can be a pretty common thing in shops that are 100% engineers, where it's easy to get lost in the echo chamber where enthusiasm for your field risks turning into contempt for any others. I'm sure it happens in other professional disciplines as well, although I haven't seen it first-hand. Hopefully becoming aware of it can help him to curb it."

"I just wanted to point out that OP referred the the friend that told her it was her ""fault"" for wearing such revealing clothes to a kids party as her ""best friend""

If something weird like that happened and my best friend told me they are just creepy like that and that I was wearing the ""wrong"" thing, I can safely say I wouldnt be friends with them anymore. If my best friend, or literally any friend at a party of mine confided this to me, that guy would have immediately been thrown out. You dont get to be creepy and sexual at my party, especially a freaking childrens birthday party

"Just think of the app/site as a tool for finding potential partners. The app/site is not the medium in which the relationship exists. The connection will still grow organically. My boyfriend and I found each other online, but we met at a coffee shop. There was no chemistry (or at least, not much) until we met in person. And definitely no relationship was developed online. It’s just the tool we used to find each other."

"Two things: 1) Your girlfriend needs to get herself to therapy. Crying 3-4 hours a night over this is excessive and unhealthy. 2) I think you should be honest with her and tell her that you're not going to comfort her about this any further, that the reason she did poorly was because of her poor study habits ,and that you're willing to help her study harder going forward but you're not available to listen to her complain and blame everyone else anymore.

"He dries *the sink?!*

Are you open to him getting therapy or the two of you going to counselling together? I agree he has a problem but putting up with this for long enough to get therapy going might be too much for you (understandable). Perhaps you could live separately under the condition that therapy and improvement need to happen."

"&gt;I get your questions. Truth is we have asked her many times to go to a full care facility but she does not want it. She has a nurse that comes twice a day but that's quite recent.

She can refuse all she wants. Get your brother out of that situation. Once she can't  use him as a crutch anymore, I suspect she'll cooperate better.

He's only thirteen. He's just a kid! Regardless of what your mother says or does, he should never, ever, have been placed in the position of being his dying mother's primary caretaker.

A mother who won't even tell him what's going to happen to him after her imminent death, or let him talk to anyone about the fear and pain he's feeling. What kind of mother could be so heartless to her own child? What kind of family could just sit by and watch this child be treated so badly like this? In trying to please your mom, you have all horribly failed this poor kid.

Tell his father what's going on at that your poor brother can finally have someone to look after him for once. Real family - you know, the kind that actually cares about *his* well being. And the rest of you should take a long, hard, look at your behavior in this situation."
"To parrot some advice I’ve seen in these situations before, what do you have to gain and what do you have to lose?  It sounds like you have a lot to lose if you are currently going through lengths to keep them from figuring out where you live and work. What if they want something and you don’t want to give it to them?  Will they start harassing you? Trying to get you fired?  Try to break you and the GF up?  It sounds like what you have to gain at best would be a relationship with someone you don’t seem to like, so that she can relieve herself of some guilt and your mom can be slightly happier.

He told me that if I would have made him turn around then he’d have learned his lesson. I don’t believe that. I don’t fall for what he tells me about things changing when (if) we live together. I refuse to believe when he tells me that his behaviour will improve once we move in. He says he will “rise to the occasion” and start earning more money and being more responsible. I call BS on all of it. I do believe that he can learn to budget and manage his money. But he has to be willing. And the situation on the road trip showed me that he is not even close to changing.

"Kaitou is using a mutual problem solving frame and highlighting the importance of the garage for their relationship, including a clear statement of the necessity of OP having that space. 

You are using a rights based frame that focuses on OP's right to the space in a legalistic manner and fails to take into account wife's interest or to prioritise the important ongoing conversation about how each person in the couple should strive to facilitate the flourishing of the other for the benefit of the shared relationship itself. That kind of support has to take into account the genuine and shifting needs of both partners.

OP's primary interest should be communicating his own needs so wife knows, then meeting the needs of wife with her car. Wife's primary interest should be communicating her own needs so OP knows, then enabling OP to continue pursuing his clear passion and maintaining the benefits he and she both clearly get from it.

So while the history is very relevant I like it talked about in the context of Kaitou's adaptable relationship and needs based frame more than your brittle legalistic self interest based one that risks becoming brittle as it stays stagnant while needs change. 

It's not BS to look at a problem and propose the most obvious solution -it is just a starting point for a conversation. It is bullshit to act selfishly in a way that disregards the needs of your partner in furtherance of your own desires.

Wife has shared her needs with OP, he needs to do the same so they can solve this together.

"Your daughter is picking up on these behaviors even if you two haven't vocalized them. She probably feels like a disappointment. Picking her up from school and making lunch doesn't make your husband a good parent. Those are the bare minimum of what a parent should do. Don't even get me started about your husband trying to make you the problem. Both parents have equal responsibility no matter what the gender of the child is. Start a dialog without judgement with your daughter. Is she depressed? How's her social life at school going? She's getting to the age where she's going to be less social with you guys. Your husband isn't being a good parent. He might need some counseling too. His attitude could be really negatively impacting your daughter.

Edit: I also find it really odd he's focusing on her appearance."
"Seriously, people here are praising this guy, saying what he did was impressive or that it makes him a ""keeper."" It's ridiculous. He's not admitting this to her because he was oblivious to what he was doing. He knew he went as far as he could possibly go without literally cheating. That's not noble."
I hate to say it but I fully expect an update that she said they only kissed until she tells you what really happened. 
"I think you need to figure out what it is about your sister's success that really bothers you. Is it that she is doing something she loves? Is it the fame? Is it the attention from your parents? Perhaps the travel?

Your sister has achieved success early, which is common in her field. But she started working towards that success probably what, 15 years ago. You have to realize that your own success is still there for the taking and yours will peak right when hers is winding down.

There are many ways to be successful and even famous within almost any field, you just have to decide what you love enough to put in the kind of work she has put into her sport. "

"Just sit him down BEFORE you have sex, not DURING, and say, ""Look, I enjoy being intimate with you, but I've told you several times that you are being too rough and I am not enjoying it."" 

If he comes back with, ""Well, you're making noises,"" say, ""I know I am, but they are not noises of pleasure. It hurts me when you go too hard/fast/etc., and whenever I've tried to tell you so, you seem to follow it for a minute and then go right back to what you're doing.""

It's probably something you are going to have to work on for a while, especially if you're his first sexual partner. He probably has no idea what he's doing, and everything seems to say ""Hard and fast is what they want!""

If you sit him down for this talk several times and he does not improve or seems to willfully ignore it for the sake of his own pleasure, you will probably want to search inside yourself as to whether or not this is going to be a dealbreaker. Can you live with painful sex the rest of your relationship if he won't listen to you? Would you be willing to stay with someone who doesn't care about how you feel during sex? "

"Had a guy do this to me, it’s super flattering at the start but it wears very thin after a few months. I realised that I didn’t want someone to worship the ground I walk on, I want an equal that challenges and supports me. That relationship led to one of the more messy breakups I’ve had. I’m happy this has worked out well for OP but he needs to be careful with how much he’s building her up to be. Love is a word that’s thrown around too carelessly sometimes. Love is something that comes with time. This is more lust than love atm. Which is perfectly fine since all relationships tend to start this way with the ‘honeymoon period’. Just good to be aware of it though because the real test of the relationship comes after the excitement dies down and you see someone’s flaws as well as the good things."

"This is really good advice. After a breakup it can seem more natural to punish yourself but the thing you need to do is self-care.

Take the time to really focus on yourself and what makes you feel safe and happy. Try to resist the urge to talk to her, usually that makes you feel even worse in the long run. Good luck, break-ups SUCK under even the best circumstances so I feel for you! "

This needs to be higher up! This sounds like something an Emily type person would do. 
"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm also on the spectrum, and I haaaaate being touched. It's really common amoung people on the spectrum.

Two things to try:

1) Sit her down. Say, ""mom, we have to talk."" Tell her it's serious. Then tell her you hate when she touches you, and you want her to stop. Be very serious. Keep repeating that you hate being touched, and you want her to stop, forever. Say you know she thinks it's harmless, and you want it to stop. You know she thinks its affectionate, and you want her to stop. Etc.

2) Start leaving when she touches you. If you live together, go to a different room. Otherwise, just leave. Give her several warnings. Start with, ""Mom, we talked about how much I hate being touched, and you said you would stop. Don't touch me again."" Meet all her protestations wiht the above. ""I know you are showing affection, and I want you to stop."" If she touches you again, ""Mom, I just said I don't want to be touched. If you touch me again, I'm leaving."" Then the third time, ""Mom, I said I don't like to be touched and I said I would leave. I'm leaving."" Then leave. Enough times and she will get the point.

"I also think there is value in individual counselling for them as well,  to give a space to process really difficult emotions with less fear of it damaging the relationship (or causing actual damage).

"&gt; Everytime we disagree he wants me to help him work through how he is feeling, he has even said this before. 

You have to stop doing this. You HAVE to. He’s got to learn how to self-soothe. You will never have a productive discussion if every conversation about the issue is derailed by him throwing himself a pity party and demanding emotional reassurance. 

If he needs a few minutes to leave the room and calm himself before continuing, you can offer him that. But set a deadline for continuing the conversation, and leave him to collect himself on his own. If he actually agrees that he needs to stop making you manage his feelings for him (and isn’t just paying lip service to the notion), he will figure it out. "

"&gt;I  My husband is very altruistic

Not really. He has no trouble treating you terribly, gaslighting you, ignoring your needs, and generally being a bad husband. 

There's a type of personality that is afraid to say ""no"" to outsiders because they need to look like good people, but are perfectly willing to ignore and dismiss the needs of those who love them most, because they believe that they'll never leave. That's not altruism.  That's just a vaneer of altruism over by vanity, insecurity, and self-centeredness.

Another fact - these people suddenly learn to say no if *they're* the ones being inconvenienced. If this guy were treating your husband the way that he treats you, there would be none of these shitty excuses. He'd be out on his ass.

I'm not saying you should leave your husband, though personally I'd never have married him. I *am* saying that you should start enforcing boundaries and consequences.

Your husband wants to choose his friend over you? Fine. You choose yourself over him. "
She understands.  That’s why she got up early to cook you breakfast.  
"Ask her to get assessed for ADHD. A lot of the behavior and qualities you are using to describe her may be due to that. 

- unfocused and mercurial 

- parents belittled her intelligence growing up: ADHD can cause behaviors that cause others, especially teachers, bosses, and parents to punish and criticize. This is especially true for girls. ""Careless"" mistakes, inattention to detail, taking a long time to get a simple, boring task done, poor grades despite what appears to be normal if not superior intelligence, disorganization, assignments and paperwork lost, leaving assignments to the last minute, misplacing things on a regular basis. 

- Having problems with traditional work, especially if it involves lots of sensory overload (such as a crush of customers) 

- All of the above leading to intense feelings of shame and crippling self esteem, leading the person to avoid activities that they fear will simply prove that they are stupid, lazy, failures, don't care, etc. 

You and your wife should look up the symptoms of adult ADHD, especially as it manifests in women, and ask yourself how much of that sounds familiar.  

"
"Ask yourself: why is your husband not putting in the same effort to change his Ex's mind as he is into changing yours?

To me there is no question - your husband's proposed living situation is absurd, especially when his son will only be in school for another 2-3 years and you have three younger children whose whole lives would be uprooted to accommodate that. 

On top of that, I know very few 15 year old boys who are just crazy about spending all their time with their dads, especially their semi-absentee fathers who they haven't seen regularly in a decade.

I think your husband is trying to make a dream of his come true, but hasn't realised that his ideas are pure fantasy. You can't just uproot a family of five, plop it down into two bedrooms in another city, throw in a 15 year old boy and then imagine that you'll all be living an idyllic family life.

It also sounds like he has absolutely no guarantee that, once he has uprooted you all, his ex will even let him see his son regularly, let alone give him full custody.  He needs to get a visitation schedule agreed with the courts and then think about how he wants to proceed in the future. Fucking up your whole family's life on the basis of a fantasy is ridiculous."
"This comment is spot on. I can definitely see myself doing this at 22 (though nearing 30, I would go ballistic and embarrass the hell out of your friend - thank god for age).  Eager to please and hopeful about a new relationship, rationalizing it to myself that I should take it as a compliment.... Ugh.

Not wanting to cheat is the baseline for respect in relationships. Not putting yourself in a position to cheat is even lower than that. He's guilty of both. Yes, he didn't go the distance and he told you about it. No, that doesn't overshadow his actions, which are still bad.

That said, it's entirely up to you how to feel about this and where to go next. But don't convince yourself his actions are noble. They're just not as bad as they could be. And there is an important difference."

"This is so something I would do...get fed up, do something rude and immature in the heat of the moment, and then regret it and want to have a real adult conversation.  

If it were me, I'd get Gary alone and just straight up apologize for your own behavior. ""Look, Gary, I wanted to apologize for what happened at dinner last night.  Yes, I was frustrated, but the way I handled my frustration was rude and extreme and I'm sorry for the way I acted.""   If he seems subdued and accepts your apology and gives you one in return, this is an open door for a conversation about his talking.  

""I was very frustrated when you did X thing because it made me feel Y.  If you had done Z, that would have gone a long way to helping me feel W.""  You can address the most important point; if it's the fact that he wouldn't shut up until your husband said something, go with that.  If it's the fact that you could tell that he wasn't really listening to you when you talked because he just started back up where he paused in his lecture, then address that.  Pick one thing to express, and let the rest slide; Gary has spent his entire life being like this, you are not going to change him in one week.  You can, however, let him know how his behavior directly effected you, and that your frustration lead you to do something extreme that you regret.  

The best outcome here is that he accepts your apology, offers one of his own, and leaves your house with a seed of introspection about how his behavior can really piss other people off.  He's not going to stop talking too much after a lifetime of holding court.  "
"Walk away, don't look back, he will not change, if you don't, we'll be reading about how he did this again in 9 months. Also, get a STD test. He's just apologetic because he got caught. "

You absolutely should have stood up for her. It isn’t okay for someone (I don’t care how old they are or how long ago they lost a spouse) to speak like that about someone. If I were your gf I would be mortified and upset also. 

As far as what you can do-apologize and tell her you’re sorry that these things were said, you didn’t want to create a scene and truly didn’t know she understood Spanish so well which is why you didn’t get more upset in the moment and were going to address it afterwards with your family. "
"Tell your girlfriend, so she has a heads up.


Also, it's pretty weird that they grew up together and are best friends and the girl has never asked about how you met before. She had 8 years of time and you'd believe besties tell each other such things.


From the description, it seems as if she got sad and jealous from how lovingly you described your GF. I personally find it highly inappropriate to wake you up instead of calling her best friend. Especially because you don't really seem to be close friends with her.


Apparently, she is latching onto you, because you are a nice guy who is around. I don't think she is aware of what she is doing (aka wrong), because she is an emotional mess. Especially if she has a broken normal meter due to her abusive relationship. She is needy and lonely and maybe even jealous of your GF.


Please talk to your GF. Shut the door to your homeoffice when you are there, don't smile back, still be friendly but keep your distance. Don't talk about private stuff now when you haven't in the past 8 years. It's not the appropriate time to become best buddies with her, because she isn't herself and already got attached to you.


Ask your GF to keep her friend busy. Agree on a moving out date if she continues to subtly looking for more attention.


Don't withhold your concerns from your GF until it explodes. The friend already reached out for you instead of calling your GF for comfort in the middle of the night while GF was away. "
"&gt; how I should know how paranoid he is about my male co-workers because of his ex-wife who left him for one of her co-workers.

You are not his ex. Your husband needs to go to therapy. If he won't trust you, why are you with him?"
"😂😂😂

Apologize for handling it incorrectly but that's all you should apologize for. Explicitly tell him why you did what you did and tell him that even if he has the social etiquette of a frog, his behaviour is not cool at all. 

Maybe he doesn't know that he's doing it. Maybe he's just a jerk. More specifically a sexist jerk who doesn't care when he speaks over a woman.

Idk but talk it out. If he's a jerk, he can find a hotel bc fuck that noise."
"Get your own bank account and pay your credit cards through that. 

If the game company is at fault, they should be refunding you. And he should be chasing that up, as it’s his account. Push him to do that and it should become clear whether he’s lying or not. "
"You are blaming the wrong person here. Yes, you might not have gotten your dream wedding because this wasn't your husband's first wedding, but the rest is on him. Him taking out his feelings towards your ex is on him, not on her. We all got screwed by different people in our lives and managed to build meaningful relationships later on. He has no right to accuse you of cheating because his ex did something to him, you are not her, you are a competely different person, and if he wasn't ready to move on, he shouldn't have married you. The problem is not that you lied, the problem is that he doesn't trust you and never did. "
"So yeah, vanity is the root of jealousy, so it’s clear who was most vain in this story. 

But forget that part for a minute. You just married this woman, how about you give her the gift of being understanding about her irrational feelings being butthurt on her wedding day. 

Trust me, your irrational feelings are going to be butthurt some day, and this is what you’d want then.

If you try asking your wife to please explain to you as if you were starting over what happened and how it made her feel, and this time you just pay real close attention and repeat back what she tells you, and at the end say you understand and get why she felt the way she felt... dude you’d be a hero.

"So you often don't complete tasks? Maybe you can be more mindful? He sounds mean but we don't know his side of the story. I can imagine getting annoyed if a partner or housemate frequently didn't complete their chores (not stowing away the laundry airer after putting the dried laundry back, leaving washed but wet laundry in the machine, vacuuming but forgetting one or two rooms, doing dishes but not cleaning the surface etc). I hate chores as much as the next person and I live alone so have to deal with only my stuff, but maybe you repeatedly leave the last bits of a task undone and that gets old.

"
"Fuck their opinions. 

And stop telling her what other people say to you about her."
"Bella is an idiot. Don't even try to explain it to her. 

I had the same thing with a roommate, who accused me of paying rent with different money than the money she gave me. We went to small claims court over it, and the judge literally laughed at her. But she STILL doesn't understand why she lost, and says she should have hired a lawyer. 

You can't fix stupid. "
"Okay, you're not fucked up - you're grieving someone you lost very suddenly when you were young. It's only been four years and it sounds like you're still grieving. I think you need to talk to a professional because I'm fairly sure this is above Reddit's expertise. 

I think there are a couple of issues here - namely, when you met this guy, you immediately saw a resemblance and even thought it was your fiance for a second. That is a ridiculously intense way to meet someone. It's not some guy approaching you in a bar who's kind of cute it's BAM, flood of emotions about the fiance, oh and he's interested. Immediately, that's not a normal way for a relationship to start.

Especially if you know you've intentionally been seeking out guys that look like your fiance in the past, I'd be concerned that even if this isn't *the* reason you like this guy, it's *one* of the reasons you find him appealing. Even when you are describing him in your post, you are comparing him to the fiance. If he is the spitting image, then part of you might always be comparing him to your fiance, even if you don't mean to do this. It's very difficult to have a healthy relationship with someone when you are entwining them with someone you've lost. You need proper bereavement counselling.

If you get serious with this guy, then he is absolutely going to find photos of your fiance. You will eventually need to talk about this. However, I would say you should get your own thinking on this sorted before you attempt this talk. At the moment, I have no idea how this would go - ""You look a lot like my fiance who passed away... but I'm fairly sure that's not a factor in me liking you?"". I think you need to untangle some of these feelings first.

Essentially, I'm really sorry you're going through this. You need counselling, and should probably take a step back from this relationship until that's in motion."
Immediate family plus spouses. This is so normal it hurts. What an awkward request on this guy's part
So... why is your husband trusting some ex from your past? And you should look into getting a restraining order or something for your ex if he can't stop harassing you.
"You're 33 and have a husband. That is your family - you and your husband. Your *nuclear* family. Your priority. Your parents and brothers are extended family, on the periphery, not number one, not the priority. You say you've always done what they wanted you to do. Fine as a child but certainly not as a married woman?!!  You do not have to do what they ask you to do.  You can say no if you want and not feel guilty about it.  

From what you've described about the toxic nature of your extended family, it was a very good decision to not have them live in your building. Good for you!  Don't feel guilty about that.  It also sounds like they are financially stable enough to afford their own place wherever they want. So they should do that instead of trying to weigh you down with their demands and neediness. No, you have nothing to apologize for. They do but they won't because they're narcissists and you are their scapegoat. And your brothers are jerks. Stay away from them all and focus on your marriage and your life separate from your parents and jerk brothers."
"I would walk away, head held high and try for a better future with people who want more in life. Do you really want your happiness contingent on a woman miscarrying? :/"
"My strongest suspicion is that they're doing some kind of drugs together, something like shrooms or molly that would make it unsafe to drive or be alone for a while. Based on the fact that that's what my  friends do when they have sleepovers, tbh."
"Honestly, none of this has anything to do with what language was spoken. Your family collectivelly laughed at how dark and “African” your girl friend was, in front of her, *and you did nothing.*

They were racist, hurtful, mean, and awful. The person you should care about most in the world stood there and took it, and *you did nothing.*

"
"If he refused to go through his finances and tell you what he spent the money on, assume the worst. Either way, you're mistaken. You are not in debt, HE is in debt. Do not help him pay it off. He made this mistake on his own by lying to you, it's his to clean up. He needs to start putting in overtime requests and looking for work on the side if he expects to earn your trust and move forward as a couple. I would recommend that even (especially, actually) in the event of marriage you maintain separate finances and bank accounts. "
"Stuck in the loveless marriage is first line in the cheaters songbook. 

She's married and she's not leaving. That's the reality. She led you on for 3 years, knowing she's married, knowing she won't leave him.

&gt;After 3+ years in a stable, monogamous relationship

You are not in a monogamous relationship. You're her sidepiece. 

Seriously. Tell her to come find you when she has a decree absolut to show you. Don't hold your breath while you're waiting tho.

I hope you read every character of your contract with the fertility clinic. You need to ensure that in case of divorce your sperm is yours and the embryos are destroyed. Obviously her eggs are hers.

"She randomly decided to message him after three years of no contact? Yeah, okay."
"In my early 20s this shit happened a lot. A guy would ask me out then stand me up.  No phone call, no email, nuthin'. This was before texts existed for what its worth.

Then maybe a few days/weeks later I'd get some horseshit excuse of ""I was soooo busy.""  My response to that is if you have the time to take a dump and wipe your ass, you have the time to pick up  the fucking phone (in your case, send a goddamn text) and cancel, or explain the same night why you couldn't make it.

There are really only three reasons that excuse standing a person up along with not contacting within a reasonable period of time afterwards: your date is in jail, your date got hurt badly and is in no position to make phone calls, a close friend or family member died.  

This asshole can fuck right off. "
Call CPS on them. None of what's happening sounds legal.
"It's not hiding your real personality, it's demonstrating a right understanding of the situation. One date is a great start, but that's all it is, a start. You still have your own life, you have more stuff going on than some guy. So waiting a day or two is sitting in the afterglow of a good date and continuing your life. Then following up a few days later and scheduling another date for later that week is a natural progression. I think being too quick signals not just enthusiasm but a level of clinginess that doesn't fit the situation of just one date.

Don't think of it as pretension. Think of it as not losing yourself completely in that initial heediness of the moment and good feeling about a new person. Keeping a cooler head also protects your heart in the beginning. "
"Based on what you've written, I think she genuinely likes you, but has no intention of going against her family when it comes to a serious relationship. It is very sad, and I think she is foolish because it sounds like you are a very dear and loving person who really cares for her. I am not going to advise you to cut her off before giving her a chance though. Tell her the truth, and then assess if there might be a future together."
Assert Dominance master class. 
"You're in a tough spot because you've got a wife who makes very big demands but isn't willing to put in the work necessary to do her part. What would've happened if you decided you didn't like your new job and rage quit without a backup plan? You two would've been completely screwed. You're aware that quitting simply because you don't like your job is not an option when you have bills to pay, and she needs to grow the hell up and come to the same understanding. Most of us have worked jobs we don't really like that much for longer than we'd have preferred because living costs money and you can't get money unless you work. 

One thing that does stand out to me though is I get the impression you don't have kids. Assuming that's the case, why were you (and why was she) okay with her just staying at home without bringing in any money or learning any skills so she could find better employment? That's *super* lazy even if she was doing all the housework and cooking every meal. "
"&gt;I complicated everything by texting my brother straightforward my boyfriend was coming

That is the exact opposite of complicating things. It should ALWAYS have been a case of you telling your brother directly. Not playing Chinese whispers

Check out triangulation as a manipulation technique. I bet you anything she was planning on lying to either you or your brother to get your boyfriend uninvited. 

&gt;I went behind her back, manipulated, and orchestrated this entire thing with my brother.

Hahahahahahahahahahahaha

Behind her back! Lol, it's not her wedding, and not her business.

And orchestrated? You invited your plus one to a wedding and informed the hosts (a totally normal thing that you generally wouldn't tell your parents about unless they asked) not pulled off a bank heist! 

Honestly just ignore her. I don't just mean on this occasion, I mean more generally. All she does is create drama and make things about herself. You don't need that in your life, scale back her involvement in yours. 

And check out our of the FOG. It might help"
"Wow. 

You've been living together for on month via default, not a conscious choice. Do Not buy a house together. 

Buy the house yourself. She can pay rent to you and if you guys get married, put her on the title. Don't let a girlfriend of less than a year steer you out of a decision you've made for yourself. Her concerns are uninformed. You don't need her approval on a purchase you're making without her.  "
"Please don’t start some kind of sick relationship with her father. 

For one it’s your friends Dad. That’s a sure way to ruin a friendship. 

It also doesn’t matter that it’s legal. It’s pretty sick to me that a 40 year old man is sending boner pictures to a teenager. 

I get it. When I was 19 I dated a 30 year old. It didn’t end well and men who are significantly older that date or sleep with teenagers have a lot of problems. Do not put yourself in this position. 

This is so inappropriate. At the end of the day you’re going to do what you want but I can assure you this won’t end well if you decide to follow through. "
"This is a really good point. OP is catching feels but he could easily be a friendly face in the workplace to her. I think the chances are pretty decent it was a date but OP should consider the possibility it may not have been. And she handled running into an old friend extremely well. Very kindly. Maybe it was an old boyfriend or something weird but I wouldn't assume anything at all at this point. Ask her to lunch again. ""My treat this time."" And maybe dinner if you're getting date-y vibes."
"&gt; Kim is just a really sexual child

SHE'S FIVE.

Who fucking cares if your ex is pissed? This is your child. And frankly, the way she's reacting--blaming a FIVE-YEAR-OLD--is a pretty good tell that even if there's no molestation, there is something very wrong in that house."
"&gt;profoundly stupid

YES. I’m not sure I could be friends with someone who thought like this."
[removed]
"Thank you. I think I'll be showing her your post because I feel that this is entirely borne of ignorance of how cards work. She still lives with the 'rents, so she's a bit shaky with financial stuff"
"Okay, this is not undermining your authority. This is using a child as a physical pawn in a power trip. Your bf needs to sit her ass down and lay out some expectations and boundaries, like “if one of us asks for the kid, you DAMN WELL HAND HER OVER.” I am really disturbed by her behavior. Your daughter could have really gotten hurt. "
"is her family the type that keeps a lot of secrets, where there are a lot of unspoken places in conversations people don't go, lots off passive aggression, and forced smiles? if so, your wife needs to confront the culture of her upbringing and make a conscious choice if she's going to carry that energy into her created family with you and y'all's children. ""people will notice that you're responding logically to someone who tried to destroy our family!"" is not a valid complaint.   


also, this is going to get out. he's going to twist it somehow or someone else knows and they'll blurt it out. she will destroy the relationship with her sister if she doesn't tell her and the sister finds out elsewhere, with someone else's spin. "

"
He sounds like a real edgelord. Not acceptable or funny in the least.
"A couple of things bother me about the way he handled this. 

1. Saying you haven't 'sold' him on the idea of the wedding. He may not want to go but I do tons of things for my SO that I don't necessarily want to do but do it because it's part of being in a relationship. I do them because I want to be there for my SO. You shouldn't have to sell your partner on being there as support for you.

2. If he was really that opposed to going he could have and should have said something way before the day before the wedding. Before you sent an RSVP. Not only does it suck for you but weddings are expensive and that's rude AF to the bride and groom. If he had said before he was uncomfortable going and talked to you about it, it would be a different situation. 

Edit: fat fingers little keyboard"
Wow. What. No. You guys are meeting each other's parents??? Dude you need to CALM DOWN. 
"Jim is not a nice guy.   He carried on a 15 year affair *without protection!!!!!*.   He knowingly fathered one kid and kept going until he put the doubt on another.   Jim *socialized* with the husband - all the while fucking his wife.  Think about that.  What kind of a person can do that?  Look the man dead in the eye knowing the his 2 little boys are probably Jims.

My god what a disgusting human being.

And if you think Jim and Amy somehow managed to reign it in and be 'just friends' you have a massive shock in store for you.

I'm sorry.

Do tell amy's husband.  Yes - it is horrible for the kids.  But that is Amy and Jim's situation that they created, not yours."
I'd get him a  paternity test pronto.  I'd also probably never forgive him.
"If you're being authentic, that's all you can be. But if you're not being your true self then something might be off. If people are not attracted to your true self then you just haven't found the one that's just as unique as you. But I wouldn't bend over backwards to please these men who don't appreciate you for who you are, as long as you're being your true self &amp; not putting up a front. "
"Well, it could be true that they changed, but just because someone changed doesn't mean you're required to give them closure and forgiveness. If one of your sister's actually felt bad, she would be trying to talk to you directly. Who knows, maybe she has asked for your contact information and your mother is finally doing the sensible thing and keeping that information away from her.

Your parents played a part in this. Your example shows that they clearly favored both of their daughters over you, to a point of ignoring you in your own home for months because your sisters were jealous, greedy little shits. Your parents allowed your increasingly shitty siblings to be as terrible to you as they wanted to be and nothing ever happened to them. I don't know that I would be able to forgive that kind of blatant favoritism. You may love them, but I would keep them at arm's length, too.

Also, if you think that maybe, possibly, that they are going to fuck you over again, don't meet you sister at your parents' place. That's not neutral territory both of your sisters have an advantage at your home turf with your parents. If you do think meeting your sister is something you're ever interested in doing, do it at a public place, far away from where you live. Keep her away from your girlfriend, too.

If they really wanted to seek forgiveness, they can probably find you. Most people have a pretty large internet footprint these days. It's practically required to have social media it seems, even if you're just on linkedIn or something, they would be able to find you with a quick Google search. I think this sounds kind of fishy and maybe I am being paranoid for you here, but there isn't any reason to go through your parents, unless maybe your mother's acting as a buffer, which I doubt given how your parents treated you as you grew.  It's good you've found a nice woman you care for. I would have serious trust issues if this was the home I grew up in. It sounds like you deserve and have earned good, positive and loving human contact.  If anything, that's the relationship you should be focusing on strengthening for the future. If your sister does mean well and has changed? Only time will tell, but you have to take a risk to see if that's true. Meet her alone, grab a cup of coffee, maybe something short like 30 minutes or less to test it out... But don't commit to a whole family day with at least one person who actively fucked you over throughout your childhood. You were ganged up on before and I'd wager they would do it again, simply out of habit. "
"Bwahaha that's insane. Have you sold the movie rights? I'm glad she was at least vindicated in the end but that's far from a happy ending. I'm worried I will never find out who did this to me. If it doesn't work out between us which seems likely at this point, it's either gonna happen again in his next relationship or my next relationship."
"Yup.  Your man needs to be the one to step up and tell them to quit hassling you.  It’s out of your hands unless you decide to go alternate routes.  It’s none of their business If you do, though."
"I think something seriously wrong may have happened to her, like a sexual assault, and she's struggling to cope. I would tell her that you love her, that you know something is very wrong, and that you understand if she's not ready to talk to you but that you need her to talk to someone. Tell her you'll be ready to listen when she's ready. Then maybe help her find numbers for therapists to call."
Children cannot be band aids. You need to work on your marriage and dealing with your loss before bringing another life into it.   
"Homie, it's your life. That's it. You can't base your relationship decisions on the views of anyone else. You're happy with your SO and kitties where you are at? Why the hell should you change that? "

"Out gay guy here.

Coming out was by far the scariest thing I've ever done, because you are putting a lot on the line when you come out. I was terrified of losing my entire family and all of my friends. 

I didn't know who thought what, because I could never ask about it fearing they'd find out. It turns out all of my friends were really accepting, and my brother and cousin are ok with it. My parents on the other hand, weren't so great with it, and that is what I feared. They didn't outright reject me, but they definitely don't like it. Hell, my mom called me while I was on the way to a date, and said ""I don't like that you're doing that.""

Every day I fear some kind of discrimination for it. I'm terrified that I might lose my job because someone is uncomfortable about me talking about my boyfriend. I'm scared that the rest of my family won't let me be around them when they find out, especially my younger cousins, whom I would be devastated to lose. 

So please, try to understand where your brother is coming from. But be sure to congratulate him on finding someone he loves and wants to share his life with, because that is something to be celebrated! If you are unsure of what to do, tell him something like this:

""Listen, I don't care that you're gay. I support you and will embrace you and whoever you love. I get why you'd hide this, and it's ok. I'm sorry for invading your privacy as well by going through your phone. I'd love to meet Aaron get to know my future brother-in-law!"" - or something like that. Let us know how it goes! :)"
This is what dating is for. Now you know her better. And it turns out she is an entitled rude brat. So dump her and find a partner that you can share your travels with. 
"I have a coworker who’s family is anti-immigrant. They really despise Mexican and Asian immigrants. Their younger son met a beautiful blond hair blue eyed New Zealander. They dated throughout uni. Afterwards she had to go back because her Visa was about to expire. All of a sudden it was unfair and Obama was allowing undocumented minorities to stay but not this white woman. WTF, that’s when we discovered they were racist using immigration as a veil. "
"The guy is violating your boundaries, being disrespectful, calling you misogynist names, and you wonder what you should do? What would you tell a friend or a sister to do in this situation?"
"As someone with severe depression (bipolar), my deal breaker is lack of treatment/effort.  "
"Ok. This situation is almost identical to what happned to me.  Girlfriend of 6 years called. Said she almost cheated. Like in your situation she guarantees she loves me immensely, it doesn't change anything and similar bulls***.  She comes home, I ask her more (because like you, I too want to hear the whole story). Turns out she actually did cheat. So I would suggest you two have a long conversation after your bf comes home. If he needed the urge to tell you right away, I'm afraid he might have done some things he wasn't really proud of."
"&gt;They said they told him they didn't want him drinking at all, but I didn't know that. They also hadn't told me to babysit.

Your parents are greatly embarrassed by the incident and are looking to displace the blame.  You didn't do anything wrong.  They are the parents, not you."
"It’s easy to jump on your wife for being unreasonable here. But as someone who recently got married, I find the fact that your sister was so showered with compliments in front of your wife is really weird tbh. I had a pretty small wedding with about 60 guests and I don’t think I heard anyone commenting on anyone else’s appearance besides mine or my husbands other than a scattered statement here or there. 

I’m wondering if there were any issues or tension with your wife and your family and sister before this wedding. "
"I'm sorry for your illness but you've had plenty of time to be honest with your bf.  3 years is more than enough time to have opportunity to let him know about what you're dealing with.  You've been deceiving him for years, letting him build up to the point of proposing.  You had to have at least an idea that him proposing was a possibility and even when he got down on a knee and asked you to marry him, you still couldn't be honest with him.  I'm sure he's devastated and confused and heartbroken.  At the very least you should be honest with him if he ever wants to talk to you again.  "
"Well, turns out that as of right now, he doesn’t have a return flight booked! So I may not even have to say it."
"I would just cheerfully give them direction. ""Ok showers before dinner, you have half an hour"". ""Let's straighten up before we go out, please put away toys and put your laundry in the hamper"". Don't criticize them to your husband, just give them direction with a nice tone of voice. Give them rewards sometimes to make it a little more fun."
"This is correct.

Kick her out. She has a place to stay. She will be fine."
"I am 100% certain that my parents would blame me for this. One of their friends had an affair with me when I was about 13. I can recognize now that I was a child and this man was my abuser, but I blamed myself for it for a long time. When my parents found out, they said I had seduced him for attention. I’ve been accused of doing that on several occasions now... it’s been very common in my life for my Dads friends or work peers to hit on me.  Usually I try to keep my distance when they have friends over. Jack just didn’t seem like the type and I’m sad that this happened. 

I imagine if I tell my parents, i just won’t be welcome there very often. 

I’ve tried to figure out what I’m doing to make this happen over and over... and I thought as I got older I wouldn’t have to deal with it anymore, but I guess I’m just sending the wrong signals or something. "
What you should do is end it. He is displaying extremely alarming behaviour here and it will only get worse. 
"You should've left him after the first time he hit you. This man is abusive and you deserve better. Leave him. Do you want you kid growing up thinking that the way he treats you is what's ""normal"" for people in love?"
"Yes, besides most people won't see lunch on a work day as a big deal. In fact, lightly tease her about totally ditching you and you've have yourself a nice set up for a real date. "
"&gt;I’ve even suggested a paternity test, but it hurts. When I push it, my husband asks why I’m so defensive and says that’s fishy. Then claims he’s joking.

Your husband is being a giant asshole. FORCE him to get the fucking paternity test so he'll shut the fuck up with his shitty ""jokes"". 

Then force him to go to couples counseling to figure out why he doesn't trust his own wife."
"He has a brain tumour. Personality changes are a part of the tumour symptoms and treatment side effects. It’s physiological primarily, although a cancer diagnosis is of course devastating and hard to cope with. It is 1000% not you. Don’t take it personally at ALL.

Don’t sign a lease with him or support him financially in any way until he decides to get his shit together. 
"You weren’t rambling, it makes perfect sense. Thank you so much! 

I think I need to communicate better to him how much it has hurt me. He was only around for the comment his dad made, and the very tail end of his aunt’s drunken inquisition about the “surrogate” (which wouldn’t really be a surrogate, just him impregnating someone else). 
So he hasn’t been present for the large majority of it, and I think I need to talk to him more about how it’s made me feel. "
"If you don't want to go because it would be out of your financial comfort, then that's totally ok. But if your family finds out that you went on a trip instead of to the wedding, it's going to cause drama. Despite you and your friends having planned this trip over the past couple of years, the wedding was scheduled first, even if it was on short notice.

If you're ok with the possibility of creating drama within your family, then go on the trip and have fun.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not trying to guilt you into going to the wedding; more like trying to show you one possible result of your actions. At the end of the day, though, just do your thing and enjoy yourself."
"Have you googled carports and showed her all the fabulous designs you can do these days? I think carports are prettier than garages.

No reason you would need a garage unless it snows where you are. If it does, maybe you can grant her parking in the garage in winter."

"Your husband should not laugh off this behavior. He's basically teaching his son that it's OK to transgress people's privacy and sexual boundaries because he's autistic. Some visiting female relative will not laugh it off when he does it to her. The cops are not going to laugh and go along with it when he steals dirty panties from the laundromat or when he gets to know women by upskirt shots. 

What are the long-term care plans for his son? Are you OK living with him and participating in raising him for the rest of your life? What about when your husband dies, given that men typically pass earlier than women?"
"As someone raised by a fantastic mother and an angry, lazy dad, I really second the bit about doing it for your daughter. She’s young enough that it’s all white noise, but eventually it’ll be really hard for her in that environment. 

His behavior is abusive and I don’t doubt for a second that he made you dependent intentionally - that’s like step one for abusers. Thankfully, since you’re not worried for your safety, you can start taking steps to get your ducks in a row with some leisure. He’ll likely get worse the closer you get to being able to leave, so try to keep it on the DL. 

A woman’s shelter or DV charity/aid group near you should be able to point you in the direction of part-time work and/or childcare, since those are usually the biggest obstacles for women in your situation. Start saving money in an account he doesn’t know about as soon as possible. Could you possibly start doing in-home childcare for other kids? Regulations vary by area but most places (in the US) allow some form of that. Consider ALL your possible skills and assets (be generous in your listing) and see if you can monetize anything. 

Also, separately from that - mommy’s groups!Social media is great to look for (or start) a local meet up group for other SAHM moms, which will give you more peers, downtime (or half-downtime), and possibly help while socializing your daughter. All of those are good things and don’t have to cost money. 

Best of luck! "
"&gt;I know they love all their kids, and my mother seems to be trying to guilt me in by saying that it breaks her heart that we don't get along.

The time for her to fix this was when your sisters were ruining your life. She's being a shit parent and sounds like someone who will always just capitulate to your sisters even if it throws you under the bus. 

Now, they may have changed, but the manipulation that's being deployed here to get you to see them tells me that not enough about your family has changed to make this worth your while. I might take a bit of space from your parents."
"Has she ever been evaluated for ADD? She sounds *a lot* like my mom. My mom is an amazing person with wonderful qualities, but she struggled in school growing up and her parents made her feel stupid and she never had the confidence to pursue anything other than retail positions. As a result, she also had low confidence and constantly felt judged by others (especially those with careers). When my parents were married, my dad was often frustrated by how unfocused she could be, and how she could say/feel/do one thing one day and the next day would be the opposite. She didn't get diagnosed with ADD until her 40s, and suddenly everything made sense. 

I would definitely suggest reading up on the signs and symptoms of ADD with your wife and see if they ring true. I think for my mom it was helpful just knowing there was a reason for her difficulty with certain things. It boosted her confidence to know that she wasn't stupid and that there were strategies she could use to deal with it (medication being one, but not the only one). There are books and resources out there that are really helpful for family members of people with ADD as well. "
"I’m wondering if this publication can print a correction in a future issue so that you have record of your involvement in this project as you move forward. Best case scenario this was an oversight. If your team gives you any pushback though, you may have a problem. "
"Feminists call this the “mental load”. It’s not just executing the tasks, it’s the mental energy required to recognize what needs to be done, keep it all straight in your head, organize it getting done, etc. It’s invisible so most people don’t recognize how exhausting it can be. I can imagine it’s even worse when kids are involved - when is Timmy due for vaccinations and who’s going to make the phone call to the doctor? Did Susie do her homework? We’re out of eggs and have to remember to get them at the store. Etc etc etc. 

Ive had this same discussion with my partner, OP. Sometimes I don’t want to have to ask and delegate everything that needs to be done at home. I want my partner to pay attention and recognize what needs to be done without my telling him to do every little thing. I’m not his mom, he’s my partner. 

Also try and recognize that while managing the household is her “job”, that’s a job she never gets to clock out of. She is responsible for it 24/7 and that is fucking exhausting. You get to clock out at 5 everyday and stop thinking about work.
"
"Couple of things. First of all, there's a reason sleep deprivation is a torture tactic. You absolutely have to prioritize your sleep, which you know. If you have to cut off calls, even if she's upset, you have to cut off calls, especially since this isn't a one off. If something bad happened, like her dog got hit by a car or her house got broken into, and you were like ""Sorry, it's 11, gotta turn in!"" you'd be an asshole. But this sounds like a near daily thing. She's getting upset in order to control and manipulate you. Not cool. 

Second of all, you're the only person making compromises in this relationship. She's not even trying to respect your needs. Also not cool. 

Third of all, she values her wants over your needs. Very, very not cool. 

This is a really unhealthy dynamic, and you are well past your due date for setting boundaries. This kind of stuff would be a deal breaker for me, but if you want to tough it out, you need to get really clear with her and enforce reasonable boundaries that prioritize your needs and well being and job, not just her wants.

You've already spoke about it to your friend and follow up that you'd like notice if he was going to be at other events so you could not attend them. Set a boundary. You could leave him a bad review online to warn others but I wouldn't message his wife for family. 
"I once lived with my grandmother to help her take care of my 4 young cousins (the oldest was 5, to give you an idea) and she would do the same thing. She would say she was going to the store for milk, be gone 5 hours and literally only return with milk. 
I was just a teenager at this time, and all I knew was that it was annoying. One day I heard her talking to her friend on the phone and she said something like, ""I just sat in the parking lot listening to the radio. I just need to be away for a while.""


It sounds like your husband is the same way in that he's leaving to dump your child off on you; only he isn't elderly and dealing with 4 kids. He is dealing with one. 
I second the comment I saw about leaving him at the house with your daughter for a while. Take a leaf out of my grandma's book and say you're going out for milk and got caught up in the radio lol "
"This! But also, your brother in laws have been living in your parent’s house (assuming rent free), where has their money gone? Where they not smart enough to save money in the event that an emergency comes up. 

I’m usually all about family, but in this case I say no do not give them this money. And if you do, I would have a lawyer draft some type of contract to insure you’ll be getting paid back. "
"So what happens when you meet someone who makes you feel the same way she does, but with the added aspect of being interested in you and only you, not just sexually but with the potential for a relationship that isn't built on what is essentially the very definition of I Guess You'll Do? What happens if your partner meets someone who is everything she sees in you with the added aspect of being her preferred gender? You're addicted to the comfort and familiarity here, sounds like.

What happens when it goes away?"
Tbh I’d start looking into moving out because there’s no way what he’s doing is going to work out well and I wouldn’t want to be caught in any potential fallout. The fact he’s so defensive and hiding shit indicates he knows what he’s doing is wrong yet his continuance indicates he’s alright doing fucked up shit and confronting him is only going to make him dig in his heels. That mentor thing is the flimsiest bs but I don’t know what you can do without any explicit evidence of him being a predator like evidence of grooming. 
"For what it's worth, I doubt blood has anything to do with it. Plenty of blood-related families have fallen apart over money and wills.

It is partly the money, and the greed, opportunism, and survival instincts that go along with it. But I also think it taps into people's fear of being loved less, being looked after less, being abandoned. To a lot of people, wills feel like their loved one's final and most binding demonstration of what they *really* felt about them. I get that this is a reasonably significant amount of money, but people sometimes destroy their families over ridiculously small sums as a result. So this isn't about your adoption or even about you, even though it feels terribly personal. There's nothing you could have done or been to prevent this. 

It's a pity your parents never had a proper discussion between themselves about his wishes because it seems to have taken your mother by surprise. She may come around, in time - she sounds like the least hostile of the three, and is probably being heavily influenced and/or beaten down by the onslaught from your sisters and their spouses. You don't have to forgive, if that happens, but I would ask you to try to have compassion, if you can. She is stuck very much in the middle, and may genuinely not agree with your dad's wishes. She may feel that really, he should have just drawn a line under past contributions and shared it equally, in the name of protecting the family relationships. Or she may feel betrayed that he never told her his plans and be angry at being left to clean up the resulting family conflict, only she can't be angry with him because he's dead. I'm not saying she's right, but I am saying she is under immense stress, and you should take that into account when deciding what you can forgive, when the time comes.

Your relationship with your family is irrevocably changed by this, unfortunately. Truth is, it's likely that many of our family loves and loyalties are conditional or less valued by some than survival/money/other pressures, but most are lucky enough not to be tested and never have to face the proof of it. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Know that you have every right to the money, though - your father earned it, and it was entirely within his rights to share it out however he saw as most fair. It doesn't sound like you're going to lose the money - he's left behind sound reasoning, and you're all seemingly self-supporting adults. Don't let anyone talk you into giving some of it to your sisters in hopes of healing the family, either - the damage is already done, and they won't love you any more for it. At most, they will slather on a few fake smiles for a while. They've already shown you that they value whatever the money represents to them more than they value you, and there's no winding that back."

"&gt;Especially compared to the pics of my wife and I where she looked much less glamours than Sara.

...But you looked great I assume?! Ugh I don't wanna be that person but I am side eyeing this post slightly. Yes I think your wife is at her lowest now, she could have postnatal depression but I can't help that your main concern is that she isn't as hot as her/ your best friend - you refer to her as the hot friend a little too much imo. Maybe your attraction to Sara is pretty obvious to your wife?"

"&gt;I'll admit that I did some digging

Wow, so you invaded your brother's privacy, and went through his messages? That's an action that says to him, ""My desire to know information is more important than your right to privacy."" I'm assuming this isn't your first boundary-violating behavior, given that he's *engaged* to this man and didn't tell you. And based on your conduct, I can see why he might want to keep that to himself. 

&gt;How do I navigate this now? Do I have a right to be hurt that he didn't tell me sooner or am I being selfish and self-centered? 

It goes without saying that you owe him a thousand apologies for violating his privacy and his trust. Apologize for being intrusive and disrespectful. Because that's what you were. You may be his twin, but you are not entitled to know everything about him. No one has that power over another person.

Then, you tell him that you're not going to share this information with anyone. **And then you don't, OP.  Not a single soul. No hints, no jokes, no wink-winks, no internet browsers left open on the family computer, no *nothing*.** And then you tell him that how you found this out was wrong, and that since it was not something he was ready to share with you, it's up to him to bring it up, or tell you about the guy. You're not closet-ing him, you're respecting the boundaries he previously had, and letting him establish new ones.

And then--**and this is important**--you need to do some serious work not just analyzing your family, but **yourself**. You committed an egregious violation of your brother's personal space. Some people sever relationships over behavior like this, OP. It's a major violation. 

My guess is there's a reason your brother didn't trust you for years with this information. You need to do the heavy lifting, maybe with a counselor, to figure out why. Something tells me he doesn't see you as the supportive a sister as you've made yourself out to be. If you want to fix your relationship with him, you're going to need to take a long, hard look at yourself first."
Wtf why are you still with him? There is no salvaging this. You're wasting your time and it's going to end up hurting your child.

I'd be tempted to tell him I'm ending things before I wind up shackled to some tactless, holier-than-thou dude.

If you're worried it's just your anger driving you... Give it a few days. Maybe ask where he gets off on making snap judgements about someone that's invited him to their house and fed him. Consider if you want to be with someone that thinks so poorly of your sister or of people that aren't as degreed (lol he doesn't even have a degree) as him. Then make your call."

Adding on to this: immediately remove him as an authorized user on any accounts. Close the accounts and reopen them with a different card number. Close joint accounts too.

"My sister looks nothing like the rest of us. Stick-straight blonde hair and blue eyes (we all have curly brown hair and brown eyes), missing some common facial features, and has random facial features that neither of our parents have.

"Your good friend at university is a very wise person. Why are you giving so much to people who don't offer you anything in return? You are not an emotional support crutch, you are a person who deserves respect. But why would they respect you, when you don't respect yourself? 

By giving in and helping them and then never asking for anything in return, you are teaching these 'friends' of yours that it's OK to treat you this way, and it's not! Their mental health issues are not a reason to treat people poorly.

As a random internet stranger, I fully give you permission to say 'no' when they next ask you for a favour, and to explain to them that they don't give as much as you do to your friendship. Give them example after example of all the times they have blown you off, don't do it in anger or be accusatory. Just state it as plain facts and then explain what you want from your friendships. 

It doesn't matter if you want them to try harder to be better friends or for them to leave you alone, that's up to you. What's important though is that you draw the line in the sand and start taking care of yourself. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm."

"I think she's hurt because you accidentally confirmed her fear of visable aging. On the surface, it can be perceived as ""ouch"".

And the psychic will not refund the $1000 for that. 
"You seem to have a shit marriage and should take more responsibility for that but that's not what you're asking about. I'm also really curious as to how you've been parenting your eldest since you've remarried and why you would let this issue fester for so long. How often do you see your eldest and where? How often does he spend time in your home, holidays with you and your new family, etc?

Moving on to the issue at hand:

There's no reason for you to take your second batch of kids to your ex's to spend time with your ex and your eldest kid. OTOH your ex has no legitimacy forbidding that your eldest spend time with your wife/his stepmom. I understand it sucks for her but it's your new wife/good stepmom and you are the parent in charge on your own time. Stop acting like both women are equally and solely responsible for this situation given the difference I've just explained and take responsibility for your part in it as the father of those kids. 

Possible solutions:

* If you have a custody agreement, tell her to suck it. Obviously in more diplomatic terms but don't let her dictate what you do in your own custody time. 

* If you don't, get one in place.

* Alternatively, see the kids all together without either mom. 

ETA: just looked at your post history, the situation is much more high conflict than you are letting on (she refused to let you see your son since april 2018, lied to get a civil protection order against you that you were arrested for breaking and that was later dismissed...). **You need to sort this out with your lawyer**. Not a bunch of random redditors. Good luck.

"I think it's fair to tell her that you love her but can't and won't listen to her talk about him anymore. You have already talked with her about your concerns and she didn't heed them. There really isn't anything else you can do, imo. Sorry, OP. Hope everything works out. "

"I don’t think so, re: the visa. I’m looking into how annulment/divorce affects the visa, though."
"I think I would have a conversation with your girlfriend, I wouldn't outright say ""your best friend has a thing for me"" more that her body language and demeanour with you has changed since you were kind to her, and that certain looks she's giving you are making you wonder if, in her vulnerable state after a break up, that she might be taking the kindness a different way, as she obviously hasn't been treated nicely like that in a long while.

I feel like if you don't talk to your girlfriend, she may end up thinking you instigated things and it could get messy. Even if you think you might be reading into things too much, it's better to be honest "
So your wife ignores you all night while at another mans apartment alone until 4am. If you really think they just talked you are really really naive. That is 10000% a date and if I were you I would tell her right now that if she wants the marriage to continue she doesn't see or talk to him again. This is wildley inappropriate and I would consider it a huge betrayal of trust. They definitley did not just talk untik 4am.
"So I know it probably feels really hot and like a thing you should do but older you will thank you for avoiding him henceforth and never allowing it to cross into a sexual relationship. 

Not because of your friend and her feelings and all that (which is a good thing to consider) but because what's pretty much guaranteed is that you'd get badly emotionally hurt from this. 

When you are 40, think about this and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Adults who have sexual relationships with teenagers who have crushes on them are not good people. "
"You apologize to his family for the awkwardness, you take the ride from his sister, and you lose his number and never speak to him again. I don’t care what sportsball idiocy just happened, what he did was absolutely unforgivable."
"I’ve seen situations like this quite often and they *always* end badly. What usually ends up happening is the woman finds another woman that she’s sexually and romantically attracted to, realizes that she can have both in a relationship, and leaves the guy that she never really had true romantic/sexual feelings for behind. If your girlfriend is really a lesbian, you “getting more experience” isn’t going to help your sex life. Nothing will help your sex life because she’s not attracted to men.

Take it from a woman that also dated men before realizing she was only attracted to other women: there’s a big difference between *realizing* that you’re a lesbian and *accepting* that you’re a lesbian. It sounds like she still hasn’t done the latter."
"This was such a heartbreaking read on behalf of the existing boys. They seem to mean nothing to her.

There are so many ways this could end in tragedy. She really sounds mentally unwell, and therapy isn't helping much. She's willing to throw her marriage and her children away for this idea. And what are the odds that even if she had a healthy daughter, that said daughter would fulfill whatever magical role OP's wife envisions? "
"Well that seals it then. You're living with somebody who has a neurological condition that makes it impossible for him to be an adult, and he's refusing to treat it.

Ultimatum time: he treats it or you're gone.

None of this is normal or something you should have to deal with. You're in a relationship with a three year old."
"I'd avoid the husband, but only until you give your sister a warning that either she deals with him or you do.  Can you imagine living the rest of your lives like that? It's gotta end sometime. Why not now?"
"Another point to consider:  why is your husband trusting anything his ex is saying at this point?  You mentioned the mother stated she would allow their son to move into your home on the condition he doesn’t change schools - yet over the years she structured their infrequent visitation based on *her* whim, without any consideration to the needs of her son and relationship with his father.  

What if she gets the proverbial wild hair up her ass and revokes her consent once you have all moved?  

Bottom line:  your husband needs to get to court ASAP and get visitation formalized, and have his ex resign primary custody in writing before I’d ever consider such a drastic move. And then I’d lay down terms with respect to appropriate bedrooms for the children. "
"I would definitely tell the police this story. They won't be able to do much right now I expect, but it starts to build a history of behaviour. This can be useful for them to have if his behaviour escalates"
"It is a normal problem however he is taking advantage. It sounds like conference, school loans should take priority.

"&gt;During this same fight, he mentioned that they had hooked up a couple times (making out) when she was staying at his house 2 years ago (a year before we met). He wanted to continue it, but she didn't. It blew my mind because this ran in contradiction to all of these statements he had made about things being over between them for ""years and years"" and nothing romantic had happened since they were ""much younger."" When I called him out on this, first he kept on insisting that it wasn't romantic and it was just hooking up, and then he admitted that it may have been romantic, but he just forgot and in any case, ""years and years"" was technically true since when he made that statement, it had been two years. 

He’s a liar. "
"Absolutely tell the rental company. Also, ask the flatmate that you trust to give them a call as well. Any complaints will have more impact coming from a few people. Keep pressing them! It's important that the rest of you present a united front. If they won't do anything, you may have to look for another living situation. 
Secondly, you are well with in your rights to ring the police if drunken flatmate becomes overly aggressive, or makes you fear for your safety. 
Also, Citizen's Advice will be quite a helpful resource as they'll be able to advise you on either finding a new property, dealing with your current landlords (if they don't do anything) and what rights you have regarding removal of said troublemaker.

"Because there is a lot of ***terrible*** advice telling you to show your girlfriend this post, I feel that it is important that I counteract that bad advice.  She already told you to drop the matter, so that's what you should do.  Your description of your feelings here is fine, and your feelings are sweet and well-intentioned, but she already knows the way you feel and does not need to hear you acknowledge her changing body again.  There's nothing wrong with how you feel, it's just that it confirms an insecurity of hers.  Her insecurity is not uncommon and unfortunately, as you recognized, society is not kind to aging women.  Just make sure that going forward you compliment her in ways that do not reference changes to her body and you're good dude."
"Does she really have OCD-level standards, or just standards that ensure everything gets and stays clean?

Food on the floor kinda should be cleaned up immediately by the person who dropped it or it can lead to other problems and general grossness. And things like dishes need to be done so they're clean at the end of the process, or what's the point?

I've met a ton of people with unrealistic cleaning standards, but I've also met people who have no cleaning standards and are surprised when their spouses/SOs get frustrated. Are you willing to tell us a little more about your girlfriend's standards for specific chores? I think that's the only way to tell whether she's being unreasonable."

"So I was having a conversation with my friend once about her niece and nephew. She was expressing to me that she didn't understand why her sister was so paranoid about what they watched. After all they'd been raised in a household where just about anything was fair game, their dad was a big fan of ultra violent westerns, and their mom was a horror buff and they were watching that stuff at 4 years old and clearly they turned out just fine. 

I asked if she'd considered that maybe her sister had not had the same experience with that material, and maybe she felt she'd been negatively impacted viewing it and that was why she wanted to keep it away from her own kids. My friend paused and said ""You know, actually I hadn't thought about it like that.""

I grew up in a gaming household too, I watched my dad playing Doom and my mom liked adventure games like Zork and Sanitarium (if you like horror and haven't played Sanitarium I recommend it, it's a classic). I'd stand behind them in the computer room and watch them play and give helpful suggestions. This experience didn't harm me, and I didn't have nightmares, and obviously I didn't grow up to be a serial killer, but looking back? I don't think I'd do the same with my own kids in the event I ever have them. 

Which is the long way of saying we are all of us the amalgamation of our experiences and our interpretation of those experiences and some people are always going to hardcore project when you do something differently from the way they'd do it. If the kid's not waking up screaming in the middle of the night I'd say keep on trucking, but there are a lot of people who can't separate ""I would have found this distressing as a child"" from ""all children must inherently find this distressing.""

At the end of the day you do you. I personally think you sound like an awesome mom. Just take a deep breath, remember parenting and children flip a crazy switch in a lot of people's brains, and that every stranger is going to have an opinion about child rearing but that doesn't mean you're obligated to listen to them. Kid's doing fine? Yes? Great, that's all that matters. 

THAT SAID

Do make it clear to kiddo that other parents will be less liberal with their content viewing practices and those are boundaries that should be respected. You know it sucks that she might not get to share her favorite horror movie/game/stephen king novel with a friend because jimmy's mom said no, but thems the breaks. 

(Another fun story, I would break into my dad's stephen king novels around age 12 because I didn't understand a lot of them but they were just accessible enough that I wasn't outright bored. My access to those ended when I walked up to mom in the kitchen and went ""What does Rape mean?"" She about near dropped a plate.)"
"Yeah, at this point it's sort of the status quo to disinvite BF from stuff for Alice's sake. It probably would have been easier to challenge the first time it happened, before letting it get so ingrained.

Hopefully they can still get Dave to realize how batshit this is, but I honestly wouldn't be holding my breath.. :("
*”I don’t want to be he killjoy that spoils his evening”* does he give you the same consideration? Did he think oh man I know my girlfriend hates this and we’ve talked about it so maybe I shouldn’t like my friends thirst trap pics because I don’t want to spoil my girlfriends evening? 
I feel her. I had a guy follow me around at a party because I wouldn't give him my number. He literally stayed until 4am (I was sleeping over at the house) just sitting on the couch watching me until my friend had to basically kick him out. Guys can get very obsessive and scary when they get rejected.

"I'd say this is ridiculous. He went full nuclear just because you dare have a life with your girlfriends? Does he normally behave this way when you make plans outside of him? We all know it's not disrespectful to attend a wedding without your SO. He just drew a line in the sand, OP. "
"Yeah the fact that he immediately started making plans to move out as soon as you even MENTIONED the age of his “friends” is him announcing that his intentions are not pure. If he was just “mentoring” these girls and everything was above board, he wouldn’t be working so hard to conceal this stuff from you. He wants to bring them back to a house where no one will intervene. 

Bleurgh, OP. Trust your instincts. This guy is no one’s friend. "
"Came here to say this.

Check pawnshops and online merchants and see if you can find them, OP.

Your mother is despicable.  If she has a key, get it back.  Even so, try to get your locks changed.  She sounds like someone who would make a copy.

So sorry about your keepsake dolls, OP."
" I was with my partner for 7 years before we got married and we were past the total gushiness, and not sappy people to begin with, and I still felt good going into it. Your problems scream a lot louder and more concerning. I’d be back pedaling out of there if I felt like that. "

"Oh my god, you could have so much fun with this.

Get a big group of friends together. Have them come over at a time when he's there and watching porn. Don't give him any warning, just welcome them in and invite them to sit in the living room while he's sitting there with a boner and some porn playing.

Script things in advance if you have to. What's important is that your friends' role is to immediately notice and comment on how embarrassed they are to have walked in and interrupted him at such a sensitive moment and how sorry they are. And then you chime in with, ""Oh, don't worry about it. He does this all the time.""

And *then* your friends can go off in shock and horror about how gross and fucked up he is that anybody would habitually watch porn in common living space when their roommate or anyone else is around, and what the hell is he thinking, and so forth. Make it intensely awkward for him to keep sitting there.

It might not fix the problem but it should at least be really entertaining."
He's been sharing big lies with another woman for 15 years.  You can't trust liars.   You will literally *never* be sure if he's being truthful with you for as long as he's in your life.
"Could a compromise be serving some vegetarian food ? Plant based meats are really a taste that take getting used to as is tofu but you can easily serve some pastas that although won’t have meat in them will be tastes people are used to. Like pasta with mushroom sauce or something instead of stock, Potato bake, margarita pizza etc. although it may have animal product it may be less upsetting to your fiancé than seeing a dead animal at her wedding and will be things your guests are used to and probably more comfortable eating although not falling fully into your belief system "
"Definitely this, and definitely say the last part. He continued to do what exactly you said you DIDN’T want."
"Okay, story time. When I started dating an ex he wasn’t good at boundaries. He would go down on me until it hurt. And not in a fun way. I would be trying to push him off me and failing. I was too embarrassed to ask my friends about it - after all, who complains about getting too many orgasms?? 

Fast forward a year and a few discussions about how I was abused as a child so consent is really important to me. One of the things I really hate is being woken up to sexual contact as it generally brings on flashbacks. 

Despite this I regularly woke up to him fucking me (I was always in bed first as I started work at 6am) - and decided the best course of action was to play like I was still asleep and just let him finish, it never took long. I could endure for ten minutes or spend hours arguing and bringing up my issues - and I had work in four hours...

With clarity I can say I was raped, multiple times by a guy I loved, and who everyone thought was perfect for me. Because I never realised it at the time because I didn’t realise that not saying no isn’t the same as saying yes. Please don’t follow my footsteps. It was painful, and sad, and nobody should have to comfort their own abuser."
"Ya, that was absolutely killer. She sounds rad af. "
"First off, report the fake account on facebook. Next, you can go to the courthouse and attempt to file for a restraining order. This will disallow him from contacting you electronically too. Not sure it will work if you don't have recent evidence of harassment, but you can sure try.

All of that said, let's address what is going on with your husband. The fact that you have evidence that this guy was your ex and harassing you in facebook PM, but he *still* believes that you were cheating, is absolutely 100% unacceptable. 

Your marriage is severely broken if a hateful message from a random can cause your husband to believe a random PM over you. You guys need to get into counseling stat and address the extreme insecurity that your husband clearly has.

"
"When you cut through all the details, here's the story I see you telling:

* You are in a relationship that's not working because your partner doesn't even try to help carry the weight of your lives.

* Your partner has been put on notice of the problem repeatedly but hasn't done a damn thing to fix it.

OP, if your boyfriend ever changes, it's going to be because you left him and he didn't get you back. But by definition, that means that you're never going to see that change. Maybe you dumping him wises him up; maybe not. But that's the only way out of the problem that I can see. 

So, to me, your choices appear to be:

* Stay with your boyfriend; nothing changes.

* Leave your boyfriend and find somebody who's better.

Not much of a choice, if you ask me.

P.S. - This whole thing about whether you have anger issues or whether you shouldn't have yelled at him is a distraction. You could be an angel and the relationship would still be broken because of what he doesn't do. "

"This stuck out to me as well! It seems wicked bizarre that Dave would oblige to the needs of his GF's sister rather than stick up for his so-called ""best friend,"" especially for an event where he would *want* his friends in attendance. The only possible reason I can think of for this behavior is the GF is just as controlling as Alice and Dave refuses to stand up for himself...?"

"Do not try and change your religion for a man, no matter how much you love him. If he can't accept your religion, then he is not the guy for you.

Plsu, you'll have to take that for the rest of your life!"
"Why Sasha has been left along to be the primary caregiver is beyond me. Even if their relatives stopped by every day, he should have been removed and sent to live with a relative so he would not have to call for an ambulance for his dying mother every so often.

"Yikes.

OP, you are in no way ready to marry this man. If the only feeling you can summon towards marriage is resignation, I think you need to put the brakes on this wedding until you figure out what you actually *want*, as opposed to what you just accept as inevitable. "
"I know, and I've been pushing it more recently since I've decided not to be a doormat. She recently tried to bring it up and that was the answer we got, so now we're juggling not letting them over and she has to go to them or meeting up with them prior to hang out at something else to get them comfortable.

I'm as exasperated as you are and I don't know why I let it go on this long either."
Exactly. Why didn't OP just waive the waitress down or go up to the counter as soon as she left? It sounds like dating isn't the only social interaction OP needs more practice at. 
"You don't have a hickey. You have a burst blood vessel in your neck.

It's weird how much work your wife is making you do to ""prove"" nothing nefarious is going on. Has she ever had an unexplained bruise on her thigh/butt/inside of her knee. This is basically that on your neck. Ask her how she would feel if she had an unexplained bruise on her thigh and you refused to accept any explanation than that her lover gave her that bruise ... how would she feel?

I gather you've been together for a couple years. You have a daughter. You don't mess around. the last time there was was a crisis of trust was years ago over something completely different (and also quite minor). This is about her lack of trust. You have done nothing wrong, and you shouldn't let her lord over you with a single (or even a few) small mistake(s) that didn't impact her all that much.

At some point your partner is either paranoid or looking for a reason to leave you. If this is the case, you have no choice but to let her leave. She will regret it for a long long time. It's impossible to prove a negative."

"It’s not gonna make up for a damn thing. I guarantee that even if she gets that girl she craves, fate has a funny way of screwing over parents who write scripts in their heads for their children. She’ll end up with a daughter she doesn’t understand, and sons who resent the hell out of her for treating them like they weren’t good enough. And she’ll sit there at the end of her life wondering why her children feel the same way about her as she does about her own mother. "
"But she's not a failure,  she's average. There's nothing wrong with average. Your husband just doesn't love her and instead of realizing that there's something broke in himself he's blaming everyone else."

He didn't need to tell you that. It was calculated to play upon your insecurities for his benefit. He doesn't love you. He's not a good guy. Sorry

"She knows what she did.

Be thankful you've only put in 6 months to this relationship. Get out now before you invest more into this ticking time bomb."
"Oh, my. It wasn't an ""affair"" but rape of a minor and grooming.  Calling it an affair minimizes the truth - that it was an ongoing criminal act. Your parents were absolutely horrible and borderline complicit in blaming you for seducing this person. As a child, you had to make sense of it in order to survive, so its understandable you blamed yourself. BUT IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

There is a lot of history that is beyond our pay grade, but most of all, and I realize this sounds very cliche, you need to get yourself to therapy. This is in regards to what happened to you, and especially with how your parents blamed you, continue to blame you when other men show their attraction for you and all of it is swept under the rug with this guise of one big happy family.

Also, you are bringing your children to their house. Do you feel your kids would be any safer with your parents and their attitude than you were as a child?

Re: neighbor.  Yes, your horrible parents would blame your neighbor.  I'd either ignore it and block his number or send him a text to stop with this flirtatious shit right away as its disgusting, then block him.  Block him no matter what. I don't care if his wife is dying and he's having a hard time. He's just another shit taking advantage of a sad situation so you'll feel you can't shut his ass down.  You have no reason or obligation to talk to him and it sounds like he's been chasing after you for some time.  You are right to be angry that he has shown such disrespect to you and your marriage. 

And then, I'd not visit the parents until you get this past issue sorted out.  It sounds like is a regular occurrence that your dad's friends/colleagues see you as a self-serve salad bar. What does your dad say, do or not do to make his friend think this? What kind of people are these friends to begin with to even think its permissible to treat you this way?  

You are in a continuous cycle of abuse when you are around your parents. They essentially make it clear you are free for the taking then blame you. This is one of the most horrible, disgusting things a parent can do.  You've normalized this behavior because it started out when you were so young and you understandably had no other method to process such a violation, and betrayal of trust, and your parents' failure to protect you.  Add the fact that they blamed a 13 year old and you have one messed up situation.  

Please, get some therapy. Your meter for what is ""normal"" is way off.  Women who happen to be particularly attractive or average or unattractive do not, in any manner, deserve blame for the acts of sexual predators. You've been trained/brainwashed to ""nicely go along"" and ""don't make a fuss"" so its also understandable that you feel very uncomfortable in confronting your neighbor to stop with this shit, or to respond with a smile and say, ""oh, its ok!""  

No. None of this is ok.  I'm so sorry all this happened. Please think of yourself, and your kids, and get help.  This will not be easy in facing the reality of what your parents have done and continue to do.  It will hurt.  But its long overdue that you get the professional help you need to protect yourself and not take responsibility for things over which you had no control, and stop giving your parents a free pass to allow abuse (and perhaps invite abuse - I'm wondering what your father may be doing/saying to his friends, and if it leads to his friends thinking you are free for the taking.)"
"I think it’s a fair reaction to dump him for that. If you want to wait a few days to see if the agree subsides and you still feel that way then do so, but to me this would be a major dealbreaker. The elitism and the refusing to talk it out and apologize, this is definitely a red flag that foreshadows much worse issues in the future if you stay with him"
"If you are looking for support in leaving, you have it. If you are looking for support in trying to make it work, you also have it.

You may not like where you are, but you did have choices and you made them and they turned out mixed.

"If they were truly different people, they wouldn't be harassing OP. They need to accept responsibility for their behavior. "
Whyyyyy are you still with this man who clearly doesn’t care about your child. 
"Whoa. You are not being unreasonable (OK, 2 hours at the gym makes sense if it includes changing and showering, but the other figures are astounding).  First question: have YOU tried going out for similarly extended periods on a regular basis?  I’m guessing not.  I have a 3-yo in a distinct mommy-wanting phase, so I know this is no small proposal, but it sounds like talking this out is not making the point. 

ETA: Also, you are saintly for saying you’d be totally cool with his going out more often for shorter periods...but you don’t have to be!  You two have a kid. It’s fair to want him to further modify old social habits to adjust, especially when his current pattern takes away entire half-days from the family on the reg. "

"I think its bothering me that 'assume she was truthful' isnt your first instinct.  

Stop overthinking everything. Its not a date or a relationship unless you two have TALKED about having a relationship or date. 

Dating someone in the same office, even if its not the same company, can backfire for a person in so many ways. She may want to keep things friendly, but not cross the line into dating you just in case you do something like overreact and flip out and make things super awkward at work. You shoukd be thinking about that too, she may be a crazy stalker. 

Chill out and stop having expectations. "
You didn’t stand up for your girlfriend because you ‘didn’t want to make a scene’? You really dropped the ball! And stop talking about GF’s Spanish which is completely beside the point.
"1.  I think what happened is exactly what you described. She was drinking with her friends, got ditched, was rescued by a gay man, and was reunited with her friends afterwards. She doesn’t remember, so obviously she won’t be able to tell you if she was drugged or how much she drank. Overall though, she is safe and she is with her friends. She’s an adult with her adult friends doing adult-type things. Leave it at that. 

2. You continue the conversation by saying that it really worried you. You trust her and want her to have fun, but you care about her wellbeing and it worries you that she was alone in a new place and can’t remember what happened. At the end of the day, she is free to make her own decisions and she is in control of how her night goes. 

Tbh what I’m most concerned about is that you’ve only been together a few months after both getting divorced, and you’re already both very clingy to each other....."
"Either she was kissing her boss’ ass so she can get good assignments or she was careless about her relationship with you and decided to flirt with a married man, who is also her boss. Either way, it’s fucked up. Tell her to stop her shit or break up. "
"Who knows if you'll even be together by the end of summer. You're both incredibly young and sorry to call a spade a spade, but this is clearly a rebound relationship for him, still in the honeymoon phase. Not saying it definitely won't work out, but I definitely wouldn't be moving in with someone I've only known their existence of for 4ish months. But to answer the question- stop worrying about it and just be courteous and polite when you do eventually meet them. They can only hate someone based on previous relationships for so long. If you're a genuine, good person, they'll come around eventually. And i'm sure his parents aren't petty enough to worry about instagram follows and who is exes or friends with who. None of that will matter. "
dont need to hire a maid the MIL is already living there and being paid for - she can earn her keep too!!!
"Is he allowed to play the Ex treated me badly card forever?   Does it apply to never going to lunch with a co-worker or friend?  His paranoia is putting you in a bad spot.  You can't be the generous person you want to be because it gets him all triggered.  You'll need to tell him, you are doing a nice and a reasonable thing for someone.  He needs to understand you are not his ex.  He can't put down rules for you based on how she behaved.  Tell him you are not going to treat people in a dick way just because he had issues with his ex.  He'll play this game forever with you as long as you let him.  "
"ITT:  OP wants to still hang out with hot best friend 

In all seriousness I think your wife lost her identity when she became a mom.  She should re-enter the workforce and gain her power back. 

As someone who had a best friend that everyone fell for, loved, and was good at everything, it really fucks with your head.    If she's prettier and good at everything, what space do you fill?  Where is your win?  Cleaning shit all day? 

Sara needs to be kicked to the curb not because she's a bad person, but because it's impossible to compete.  Forsake all others and turn into your marriage.   Start with that and work your way down."
"honestly why are they uncomfortable with you in the first place? your wife's **best friends** shouldn't be so uncomfortable around **her husband** that they DEMAND you leave or they aren't coming. something else is going on here. I can't help but think we aren't getting the whole story. 

no one just demands the home owner leaves their own house so they can visit with a friend because they're ""uncomfortable"" with them. like either you have some history with them or someone is spreading lies about you or they're legit batshit crazy for making such an obviously weird and socially unacceptable request.

Can you create a Google account and write your journals and store them in Google Drive or similar service?
"Most magazines have a few paragraphs in the editors notes with corrections. I would write a request to the magazine for a correction and forward it to your office director for you both to send it off together (so the magazine knows it's legit.)

"You can’t change someone like this. You can’t change other people , period. 

You are probably feeling fed up right now because she left your child stranded. That’s a huge NO in my eyes. If you want to work on this with her, you’re going to have to straight up tell her either she gets counseling and learns to schedule her time, or whatever consequence you feel you can carry through with.  Google the term, “scientists have found out why you’re chronically late.”

My family member was always hours late for every thing. One year, and this was like 30 years ago, we started eating Thanksgiving dinner without her (she showed up 2 hours late), and she is still angry about that to this day. I don’t hang out with her anymore. "

"She is an ass. That being said, BF should have stepped in a whole lot sooner given it is his mother. He needs to let her know how innapropriate her behaviour and comments are and that he won't tolerate her treating you that way. "
Your wife almost didn’t marry you because of how your mother treated her during wedding planning and you’ve never bothered to find out exactly why she almost walked?
"Gotcha. I mean, at some point you and your boyfriend have to stand up for yourselves and demand to be treated with respect. That means you don't go to the weddings of people who mistreat you. You don't sit around being sad about being disinvited from birthday parties, because you stop hanging out with fake friends like Dave. Dave is responsible for his own actions and he has shown how little he cares about you two. Believe him."
"I probably wouldn't respond. If I did, it'd be ""Initially I wasn't interested because I'm just out of a serious relationship and not ready to date. It wasn't personal.

"&gt; this may stem from a somewhat large exposure of pornography when I was a teenager

A large majority of what you see in porn is not pleasurable to most women (jackhammering, face fucking, aggressive fingering, anal with no prep, etc) and the women in those videos are paid to pretend they enjoy it.  Most women in real life don't want to do sexual acts that are physically uncomfortable/painful, so I would keep that in mind when you are making requests in the bedroom.

That being said, the two of you may just be sexually incompatible and it might be time for you to move on."
"Be sure you get Max into the vet and start a record that you own him.  Is he chipped?  If not, get him chipped in your name.  This is in case she says she'll sue you to get the cat back.

"&gt;And our several date nights a month always felt rushed because we had to pick Alyssa up by 9:30.

This is an easy fix and one that won't impact time with your daughter.  It's time to find a babysitter in addition to your nanny.  It's not surprising at all that a full time nanny doesn't want to stay later than 9:30 a couple times per month but that's a very early curfew for adults.  So look around for an additional date night babysitter.  Care.com is a good resource if you don't have anyone else.

Keep your ""trips as a family"" expectations very low.  Toddlers are not good travelers.  They don't like being in cars, can be absolute hell in restaurants and often will refuse to sleep in unfamiliar places.    So plan for short distances and take along food and snacks for the car and hotel.  Room service breakfast is a good investment from a stress reduction perspective.  "
"If he’s into the pace and she’s into it, I don’t really see the harm. Some people aren’t really the “go slow” type, as long as they are both on the same page I can’t see a problem.

My partner and I were like this when we started dating and that was 10 years ago. It can work."

"He did, but it wasn’t until a while later. He told her that it was Keegan. She eventually confronted Keegan who said he had been there but it was entirely Ashlyn’s idea, and at the time he just thought it was kind of funny. He didn’t realize what Ashlyn’s intentions were. Rich and Ashlyn dated for a little bit, but he eventually felt guilty and got ahold of Jen and apologized for everything. 

Actually, they’re back together now. They spent about a year and a half apart, and slowly started talking again. They’ve discussed the situation heavily. Part of me thinks she’s dumb for going back to him, but I can also understand why he would have reacted the way he did. They’re very happy now. "

"I have a crazy amount of allergies. When we go to my boyfriend's parents' house I bring my own stuff. Over time his mom has figured out what I can and can't eat, but I still always check the package and often I'll cook with her cause it's fun, but also to make sure it's right. It's sweet when she finds me something to eat but it's never expected.

She's a rare gem, though. My own mom frequently poisoned me before I stopped letting her cook because she's inattentive. My boyfriend's dad would poison me by accident just out of lack of awareness. 

Her health is her responsibility. I'm sure she made mistakes when she first found out about her allergies and poisoned herself early on. If she wants your mom to cook she needs to know there's a learning curve.

She shouldn't feel like she's apologizing for her allergies but she also shouldn't put someone else in an impossible position. "
"Maybe, but they’re being awful saying her kids aren’t “real” family members. Even if she did have  more kids they’d have to cut that shit out. "
"Your sister is your own age and raised you? Why can't you take care of yourself?


I mean I don't know why you have a curfew but if that's what you agreed on then keep to it. Same with this dude, you knew your sister wouldn't like it so don't go acting offended when she found out and turned out to not like it. 



You're letting her care for you and are acting like a kid, you have a curfew, she gives you money, but simultaneously fucking 25 year olds and sneaking around about it. No shit that's going to irritate her.



So either keep to her rules and continue to let her be, basically, your mother. If you do so voluntarily then respect her and respect what she's doing. The downside to that is being treated like a kid and having her be overprotective. 



Or stand on your own. 



To sum up: Yea she's overprotective, but you're acting like a kid, so it's not weird she treats you like one. "
"I mean it's basic math but whatever..

Anyway, one night I heard a faint, strange sound coming from the basement (this was storage), something I had never heard before.  so, I called my then-boyfriend and asked him to drive over (about 20 minutes) and check it out for me.  

Dear reader, *he came.*

He immediately drove over because I was worried, and that was all he needed to know.  He carefully checked out the basement, called the all-clear and walked me out to my car after I closed up.  At no point was he the  least bit put out, and he actually seemed to find it odd that I thanked him!

*That* is how you handle the situation, motherfuckers!

And yes, dear reader, I *did* marry him!"
"She sounds like a very self-centered person with an ignorance towards her own health. When you have special dietary needs that go above and beyond the ""norm,"" it's only fair that your bring your own food options. This is what self-sufficient adults do."

"You said:

&gt;I found the 17 year old girl on his facebook friends list really easily and there was nothing on her profile where anyone could have assumed she was over 20, she was talking about prom and general high school stuff all over her timeline.

Once he is gone, find her parents online and give them a heads up the creepy guy in his mid-twenties who is chatting up their underage daughter!

What this guy is doing is wrong. He knows you don't approve and is running away so he can continuing preying on young girls without judgement. Shine a light on this dirtbag.
"
"Your first paragraph you said this was a mistake from the beginning. You need to take your son and go. He sounds desperate and desperate people do things that I know in your head you are saying ""he'd never do that..."" get out now before he harms you and your son. It won't be easy,but you will be happier. This is not healthy for you or your son"
"Thanks for reading. It seriously does sound like a plot from catfish. I don't have any plans of showing him this. We got trust issues, sure, which is almost separate from figuring out who has it out for me. Knowing I'm innocent hasn't provided any peace of mind for me. 

I still worry it is someone on my side. I've called everyone I know. Maybe it's someone I went on a few dates with and then told them I wasn't feeling a connection. If they're twisted enough to go to this much effort, they certainly wouldn't have any problem playing dumb about it either. "
"I agree with other commenters who say this is probably about more than the money and is about her poor relationship with your family. 

However, you don’t mention what arrangements you’ve made for your young and possibly growing family in the event something happens to you. If your plans involve your wife receiving handouts from your parents rather than other independent funds (eg life insurance payouts) I could understand why she might feel vulnerable with these arrangements."
"Yeah it sounds like one of those woolen lies, if you keep tugging at it the whole thing will unravel. It sounds like she's trying to play innocent. Move on OP, find someone who can respect their partner."
"Just bring the bottle home in a bag stored in your trunk and when you come back tell the RA that you don’t feel comfortable living with your roommate anymore because she clearly snooped though your items so hard she found the false bottom of a box you had for *personal items* and honestly you don’t think you can spend a year with someone feeling like you have no privacy. Can she help you get pushed up the list for a new roommate. 


(Obviously when I say *personal items* I mean imply it’s a vibrator and you were being discrete but somehow she found it. Not your hidden wine.)

Edit: I assumed you were going home this weekend. If you aren’t just pass it off to a friend in another dorm to hold onto it for a bit. "
"The two therapists that you mention, this was for marriage counseling, right? Or was it just for her, to ascertain whether she was depressed? 

Assuming these were marriage counseling appointments, did the therapists give you any advice for improving your relationship? How long did you see them? Why did you stop?

I think you guys have probably become incompatible and you shouldn't stay with someone who no longer makes you happy, but marriage counseling is a reasonable step to take, which is why I'm trying to figure out how much you actually tried it."
"We already know Alice sucks as person. That much is clear. It seems you need to stop defending Dave and acknowledge that he also sucks as a person (and has no spine). If he was truly a good friend, he would stand up for your BF, not bow down to his future SIL's ridiculous demands."
"First, I don't think she thought of it as a date. A lot of people don't date amongst co-workers or people, they are forced to see every day. I can't see why she shouldn't have been genuine and wanted to catch up with a friend and asking you if you minded was just to be courteous, you have no say in her actions and you would have looked like a freaking weirdo telling your sort-of co-worker, she couldn't leave you alone in a restaurant. "
"This does NOT sound like she has a ""weak stomach,"" This sounds like she needs to get to the doctor. "

"To me, that line was the most significant, because it indicated that he may be feeling insecure about the amount of love he feels for the child.  This is just speculation, but I wonder if that could actually be the root of this whole problem.  He expected to be overcome with blissful love when he met his child, as we all conditioned to expect, and instead he feels sort of indifferent.  So now he's searching for an explanation for that indifference; there must be something wrong, in his mind.

I agree he should get therapy.  He might even be suffering from the male version of PPD."
"It is fair to her. Right now, you cannot be the 100% platonic friend that she thinks you are. You are also suffering, so I think she would want you to take care of yourself first.

You're not disappearing forever, just putting distance in. Spend some time apart, develop intimacy with other friends, then one day find your feelings for her have dramatically lessened and you can be close with her again.

For my own tip, I think it helps to hyper fixate on flaws. Just remember the version of her in your head is different from the reality if you date her. That helps keep me at arms length."
"Yeah, it seems highly unlikely that an otherwise decent and trustworthy person would knowingly and intentionally throw away expensive and emotionally important stuff, then swear and hang up on the person they've wronged... let alone, OP is her damn daughter.

This is *bad*."
"This won’t resolve itself, your dad is incredibly abusive, and seems sick mentally. The only way this will get better is if you leave, you need to cut ties with someone like that. He sounds like my grandfather, an incredibly abusive (physically and sexually) Guyanese man who will never change. My mom escaped his clutches at 16 when she fled to the US and never looked back. My aunt stayed in his life until her 40’s when he tried to have sex with her. She cut him off too. He never will change. It will get better, I’m sorry that in your country you can’t be yourself and must be covered, especially if you don’t want to be covered that way. 

Please, try and get out of a situation like that. I’m not sure if going to a school abroad is even a possibility, or how things work where you are. "
"Yeah a lot of people have a very simplistic ""punnet square"" type understanding of genetics while most traits are controlled by many genes and it's more complicated than ""mom and dad have blue eyes, how did I end up with brown""."
Please go see your doctor about birth control right away. Look into your options and select an option to make sure you don’t get pregnant until you’ve sorted out all the other stuff.
"You said you'd be hurting her a lot by leaving. What about all the hurt she's caused you? She's not divorced, she's not even separated from her husband. They still live together, and have a joint account together. She'll 'probably' get divorced in two months? Would she be doing this if you hadn't found out? I find it doubtful. The fact that she wanted to make sure your relationship was a sure thing, and asking about marriage while she's still married to another man is ridiculous! I'd be slightly more inclined to believe her if she came clean to you with no prodding, but you had to catch her in a lie. She's not cheating on you, she's cheating WITH you. Ask her if the husband knows about you. Does he have a girlfriend? I bet he doesn't have a clue. 

Leave her. She's the worst kind of woman, and if she actually does divorce her current husband and marry you, how long do you think it'll be before she decides to 'upgrade' again? "
"What a shock, the racist guy is also incredibly disrespectful to his wife. You so rarely see those two traits in the same person."
Yep. What nearly 30 year old women have sleepovers that often (or at all really)?
"There's a comedian who once said, ""before I speak, I ask myself three things:  Does this need to be said?  Does this need to be said by me?  Does this need to be said by me, right now?""  And that has really never steered me wrong."
Feed him to the spider.
"Wow, reading that made me sick. I agree, I think OP's boyfriend is similar to this. Especially the creepy ""just let me love you"" thing.

I don't know if this is saying too much, but from my own personal experience, I dated a girl who was very much ""broken"" at the start of the relationship so to me honestly it's incredibly twisted to see that some people want you to need them in order to be attractive to them. I always wanted the best for her and for her to be healthier mentally, but eventually we grew apart and I was completely at peace with that. 

OP, you should be with someone who wants you to grow as a person, to be the best version of yourself."
"The family member of your ex has chastised you and you think he'll give you a positive recommendation? You haven't ever even worked for him. I'm sorry you no longer have access to this opportunity, but untangling yourself from this family is for the best."
"The illness itself can also make a person seem ""off"" or maybe ""drunk"".  She needs to start medication and therapy. It will be a rough road and she may decide that medication isn't for her, it is tough. 

I do think you have a little bit of privilege because the way you talk about her and mental illness gives me the vibes I get from certain people when they learn about my illness. Always suspicious of me, if I don't want to share things then I am ""hiding"" things. You said in another comment you can't understand WHY she would disappear and then ""suddenly"" come back (she didn't, you said his aunt found her)...I mean, be glad you don't have to live with schizophrenia. She disappeared (but thankfully was found before she was murdered or killed herself) because of her illness.

I am not saying you have to take her in, I guess I am saying a little more compassion in this situation would go a long way. This is your husband's sister, everyone thought she was dead. Another statistic. Of course he wants to help her in every way possible."
"I never get this. It’s not a deal breaker if it doesn’t break the deal. He knows now that he can keep doing this and face no consequences. Stop normalising his behaviour. 
OP, you're a parent and are modeling shitty relationships to your kids. It sounds like you have a lot of issues therapy could help you sort out. You don’t deserve this. Your kids don’t deserve this."
"""... He was pretty mad about the car prank since it was new but again these pranks are harmless.""

I'm not sure *you* get to be the sole arbiter of whether a prank was mean or not. Using that logic, wouldn't it be entirely fair for *him* to decide whether his prank was mean or not? That's the standard your establishing: the prankster gets to determine whether the prank was appropriate or not. Clearly that's absurd.

A couple other points: pranks tend to escalate. I can see a pattern of escalation in your pranks. The clock thing was clever. The mayo and car prank weren't funny. They were gross and mean. So he decided to commit the mother of all pranks to totally outdo you.  And he did. His prank was about 5-10x meaner and less funny than your mean and unfunny pranks.

You both really need to apologize to each other and stop being not funny and mean to one another.

IF it makes you feel better, I once read a story on reddit about a husband who pranked his wife by pretending that he left their toddler in a hot car. He even had a fake baby and everything. That prank was worse than your boyfriend's"
"I don't think it's that uncommon a feeling. It's a fear of missing out. You always hear about other people's hookups and flings, but what you don't hear about is the weeks or months they spent alone trolling tindr and bumble in between those. 

I know a guy who put his fiancée ""on hold"" because he wanted to experience life and sex before he ""settled down"". They decided to go no contact for the first 6 months, and then see how he felt about it all.
 Sadly enough, even though he was only 27, real life didn't live up to the movies or (probably exaggerated) stories of his mates, and he only slept with 2 other women in that6 month period. He later realised that first time sex and dating was exciting but he missed the connection and intimacy he and his fiancée shared. Unfortunately, in his quest to experience youth and wild times, he had neglected to take into account his fiancées pride, self respect and idea of love, and his sweet kind hearted fiancée didn't enjoy this little self exploration of his at her expense. By the time he came knocking on her (former residence) door,  she had sold the engagement ring, and moved across the state. It crushed him, but that's the game of life and love. 
"
"Sooo are you staining the carpet, dropping food and leaving the floor wet and then doing a sloppy job of cleaning up ? Or is she actually OCD ?

 “I didn’t mean to leave a festering mess covered in a stained tea towel” is a bit different to “I meant to wash the pots after I fnished my meal” 

Intent means nothing if you’re an appalling slob to live with and do a half-arsed job of tidying up. 

So is she being wholly unreasonable ? Do you do a good job of tidying and cleaning ? Or is she at her wits end trying to keep the environment hygenic ? Or something in between ??"
"&gt;Not only has he liked it, he's commented with a gif saying 'my queen'

Break up with him."
"You're right.  Once she moves in, your life will be hell and you'll have to move out of your own place to get free.  

Offer to help her find a place of her own and get her STBX to pay for it."
"This is not a Rochelle problem. This is a boyfriend problem.

Stop being the girlfriend who doesn’t say anything in fear of being a nag. Tell him this makes you uncomfortable. Ask him to cut off contact. If he doesn’t, then I personally think it is worth re-evaluating the relationship over.

This girl seems a hot mess. She doesn’t respect your relationship if she is alluding to times that she had sex with your boyfriend. And your boyfriend needs to stop contact. You can too, but I think that it is worse that he is in contact because something like this (or worse) will happen again. Think about it: can you see her coming on to him again? Because she was drunk or whatever. I wouldn’t want that kind of person around my boyfriend and he wouldn’t want to be in that type of situation. Talk to him."
"I don’t think you were wrong at all. In fact, if my mom slapped my girlfriend I can say with certainty she would have gotten slapped back. I wouldn’t have even been mad because you can’t hit someone and then play victim. His mom sounds crazy. I can’t see why he would defend this behavior, is he a mommas boy? "
"Get the *hell out* OP. He’s decided your reality doesn’t matter. He will not stop this. The plan is to break you; either you admit you asked for this abuse or you simply fall silent and allow it. Do not respond to his verbal abuse. Do not give an inch on this. You have to leave. He pulled the initial punch at a social event hoping you would be surprised and embarrassed and not debate it. He’s going to continue this til you break and *let him do what he wants*. Don’t. 

You have to leave. There is no relationship that sees this behavior and then bounces back. He’s literally extending a hand to you with the words “Accept this abuse”. Do not take that hand. Leave. "
"I'm curious how/why you two decided she'd be a SAHM.

In some cases, it's really what the mom/dad wants to do with her life. In other cases it's more a 'ow fuck childcare's expensive' decision where the stay at home parent feels they're making a sacrifice by quitting their job, but it just makes more sense. 

I know it doesn't change anything on a practical level (her hours at home vs yours) but I do think it's important to be mindful of when you ask your wife to do more. 

If she's feeling like ""I got the short end of the stick, I'm the one stuck at home and now he's also complaining about the chores"" it's going to be a different conversation than if she's the one insisting your kid should have a SAHP. 
"
Dont forget to explain that if they truly have changed they will respect your wishes.
"Congrats on graduating and on surviving that. Please, please, please always remind your mom what an awesome person she is. It must be so tough for her and she was the brightest star in the universe that night! "
"That is an abuser's MO - dragging people into a dependency hole they can't get out of. Find a local women's shelter, if you need to get out immediately. If you can't, given your kid, find a job. If you SO won't let you - that's a clear sign that he's trying to keep you complacent. At that point, absolutely find a woman's shelter. You owe your daughter that.. "
"Anyone else seeing a sea of red flags?

I'm calling this a creative writing series.  Don't believe a bit of it for a second.  The buying matching pajamas was the last straw."
"I feel like you’re being very overdramatic here. It doesn’t sound like too formal a date at all and from the sounds of it, you were finished eating by the time she met her friend and so I don’t feel like its half as rude as you making it out to be. Also, why are you even bringing up the fact she paid at all, nevermind as if it is also some kind of problem? She probably felt rude for leaving and thought it would be a nice gesture to pay (which it is). Really struggling to see your point at all here tbh. 

edit: also just seen your comment that you didn’t invite her out with explicitly romantic intentions. More to the point that she has done nothing inherently wrong or nasty."
"Nah, she will be convinced that OPs Mom is terrible at cooking and tried to “poison” her just like her ex’s mom"
Take a dog toy over - a rope chew or something (not food) and start a conversation.  That’s a really nice thing to do and you’ll have a chance to meet your neighbors. 
Oh goodness. You ARE part Latino so everyone needs to STFU. You’re not a fraud so be confident in who you are and your truth and don’t give two shits about anyone who has an issue with it. 
"So your husband:  

- Is a raging misogynist 

- Thinks you’re just a brood mare and receptacle for his sperm

- Threatens you with physical violence

- Tears you down emotionally for the fun of it

- Tries to force you to have sex with him when you don’t want to

- Threatens to ruin your life if you don’t do what he wants

- Is teaching your child to hate and disrespect you (and any future women he meets)

- Doesn’t even actually like you, let alone love you

Why on Earth are you putting up with this?? This man is so abusive and misogynistic, it’s almost a parody. Leave him immediately. If not for yourself, do it for your son and all the future women who will suffer at his hands, since he is being taught that misogyny and abuse are okay. "
"What a tough situation, you have my admiration because I can't even imagine dealing with all that.

First, I think the way your husband spoke to you is absolutely unacceptable. It was disrespectful and you don't deserve to be spoken to like that.

But, considering her past, I can kind of understand your husband wanting to carefully manage the risk of setting her off as long as she isn't actually trying to rip someone's throat open with her teeth. it doesn't sound like you two were communicating about this, you were deciding and asking him to execute. You might ask, don't you have the right to decide to enforce policies around your children? And he could just as well ask, doesn't he have the right to decide when it comes to his child? So you two have got to remind each other that neither of you is the enemy in this difficult situation, that you are on the same team, and you've got to work together and talk it out. Decide together how to make course corrections when something doesn't go well. Maybe a family counselor could help you figure out ways to problem solve together better."
"Yeah. Sleeping over at someone's place 7-10 days per month, regularly, is unusual if they're just your friend. Considering these are social visits and not like crashing at someone's house because of work or something, it's pretty odd."
"&gt;I take supplements that he gives me, and he has told me that he thinks caffeine is negatively affecting my mood and making things worse, so even though I didn't really see it I've told him I'm stopping drinking coffee.

that your boyfriend gives you? wtf, he's not a doctor. and he made you quit drinking coffee? I haven't even got to the ""bad"" part of your post and this already sounds like total crap.

&gt;When I told him i needed to go in, he locked my door and held it shut from his drivers side, there was no way for me to get out of the car and he started screaming that I need to understand how he feels all the time and said something along the lines of ""I could punch you right now, you make me so fucking angry"", and ""don't even try to get out or fight back, you know I'm stronger than you"", and made fun of me because I was ""probably going to go cry to [my] mommy and manipulate her into thinking [i'm] the victim"".

You tell your parents EVERYTHING and you break up with that asshole. He is an abusive fuckstick. If you stay with him, he WILL hit you."
[deleted]
"&gt;I'm pretty sure she **should** know how my gas rewards card works because **I've explained it to her before**,

Emphasis mine. Your friend's reaction would indicate that she might either not believe your explanation, not remember your explanation, or just might not give a shit about your explanation because it doesn't line up with her version of reality.

Given that she's actually going so far as to tell people that you're untrustworthy, I would 100&amp;#37; drop/block/ignore her from now on. Smearing your reputation because she doesn't understand how rewards works is completely inappropriate and IMO, not something you can/should allow a person to do, and stay your friend. "

Is he being treated with medicine for his adhd? That entire post screamed adhd at me.

Would they blame them for seducing some sick abuser too? I would not let those two anywhere near a child of mine. Ever. "
"Yes, I was thinking it was a bit weird. I still can't believe she just barged into our room and bathroom! And messed our living space up to get to him.

I guess I would understand more if Max was her cat before we adopted him, but he belonged to another family and she served as the go-between.

"the corresponding (ex)religious sub might also be a good place to discuss this.

i'm going to guess /r/exmormon ?"
"You're not excited because you feel like he's only doing it because you browbeat it out of him and not because he wanted to marry you.  And it's hard to get excited about something you're doing out of obligation and not actual interest.  The first breakup was probably the time to let it go, the second one DEFINITELY was.  

The baggage you've got is too numerous to be carried on this plane - if I can use a terrible metaphor."
I love this and it's true. You really can't fix this kind of stupid.
I would stop describing your husband as a “very loyal” or “good” person. His loyalty is in the wrong place.....
No one goes two weeks without communicating with someone they're really interested in. Go out with the new guy. Maybe A will hear through the grapevine and get his head out of his ass. 
"This. Taking a Private Sector job would make him contacts, get him savings, some structure, etc. Without any real previous experience and with no connections or networking previously it's gonna be REALLY hard to get going.

He is better off working Private so he can get experience and contacts. Then he will be contributing while he assembles a plan. He could transition to Freelance by taking jobs little by little until he has enough of a Portfolio, business connections, and clients to leave his private job

I just started my second business. My first business I started just like your husband, but because I knew no one, had no Portfolio/way to show my experience, it was a flop. Without those things I had no way to really generate business for myself. So I went back to being an Executive Assistant at a tech company. I saved some money, did a lot of networking and sample work. And eventually started taking gigs on the side until I finally just didn't have time to work at my 9-5 anymore. After this experience I learned from some entrepreneurs I made friends with that you never start a business or consulting until you have a big network and a surefire way to display your product. Maybe your husband needs to take a step back and look realistically."
"There's some truth and a lot of childishness to her complaints about work. Let's face is the service industry is the new American under class. They do not get treated well and are highly disposable. That's why I was sad about her anxiety to go back to school. She had a partner who was wiling and able to support her doing that. Not all people in her shoes get that.

I will say though that she is not lazy around the house. Even now when she is depressed, she does the lion's share of cooking and helps keep our place clean. As for why she didn't work before, I guess I have no good reason for that. The only jobs she qualified for made her miserable, and we truly didn't need the income, so why force her to torture herself? She kept our home immaculate, did all the gardening and appointment/bill coordination, and all the cooking. The cost of a full time maid, private chef and gardener was way beyond my means, so I feel like she more than earned her keep.

But here she is turning into a burden. If she matched my income we'd be doing a LOT better, but we can make it work where she's at too. But her constantly quitting every few months is killing us. We need consistency."
"If I were you I’d focus myself on my daughter.  

Your wife is busy making all these life changes, but where is your 6 year old in all of this?  


She shouldn’t be with some lady your wife has only known for two weeks and she shouldn’t be watching her dad fall apart.


"
It's ultimatum time.  He needs both grief and anger therapy.  He can start with grief but if that doesn't make it better then he does anger management or you take him up on the offer to divorce.

It’s gotta be someone who knows him. Also you should be way madder that he believes a rando phone call over you. On some level he must suspect you of cheating if the phone call equivalent of junk mail convinced him you’re cheating. 
"Well, she can't make you lie anymore. It's time to be honest with CPS. "
Your girlfriend hates your mom just because two years ago she wanted to bring a gift and your mom said it wasn't necessary?
"This is how my old abusive relationship started - the testing of what he could get away with. 
The only problem was that he was absolutely perfect inside and outside 99% of the time... until that number dropped down to 85%... to 70%... until I found myself being relieved not to be around him.
The gaslighting and abuse was so slow and gradual I kept justifying it in my head for a year before I finally broke it off.

You feel hurt, degraded, upset by him and he tells you it’s a pointless argument and doesn’t stop? That’s abuse."
"God that sounds like something I would say. It sounds like she's comfortable with your mental health and felt like making light of it in a way to make you feel better. 

I understand the truth behind it hurts, but some people (like me) truly feel that laughter is the best medicine and having the strength to laugh at the dark things in life that you can't change makes life a little brighter. I've had it backfire on me like your gf plenty of times too. "
"Not only do you not have to ever speak to them again if you don’t want to, you can also tell your parents to stop bringing it up. Ain’t nobody got time for that noise.

Having said that: it would be a good idea for you to talk to someone and work through your unresolved feelings around this. That was a big thing you went through and it wouldn’t be surprising if you have massive trust issues now because of it."
"Yeah ... she doesn't get to throw that in your face now. Unrelated, old, completely irrelevant."
"You are an angel. Everyone should be lucky to be surrounded by someone as kind and loving as you. I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm absolutely sure your friends are looking at your actions with nothing but love and gratefulness. "

If it's not making you happy to make a long term commitment to someone and have a huge party to celebrate that, why are you doing it?"
"If they have such a successful family business, they should have consulted a lawyer about how to protect the money legally.  The way she's doing it would make her *more* vulnerable in the case of divorce.  Most courts do not look favorably on hiding assets from ones spouse."
"Him: I'd like to have dinner with my family this weekend. 

You: Have a great time! Be back by X so I can X. 

And give him the same consideration. You're not being unreasonable. You both need equal amounts of time away from each other as well as your child. "
"Personally, I think your husband is being a bit of a jerk about it. Our children are adopted, so they don't look like either of us. I think it would be so cool to have a child that looks like the woman I love. "
"This dude is going to seriously hurt you or even kill you one day. You need to get out and never look back.

He's not sensitive, he's not overworked. He's a pyscho with anger issues and loose hinge. Those objects *will* be you one day if you stick around. He's controlling and extremely dangerous. You're in an incredibly abusive relationship."
"As I’m chowing through some chicken thighs as a dedicated meat eater, I say you are totally fine offering only vegan food. It’s something you believe in, it’s the way you live your life.

"There’s got to be more going on here.... 
I might be the suspicious type but I definitely would do some recon before making a decision. Put your damn foot down... 7-10 days a month! ha yeah no.... something is certainly going on. Sometimes when you’re in the situation it doesn’t seem THAT odd, but this pretty damn odd. I’d for sure get to the bottom of this if I were you OP, no way no how is this just some sleeping over bs "
"The behavior of the first partner doesn't match his description of her, which is worth considering. People don't typically make drastic personality changes for the better, and this is almost never prompted by the ex getting a new partner.

What are you getting out of this relationship?"
"Definitely go by yourself. I’m a fan of solo vacations, and if you love it there and he refuses to go, you shouldn’t suffer by not going. "
Four years is a normal span between partners. You are both in college. That's the age group of your peers. Don't second guess yourself. Enjoy your relationship and date who you want.
This was the exact thing that happened to my mother. Youngest and only girl with three older brothers. My Oma and her did not get along for years. Eventually they went to court and my mom was put into foster care. That is how much resentment built up.

"Yeah, you fucked up. She said “I want to leave” and you sat her down instead and seemingly talked her into staying. Sure, you left the option there to leave “up to you”, saying that creates pressure. Pressure on her to make the call to leave, and you asking those questions “what can I do to make you comfortable” reads in that situation as - “what can I do to make you stay” because she already told you she was uncomfortable and WANTED TO LEAVE. You sitting her down after her expressing that, peer pressured her into staying. 

At the same time she’s a grown woman and could have left by herself, but of course after being groped the last thing she wants to do is go off and find a way home *alone*. "
"What do you think would happen if Amy got divorced, or her husband died in a car accident?

"Firstly, please stop justifying your weight, clothing etc. You have no reason to apologise for any of that, it's completely normal.

Secondly, there's a reason he told you this and it wasn't to make you feel better. Take this as a warning to get out ASAP. I know I probably wouldn't take this advice if the situation were reversed, but just keep it in the back of your mind."
"So, I'll play devil's advocate here for a sec.

I'd add that OP should start preparing to lawyer up. If she plans to take the children fully that's awful especially following such crappy behaviour and actions 
Yeah ... what grown woman has that many sleepovers? Wtf?
"Next time you see him drink water, stare him down. ""Wow, Dad. I see so many women drink water. I didn't think you'd be into that."""
Don't be surprised if she dumps you. You acted like a coward. Also fuck your dad and brother for laughing. Your family members are assholes. 
"Hugs are also something friends do. It may well just be that she's a huggy person. 

And paying the bill could just be a nice thing to do, or an apology for running out on you. 

She might be interested in you she might not, but there's no evidence either way in what you're decribing"
"This is really poor behavior on the part of your wife. It does read as insecurity and jealously of her own daughter, which is crazy unattractive and frankly harmful to Amy. 

You need to talk to your wife about it, though I understand it's a delicate subject. Sit her down and let her know what you have noticed but try to act more confused then accusatory. Reassure your wife that you love your wife in a sexy way as a romantic partner, and that you see Amelia as your beloved daughter. 

Tell her that Amelia is a child and when your wife competes with or copies a child it makes you feel uncomfortable and is not attractive. You like her as the independent adult woman she is. Let her know that of course she can wear makeup if she wants, but she doesn't need it. You've always been attracted to her without it. Tell her that posting pictures right after daughter does or changing into the same clothing right after her daughter does is weird since it's copying a child. It makes you uncomfortable. 

Also, tell her that since you see Amelia as your daughter you want to be able to spend time together and compliment her like any father would. Give the couch example. Tell her that was obvious and unkind. That it made Amy feel bad and made you feel bad too, since your daughter was sad it makes you sad. Of course your wife can join you but when she pushes Amy away, copies her, teases her, drives her away, or tires to one up her it is very obvious and uncomfortable for everyone (you, Amy, and Amelia is embarrassing herself). 

I'd tell your wife that you want her to feel confidant and loved and suggest some one on one time just the two of you. Maybe some nice date nights or something. You love that your wife has been kissing and touching you so much lately, but you'd prefer it to be when it's just the two of you and not as much in front of your child. It's awkward. Also, it makes you feel weird that she kisses you more in front of Amy then when your alone. It makes you feel like the kisses aren't really for you, and makes you feel bad. 

Then, when she doesn't just accept and handle all of this gracefully (since I'm super doubtful of the maturity of any mother who would act this shit towards her kid) suggest marriage counseling. I think you need to recognize that poor Amy needs to live with her mom for two more years and if Amelia keeps this up she will destroy her relationship with Amy and probably give Amy some sort of psychological issues. As a parent you need to put an end to this. "
"Therapists are great because it's extremely draining and unfair to expect other people in your life help you work through extensive issues. OP has a full time job with a long commute, he doesn't need to add counselling his wife to his responsibilities. If she's unwilling to see a professional then why would she even listen to him? "
"If she is still holding a minor untruth from years ago as evidence that you can't be trusted, she should have left you then. She doesn't get to run you through the wringer for the rest of your married life. She's never lied to you?

She (or both of you) needs counseling."
"He sounds like an asshole. When he makes those comments about you being more comfortable in a trailer, he's making fun of you. He says he isn't willing to financially support you but I can't find anywhere in your post where you asked for him to do that. He's making excuses and being cruel because he doesn't want to live with you."
"&gt;He recognizes it isn't a healthy attitude and occasionally makes a small effort to try to budget, but he usually gives up after a day or so (""I don't like to feel deprived."").

Do you have enough money to do everything that *you* would like to do? If not, I would ask him why he thinks that it's okay for you to make sacrifices while he does everything he wants to do?"
Don’t say anything yourself to her. Call child protective services anonymously and tell them what you know. 
"I think normal trial separations don't include cuddling, kissing, and movie nights with lot of wine. That is the opposite of a trial separation and kind of defeats the purpose. 

I think a normal trial separation includes time alone to reflect and find yourself and decide if you're happier alone or if you're still in love and want to work on the relationship with a renewed passion."
Move on OP. The fact that he did all of this behind your back without asking you up front is evidence that he doesn't trust you at all and doesn't seem to be remorseful one bit for invading your privacy.
" ""I have to do what is best for all the children. Having all 3 girls in the same room with their vast ages differences is not fair or healthy for them. I am not moving unless that issue is resolved."" "
"So here you've got the twin pressures of misogyny and dealing with someone who would prefer that his daughter is sexually harassed rather than rocking the boat in any way. My dad behaved in the same way when I told him about my uncle's inappropriate behaviour. This isn't a mentality that all men (and indeed women) have but it is very common and I really do think telling your mum is still the best option, regardless. If telling her causes family drama, that is not your fault. It is your uncle's fault for sexually harrassing a child and he should both expect and receive consequences for that. "
"Haha, you are right. But the last sentence is so hilarious, I burst out laughing.

OP this is the top comment, IMO. Your friend tried to be a sneak, and figured if he got rejected, which he did, he would pass it off like he didn't realize she was in the shower.  You may not be able to do anything about the sneaky act he just tried to pull off, but you can certainly keep your guard up from now on, and inform your girlfriend of your suspicions. He is thirsty as fuck."
"The ""no filter"" tag is such bullshit, it means they have no problem saying hurtful shit and when you get hurt, they respond with ""Well you know I don't have a filter"".

No, you don't have class, tact or me anymore. Because no matter what anyone has to say, there is always a polite way of putting it.

Disagree with sisters quick marriage? All he had to say was, ""that was incredibly risky for her to do, give up her life to travel across the country to be with him after only a month. Hopefully it continues to work out"". Or, ""I don't agree with how they're did it, but it's really none of my business""."
"""Husband, tonight I'm telling James he has 2 weeks to move out. I expect you to support me in this conversation.""

If your husband pushes back, just say ""Enough is enough. He goes in 2 weeks or I go. Choose.""

You don't have to justify not wanting to live with an asshole freeloader. It's your house."
That 1.5 mil was before she was married and there is no law to require you to take a salary. Sheesh. I have good money on someone wanting revenge. I mean who would know this anyway?
This is what doesn’t add up for me. I’ve grilled my boyfriend about it several times because I said to him there must be more to this than he’s telling me but there really isn’t. I think she just isn’t a pleasant person. She tried to get her childhood best friend to break up with her fiancée of 10 years because she felt like she could do better (when he’s a super sweet guy). She loves to create drama whenever she can from what I’ve been told. 
"You guys need to try to get back on the same team and figure out things together. It's reasonable for her to want her car to be protected. It's reasonable for you to get to have your space to work on cars inn your property had promised. Could you add on to the garage? Build a sturdy carport? You guys need to approach this together, Not as adversaries.

Also, be careful about taking about ""my money"" or ""**I** bought her a car"" when you're married and she made considerable sacrifices for your career. They're shared assets."
"Uh yeah all you're asking for is more than fair. It's time to have a big sit down with your bf and tell him you're not up for hosting at all, and that your compromise position is no more than (think what you can really stick to- one week? Two weeks?). Emphasize this really won't work for you and you don't appreciate him committing your space without asking. He needs to feel the inconvenience from you- make your voice heard.

When you together have decided on what is the max you can put up with, it's his job to go to his friend and say: hey, I spoke too soon on the crashing thing. We're going to be able to host you for (time agreed on) but you need to find an apartment by (x date). I can help you look and you should become planning now to find a place by putting applications in for July. A month is just too long."

Again to reiterate: you are allowed to get whatever you want, and she is allowed to react however she wants, and if it is a deal breaker you knew that going in and doing it....

Even being gay might cause problems if part of her vision of this hypothetical daughter include coaching her through boyfriend problems &amp; doing the common heteronormative teasing about having 'boyfriends' when she's like 6 years old.

There are infinite ways this hypothetical girl could fail to meet your wife's fantasies about what having a daughter is like, and the fallout will be terrible for the daughter, your wife, your boys, and you."
Yeah that is really fucking annoying.  I have to nag my husband to take care of his shit because it's inconsiderate of him not to when I need to use the machines for my own laundry.

"Time to have a serious conversation with your husband about your expectations from him for your family. Talk and find a compromise that works for both of you. This sounds like it could lead to a lot of resentment on your part and you guys don't need that toxicity in your family. ""Husband, I am starting to get frustrated in our marriage for X, Y, and Z reasons. I need stability from my partner and what's happening now just isn't working for me anymore. How can we work together to solve this issue?"" See where this conversation takes you."
You're a grown man and no one not even your mom should control how you want to spend your time. You sound like you don't want to break up with your girlfriend so why even think about that in the first place? Your mom has her own issues because of her friends being abandoned by their kids and she's projecting. You should talk to her and explain that you're not planning on doing that ever and then make it up to your girlfriend by spending more time with her. 
"“Ohhhhh, lets talk about your medical issues first!”"
"It is perfectly okay to say ""I cannot be the person you complain to about this any longer"".

Frankly, your girlfriend played herself on this one. When I was teaching university, I called her mindset ""the fatal calculation"", because when you decide to just blow off 8% of your grade, you are counting on the idea that you can get full marks for the other 92%. But the students who do this never get full marks, partially because that attitude is indicative of how they're going to do the rest of their work, and partially because frequently the stuff they blow off would have helped them with the rest of the things they need to know."
It’s only a matter of time before he begins hitting you. This is abuse. You need to leave. You can’t make him not abusive and angry any more. Leave before he hurts you. 
"Well she may have been furious and delt with it, but just didn't want to discuss it with you.    Some people are very private.  Your part in this is over, and I would not create a stir even if he does come around.  If you told this lady about it for her sake, then you have to respect her enough to handle it on her own terms.  Talking about it to other people at work could also make things really difficult for her."
"What is wrong with your friend? Because of what you were wearing, you were asking for it? That's bullshit. It's not how she should treat her friend, and it's not the type of behavior that should be modeled for a group of kids.

I think you could tell the wife what happened and softening it by saying that it was inappropriate to be doing in front of kids and in public rather than accusing him of attempting to cheat. And it was a terrible example to set for children because it teaches them that lewd behavior from a man is acceptable in any circumstance. If the kids are around 10 years old, they're not as oblivious as you would think. "
"If they really wanted to save the house, 5 adults could get a job in fast food...  &gt;:)"
"Their treatment of you is awful. I hope you see that. I hope you're able to get counseling to grieve the loss of your dad, and of being so ignored as a child. You deserve time and space to get support for your family rejecting you.

Your resentment is clouding this issue. You're looking at this like you finally have power over them to either give or withhold love- in the form of money- that you didn't receive. You are imagining that they need you and you can save them. Perhaps that they will even be grateful and invite you in to the Christmas party and to the love they share between themselves and to the family home. Well, no. No amount of money will buy affection. These family patterns are too deep. You resent their closeness and they in turn resent your success and independence.

So try to separate. Would you give the money to support your mother in retirement? Would you gift it with no reciprocation? Would you buy the house outright and ask for rent? Would you evict if they never paid? Would you have invested in the yoga business? Why invest now, when they've put everything in what you knew to be a losing investment?

Consider why they're in this situation. Why is a household with 5 earners and no mortgage in dire straits? Haven't the husbands been saving for years? If they love the living situation so much, why don't they pitch in? What other options are available?

Keep in mind that begging to you via text and calls costs nothing. They got everything they wanted from your dad with similar tactics. Begging, if you have no pride, costs nothing. It is cheaper and easier than taking out a HELOC, pooling all resources, getting a job, or dipping into savings. So to you, it seems like the last thing before the bank repos the house. But maybe not! You don't know. And you're considering giving your money emotionally without being in a position to explore all other options. That's their work. But don't let guilt drive the decision without knowing all the facts."
"You need to tell her he sucks. You know why? Because she already knows on some level that she's married to an asshole, but odds are nobody she's close to has said so to her face yet. So in the meantime she's gradually losing friends, and eventually it's just going to be her, her douche husband, and the boatload of rationalizations she undoubtedly makes to explain why he is the way he is.

Also, if this is how he speaks to casual acquaintances in public, imagine what he probably says to your friend in private. 

She may need the cold water shock of being told in so many words ""I hate your husband more than I enjoy spending time with you, and so do all our mutual friends"" to jolt her out of her denial. "

THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT!

We see this pattern a lot with male abusers--he'll blame his violence on his temper, but strangely never lashes out at anyone but the victim. When he throws or breaks things, it's always the victim's stuff. 

OP's GF wasn't going to hit OP while he was holding someone else's wine glasses, break them and have to pay for that as well. She was waiting for a chance to let OP know she decided he was in contempt of her law and deserved to be punished.

"The whole time this was happening, over probably 6-8 months, there were so many times we looked at each other like, “This has to be a set up. Is this The Truman Show?” I sincerely hope you end up finding out who was behind it. Even if your relationship isn’t salvageable, hopefully you can cut the asshole behind it out of your life. "
"&gt; I told my friend that her BIL was really creeping me out and she said he’s just like that and he probably didn’t mean anything bad. I tried to tell her about the staring and she sort of accused me asking for the attention by wearing such a ridiculous bikini to a kids party. I said she knew what happened, as I told her about being late and target and all that. She said something like “**I’ve known you for too long to believe that**.” And she walked away from me. Again, not being super witty...I didn’t have a comeback.

Not to blame the victim here but why is your friend this dismissive of you? "
"I agree. She was so far away and could have easily just swept it under the rug and OP never would have known. They wouldn't have had him call you.

From this story I honestly have no clue what happened. My only guess is they got into some crazy drugs or did way too much of something. Maybe her drink was spiked.

This seems like a really confusing situation. Only thing you can do is talk it through with her and figure out what happened."
"Look up the comic ""You Should've Asked"". There's more then just chores for her, there is the whole emotional load that comes with trying to take care of everyones wants, needs, and desires. And please get rid of ""the holding all the cards"" mindset, it is not helpful at all. Assuming you are 100% right (no one ever is) is not a healthy mindset to have. You both need to find a way to communicate with out judgment or defensiveness. Counseling is a thought."
"You did the right thing and this teacher is a predator. It sounds like he's been grooming her for a while and you should make a plan to get away from your toxic family as soon as you turn 18.

"This is a great topic for discussion because the answers are going to vary wildly depending on everyone's various experiences. The main question is: do you *want* to cover your scars and what would a tattoo mean for you? I have a full sleeve and I love it. I started working on it when I left the school I worked at for two years and the class of kids I taught with special needs gave me beautiful cards as a going away present. I had my artist take those designs and make a sleeve out of it -- it's something I will never regret, and those students are people who have permanently impacted my life.

&amp;nbsp;

One question is: **are you covering your scars for everyone else's benefit or your own?** You mentioned people harassing you about it is chipping at your confidence. People, for better or for worse, are compelled to ask me questions about my tattoos. I'm used to it now and when they are creepy I'm good at shutting them down. If you're trying to turn negative attention into positive attention, then I think you're on the right track for getting a tattoo, just understanding that some people also think negatively of tattoos.

&amp;nbsp;

  
Another question is: **do you want your tattoos to memorialize or erase your scars?** What I mean is that I had a big nasty scar from when I removed a melanoma (fortunately non-cancerous, but that was the scary part) from my upper arm. The tattoo I got over it has just made the scar prettier -- reminded me to pay attention to my body and care for it. The scar is still there, and the tattoo has made it nicer to look at for me. With raised skin, the scar will never go away, but you can certainly hide it. Just make sure you're getting the tattoo for reasons that make you happy instead of just to appease society. Work, stigma, and harassment are all very practical things for you to take into account when going into it, but at the end of the day, the most important thing is if you will feel positive about yourself getting a tattoo.

And, now, my personal opinion: tattoo the shit out of yourself! XD I love my tattoos, they make me happy. I get friends tattoos with my closest friends and the ink reminds me of happy times/challenges in my life. I hope this helps you! "
"It sounds like counseling is in order here.

Also, after she has an outburst, you leave, and she's ashamed, you say you then win the argument by default - is that because she just gives in because she's ashamed of the outburst? If so, she's still not learning how to handle problems like an adult. When you gets back, don't let her concede everything as a form of apology - tell her that you still need to discuss the issue, and draw her into a calm conversation about it. The best way for her to apologize to you is learning how to handle a problem without yelling. If she can learn how to negotiate after an outburst, she'll have a new skillset to replace the yelling with."
"Was looking for this. The doctors visits, the hormones and injections and body changes; donating eggs isn't a walk in the park and having support is critical.

I would recommend talking to him more about his reasoning. 'Coz condoms' sounds lame and I would bet there's more to it than that."
I agree. Just because he was rude doesn't mean you have to be. That way when his family finds out you dumped him they will know that its because you were too good for him.
"You're not wrong for wanting to go, and I totally feel like they are being overprotective/rediculous but there's not much you can do if you can't convince them. They have a point too. You're 19 and an adult and they have no obligations to continue paying your bills. It sucks but if they want to cut you off they can so unless it's worth it to you I wouldn't risk it."
"&gt;  it breaks her heart that we don't get along.

What, it didn't break her heart when you were being shat upon, but when sis wants something it breaks her heart that she can't provide it? 

That is definitely manipulative as hell. Whether she really intends to be that manipulative or not, I don't know, but it's not OK. She's putting the blame on you for the relationship your sisters destroyed. "
"Compliments that insult other people are not compliments.  And just because those things don't hold value to him (but really, he doesn't consume art? He doesn't think medicine is a worthwhile pursuit? Market research is easy? Does he not know how stupid people are when you group them up?) doesn't mean they don't hold value.  


I think it warrants a sober talk with him.  I'm not sure it's break up worthy, because he may honestly not know.  A lot of people think how he worded that is flattering. Although putting down ""girly things"" kinda implies he finds them beneath him and you.  There's nothing wrong with liking traditional feminine interests.  It's not a competition and it doesn't mean someone is unintelligent just because they like makeup.

"This almost feels like a setup. If girlfriend is refusing to make an effort to understand OP’s culture and its approach to food, and knowingly walking into a situation with a high probability of sending her to the hospital, my tin-foil-hat senses say that this will be her excuse to drive a wedge between OP and his family when they inevitably serve her one of her allergens.

As a formerly abused kid, I'll tell you that the second greatest thing you can do for this kid is give him a reality check. Kids look to their parents to define right and wrong, so a guilt trip from a parent is an utter mindfuck. When my grandmother told young me that my mom ""had always been a drama queen,"" it made light of many years of her calling me a ""bad"" person in various dramatic ways. It helped me feel good about myself and see past the programming. So since you seem to be on your way out of this relationship anyway...clue the kid in to what you think of what his father is doing to him. "
"Move out.  Leave and tell your husband you'll be back when he's ready to prioritize your marriage.  He has 6 months and if he still thinks his friend is more important then go ahead and file papers. Let him know you're serious. You're young and do not need to take second place to your husband's friends. 

My husband and I have an agreement. A ""no"" from one of us is enough for it to be a ""no"" from both of us. It's only a ""yes"" when we both say  ""yes"". You're husband needs to get with the program called marriage, he needs to care about how you feel enough to actually listen to you when you say ""no""."

"Well, that's the most heartbreaking thing I've read all day...

Do you know that scene from the first Austin Powers movie with the security guard and the steam roller? The machine starts out a hundred feet away, barely inching towards him, but he never even tries to stop it. He stands still just screaming for ages until it eventually rolls right over him and crushes him to death.

It's in the script that he dies that way, but even the hero who's driving the damn thing is shouting ""MOVE!!"" and waving his hands. As an audience member, you have to laugh at this loooong scene, but it's also frustrating because it so obviously didn't have to end that way.

What I'm trying to say is: Don't be the security guard! Your heart *is* talking to you about this marriage, but it's not really the ""mushiness"" it's dreading. As a member of the impartial audience, I'm telling you it doesn't have to be like this forever, but it will be if you don't act and just let people roll over you."

"Personally I’d call the police, not the emerg line but just to talk to someone about what you’re aware of, and what steps you can take here (if any). I applaud you for wanting to intervene. This is how the world should be. Thank you. "
"""You should go kill yourself."" JUST KIDDING HAHAHAHAHAH!

No. He's a shit."
"I think you could tell him you've noticed he avoids talking about his marriage and if he ever wants to open up or needs your help, you're there for him. But that's about as much as you can do without crossing a line. You sound like a good brother."
In my experience sexual encounters with friends end up ruining your friendship so you need to take that into account and decide if it’s worth possibly losing your best friend or not.  Personally I don’t see anything wrong with not being sexually active at your age.  I would just wait and let it happen naturally 
If he knows you’re a virgin and he knows you have barely ever kissed anyone he’s not going to expect you to be amazing the first time. He seems really sweet so I would just talk to him about your insecurities and be open with him about how you feel. Also try not to drink like that anymore.... it’s not fair to make someone take care of you like that. 
"Yes, please do this OP. And move the bottle to a friend's room while you wait to go home. Also, *delete your post and throwaway, clear history.* 

Not sure if it's worth putting a coca cola bottle in the wine's place. I'd switch a vibrator or something there and just tell the RA (when you are presumably asked for a reason you want a room change) that she has admitted to going through your things and you do not feel your belongings are safe or personally comfortable sharing a room with her. "
"But the ""love her already"" and the play-by-play remind me of my middle school diary, no joke. I think/u/jenny-thalia is highlighting OP's lack of experience, not saying that a fast pace doesn't work for anyone. "
"The thing that stands out to me is the fact that he told you the full (painful) truth immediately. And that he had to stop himself from calling or immediately coming home.  That speaks volumes to me. 

People aren't perfect, but the way you handle mistakes and the level of integrity and honesty used says a lot about who you are. "
"Normal adults don’t have constant sleepovers unless sex is involved. Married couples don’t have 7-10 sleepovers a month where one spouse has to leave the home ever unless something shady is involved. Normal adults, married and unmarried, pay their own bills and live in their own homes that they pay for. "
"This isn't between you and your family. It's between you and your husband and sister. You and your husband need to be together in this and your family doesn't get a say. If anyone bitches, tell them it's not their business and your aren't discussing it with them. Then drop it, hang up, walk out, whatever you need to do. "
"Tricky tricky.

When someone says, ""I need more,"" the other person might hear, ""You aren't enough.""

Where does experimentation start and stop? Maybe she's nervous that it will be never-ending and that you'll really decide that you do want more than her.

I'm a tiny bit prudish, and I think there really is raised expectations due to porn. Hey, porn is fun, but sex where you're both enjoying it is the best. Feeling like you have to put on a show *every time* because that's what porn-addled people expect sucks.

My advice is to think deeply about this. Some people might automatically tell you that you're incompatible. I think that's bullshit. Relationships are work sometimes. You win, you lose. Only you get to decide if *current* sex mismatch is a deal breaker or if the other aspects of your relationship are redeeming."
"&gt;I don't know why he'd believe this as our parents are very accepting of other people and cultures. 

It's not you putting your relationship with your family on the line. People tend to react very differently when it's their kid rather than someone elses. 

If your brother has been trying to get the courage up to tell you that he's gay for 5 years, through a 3 year relationship, engagement AND moving in with his partner and still not been able to do it, you've (all your family, not you specifically) are definitely nowhere near as accepting as you think you are.

You can be hurt, but yes you are being self-centered. This is nothing to do with you. "
I don't think OP is getting the whole story from his wife. It's so rude and weird of the friends to ask that he vacate his own house that it borders on improbable. I think his wife doesn't want him there for who knows what reason and she's blaming it on the friends to avoid telling OP the real reason.
"You are right. Trust your gut. He is your sister’s problem not yours. A disruptive factor. Life is hard enough. 

All the ness to you. Good luck  "
"Whether there is a paternity test or not, there does need to be therapy, either for him alone or couple's counseling.  Right now he's sacrificing OP's mental health and endangering his marriage in order to give voice to fears that he himself admits are irrational.  "
"There is a word for what your father’s wife is doing: triangulation. Instead of speaking with you directly and trying to resolve the problem with you, she enlists your father to relay her complaints to you. That puts you in a weird position where you feel bad but really can’t have a productive discussion to resolve the issue, and it has the added bonus of turning you and your father against each other by making you argue about her. 

The best way to deal with triangulation is to refuse to argue through the third party and instead insist that the person with the problem should come to you directly if they wish to discuss it. That means having a brief talk with your father where you say something like, “Hey, I know things between me and Phyllis have been difficult. If Phyllis is having difficulties with me I’d like her to come talk with me so we can work it out. I’m not comfortable relaying information through you.” And when he tries to continue the behavior (which he will) you shut it down by listening for a minute or two and then saying, “I’m sorry to hear that, I’d love for Phyllis to call me to discuss it so we can work it out between us. How is [subject change].” In other words, don’t argue, just shut it down. 

She sounds like someone who thrives on drama and is actively trying to start a fight so that she can set you and your father against each other. The way you deal with it is by accepting that this is how she is, that there is always going to be something she is mad about, and not engaging. You can google “grey rock method” for a good strategy for dealing with someone like this. You can also work on having quality time with just your dad without her and her kids. "
"&gt; Him: ""I'm going to go into the bathroom and check her out. I'll act surprised and confused if she doesn't send me the right signal or shrieks, but if she doesn't fight me and will cheat on her boyfriend, I'm going to get laid.""

100% accurate. This is what I thought too when I read the post."
"“Hi there, hope you’re enjoying your trip! We agreed to a rate of $250/week, but I noticed the checks were for $200/week.”

At this point, she will probably jump in with an apology and a solution if it was an accident. "
"This is great advice. I did read it carefully, if we separate she can't use them without my permission"
"Your girlfriend is physically abusive. Take pictures of your arm without her knowing and email them to yourself. 

You say you’re on vacation with her family. Are you able to leave? You should consider telling her family that this happened in case she wants to say that you threatened her and she attacked you in self defense. "
"No, none of these comments have been made in front of my children. 

I would have ZERO interest in being polite if anything was said around my children. I may be too amicable in general, but I would tear someone apart and leave with my kids if anything was said around them. "
"You say being with the grandparents all the time is good for your children, but then you list several paragraphs about how abusive your parents are to you. Every negative comment your parents make about you or your husband, your kids are hearing/picking up on. Theyre being taught that all of this is a normal and acceptable way to treat your children and their spouses. "
"This. My parents have been married for 35 years. When they met in college, my mom was engaged to someone else. My dad said he was into her but wouldn’t pursue a woman who was engaged. My mom broke her engagement, became IMMEDIATELY engaged to my dad (literally, same day— they went from classmates to engaged with no dating period), spent a short period of time in a LDR, and got married within a year and VERY shortly after pregnant with my brother. They also didn’t sleep together until they were married. They would LOSE THEIR FUCKING MINDS if I did something like that, *as well they should.*"
"Your girlfriend is a ride-or-die sister, I’ll give her that.

I’m guessing she’s never had to act in the moment like that before and is worried about what you think of her for being capable of such savagery. Or having that many eyes on her. I’d be feeling a little uncomfortable myself if I’d had to dump kool-aid all over my BIL’s ex, no matter how crazy she was. Give it time and let her forget. Eventually she’ll be laughing along with the rest of you when you tell the story at parties. "
"TIL someone, somewhere dries their sink."
I'm giving her a temporary emergency stress pass.  People need a grief period but it's also why he and his girlfriend will need to set clear boundaries to her.  
"&gt; I quit my job, put school on hold, and have stayed home with the kids this entire time.  
  
Yeah, I would be super scared to be doing this while not married.  Have you explained to him what a huge risk this is for you?  Does he not care?  I would start looking for work again ASAP!   
  
&gt; he holds a stance that its just not how he likes to live and likes to live in the moment and see where things go, but we have kids!!!  
  
Yeah, exactly.  ""Living in the moment"" ended when the first kid was born.  He needs to grow up.  If he doesn't want to marry you ever,  you need to know that now so you can start protecting yourself financially."
"&gt; Why are you marrying him?

Came here to ask the same thing, OP. Why are you moving forward with this when your entire post reads as looming dread, and kind of hurting my stomach, I can't imagine how *you* are feeling.

&gt; You have to spend the entire day acting like a lovesick puppy or you just don't live up to the hype.

Most people are not ""acting"" like you say they are, many, many times, too many to quote. This is projection like crazy. *YOU* are clearly just going through the motions, as if it were all were a bad dream. YOU BETTER WAKE UP.

The joy and giddiness you see in other brides-to-be is VERY REAL, don't knock them, but rather, check yourself."
"three things:

1. do not sign away your rights
2. get a lawyer
3. look into getting conservatorship for your mother - the dramatic shift in your mother's personality and rapid weight loss is troublesome (and might indicate some sort of mental health issue stemming from your father's sudden death), and she would definitely benefit from someone else managing her finances since she clearly is incapable of managing it herself a this point"
"I've gotta ask: Do you think part of the issue here, and part of why you're offended, is that your husband is subtly indicating that he doubts his son's paternity? "
"This is a nightmare and I am so sad for this poor kid. Yes, if you need a second opinion, this is severe emotional abuse. It is extremely damaging to a child. It is not a “softer” version of physical abuse. In the victimized child, it leads to eating disorders, self-harm, depression, suicide attempts, etc. This is just as dangerous as your boyfriend beating his son. Hitting children (or spouses) is illegal in a lot of Western countries now, so many parents desperate to control and use their children for their own gratification use other methods. 

Please tell the child’s mother about this. Film an outburst if it is legal for you to do so where you live. If the mother does not intervene, call Child Protective Services. They might not do anything immediately, but they will have that info on file for when your (hopefully ex) boyfriend escalates (he will). If I were you, after witnessing how he treats his son, I couldn’t look him in the face again, let alone be romantic with him.

EDIT: If you leave him (and I hope you do), tell the kid that the way his father treats him is bad, so bad that you don’t want to be with him anymore, and that you are sorry he has to go through this. Your bf will say to his son that you’re crazy, that you’re trying to separate them, etc., but I guarantee you this will stick in the kid’s mind and possibly save his sanity. I cannot overestimate how valuable it will be in the long run to have had another adult point out that this is not normal. PS: “I am so sorry about how your parent treats you, it is wrong” is a guideline I learned from a medical professional in cases where they know there is abuse but little they can do about it. It helps mitigate the mental damage."
You’re completely right :( I told him he should tell Dave how much this has hurt him and it’s the final straw but he says he wants to wait until after the wedding so as not to stress anyone out. Is there a way to word how hurt he is without creating a drama before the wedding? 
"You are not being unreasonable and you know his attacks are due to there being something wrong with him, not you. You need to not let him knock you off balance with those attacks. It does not even matter anymore what he thinks about your evil coffee cup wet sink ways so let that slide off like Teflon while you keep refocusing the discussion on what does matter - the plans to establish separate residences and to co-parent your child. Wait him out while he rages about your sock drawer and then return to the planning discussion. I think you are going to be so much happier, I am happy for you at the prospect."
I immediately thought MLM scheme is next. 
"It...sounds like he already has anger problems? He's blowing up at you all the time. 

It's not your job to solve his medication. He needs to see a doctor and get real treatment. This is HIS responsibility and if he can't do it, then you should leave. Move to the west coast where basically everybody is your dating pool."
"Then don't do shit you know she won't like in her home.


Also, isn't she also going to college? She's only 2 years older why is she still working to pay your shit? "
"Lose the friend, she is a psycho.  She will be lucky if she isn't charged criminally, and she very likely will when this is all over.  What an absolute crazy person."
"Everything sounds one way from him, but his sister won't even talk to you because she knows his ex.  Did she really cheat on him, or did he cheat on her?  Were they really ""not really together"" any more, or did she not know he was dating you?  

You know very little about this guy.  You're still in the early stages of this relationship.  Please be careful.  Be prepared to hear that he actually I told you a little white lie (or two (or seven)) because he knew how it would sound if he told you the truth.

Be prepared to leave on short notice.  Don't cut out your friends or family because they distrust him.  This has all the earmarks of the lovebombing phase of an abusive relationship.  I hope it's not."
"So he pushed you to have sex, she called you a slut, he watched her slap you, and somehow he's mad at YOU? Fuuuuuuck that. Leave his ass and tell him they should be thankful you didn't call the cops for assault."
"He's trying to ""cool girl"" you! (e.g. ""You're not like other girls... you're cool and worthwhile!"" Ummm... thanks?)  As a woman in a STEM field who played rugby and worked on cars,  I got a ton of this in my 20s, and it's really damn tiresome. It's also really hard to get a certain kind of dude to accept that praise that is dependent on contempt for femininity as a whole is worse than eternal silence - cue ""but it's a *compliment*!"" Lather, rinse, repeat. You BF may or may not be ""that guy."" Maybe he just spoke unthinkingly and said something he didn't truly mean - I don't think you can know for sure based on a single conversation. But I think you were right to push back hard, and that you should remember this incident and think carefully about anything you might near that points in this same direction."
"So what you're saying is that, apart from him being a rapist, you're thrilled to be with him?

You explicitly told him to stop.  Multiple times.  He continued anyway.  By any reasonable definition, he sexually assaulted you.

So the ""what else"" you need to do is break up with him instantaneously, and report him to the police."

"Academic ophthalmologist here. a) She doesnt have what it takes, but much more importantly for you b) she is not a good partner let alone girlfriend. My advice is to let her go, you have shown much more empathy than you will ever get back. "
"No goodbye note, just ghost her. (I mean, respond if there is a logistical detail about the moveout for which you are responsible, but be as succinct as possible.) 

This girl thrives on attention, including negative. For people like her, angry vitriolic attention (which you understandably want to vent at her) is better than none. Indifference and a blank wall from you is her worst punishment, believe me.

You have handled this beautifully, and with much class. Keep it up until you're away from her. Good luck with the move!"
"I really agree with this post. It’s like his view of her is nothing but superficial. Like he tried so hard to not focus on a superficial thing like her beauty, he does realize he instead focused on other superficial things. 

"
Don’t do it. She found out the grass wasn’t greener on the other side and now she doesn’t want to be alone so she comes crawling back to you. I’m sure you can find a good woman who won’t cheat on you. 
"Well no wonder no one is happy about this.  It has all the red flags of an incredibly unhealthy relationship.  Yeah yeah, I know, you two hit it off right away and are perfect for each other and love spending every waking moment together.  That is part of the problem.  Healthy relationships between well-adjusted individuals do not look like this so early on.  It's not organic.  It's almost always a sign of major problems to come.  Like...big big big problems.  Generally speaking, the faster a relationship becomes serious, the more volatile it will be after the honeymoon phase wears off.  Easy come easy go, ya know?   

The fact that you are playing house with someone you barely know shows your disillusion with things and doesn't make you look like a healthy partner.  Sure, it sucks that his family is only blaming you when HE is just as much to blame, but this looks like a car wreck happening in slow motion.  

Still don't believe me because ""he *is the one*""?  Let me count the ways:

* It was incredibly immature of him to start seriously dating someone when he hasn't settled his previous relationship. 

* You are too immature to recognize how immature and unhealthy the above decision was.

*  You chose to become involved with a man who was still involved with his ex.   

* He could have easily subletted his place and found roommates, but he decided continuing to live with his ex for MONTHS was the better option.  I wouldn't touch this guy with a ten foot pole.  That is not the kind of judgement I want in a partner, and I hope you don't either

* Quick escalation periods (moving in or becoming ""official"" before it is natural to do so) is not a sign of a healthy relationship.  It is a sign of two people who don't know how to have a healthy relationship so they try to lock it down quickly out of over-excitement.  That passion tends to go both ways.  Positive when things are good, but very bad when things are not so happy. 

* I'm not even going to get into the whole house sitting thing.  Okay, I will.  You should have used that time to get to know each other at a healthy pace, but instead you decided to move in because the house owners' dog liked you.  That's asinine and you know it.  It was just an excuse to go play house.  Don't act like it wasn't. 

* You have a job yet are allowing this man you barely know to support you financially.  No, you don't know him.  You only know the version of him that he's been for a couple of months while in a honeymoon phase of a relationship.  You have not seen ""all four seasons"" of him.  Yet you are perpetuating this power dynamic so early.  It's not healthy.  Not at all.  Not for either of you.

So yeah.  Sorry.  I wouldn't like you either. "
"OP needs to unpack his sexual issues and how they relate to having sex at 12/13. 

I dated a guy who had a girlfriend who was 15 when he was 13. She pressured and manipulated him into sex when he’d barely discovered masturbation. He did it unwillingly and she dumped him immediately after to date an older dude who’d put out. He still had sexual hangups at 25 and didn’t realize he’d been coerced, which is rape, until I told him. The realization ended our relationship, I guess he then associated me with his trauma.

These issues follow you til you stop and give them the attention they’re demanding."
"I also wonder if he made a bigger move beyond opening the door and quickly leaving once he realized she was in the shower. If he just opened the door, heard the water, said ""Oops sorry"" and quickly closed the door she wouldn't have shrieked.

He was more intrusive than that. No way should your gf have to play nice with him again."
"Divorce.  His plan to stay living in the home with you as his nanny/maid while he goes out with his various girlfriends is not a good idea. It will crush your soul.

Get whatever child support and alimony you can, including heath insurance.

Don’t tell him yet.  Find out where all the money is before he can hide or spend it.

And get tested."

You're a great mom. You're raising your daughter to be her own person and have her own interests. Ignore everything these people say and find a new support system. Cut the toxic people out of your life. "
"This got me thinking,  since OP mentioned school and how it is intimidating.. I work at a community college and often work with ""non-traditional students"" (adults who are older than the traditional college student/ have been out of school for years) and  that kind of anxiety is a common problem. Most colleges offer some form of free psychological services/counseling for students. Maybe you could suggest that she 'dip her feet in the water' of college by taking one class that she could have fun in (dance, archery, swim, poetry,yoga). A lot of anxiety for our non traditional students stems from them having certain ideas about community college (that they'll be the oldest in their class, that they won't be at the level of other students because they've never been in higher ed and it has been years since they last went to HS) that change once they attend classes and see that there are many students their age, etc. Additionally, taking a lighter class that allows for socialization between students might help her make friends that she feels more secure and comfortable with and that could help her feel more grounded in the new city."

"The compliments on appearance makes sense to me. You might see her as the same beautiful woman, but I bet she's noticed changes as she's aged, and so probably appreciates the reassurance from you.

As for the hobbies, why not start a joint project? You guys got a room that could do with a revamp? Maybe go to a car boot sale (flea market?) And get some cheap old pieces of furniture to try to upcycle. She could start up a Pinterest board to see about cool ways she could incorporate her old artistic flair into it. It's easy to end up sat in  front of the tv, maybe you could use your enthusiasm for doing things to get her involved, and because it's something the 2 of you are doing together she might be more keen to give it a try."
"&gt;he told me he didn’t have that much left to pay for gas

sucks for him, he can overdraft his bank account if he needs, but he made an agreement with you to pay for gas. He doesn't pull shit like this with landlord, or his bills, or his student loans (I hope!) because they won't give in. You give in, so he can take advantage of your trust."
He made his  choice when he started lying.
"he’ll tell his friends he broke up with you because you’re crazy...i guarantee it. you’re better off anyway, i can’t imagine being such a condescending shitbag? at 27"
"Agreed. This happened to one of my friends -- she was dating a guy and they got on really fantastically. He invited her to the beach and they had a wonderful date, buying ice cream and walking in the sand, laughing, and being in love. 

At the end of that same evening... he broke up with her - it had been his plan all along. She was humiliated and was like ""why the fuck did I just waste the day doing fun things with you then?!"" For a lot of other reasons the guy was a total creep, but that was probably among the more hurtful things he did.

I guess it really depends on the circumstances but I can think of a lot where I'd rather just get an email. "
"30s yo woman here.  I can’t think of a reason that I would want sleep overs like that now.  In college that was fun, but now I want my bed, all my pillows, fan, and noise maker.  (Yep, I’m old)  I don’t want to sleep on the sofa at someone else’s place that lives nearby when I have my own place.  Especially knowing that her husband had to vacate for me to even stay there.

I think either OP doesn’t realize he is being creepy to the friends or something kinda weird is going on.  If I was creeped out by a friend’s husband I would avoid going to their house at all because I would want very limited interaction with him.  Maybe his wife is annoyed by him and wants a break?"
"&gt;the fact that they're using your fathers death saying ""he would've wanted this"" is SO messed up. 

To add to this: don't forget that what your father (actually! verifiably!) wanted was for you to have the guest house, and that went right out the window when he passed away. Your mother and sisters are not in it for the good of the (whole) family here, or for your father's wishes; they're in it for money and to bleed you dry. And they think this appalling behavior is *acceptable*.

Do not give them any money. *Do not.*

"When my husband shaved his beard he looks drastically different. To the point that my mind classifies him as a stranger. But after a day or so I get used to it again. It's definitely jarring and every time I feel guilty because I feel almost like I'm cheating.

Honestly the best thing is to be honest about it.  I almost hit him once with a pan because I didn't know he shaved and he surprised me in the kitchen. "
"Is it possible for you to head back early and claim the leave that you didn't use yet?

"He's testing the waters, and it won't get better from here. I would call it quits. I know it's really hard, but it is for your own safety. 

For comparison, I can tell you how this would play out in a healthy relationship: I turn on the lights. He says ""can you turn the lights off?"" End of story. For such a simple problem, there would be no physical violence, ever. If we ever play-wrestle, and he pins me down, and I am laughing and then say ""ow! too much! that hurts!"", he *immediately* stops what he is doing (loosens grip, jumps off me, whatever), and asks if I'm okay. Any other response than concern for your wellbeing when you express discomfort is NOT OKAY.

It's okay if you don't want to assign labels to this; I know that can be scary. Just recognize that he doesn't respect you, and you deserve better than that. So, you're walking away. You can do it."
"With the way you're talking about the best friend in your post, I would not be shocked if you make your opinions of Sara very apparent to your wife. You just listed all of the incredible things about 'hot' Sara, and all of the bad things about your wife. You probably are not as subtle as you think, and working on that would likely be a good start. "
"So she goes to school and works full time to support you? Look, her reaction was extreme and she's the person who made the decision to raise you, and if you wanted to walk away from her right now, you'd have a right to do that, but if you don't want to do that, you need to try to see her POV here. She's barely older than you and she's basically raised you, and she's supporting you (clothes and phone bill aren't necessities like rent and groceries) and she expects you to treat her with at least some respect, but instead you're sneaking twenty-somethings into the house she apparently pays for even though you know she'd hate it? Dude. Come on. ""I didn't know she'd be home"" is the excuse of a 14 year old. Your sister had to grow up so fast. She's tried to protect you from having to do that same thing. Now it's *actually* time for you to grow up. 

If you want to fix this, you need to be an adult and sit down with her, thank her for everything she's done for you, tell her you fucked up, and tell her that now that you're 18, you want a little more space to be free to make your own decisions, including who you date. You also need to do more to support yourself. You guys are only two years apart in age, and there is no reason for her, at this point, to be supporting you, even if you do pay a few small things by yourself. You need to be 50/50 in this with her. If you want to be treated like an adult, act like an adult. "

"It’s literally insane! Yes she’s obviously an important part of his life as a sister in law but really she shouldn’t be dictating his wedding at all. He really needs to find his feet and stick up to this woman. I definitely wouldn’t be allowing her to talk shit to me at the wedding either, both stand up for yourselves for once and put her in her place. "
"Holy shit, dude. I was on board with you for the most part, but Jesus, are you kidding here? Do you have any idea how superficial and cruel you sound? You are rating your wife like some douchebag frat bro or pickup artist. This is horrifying. No wonder she's so depressed. There's no way some of this attitude isn't coming through to her. Between this and the way you talk about hot Sara and your wife when she was ""in her prime,"" it's just awful. "
If my boyfriend woke me up by suffocating me with his penis I wouldn’t be too happy. This is fucked up.
"OP's response: ""Sorry, I only loan money to family."""
"Hugs. So many hugs. This exact thing happened to me. My friend lost her baby on August 22 a couple of years ago, and my baby was born September 4.  It was hard and I didn’t want to add to their pain but I didn’t know how to be around her with a giant belly or a newborn. We still aren’t as close as we were before even though she’s now had another child. I still send them a card on the date to let them know I’m thinking of them. But I’ve done some really stupid social faux paus in regards to it and I constantly feel badly. Long story short, I don’t have a lot of advice but I know exactly how you feel and I wish you a healthy, peaceful birth and comforting thoughts for your friend "
"Maybe overreacting but I might hand him paternity test results attached to divorce papers. “Just joking”. Repeatedly. Yeah, right!"
"Let him fuck things up , it keeps  contractors like me in business coming back to fix it right "
"I just want to throw in that if you're planning on having another child and that child looks ""just like his dad"" I would be concerned about your husband being more engaged in that relationship than with your current child. 

Your husband is being insensitive at best and insulting at worst. Either way, he doesn't seem to understand how deeply this has affected you. I had PPA - hormones can come with some really persistent negative thoughts. "
Ohhhhh my god. Get out now before he does some insane thing like wreck your credit. Sorry he’s a dud. There’s better men out there.
"&gt; My family has a history of domestic violence   
&gt;  
&gt; My parents have also been violent with me. 

You are being abused and you need to tell someone. Normally I'd say tell a school counselor or teacher, but since it's summer and you're probably not in school, you need to call the police or Child Protective Services. What you did does not excuse your parents' behavior. The best thing you can do for yourself now is get out."
"&gt;He has a history of mild bipolar that is usually well managed without medication, and honestly he probably drinks too much but isn’t irresponsible with life things because of his daily drink habit, but since my dad died, he switched to whiskey, then for some reason, he got his doctor to prescribe adderall instead of anti-depressants

Geezus you are not safe around him right now. On top of the unmedicated bipolar and the alcoholism, Adderall can cause some pretty wild swings in aggression.

Don’t sign anything. Inheritance for the most part is not shared marital property and he can’t touch it. He sounds like he is in a manic state and that’s a bad combination with money. "
Is this the only comment you’re going to respond to? :(
"I mostly agree with you, except that the whole walking into the bathroom when he knew she was showering in there is predatory behavior. He willfully violated her privacy. He could have approached her any other place including just propositioning her after she came out while everyone else was busy with clean up. But instead he came into the bathroom while she was naked. He didn't open the door, see someone showering, and then oops back out immediately. He stayed in there till she shrieked. That is creepy behavior. It does not speak well for what kind of person he is.

Edit: fridge thought: If OP's girlfriend had panicked and frozen up, instead of shrieking, this could be a thread about how OP's girlfriend got raped in the shower."
"Hmm. I would tell him you’re not able to make it to the airport for some reason and you will see him at home. 

I would sit him down and very abruptly ask him about it, then wait. It’s important to know whether he is going to start with denial or just come out with it. When you tell him, just say “Have you cheated on me?” Then just sit and wait. A lot of emotions are going to happen for him. It’s important that you let him talk, and that you don’t let him know how you found out. That way you have the cards. You can gradually give him more info if he continues to deny, but mostly let him talk to see what all lines up. 

Good that he blocked her, terrible that he didn’t tell you :/ 

Whether or not you choose to stay with him, this is the best way to get all of the info. Don’t blow up. This is the time to be strong. Blow up later. This has happened to me and I found it a lot more gratifying not to show my emotions in front of said cheater. All business! 

I’m really sorry :( "
"I would try the direct route one more time and be extremely direct. “Roommate, while I understand the living room is a shared area your semi-constant viewing of porn makes me uncomfortable and doesn’t allow me to relax when I am at home. Please take it to your room so we can both have some privacy.”

Keep in the back of your mind that porn addiction is a real thing and from the sounds of it, your roomie is addicted. There is a really good chance his activity won’t change. I would start looking for somewhere else to live. "
Your girlfriend sounds immature AF. Sometimes masturbating is just easier or better than sex and there's nothing wrong with that as long as your sex life is generally good. If she can't understand that she needs to grow up 
"&gt;I wish I’d spoken to her, though I appreciate even then she probably would’ve done what she wanted to in the end.

Unfortunately, that's pretty much the crux of the matter. At least you're a good friend to be concerned, and you did attempt to discuss the first incident with her.

I'd say you should try and talk to her about what happened at the bar, too. It's not too late to let her know you're there for her if she needs you. Either she'll feel validated that another person saw how horrible he was, or she'll still be in denial and stay with a complete jerk. That's the cruddy thing about being an outside witness to a toxic relationship, it's out of your hands past a certain point.

Hopefully, even if she isn't ready to leave him yet, you'll plant the seed of doubt that will give her the strength to do it in the future."
"Listen to me OP, you did not ruin her career, she did. If going for a married man (a.k.a her boss) while being in a relationship herself, is her way of beating the competition and moving up in the company, then that’s all on her. Not you. Be careful though; if she doesn’t think what she did was wrong, she’ll most likely say the same thing if her crush on her boss developed and she’d end up cheating. This is not okay by any means. If you’re done with it, then be done with it. I’m sure you can find someone better and someone who will actually care. "
"&gt; I worry I’ll come home and find a hungry dirty baby and he’ll be like “oh, I didn’t know.”

He's a shit father and a shit husband, and with his mindset he is *not* going to improve.

You say above that your kid has brought great joy to your life and that is fab. But now you need to bring great joy to theirs by not having them raised in a household where the dad's sole ambition in life is to sit on his arse and let other people do all the hard work. 

Get out, yesterday. "
"Please do not die for this guy. He made a list calling you fat and unattractive, yet convenient. He's just not as into you as you are to him."
"You don’t want to come across as a possessive, jealous husband, but honestly it sounds like she went on a date with him. Spending that one on one quality time with someone is something you do with your partner or good friend, not some guy you’ve just met.

I get why you feel uncomfortable about it,  and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with telling your wife it made you uncomfortable. Hopefully she’ll be able to see things from your point of view.

I wouldn’t do anything like forbid her from seeing him again, but you need to have a discussion about what’s appropriate in a relationship. And your wife spending quality one on one time with a guy she just met isn’t appropriate, even if you do completely trust her."
"This is a great comment. It also seems to be exactly what OP is dealing with in his wife. I have never felt teh constant urge to move but I have noticed that I always feel like I'm waiting for something. As a teen, I was waiting for college. In college, I was waiting for 18 because I started a year earlier than most. Then, wait for 21. Then after college, wait for grad school to finish it. Wait for the next project to be over. There is nothing going on in my life now that has an endpoint. I'm not 'waiting' for anything, but I still feel like I am and I really can't figure it out. "
"Why not cancel the tickets and get a refund and tell the parents you arent able to go? Your boyfriend should be upset that they offered and then rescinded- is he? If so, he can talk to them "
"for anyone else who was wondering:

fungible (adj.)
(of goods contracted for without an individual specimen being specified) replaceable by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.

thanks OP, i learnt a new word today because of you! :)"
"How about the possibility that she was lying to you about the marriage being broken in the first place?

How about the possibility that the money she claims to have given her parents is actually in a joint savings account?

What has she shown you to back up her story?"
"It's because he doesn't want to take care of his kid. If he's constantly out, he can't be expected to parent meaningfully.

I'd try scheduling yourself a day out without telling him, then let him know as you're leaving that you're heading out for a while. Let him figure out the rest. And then when he inevitably complains about how long you were gone and how hard his day was, insist it's totally normal to spend eight hours having lunch or whatever. He doesn't get to just bail on his wife and kid and expect you to tolerate it indefinitely."
"She realized she hurt you and apologized, and this doesn’t sound like a pattern. It sounds like your depression has grabbed ahold of this comment and doesn’t want to let it go - talking to your therapist about it sounds like a good idea. "
"&gt; I know he's trying to come from a caring place, but how do I tell him to back off a little?

He's not coming from a caring place. He wants you to feel shitty about yourself because then you won't realize you deserve better than him. "
"Co-sign. This is actually the first thing I thought of. I went through years of getting sick on special occasions (my birthday, thanksgiving, etc) and because I was in my early 20’s, no one thought there was anything wrong with me. Finally, I got so sick I couldn’t eat for a few days and surprise, I needed emergency surgery to remove my gall bladder (I had severe pancreatitis and jaundice because of it). 

OP, if when she’s sick she also feels serious pain on the right side of her abdomen (kinda below the rib), she probably has gallstones. She should go to her primary doc and tell them about her symptoms and get a fasting ultrasound so they can look at her gall bladder. "
"Holy shit, for real? In my Suboxone clinic we have to have individual therapy once a week, group therapy once a month, and 2 NA meetings a month.

Has he tapered down at all? Suboxone saved my life but I've been on it 2 years and am weaning off the last .05mg - I started at 16mg. a 2-3 year tapering process actually isn't going that slow, but after 5 years he should be very close to being totally weaned off.

I've had bad experiences with my insurance and Suboxone, so I too have to pay out of pocket. Generic Suboxone also does not work as well IMO, but I was able to handle it for 2 months until I could switch back to the name brand.

So I see where he's coming from, but going out and buying them off the street? Yeah, no. Sounds like he's abusing them."
"Not to mention they clearly think her children are an inferior option compared to having biological grandchildren... as an adopted step-daughter of a large extended family, it's hard enough knowing you're not their favorite family member, I can't imagine if they explicitly said that to my dad/to my face. "
"&gt; I would have ZERO interest in being polite if anything was said around my children.

You need to have this level of concern for yourself too, not just your kids. You're owed kindness and respect as well. If nothing else, remember your kids are watching you whether you know it or not. You need to model self-respect and boundaries for them so they know how to handle bullies when they're older.

As an aside, OP, you sound like a cool person. You don't deserve this shit."
"THEY are the parents, right?

If they wanted OP to watch a SIXTEEN year old boy at a wedding party, they should've asked.

Benefit of the doubt though, thwy are probably so embarrassed and pissed that they will have to pay a lot of money in his behalf and they are looking for someone to shoulder some of the blame. Totally unrighteously so, so don't take it up."
"I don’t think she could have made a story like that up on the spot. 

Please stop interrogating your 5 year old. Stop talking to her mom about it too. Professionals should have taken over after the first conversation. The longer you take to cover this step, the more time her mom and Jon are over there grooming her on what to say. I hope this works out for you, but all of you adults are really making this situation worse at the moment "
"Yeah. This is what I definitely should have done, just been reaffirming in a general way. In the clarity of daylight and no wine, I recognize that she has been making comments about getting older lately, and this is how I field them. And it always seems to play out differently. 

If I step back and think about making a self deprecating comment about myself in that manner, I can understand where she might be coming from. In a perfect world I think we all know that these kinds of “fishing” statements aren’t a healthy way to communicate. But we’re all human and we’re all susceptible to falling in that little insecurity trap. 

I should clarify I don’t see this, and I don’t think she sees this “misunderstanding” as a major issue in the relationship. I guess I was just throwing it out there to internet to get some feedback on how to proceed. 

I think the best thing I can do is just stay gentle. Getting older isn’t the same emotional and mental process for everyone. For some it seems easy. For others, these physical reminders of our linear progression through time are harder. "
"I'm sorry for your loss, it does really hurt to lose someone you knew so closely. "

"My GF is a doctor and she said that the majority of people who go in for surgeries, even minor ones, come in with someone. But regardless of whether that anecdotal snippet is universal or not, you would hope that your loved ones would be happy to give you emotional support when you need it."
"yes and no, it's all part of the whole ""my hubby can just go fuck off when my friends say so"" issue. Is it that she finds it easier to ask you to do stuff, than to say no to other people? because she knows you will, and it feels less confrontational for her? IS she bad at confrontation? Is she a doormat? or ... is the doormat you?"
