"Def. look into Ehlers Danlos. It is a cause for POTS, and hereditary. It can cause joint pain and connective tissue problems. It doesn't always lead to POTS, but it does sometimes lead to Raynauds, gastrointestinal issues, etc. You should very much look into it :)"
Def Sean Penn.  I doubt he has any concern for the lives of anyone.
"This didn’t happen to me...but I thought it did.

My wife and I were having our third child and our two others look exactly like me. Brown hair brown eyes. My wife has brown hair and hazel eyes. Our third daughter on the other hand...has Red hair and Blue eyes. 

She was born by c-section and I was in the room when she came out and I swear to god on my life I thought she was an albino black kid. 

I told my wife “she has red hair!”

My wife said: “no she doesn’t...”

This went back and forth for a second until the doctor said from across the room...”SHE IS DEF A REDHEAD!”

Now let me quantify this first. My wife and I are not exactly monogamous. We have other people in the bedroom from time to time so the idea of the baby being someone else’s...how ever minimal the chances...is a slim possibility. 

This is where the doubt comes in. She hadn’t been with another guy to my knowledge for a long time before my wife got pregnant. AND as far as I know none of those guys had red hair (my wife isn’t really attracted to red head guys.) We weren’t with anyone else for going on over a year before the birth. So of course I started thinking maybe she was stepping out without telling me.

Now in a relationship like ours...there isn’t really a reason to lie to your spouse about fucking someone else. We are cool with it as long as we check with each other first and it’s strictly for fun and there are no feelings involved. So worry sets in a little bit when I think she’s could be hiding something from me. Because that could mean she’s doing it for more then fun...which is always a risk when you open up your marriage like this. 

I let it go for a while but by the time she was 2 her hair was still red...her eyes were still blue and getting lighter...so I had to put my mind at ease and do a paternity test.

My wife has a lot of red hair in her family...and I have blue eyes in my family. And turns out...even though it’s super rare to have 2 recessive genes skip generations...I am her father. Shes a little genetic anomaly. Red hair...blue eyes...no freckles...easily tans...and 100% mine. 

So I had the panic...but it all turned out well."
"Idk, I’d def date her. Indie music, a bit awkward? Seems like Sophie from Girl Boss. And if she’s brunette with bangs, consider it a done deal. What’s life without some risk?"
