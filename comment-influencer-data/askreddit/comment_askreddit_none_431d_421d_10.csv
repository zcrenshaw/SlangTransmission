"God*damn* I miss Borders. There were two ""near"" me but both of them were about a half hour drive away, and I can't remember going to either more than once or twice before like, 2008 at the earliest. There was a Barnes and Noble that was half the distance, but good god it was so shit. They would never seem to have anything when it was released, either because they just hadn't gotten it, or it hadn't been put on the floor and couldn't be found.

When I started driving I would just suck it up and make the 30 minute drive to another B&amp;N at a mall because it was less shit. Eventually found something online that neither of the ones I went to had in stock, but the one in the rich part of town did. So I go there, get the book, and there's a Borders across the street. Decided to check it out too, what the hell, you know?

I'm gonna be honest, it seemed like kind of a mess compared to the slightly larger B&amp;N. Organization was weird. It was *hella* dark, like Starbucks at 6AM dark. I just wandered around for a little bit, trying to figure out where anything was. When I went in, there was one cashier checking someone out and another customer waiting in line, and that was it. It had that kind of weird-quiet, almost derelict feeling like when you walk into a Walmart at some dark hour because you work nights and two in the morning is when you prefer to do your shopping because fuck the sun.

I ended up with a couple books about ghosts (I like to get stuff like this when I travel, one good thing about Barnes and Noble is that they have these in the local section without fail... but Borders also had the surrounding states, which was rad because I have no desire to actually stop in Virginia long enough to find a bookstore), a book on demonology, and what was maybe the peak of my pre-Amazon ""weird book"" finds, a manga adaptation of The Nightmare Before Christmas.

I actually ended up going to that Borders for a couple years until it went out of business with the rest of them. I buy everything digitally now so I guess that didn't really affect me too much in the long run, but I still miss it."

She obviously wasn't having it and kept shutting him down and walking away. He called her a ""stuck-up cunt"" and she pushed him backward out onto the patio and before he could retaliate two of her male coworkers got between them and threatened to beat his ass. This MF then proceeds to get two bicycle cops called on him but then REFUSES to leave because my GF and coworkers ""assaulted him"" and they should be arrested. I wasn't there but according to her, the cops were dumbfounded and told her to get a restraining order. Dude was so emasculated from the push that he proceeded to disobey cops and tried to get my GF arrested. "

"Mound &gt; collapse &gt; shorter mound

It's not like there's an underground city, it's a system of rooms and tunnels/corridors between them (similar to the pyramids but more horizontal). It's safe to say that many of them have likely collapsed already, and those still intact could be fragile enough to collapse from being disturbed by excavation.

This is all based off what I was told when I visited the ming tombs and saw the excavation efforts. The unearthed area they were working on excavating was entirely collapsed and the efforts were going painstakingly slowly because of how fragile the statues are. The majority of the statues were damaged or entirely shattered.

Since the value of the tombs are purely historical/archaeological there really isn't any reason to rush the excavation. Qin Shi Huang's tomb is especially important, so they're leaving it entirely undisturbed until they have techniques and technology to support a far higher quality excavation effort.

The lake of mercury is definitely a concern, but I wouldn't say it's the primary concern. The main concerns all center around the destructive nature of current excavation capabilities."

I asked my boyfriend one day, maybe two years into our relationship if he noticed, he’d never said anything about it. He was like ‘oh yeah, I hear it. I just figured it’s just something you do.’ He shrugged it off and has never brought it up since. I knew in that moment I was going to Marry him. We’ve been together over 6 years and married for a year and a half.  I knew he would love me for everything I was, crazy ticks and all. "

I guess they figured I couldn't possibly be dumb enough to drink underage in front of them so they skipped me completely and got 3 of the kids in the barn.

I still have a hard time doing things like long division where you write everything out. I had been given detention for prior similar issues, and was failing “math” in the class. 

Anyway, in that same month I was suspended, I got an award for mathematics by the state, for scoring in the top 5 on standardized testing.  (And I didn’t even use the trail mix)     ;)

After my scores had returned from the state testing, they all acted very differently to me. From that point on, I could have just cheated and they would have said anything to me. All of a sudden my failing grades were changed.

I say fuckkit, it's not worth starting shit over, figure I'll never see them again. Then I board. One good guess who I end up sitting with.

This little girl is initially sitting in the middle seat, when I sit down she complains to mommy that she wants the window seat. Not ask, complains. So they switch spots. After another minute, the child complains because she's too cold so the mom gives her an extra blanket. 

Finally the plane pulls away from the terminal. I reach down and grab some gum to chew for ascent. The girl sees my gum and complains for some gum and you know what? The lady turns to me and demands *demands* I give her daughter some gum.

I tell the kid ""I'll trade you gum for the window seat because that's how the world actually works""

"Background: I was close friends with a guy in my high school, who dated a girl 2/3 years his junior who, after starting to date him was in touch with a friend who was an absolute nice guy. Unfortunately, this story doesn't have a good ending. I myself am his senior of 3 years.

The girl was kinda nice, my friend introduced me to her on an outing once, and after a bit of time, I deemed her a pretty good match for my friend. They were happy together so I wished them the best and went on with my life.

Then after some time, my friend texts me to talk to me about this nice guy who's been basically telling his girlfriend over and over ""I should've asked you out first"". His girlfriend was uncomfortable, but she can't end the friendship because a certain ""nice guy"" decided to threaten to commit suicide. I told them to report him, but his mother was a teacher in the school, so that fell short very quickly.

He continued to plant seeds of doubt in her head, pointing out the fact that my friend was effeminate (he isn't, he's just better with the ladies than gents. He's a sweet guy) and that he could take better care of her. Essentially, brainwashing her, day after day. And slowly, she began to believe him.

Eventually, my friend catches the two of them canoodling in an empty classroom (they're 14 years old, tops, FFS) and of course breaks up with her. As far as I know, they're still together but my friend's now ex girlfriend chats him up occasionally to bitch about her now boyfriend nice guy. Like, kid, if you're going to complain, why are you even with him?

I actually visited my high school for a bit to catch up with folks and I saw the aforementioned nice guy. He resembled a round sweaty fat lump, tbh. Whatever won that girl over definitely wasn't his looks. Or his personality. "

"Late morning, Thanksgiving Day. Early 1990s. I was playing outside and noticed black smoke nearby. Ran out to the street and someone's house was on fire. Ran back and told my mom to call 911. I was the paperboy in the neighborhood so I actually knew the exact address, the names of the adults, and that they had two teenage kids and two dogs. I had seen them when collecting and when delivering (afternoon delivery).

Apparently we were the first to call 911. The dad had started a fire in the fireplace and forgot to open the flue, but had gone into the kitchen and forgotten. Kids were upstairs, he and the mom were in the kitchen when another neighbor pounded on the door to say the house was on fire. I made it back to the house to see them all running out. Firefighters arrived less than a minute later.

House was saved but the turkey was reportedly a little dry."

"When he called cutlery spoons table spoons and insisted that tea spoons were regular, cutlery spoons. 

His family ate with teaspoons cuz they're all tiny af and couldn't fit regular spoons into their mouths. So when someone in their family could, they ate with a 'table spoon' (not a table spoon. a regular spoon).

I was adamant that I was right and there was no way his family used table spoons if some of them couldn't even fit a regular spoon into their mouth. He was adamant that I was wrong and ""you wouldn't understand because you're not posh enough to use so many spoons"".

It eventually reached a point where I met with his family and spent the entire time scrutinising their spoons rather than eating, which led to more friction, but....

"I used to be annoyed by this one girl all the time because she was, well annoying. She thought we were friends and always tried to be around me because I wasn’t outrightly rude to her. Eventually I got fed up with it and started being rude to her hoping she would leave me alone. This went on for years and she was never mean to me once.

Years passed and I fell head over heels for a boy who made me feel just awful. Unrelated, but I had a revelation I was very unintentionally mean to other kids when I was growing up - and to this day I’m still not sure why I was like that. My thoughts went back to her. I sent her a lengthy message back when I had a Facebook and apologized for the way I treated her.

About a year later my life took a dark turn very quickly and she was the only one there for me when all my “friends” abandoned me. She was my best friend for about seven years. Last year, after a couple of years of being the only one trying to maintain the friendship, it finally died.

I loved her like the sister I’ve always wanted. There’s people you would die for, but dying’s easy - I would’ve killed for that girl. God knows I’ve cried."

This exactly. Yeah being a team player when your clocked in on your shift is important. But if a company doesn't value your work life balance and let you clock out and go home when your supposed to they aren't worth a fuck to work for and you don't owe them anything at all.

Yeah. These companies don't understand that low wage workers don't give two shits about brand image or loyalty. You can't afford that when your job barely pays rent. Brand image only really counts if what you are doing is actually helping the brand. A CDL driver doesn't gain anything from Amazon that they couldn't gain working anywhere else.

"I was working 14 hour shifts 6 days a week, had just learned they were no longer giving my department christmas bonuses that year, and had been denied a raise. I overheard the boss on the phone with someone blame my department for shit he dropped the ball on and said ""those guys are a bunch of idiots. . . ""  
    
I lost my shit. I immediately punched out and the whole way to the punch clock and back I could feel my rage building. When I saw him on my way out I got in his face like a baseball manager to an umpire and started screaming how he's a fucking joke and the main reason the company would never be successful. I left with about 15 people following me and high-fiving me. They called me asking me back that night, 2 days later, a week later, a month later, and 9 months later. After I quit they lost 4 other managers within 3 months, and a bunch of really good employees.  
  
Then the boss I had cussed out was forced out of the company by the owner (his wife) when he caught her cheating on him. The company went bankrupt 2 years after I left. Fuck them all."
"Well, partly it was because a man came into the store with an ax to threaten employees, and management weren’t allowed to call the police as mall security was supposed to deal with it. 
Strike one that day. 
Then, I started other thing was that I started throwing up blood halfway into my shift. I told management I was going to go to the hospital and they told me I could so long as I was back in time for the rush around 2 pm. I wasn’t even that important, just one of several front end cashiers.
Haha, nope. See ya never, suckers!

Best part was that my boss was seemingly flabbergasted as I explained why I was quitting, while I was leaning on her doorway, white as a ghost and clearly unwell. "
"&gt;Be willing to cause an awkward situation

This is a great piece of advice. Criminals use the fact that people don't like to say no or create an awkward situation to their advantage. An example:

It's just after midnight and I'm walking back from the CVS near my hotel. Stranger says he needs help. I'm a helpful dude, so I ask him what's up. He says his phone is dead and he wants to call his friends to pick him up, and asks to borrow my phone. That's an instant no, because there's a solid chance he's just goimh to walk/run away. I tell him no, and offer to call whatever number he wants and put it on speaker. He presses to just get my phone and he kind of stands in my way. I ended up just walking across the street without saying anything.

Moral of the story is, don't put yourself or your property on the line to please strangers. Be willing to be a dick or be awkward. If they really need help they'll work with you."

"Look at all the nice, helpful and polite retail/food/ etc workers. Most of them would never get fired for not giving a fuck, luckily for us a lot of them actually give enough fucks to go out of their way to make a customer happy even though they don't get paid extra for it in most cases. Unfortunately every day the most memorable customers for them are the entitled assholes or dumb fucks who imprinted ""The customer is always right"" in their brains without knowing what the fuck that even means.  
So please be kind to all workers and when you notice that they are really going out of their way to make sure you get the best service possible please thank them or at least treat them like humans and not like robots.  
I cannot count how many times I've been given coupons, free services, money saving tips (Like ""Hey you should go across the street they sell the same thing a lot cheaper) extra free food etc just because I'm an understanding customer.

"This is all for casinos in the US. 

Usually high rollers have a line of credit to where the casino fronts the guest the money. That way the guest isn’t paying bank fees or traveling with 100k in cash. Different casinos have the markers bought back differently. Some go for deposit 30 days from the date a marker is taken some only give you 2 weeks. And each casino in each franchise is different due to both upper management of properties and the different gaming laws in each state. Vegas casinos are a completely different beast than tribal casinos. 

Most people with a line of credit have to apply for it. At certain casinos, there is an option for extending a courtesy line of credit. You have to have either large amounts of money or have a decades long relationship with other casino credit offices for courtesy credit. Even then there will be reports ran on the guest. "

"Well, I realized even though in my own head I was utterly fascinating, to the wider world I was not very interesting. Beyond my own philosophies on life (which were pretty shallow and depressive), I didn't have much to offer, so I worked on that. 

I started to dress better and take better care of myself.

I developed my interests and joined groups of people who shared them. 

I worked on my social skills and started taking more risks, seeking out friendships with people rather than waiting for them to befriend me.

I became a genuinely good listener. Before, I was either just sitting there like a shrink and absorbing their monologues, or I was just waiting for my turn to talk in a conversation - really just continuing my monologue. I learned how to be an engaged listener and learn from other people.

I learned to really enjoy being alone as well. Not the way I did before, as sort of a loner, but to truly enjoy my own company and doing things on my own."

"- Try not to move unconscious or seriously injured people if you suspect a neck or back injury until paramedics arrive *unless* they are in immediate danger (i.e. in the middle of the road, a burning car, etc.). You risk paralyzing them or causing other permanent injury. Obviously if they're conscious and yelling, ""Ah, my leg, I can't walk."" Feel free to move them. Burning car, move the person no matter what you suspect.

- Drowning is not loud or obvious. It's very subtle and everyone can benefit from knowing the signs. The biggest ones are that the person's head will be tilted back (they'll be trying to keep their airway clear) and their arms will be flapping/grasping downward, as if trying to grab something that isn't there or pushing themselves up from a desk/chair. Also, if they're not responding to their name or your yells.

- Don't mix ammonia and bleach. I've run into so many people in the food and service industry who had no clue. One cleaning material + one cleaning material = super cleaning material, right? /s

"Often people also buy way too expensive. Banks will lend you a lot more than is probably sound. When my husband and I applied for our first mortgage and ran extensive spreadsheets documenting income and expenses and expected bills/maintenance we realized that buying at the top of the range would mean no fun expenditures, a lot of rice and beans for dinner, praying for shit not to break for years and wishing for promotions/income increases. So we bought significantly under, and can deal with emergency spending and save and still do fun stuff too."

Chiseled jaw.

He has to be a certain age range of her, I loosely remember it being around 2-5 years.  Anything older is a no go. She admitted on FB years ago that a great guy asked her out but then she found out he was 10 years older than her and turned him down.  That is just ""too"" old.  She was like 27, so 37 wasn't really a giant difference. 

Needs to be 6ft.

Needs to be incredibly fit.

Loves animals.

Wants kids.

The most handsome man in the room, she wants people to notice her husband and her ""great catch.""

Must have a graduate degree or higher.

Needs to own his own home.

Maybe a vacation home too.

She doesn't want him to have too many past girlfriends because that shows he cant commit; 1-2 ex gf's is an appropriate number.  This is becoming impossible because we are in our mid 30's.  Men in this age range often have more than a few ex's and maybe an ex wife. She needs to let go of this 18 year old reasoning. 

He must consider her cats her kids, so like ""adopt"" her cats in a way if they marry.

Make 6 figures.

Now that I read back on it all that shes said over time and on FB, this looks like a checklist Cosmo would put out in the late 90's and we impressionable teenage girls ate up thinking we weren't going to settle for no scrub.  She just never grew out of it.

One of the things that stands out to me is the COV\*\*\* misspelled word.  I work in data science, and as soon as I saw that, I said, ""He's using it for market research.""

It might not seem super obvious, but if you think of him saying, ""There not supposed to come to this country"", the left leaning groups will jump on the error and comment at the incompetence of the tweet.  The right will jump on the fact that the left are being tilted by a spelling error.  By analysing sentiment, you have a rough idea of whether or not your userbase supports you.  Once you establish your baseline for support level correlated with usernames, you can apply classic test marketing to everything to see if your right- or left- leaning supporters approve or disapprove of things you do.

It just reeks of the same sort of technology that [Target used to figure out a daughter was pregnant before her father did](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#68435a8b6668).

For that reason, I never ever comment, nor retweet or repost, anything that has something that could be used for market research, because it snowballs and gives more data. He has an extremely smart, well connected and well funded set of marketing people working for him.

Given that this is a thread of who we hate and respect at the same time, I hate and respect Trump's marketing team responsible for advising him on what to do, as opposed to a political candidate that I believe has the ideology that best benefits America and her people."

Hillary Clinton instead provided Bush with hologram technology in lieu of actually damaging the jets. Bush then hired Blackwater operatives to strategically place explosives throughout the WTC disguised as Jewish businessmen.

"On my 23rd birthday, which happens to be New Years Eve, I got fired from my job in the morning. By afternoon, my boyfriend had dumped me. I went out that evening to a bar and someone reached into my purse and stole everything but my car keys and a tube of lipstick. I drove home to my apartment and a man robbed me at gun point, when I gave him my now empty purse and he realized it was empty he threw it at me and hit me in the head (good thing it was empty, amiright?). I was afraid to go into my apartment at that point because, even though he had taken off, I was still afraid he would see where I lived. So, I got into my car and started driving to the police station... only, I lived in a rural area and I ran out of gas. The only person I could call was my now-ex-boyfriend, so, I called him and he came and got me, took me to the gas station and helped me purchase a gas can and some gas, then took me back to my car... which someone had broken the window of and had now stolen my, very cheap, stereo system. I finished off the night with a bottle of tequila rose and woke up several hours later actively drowning because I passed out in my shower and my hair had clogged the bathtub drain and my ex was dragging me out of the bathtub whilst calling me an “utter fucking moron”. I’d like to think that he was just being nice and had come back to the apartment to check on me, but, he had actually left his favorite sweater there and was retrieving it (most likely on the assumption that it was within the realm of possibility that my apartment would randomly catch fire and destroy everything within it).

A few years pass, sophomore year of high school we get seated next to each other again in Chemistry, and I'm like, ""Oh fuck this not this piece of shit again."" But he was totally different. Like, we had talked a bit in Math class when he wasn't being a dick, but he was really awkward and talked about guns a lot. Turned out he just didn't have a lot of friends and didn't really know how to interact with people. Once I got to know him, he actually was a really cool guy who knew a lot about the weapons and was interested in the military.

We both just graduated from college this past spring, and it's like he's a totally different person. Completely confident, lost a bunch of weight, and works for the police department. Crazy how far some people come.

Invent a few things (preinvent) .

Stay in better shape.

Realise the negitive things do not need to hold you down, and when people are dying from Cancer, do not make it about YOU, spend the time with THEM making their time more pleasureable.

Ignore disasters you can not stop. MANKIND NEEDS to learn from their mistakes and bad choices. ( except the trump thing, ya gotta stop that...)Hell even at 10, I was NOT tied down, it is called transit.

As for cash, it would be easy to get tutoring jobs, making a kids fortune.

All in all, stop thinking like a kid, start acting like an adult with a plan.

Personally, i would get diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, and I would go back to school and persue a better career, ans start heavily investing in the markets.

Use my wealth to then combat mankinds stupidity and stop some of the poor choices we make.

And most importantly figure out how to end up with my wife and kids, without the guarentee of that, I would not do it(IF it was by choice)."

So I did my best to move where needed to get the money I wanted.  In two months of being a salesman 50% of the stores revenue was from me ($75k), and there were 5 salesmen.  So I get a phone call from the district manager about a complaint over a sale that profited the company $20.  The client was a rude bitch and I basically made her leave.  The DM then said he’d be watching me from there on out.  I hung up the phone, went to my locker, packed my shit and left.  Middle finger still up 6 years later.

"It’s funny; as a service plumber you would think it’s the shit. But as a service plumber who works directly for a large chain of stores, it’s actually the entitled motherfuckers who come in, see the restroom is very much closed, but run and get an employee to see if it doesn’t have to apply to them. Half the time the employee, not in the loop themselves, actually approaches me about letting random customer in to use the restroom. I’ve got a toilet off the floor, visible from the door, and these idiots are like “I’ll just be a minute.” Nope.

For the record; poor people never do this. It’s 99% upper-middle class and above white ladies. Poor people immediately engage the buddy system to take turns using the available restroom. Like humans.

If I stopped for every one of those idiots it would take me a month to do a week’s worth of work.

I got so sick of the BS of one manager adding me for random shifts or ringing me on my days off, ""can you come in?"", ""no"", ""why not, where are you"", ""I'm not at work that's for sure, bye"", in the end I blocked works number so they couldn't contact me when I wasn't there. Luckily I was quite good at a certain thing others neglected and the managers manager had a bigger view and saw what I did was useful so let it slide. Luckily I left and got a better job, way more flexible and more money, those 2 years in retail were dire though.  


Before I left they changed it so shift rotas were put out a week before and you had to sign it to show you agreed to the extra, no signing then they couldn't assume you'd do extra. I like to think that was because of me and made it a bit better for everyone, some managers still tried to ignore it a bit though."

"Got to 33, almost 34 before I got married.  Went on numerous dates, even had a girlfriend for several years--but our beliefs dont permit sex prior to marriage.  So never had it, though got fairly close a couple times.  I'm not trollish, my personality isn't critically flawed, I just...well, I bought into the 'Nice Guy' ideas and the several year long relationship was with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder and was very abusive.  Needless to say, she broke me of the nice guy crap and being anyone other than myself, which lent an authenticity that actually allowed me to find dates with quality women.

All that being said, thankfully I did wait for sex instead of leaping at the first opportunity or the Red Light district.  As did my wife....


She was 35 when we got married.  Also a virgin.     Never had a boyfriend, never was even kissed.  She spent a number of years overseas as a missionary teacher (while I was in the Army.  Went on a couple dates in the Army, but no real relationships--and no sex.)  so she never really met anyone.  When she came back she went on a few dates, but the guys were mostly creeps looking for a lay or an ego massage.  

Eventually we met on an online dating site, kicked it off slowly at first in April of 2014 and were engaged before Christmas--at that point we both knew what we were looking for in a partner and didn't feel like spending a year+ dating plus a long engagement.  

And for those that think we were crazy for not having sex before the marriage or 'trying out'  others?(edit: seriously, autocorrect? 'Trying pig's others?)

It was worth it.  It was so worth it.  We have something special, physically and emotionally and spiritually special to just the two of us- the deepest intimacy a couple can share.  I hated waiting....but i wouldn't trade it away.

Edit because people are offended: ""Creeps looking for a lay"" referring to people who she 1) found creepy 2) went and, in spite of her profile and preferences stating that she wasn't looking for sex, she was looking for marriage and pre-marital sex was out of the question would go ahead and go through the motions of falsely presenting themselves to try for it anyway.  

It's not meaning ""Everyone who wants to have sex outside marriage is a creep.""  "

&gt;There is a widespread perception that Kennedy made an embarrassing mistake by saying Ich bin ein Berliner. By not leaving out the indefinite article ""ein,"" he supposedly changed the meaning of the sentence from the intended ""I am a citizen of Berlin"" to ""I am a Berliner"" (a Berliner being a type of German pastry, similar to a jelly doughnut).

&gt;According to some grammar texts,[10] the indefinite article can be omitted in German when speaking of an individual's profession or origin but is in any case used when speaking in a figurative sense.[11][12]

&gt;Furthermore, although the word ""Berliner""[9][13] is used for a jelly doughnut in the north, west and southwest of Germany, it is not used in Berlin itself or the surrounding region, where the usual word is ""Pfannkuchen"" (literally ""pancake"").

&gt;A further part of the misconception is that the audience to his speech laughed at his supposed error. They actually cheered and applauded both times the phrase was used. They laughed and cheered a few seconds after the first use of the phrase when Kennedy joked with the interpreter: ""I appreciate my interpreter translating my German.""[14]

"Haven't seen #2, but 1 and 3 were *designed* to be bad, and were intelligently marketed to lean into that concept. 

They cost peanuts to make for a few reasons:

1. No expensive stars

2. No legitimate VFX

3. No theatrical release

4. Long term planning to recoup expenses on TV and streaming. 

Sharknado played this to perfection, marketing itself as a movie that would be ""so bad it's good.""

No one *pays* to see movies like that, but there's a huge draw for that type of film on TV and streaming, because in a sense, you've already paid for it, so you might as well watch it. 

Thus advertisers are willing to buy slots, the channel is willing to make the order, and the production makes a profit. "

"When 13 I woke up to the police being in my house shouting from downstairs. I figured they were probably going for my brother, since he’s 5 years older and a trouble maker in general. I was surprised when they instead went to my room and arrested me. I left in a police car to a police officer telling me my rights like in movies.

My parents left for Vegas the day before, so I was alone in this, and they took all of my electonics for investigation, for 6 months I had no cellphone, no computer, nothing.

Aaaand I spent 4 hours in the police station in the interrogation room, I had to call a lawyer for advices.

"In the UK, when visiting a rented accommodation; pay attention to whether or not the letting agent opens bedroom doors with their key or not.

They can legally enter the house with 24 hours notice, but they cannot entire specific bedrooms without either the tenant present, or otherwise the tenant's permission.

Letting agencies will almost always attempt to ignore this. If the current tenants aren't having their privacy respected, don't expect any different for yourself."

One of the friends had also seen it before and apparently forgotten as well but remembered he liked it...It didn't go over very well and at the end everyone was like ""wtf?"". I guess it didn't scar anyone too badly because no one asked for it to be turned off but I think from now on I'll only watch super dark comedies by myself or with that one friend."

Timing, especially in comedy/performance is knowing when to act/speak. It isn’t knowing what’s coming, it’s an instinct for the best moment to do or say something.

So the joker knows when to pull the trigger, when to say the punchline, in a certain circumstance. Not what is going to happen - just the best time to do a particular action. 

Besides, everyone always says the key to comedy is timing....headcanon accepted.

"I almost feel like we are the same person. I was a shift manager at a shit hole for a Burger King. Turnover rate was high as fuck and the only consistent people there was 2 Hispanic ladies that were there for 20 years and 2 teenagers that liked working with me because I tried to make that disease of a place fun. 

I was the night manager and it was a 24 hour store. I was constantly scheduled to only have 2 or 3 people so it would either be me running drive thru and front counter at one of the busier stores in my city, with 2 people in the kitchen or having 2 people up front and only one person to get slaughtered in the back with the amount of orders we got. But that was on a good day.

There was quite often times where it was 1 person up front and 1 person in the kitchen. People who did truck orders consistently fucked up and we'd run out of stuff like certain cups or chicken fried, couple of times we even ran completely out of meat, Burger King with no burgers. 

Lets see... i've seen the fryer explode and burst into flames and not a single call from my GM went to maintenance to make sure it wasnt a hazard. 

They consistently boosted new hires pay that would quit after working for a week and would never give any kind of raise to the people who were there working their ass off trying to help the damn place. 

They'd hire anyone who'd walk through the door and the ones they hired for graveyard always quit besides 1 guy. 

One guy was a pedophile who had a record they ignored when they hired him. He was arrested again last year and last I heard he got some serious infection in his dick and had to have most of it cut off. 

I could go on and on but that would take all day. I ended up getting fired from there because I let a foster kid make a sandwich without paying for it because he had no money, he just started working there so he hadn't gotten paid yet. "

She said it felt like lawless country land, where, if you pissed them off, they’d kill and bury you and the whole city would easily deny you ever drove through.

I drove through that area in the middle 2000s and I agree 100%. And I'm a man. I went into a gas station Subway for a sub, and the young blond female teenager froze and *literally ran in the back*. Then this  dopey middle-aged guy comes out, pathetic chest puffing, and asks what I want.

"Hey friend, a word of advice that will no doubt help both you and any veteran you're speaking with in the future. When a veteran is expressing distress as a result of their time spent in war, they are not in the headspace to meet other people's requests for war stories. In these instances, it's important to focus on the veteran's emotional needs of the moment. Additionally, some Vietnam veterans take offense  when civilians refer to the Vietnam War as ""Nam"" because it is the veteran who is on familiar terms, not the civilian. I can appreciate your curiosity because I'm interested in War stories myself. And like you, I highly respect veterans. And that's why I think it's important to help you out a bit with these two pieces of advice. I hope you don't feel I'm picking on you."

Didn't mind it at all, because it was great to have him around.
Fast forward about 10 years and I now have 2 kids and a mortgage and car payments etc.
We all met up for a catch up and at the end of the night before I went home I asked him what bus I could catch.
He said just get a taxi. Truth was I couldn't afford one and I told him that.

He replied:
     'Oh good, I'm glad you know what it feels like to struggle now. You always used to be the guy that had money and it used to make me jealous'.

Crushed me and our friendship right there.

Still see him occasionally but will never make an effort for him orhelp him out again."

"Oh my gosh, this happened to somebody else. Thank goodness.  


I had that happen, too. I woke up during the night to the feeling of something crawling on my chest, calmly patted my chest &amp; grabbed a cockroach &amp; just crushed it like nothing.  
Then I woke up the next morning like, ""did I seriously crush a cockroach to death &amp; not think anything of it because I was half-asleep?""

"It's incredibly disheartening to see the new left embracing this mentality just as much as the far right,.  Both extremes value feelings over facts these days, and they're using it to push a lot of ridiculous rhetoric that goes mostly unchallenged in the mainstream because people are afraid to speak up and stick their neck out.  Try to use facts to settle an argument, and people will just cry that you're disregarding their ""feelings"".

If angry old white dudes are saying ridiculous shit, it's a lot easier to go out and criticize them than if it's an LGBT minority with purple hair and huge psychological issues.  You automatically look like an ogre by going after someone like that.  A lot of people are using their victim status to bully dissenting individuals into submission, which is really fucked up.

Everyone wants to be nice and accepting these days, so the weakest people have paradoxically become the most powerful voice in society.  Almost no one wants to look like the bad guy and push back against them when they become hyperbolic and unreasonable.

It feels like the far left/right extremists dominate all the platforms in modern media, while more rational people closer to the center mostly stay quiet out of fear or disinterest, which means the state of discourse online and on television/workplaces/campuses right now is incredibly bad."
"Not a psychologist here, but I do love to read up on this stuff. Apparently, it's caused by having such a low-view on yourself (low self-esteem) that you feel you don't deserve to be happy. So you act out and push everyone that could make you happy away because you feel you don't deserve to be happy/feel uncomfortable with the idea of being happy because it's alien to you and you fear change.

"The smell of the glue and paper that binds the books is another one I cherish. Smell is a powerful memory trigger.

I lost my sense of smell for the better part of 2 decades and it's just come back. Depending on if it's a classic book or modern book, as well as where it was printed, the paper and glue smells different. It's one of my favorite things to open up a classic Jules Verne and to be taken back to when I was a kid borrowing books from the library."

"As a foreign student in Britain, I noticed the huge, unspoken class differentiation that is still alive and well throughout the society. A lot of upper class people genuinely believe they are better than others just because they were born with a silver spoon in their mouths. More liberal ones have a weird ""class guilt"" thing, where they try too hard to be understanding of working class and immigrants, but come off as patronizing. I haven't spend quite as much time with working class people, but I can note there is a strong anti-intellectual and ""immediate gratification"" culture that prevents some of them from achieving success. Overall, both sides like to make lowkey jabs at each other and live in a very different cultural environment. I am from ex-USSR country, so maybe that's why I do not get it, because in my country, apart from flaunting their money, rich people are not that culturally different from the poor, and most of them had poor parents or grandparents."

"Yeah his story makes perfect sense. As a child his deepest trauma was always that he was alone and outcast (he didn't have his birthday party, for example) and his parents had a divorce. His mom's new boyfriend took him to a baseball game where he mentioned he really respected the manager, and ever since then Michael wanted to be a manager. 

He joined DM under Ed but hated that Ed was just a boss, and Michael Scott cared so deeply about people that he was a great salesperson-- he would record little details about his clients and call them up, make jokes, and he understood how to charm them expertly well (take them to Chili's, tell great jokes, connect with them deeply). He knew his community well and had TREMENDOUS passion to the point that he would start a thousand new paper companies (and not even run out of names!)

When he became a manager it was a struggle because he still wanted to be respected and loved. He saw them as his family and his heart soars with the eagle's nest when they have kids and get married. However, he realized deep inside that he ultimately was still lonely.

 Finally, he meets his perfect woman and the two of them fall in love, but he loses her and has to rediscover himself. When she returns, he realizes that as much as he loves his DM family, he wants a REAL family, and he leaves to start it. 

Honestly, the show handled his story PERFECTLY. It made perfect sense and all the details matched up. "

"The thing that disturbed me the most was the amount of women just standing around looking at each other. They were upset and obviously deeply concerned but they were just *standing there*. Not moving and not talking and wearing grim expressions. 

Some others were scurrying about, getting the bleeding woman to lie down, legs elevated and comfortable before deciding their next move, collectively as a group. ""What's your doctor's name? Do you have his phone number?"" were the questions they were pummeling her with. The pregnant woman was crying uncontrollably and could barely get a word out. 

""We need to call your husband."" was another great concern several of them voiced. Her husband is a mechanic. At that point, he was useless.

"In the early 1990s, there was a garbage movie called ""Mad House"" with John Laroquette and I believe Kirstie Alley.  

It was, ostensibly, a comedy and it was AWFUL from the very first scene.  I saw it in a fairly full theater.

A few minutes in, everyone in the audience is like ""WTF?"" and finally, at the third or fourth gag to fall on its face, one or two people from the audience erupt into SUPER sarcastic laughter.  Now THAT'S funny, and the laughter spreads throughout the entire theater.  Almost everyone is like ""HA!  HA!  HA!"", knee-slapping, the whole thing.  But it really snowballed on itself.  Being in a big room with strangers and everybody is just heckling this total SHIT movie was probably among the Top 5 hardest laughs I've ever had in my life."

Most of the staff reported this one to the RSPCA, who investigated and found that they were negligent.

"My kid developed encopresis as result of a dairy and chocolate allergy. For his first 3.5 years, we fed him as anyone would feed their child - milk, cheese, chocolate, ice cream were all allowed. Pizza followed by the ice cream shop was a favorite treat for us. 

When he started preschool, he still couldn't control his bowels, so we saw the doc. After a ton of allergy tests, he was diagnosed with the allergy. 

Within days he stopped not only shitting himself, he stopped completely. The allergy had gotten his pooping muscles used to the soft bowels, so he never had to squeeze. He got very serially backed up, so we had to do two enemas a day for a week to flush him out completely. We had to use a laxative for 6 months in order to train him and his muscles properly.

Encopresis is more the inability to control your bowels than anything. "

"Dishonorable discharge is about as bad as a federal felony charge when it comes to job applications. Often times it's required you admit to it as well when applying. Given the dudes rank, he'd probably been in for a while, so may not have much work experience outside of the marines. Depending on his job specifically, there may be little applicable skills he could list for most jobs even without the dishonorable discharge. This can be mitigated by employers having a soft spot for veterans or for jobs with veterans preference or by going through any of the programs offered to help integrate veterans in to civilian life. The dishonorable discharge makes all of that moot though. Even people who know him and like him from service will really be putting themselves on the line to even give the guy a verbal recommendation to friend. Also, all of the healthcare and banking and education and financial perks a veteran has access to are taken away, as well as access to veteran support services and groups.

"I worked in a grocery store deli. We were constantly understaffed and they wouldn't hire anyone, which meant any call out meant complete hell. You know how deli lines get, you'll have 30 people waiting in front of the deli complaining about how long it's taking.

I was closing one night and the other person I was with called out, although three employees was really what would have been necessary for things to go smoothly. Not only would there be an endless line of people waiting for cut deli meat, but I also have to cook the rotisserie chickens and somehow clean everything before closing. Literally impossible and I'd have to deal with people bitching all night.

So a line started to form and some older woman was complaining because the roast beef I was using didn't look good to her, so I said ""let me grab another from the back"", walked into the back, around to the front of the store and right out the front door. I'd feel bad but I had a growing contempt for the deli customers. If anyone remembers that scene from The Wrestler, that's what it feels like to work in a deli."

I swear, I wanted to hug every guest today who asked if we were okay, or understood that we'd been working as long as they'd been waiting, or understood that we had to deal with the aftermath of a special no one could prepare for.

We were just as mad, if not moreso, than anyone in the lines today, but i want to send out a deep, personal, heartfelt message to any and all shoppers today who sympathized with us.

Thank you."

If you’re the DD- great. We aren’t judging you for being responsible. Don’t feel awkward about it. Just don’t be a dick. 

If you’re pregnant and can’t drink- good on you for still going out and socializing with friends. We aren’t judging you for being responsible. Once you can, come back and have a celebratory drink with us. 

If you want to get drunk, ok, we can help. Just don’t be a dick. 

Don’t like a drink? Ok. Just let us know what’s wrong. If you can’t, just talk to us so we can figure out why you don’t like it. Just don’t be a dick. 

Bottom line, just be polite. If we’re in this for the right reason, we’ll be glad to help. "

The game itself isn’t necessarily bad, but the fan base consists of a large number of very young children, who do not need their parent’s card details to access it and thus find it more accessible than other multiplayer video games currently on the market.
This young fanbase, coupled with a large number of insufferable ‘click bait’ themed YouTubers like Ali-A, who produce mindless, barely edited, low quality content at a constant rate, has resulted in many online communities hating the game.

"At the same time it is also not a good thing to have a character that is gay in name only and never has to face any hardship that comes with being gay. Because that would come off as if the show wants avoid showing the character as gay to prevent their audience form being offended. I think Captain Holt is a good balance of him not being too gay while still being gay enough. His quirks are all not related to him being gay but him being really stiff (which is also  why he is terrible at pretending to be straight, not because he is just really gay) and he still gets shown in a serious relationship that has its own personality. Being discriminated against is a realistic portrayal of what he had to go through to get where he is. Ignoring that would make it seem as if the show is erasing that unsavory part of the history of the NYPD. And it still fits the show as it's similar to other criticism the show has on the police force."

"I was involved in this child’s comeuppance. My gf and I were drinking at a bar/restaurant next to our city’s Orpheum theater where finding neverland was playing. 

This couple comes in to the bar 15 minutes before the show started and approached us, stating the female was too sick to see the show so they offered up their tickets. Sweet! We downed our drinks and ran across the street, ran into the venue and found their/our seats; probably 10 rows from the stage on the aisle. We weren’t invested in the show, but we enjoy theater so we gave it a chance. The problem was that we were seated behind a 10 year old boy, reminiscent of the German boy in Charlie and the chocolate factory. He had this loud plastic bag of expensive gummy sharks that he was loudly eating, crunching up to plastic, and simply annoying the hell out of us with. 

At one point he set down the mostly finished bag on the floor in the aisle next to his seat. My partner, God’s bless her, reached with her foot and dragged the bag slowly black and snagged it without him noticing. We munched the rest of the sharks giggling like children. We ended up watching him for the next 10 minutes reaching around the floor, looking under his seat, whispering to his mother and father, basically all out confused and distressed as to where his last 3 gummies went. 

We’re dicks, but he was annoying us during our free musical. ."

"Sort of related - my parents were always relatively strict.  Not that we had a ton of rules, though.  We could wander around our sizable neighborhoods (before/after we moved), visit friends in said neighborhoods basically whenever we wanted, etc.  They were just strict in the sense that if they said something, that's how it is.  There's no whining, cajoling, or convincing them otherwise.  If you attempt that (especially the whining) it just makes it worse.

So.

My older sister and I had some friends who lived nearby.  These friends were fairly spoiled.  The kid my age still had his mom wipe for him.  That *could* have been a medical thing, but I'm pretty sure he was just lazy or dumb.  These kids whined *constantly*.  Eventually they got whatever they wanted.

They wanted to come over one time (or for us to go to their place).  I think a sleepover was the idea.  We asked our parents, they asked theirs, and we got a no and yes, respectively.  ""Well, ask again.""  Like, what?  Why?  ""Ask again and they'll say yes.""  Fuck no they won't.  These kids just did not understand that a no is a no.

"Definately if you were unknowingly drugged, you would be not guilty.  Part of the guilty mind requirement for drunk driving is that you knowingly ingested an intoxicant, even though you dont have to know that you are actually *drunk*.

In other words, you have to know you consumed alcohol, but it's not a defense to say ""I didnt think 3 beers would get me drunk.""

You're also right about the policy risk of allowing people to purposefully drink to automaton levels.  That would allow people to basically start their own purge whenever they want. 

So generally, if there is evidence that you intentionally induced your extreme intoxication, it's not a valid defence. 

This is why, on a legal level, Bruce Banner would be liable for the damage the Hulk does every time he purposefully makes himself angry.  

Whether you want to prosecute Banner is another matter, but he is legally guilty"
"I've held back the punches, but once when no one else was around, I punched a lady right on the chin.   Security camera was pointed at me, so I felt like if anything came of it, I'd be okay.  

I still held my punch, but was hard enough to knock her down.   The embarrassment made her keep it quiet.    "" guys don't punch girls""  so the implication was she wasn't much if a chick.  

She basically tried to touch me with what I guessed was a staph infection and the wound was open.  I called her out, that it wasn't a bug bite.....  she got embarrassed by that so it she did a nuh uh and then went in for the touch.   Turns out it was a staph infection.  "

"Was interested in this girl (let's call her jess) who I had met properly only once prior. Her best friend is also a good friend of mine. She's unbelievably shy so a 1 on 1 hey let's go out for a drink would not work. So I decided to plan a very informal dinner event at this high end restaurant that had a promotion (we're students so..). I describe the scenario to a couple of my friends and invite a few; before I knew it we were a group of 8 all dressed up. (I should mention not many of my friends knew each other, they were my friends but strangers to each other)

We set out walking to this restaurant and everyone's getting to know everyone. Jess and I trailed a couple feet behind the group And we got to know each other personally. Long story short is actually not as you'd expect, the restaurant no longer had the promotion, the girl ended up not being interested, and we went to pizza express in uber formal wear. However, the entire day everyone was laughing and mocking each other (banter sort of way) that all the would have been downsides turned into jokes told to this day. All round great day and everyone had fun."

"I work at a bank and recently had a dealing with an guy in his early 60s who came in wanting me to wire 3k to his “new girlfriend” in Ghana so she could come to the US and marry him. He shows me a pic on his phone, she’s mid-20s, blonde hair, blue eyes, and white. I was certain it was a scam, but asked if he’d met her. He said no, but the money is so he can finally meet her and marry her. She supposedly has no video capability. I tell him no, I won’t be sending any wires for him and I also tell him he’s a victim of a sweetheart scam. I direct him to the gov’t website for the US embassy in Ghana that has a whole section on romance scams out of Ghana because that’s how popular they are. He leaves and I add an alert to his account to use extreme caution when sending wires and detailed the situation. I didn’t see him for a few more months. Apparently, he started going to another branch where an employee wasn’t doing their due diligence and reading his account alerts before sending wires. This guy wired out a total of $54k in 3 months spread out over 5 wires beginning 3 days after I added the alert on his account. I only caught wind of it because he came back to see me to try and send a sixth wire (apparently forgetting that I was the first person to turn him away). We ended up closing his account after that and that is when we discovered how much money he had already lost. The shittiest part is we couldn’t try to recover any of the money because the guy refused to acknowledge that he was being scammed. Banks try their best to protect their customers’ money but at the end of the day its entirely up to the customer to not be an idiot. "

"Not sure if a bullet was dodged or I’m a paranoid asshole. 

One time when I was studying in London (I’m American) I was picking up some beer later at night at a local store. This lady comes up to me and a friend and starts talking to us. Everything seemed normal and she was nice enough. 

She tells us she is just a few blocks away, and we are heading the same way as her, so my friend offers to help carry one of her bags since he wasn’t carrying anything, to her apartment. As we keep walking the apartment seems to be nowhere in sight. We walked past our destination a few blocks and I started to get weirded out. She proceeds to make a phone call to someone, where half the time I think she was speaking Russian, and the other half of the time she just kept being really specific about us being nice American boys, our looks etc. And continues to tell us “No just a few more blocks away”.

The whole way she was talking about us to the other person on the phone sounded incredibly strange, and made me think she could possibly be a human trafficker or something as she was getting oddly specific about us, our looks, our heritage etc. So I grab the bag from my friends hand and drop it at the next intersection saying we are leaving now, and she started to grab his wrist and pull him with her which was a huge wtf for me, for a woman with 2 random men to be grabbing their arms and pulling them. So I just rip her hand off him and we just take off at a brisk walk. It was seriously an odd situation. I’m not sure if she was up to anything but she was for sure giving me the creeps and my friend. Mid westerners like him though have a hard time being mean/rude haha. "

"French Martinis are just not a great drink. They're a great gateway to the Sweeter side of cocktails though! They're popular because they sweet, fruity, vodka based and don't have the sour edge of a cosmo. But most importantly, they're easily made from ingredients you'll find lying around the average club or pub.

If you find yourself in a particularly well stocked bar, there are some excellent alternatives for the fruity/berry flavours that make the French Martini possible. Usually there will be one on the signatures list (you don't get far as a cocktail bar without something sweet and fruity), but the Charlie chaplin is always a safe bet because any cocktail bar worth its salt will have the ingredients.

A really, really good French Martini requires incredibly fresh pineapple. I'd almost consider them a seasonal drink to do them properly. "

"I am a therapist specializing in gender and sexuality. I now work with adolescents and families, though I've worked with all ages. One of the things I wish everyone knew (but particularly young people and their parents) is that it's okay for your identity to grow and change as *you* grow and change. You can label yourself gay now and later start calling yourself bisexual later when you've explored your sexuality more. ""Lesbian"" might be a word that makes sense right now, and even if you later feel that ""trans guy"" or ""bisexual woman"" or ""straight"" or anything else describes you better in the future, that doesn't mean that any of your feelings then or now were illegitimate or that changing a label makes you a liar. Your attractions, sex drive, and body image can change (though usually not drastically) as you age. That's fine. Roll with it.

Parents: saying that a kid is ""going through a phase"" or telling your kid things like ""you don't have to label yourself"" risks making your kid afraid to tell you about their inner life. You mean well—maybe you're afraid that they'll get bullied or that they'll change their mind later. However, you're essentially saying, ""You're wrong about your own feelings. You don't want the things you want or feel the way you feel. I'm the only one who gets to tell you who you are."" It's always better just to say, ""Tell me more."" The worst-case scenario if you validate their feelings is that your kid comes to a different understanding of their identity later in life, which is perfectly fine. The worst-case scenario if you *in*validate them is that they don't trust you enough to come to you when things get bad."

"As an arch student I just wanna say our tech is not magic. Like, X-ray wouldn't work because that's not how those work and technology like metal dectors work by bouncing signals back and just basically telling you something is there (we can already assume this room has stuff) but it doesn't really show you empty space such as a hidden hallway. There's some other technology in that vien but it is no where near as advanced as anything you see in the movies. I know you already knew that but even less so than what you thought. Basically any researchers have to look at it and make the call on if they should wait or just plow through. In a situation where it was going to be demolished they would go ahead and try to learn what they could but in a situation where the area is protected they'll wait in hopes that future technology will be able to do more useful/non-invasie things. At the end of the day archaeology is a destructive science. If something can wait for better circumstances it'll be left because you can only ever do a site once.

"I've said this on Reddit before, and rich people of Reddit don't seem to understand it. There was once a thread on AskReddit about ""What do poor people do that rich people don't understand?"" (you can search for it, it's a great thread and both poor and rich people were commenting). I don't blindly wish you death because you got the luck of the genetic draw and your parents are rich, thereby giving you reasonable comfortability. If you're a good person, then that's great. The distinct frustration (especially in this economy and current political climate), is there are many fears you most likely won't ever have to deal with. There are many inconveniences you won't ever have to go through. You can't understand the other side of it. Wealth doesn't bring automatic happiness, but it does give you tools others don't have to put themselves out of bad situations, or create safety nets a lot of us will never have. 




I'm not talking about nice cars or owning homes; I'm talking simple things like you'll never have to lie that you're sick and stay home from work bleeding on a dry washcloth because you can't afford a box of tampons until the next day, which is payday. You won't ever have to suffer through earaches, toothaches, or skip vital medications because you don't have money to go to the doctor or pay a co-pay. You've never eaten food put on the curb from fast food restaurants. You've never washed your hair in a public bathroom sink. You've never had to degrade yourself or do dangerous things for money. Again, this does not mean that you MUST suffer, and you MUST live in poverty or you aren't a worthy person or good person. But there is a life disconnect. Like people who were once addicts but are now sober, or people who were married and are now widowed. There are ""clubs"" of people that understand things only because they've gone through them. Good or bad, right or wrong. 







I feel people who are wealthy, who were born into it, never lost it, never were dirt poor or had any period of fear that the heat would be turned off or the lights would be turned off or you didn't know exactly when you would eat next......that fear is part of a club that you live through. So when rich and wealthy people try to talk about money or sympathize about living situations or tough experiences, it's not the same thing. I get where the helpfulness comes from, because I have friends who grew up in wealth and I had to explain why I didn't do things a certain way or why I planned and prepared for things they could do off the cuff. Because they had never had that fear. I think the frustration stems from you'll never know how lucky and charmed your life is to have never been a part of that terrible ""club"" of poverty. I don't hate those born into wealth; I just believe after all the things I've seen and lived through and survived, the gratefulness of what you were given should be more apparent. Most wealthy people never appear grateful or thankful, or don't use their money for tools for good or charity or to make the world a brighter place. I hate THAT part. "

"Since not in sight yet: my wife and I went for marriage counseling/sex therapy some years ago, and the therapist quickly realized that my wife had repressed daddy and sexual coercion issues (not related; the latter was a college experience). The therapist dismissed me and devoted six separate sessions to walking my wife through talking out and dealing with her feelings and their sources. Then I was brought back to go over some practical exercises for reestablishing trust and rebuilding passion.

It made a world of difference. She didn't have to talk about her issues with me; she had to talk about them with *somebody.* I figure it was better that it not be me because that eliminated a bunch of negative emotions (shame, resentment, anger) that could have easily been transferred to me if I ""knew her secrets,"" and this meant she could keep her dignity and privacy."

"I don't know if this fits the criteria you're asking for, but I'd say Tourette's.

I don't suffer from it myself, but several close family members do, and it rarely manifests itself how people think. Media (mainly derivative comedies) have painted the disorder as simply being unable to control your swearing, and as such has become a punch line, or the aspect of a whacky character, and treated as some kind of joke.

In reality, excessive swearing (called coprolalia) is actually very uncommon in people with Tourette's. What's often much more common is that children develop uncontrollable tics, either physical or vocal, which often manifest themselves during adolescence. They often become more pronounced when an individual is stressed or anxious.

Being a teenager is stressful enough, but when your body literally feels outside your control, it must be horrible. Many children and teenagers with the disorder are often ridiculed, mocked, and ostracized by their peers. The media's portrayal of the disorder had been a huge influence on this, and it's a tremendous shame given the sheer number of people afflicted with it."

"Back at uni, I was grading lab work. Near the end of the 3 week course, the reports just pile up, because students always hand them in at the latest possible date. As I was working through my pile, there was one group of 8 that I had already figured were assholes (barely any prep done, took forever for the work, etc.).

Working through the reports, they were massively lacking. It was extremely clear that they just handed them in to keep the deadline, and I would return them for corrections. A horrible report takes longest to correct though, since you need to figure out what they were thinking at the parts they did, or what parts they never even tried to do. Not to mention the handwriting screamed 3 a.m. and/or copied on the bus as well.

Now, at the end of the pile, there was this girl's, and it was a bad one. Literally *everything* in it was wrong. Frustrated as I was, I wrote a whole page of correction requests, and it was not nice. I only noticed how bad it was when she came in crying, and I looked at it again. Hers wasn't all bad. In fact, you could tell that she *tried*. It was still all wrong, but everything was there. That page of red ink was really just me pouring out my frustration at the 6 or 7 that came before hers. She got the equivalent of a B- after doing the corrections I asked for, and I still feel bad about it."

"I remember reading about Peter the Great, I think. Out of 16 kids he had, only 3 made it to adulthood. I might be mixing up the royal but it was someone extremely important.

I bring it up because I think it highlights that it didn't just happen to a certain class or country of people -- that has the norm for most of human history. To have so many children, only for most of them to die, whether you were rich or poor, could hide yourself away in a castle or stuck on a farm, etc. 


I feel like human condition is when you're raised with something and it stays consistent, you tend to accept it as normal and get used to it. That's not to say that those parent didn't grieve always, but when nearly every single person you know had at least one child die on them, you had siblings that died, your parents and their parents and their parents did, maybe you continue life in a certain way that we might not be used to in today's society.

"Offten they are the first responders, get supplies and help conduct initial rescue operations until the government can provide assistance.

Without the yakuza the loss of life would of been much worse since the government was stretched so thin and international aide takes time to get there. Things like using their illegal trade routes to bring supplies, preventing looting and  price gouging with intimidation and tons of other things they are able to do quickly without  having to navigate the buracatic red tape. They aren't angels and most of their efforts are to keep communities from trying to root them out, but still they seem to be vital to Japan. "
"**DMD** - direct metal deposition:

 A nozzle streams powdered metal straight onto the point the printer is printing, and another nozzle melts it (or the metal is melted straight in the first nozzle but I haven't heard of this kind yet)



**DMLS** - Direct metal laser sintering: 


Sintering means sticking two particles together with heat (""welding"") without liquefying them.

In DMLS, there is a bed of powder on a stage that is accurately melted by a laser (""laser"" sintering). Once one layer is done, the machine adds and smooths another layer of metal powder on top and repeats the process, sintering the new layer to the one before, creating a solid.


DMD has an advantage in that it can potentially be used without a ""stage"" - since the material is deposited by the nozzle and melted almost instantly, the ""arm"" of the printer can move as it wishes, and thus can be used to build large structures, like wings or even [bridges](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/04/the-first-3d-printed-steel-bridge-looks-like-it-broke-off-an-alien-mothership/).

It was a really cold day and nobody could come out and fix the heater, so my parents were sitting around and trying to keep warm. My dad opened the back door to get some more wood for their fireplace, and a corgi just waltzes in! The moment my parents gave it food, water, and some attention, the heat magically came back on. As soon as the heat was working, the corgi left.   


My parents still talk about the magical corgi every now and again!"

Plus, even if there isn't a single woman there, you have the prospect of a lot of new friends who could introduce you to other social events and women.

Are you passionate about your work? Are there professional networking events for it in your area? That's a great premise to meet people without any implications that you are ""on the prowl"" so to speak.

You got 10 hotwings and didn't get em? Hope you're hungry, I'm dropping 30.

You're missing a small potato? Here's 2 larges to make up for you having to drive back.

Oh, what's that, you forgot your biscuits? Well you're gonna have to come back, and you never actually ordered them, so I'm also gonna have to charge you since I'm ""fucking retarded for forgetting your goddamn biscuits"", you cunt. No, I'm not giving you a full refund, even if you did bring it all back."

"There's a hell of a lot of pointless jobs out there, most of us just go to work because we have to make money, rather than because we need that work doing, and the distribution of the profits just means most of us are just working to make someone else money. CEOs earning hundreds, even thousands of times what their average workers earn is disgusting. Jeff Bezos could easily pay his delivery staff thousands more every year, but instead he pays himself billions.

No I don't believe we'd stop paying taxes, but those taxes would obviously stretch further and we could all lead better lives for it."
"I picked up some used HiFi speakers and the guy threw in some Monster speaker cables. Those things were thick and heavy as shit. I have a huge roll of speaker cable, so I tossed the Monsters in with the stuff I was selling at the flea market. Some guy was so pumped to get them for $5."

I was on deployment and they have a deployment package where you keep your contract, but it's just suspended until you get back and you don't have to pay the bill until you are using your phone again. I set it to suspend a week before deploying and paid the bill ahead of time to make sure it was fine.. Even called them before deployment to verify.

10 months or so later, I try to turn on my phone at a shop and they hit me with something like $600 in late fees plus other ridiculous fees on top of it. I asked for a manager and explained everything, even showing proof of my deployment, my last paid bill and everything.

It's probably the thing I hate about this website, people come in here wanting pick fights and antagonise, then insist they have a moral and intellectual highground even about subjects they don't know the first thing about.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahanni_National_Park_Reserve

&gt;Presently around 800–1000[23]:11 people visit the park every year, most of which are overnight visitors who travel down the South Nahanni. The park is open year-round, but most visitors come in June, July, and August. Virginia Falls is the only area of the park where a reservation is required, which must be done months in advance to prevent overcrowding. For safety reasons, all visitors must register with park officials upon entering the park boundaries, and deregister within 24 hours of leaving. There is a park office in Nahanni Butte at the end of the river, where visitors can deregister.[4] The only practical way to get to Nahanni National Park is by floatplane or by helicopter, usually from Fort Simpson but other communities and locations offering a gateway into the park include: Watson Lake, Muncho Lake, Fort Nelson and Inconnu Lodge.[23] Some people do hike in from the Nahanni Range Road at Tungsten to the west of the park.

I think it's safe to say, the only places on earth that haven't seen human exploration are underwater, underground, or the ridges of large mountain ranges."

By 1997, attempts of contact ceased, and India eventually put an exclusion zone over the area. In the 2000s, the Indian government made two visits by helicopter and were attacked, and 2 people illegally fishing accidentally drifted onto the island, and were brutally murdered. "

"I was in an evangelical church ever since I was a kid. I really enjoyed going there every Sunday. We sang and then heard the pastor talk about whichever topic was on the menu. When I turned 13, I started to question everything they considered as the truth. For example, it was weird that a dude died and then came back from the dead 3 days later just because magic. There were other things as well, less philosophical and more pragmatical that were related to the hypocrisy of people there. I'm not saying everyone is like this but in my church they preached about loving one another and then people would talk shit about eachother in their back, they would prohibit us from hanging out or dating people outside the church, they wouldn't accept gay people in. There was this dude that came out after being in the church for a while and everyone just ostracized him afterwards. So with all of that I just decided to leave that behind and I started not believing in God. How could He allow something like that?"

"A few years ago, I was driving home late at night. It had been snowing for a while, and there were no tire tracks on the road, so I would guess no one had been down that road in a few hours (I lived with my parents in a very rural area at the time). As I was about to the end of the road about half a mile from the house, I saw something moving on the side of the road. A man had been lying down in the ditch, and he suddenly got up and started walking into the road. He didn't appear to be distressed at all; his face was completely emotionless. Being young, alone, and unarmed, I drove past him. I got home and told my parents, and my dad called the police. The man was never found, but when I went out the next morning I could see his footprints in the snow walking toward my house from the ditch."

Apparently he pinched me and I hauled off and punched him in the face.  My mom said she was so stunned she didn't react at first.  He never made a peep, just went and played with some toys and I went back to doing whatever I was doing.  Pinching was far far less after that and never to me again."

"If there’s 100 doors, there’s two possible scenarios.

1) Your first pick has a goat behind the door. There’s a 99/100 chance that this is the case.

2) Your first pick has a car behind the door. There’s a 1/100 chance that this is the case.

The host then takes away all but one other door as an option, leaving one door with a goat and one with a car.

99/100 times it’s the first scenario, and switching your first choice will get you the car.

1/100 times it’s the second scenario, and switching your first choice will get you a goat.

So 99/100 times, switching will get you a car.

It works because:

-Your first choice of door is more likely to be a goat.

-Therefore, it’s more likely that when the host takes all but one other door away, the other door is a car (again, since it’s more likely your first choice is a goat).

-Therefore, it’s more likely that switching your first choice will win you a car.

Your first door was completely random, and therefore, 1/100 to be a car. But then, imagine the other 99 doors as a separate set, which 99/100 times, the car is in. The host knows which door the car is in and is eliminating any other door that doesn’t have it. That’s why the odds are good for you, because the host is helping you by eliminating all wrong choices in the 99 other doors.

If you still don’t get it then I can’t help you."

"We have an ass load of those around where I grew up. There's one really small one that you can walk out on a dock to the middle, and then there's the big one they closed to the public. I got to see the big one in third grade because the guy who owns the property let us take a field trip there.

 It used to be a freshwater spring, and they used it to power a water wheel. The back pressure from damming the outflow up caused it to collapse and open up. They called it ""bottomless"" and used it as a tourist attraction. There's no natural oxygen for fish in it, so they used a water wheel to aerate the top and stock it with fish. People liked to throw garbage and stuff in it because it was ""bottomless"" so they closed it from the public. 

Really, it's only a couple hundred feet deep. All the ones in my area are essentially collapsed springs that are connected by underground waterways. They're still trippy to look into and not see the bottom. Just a long ass tunnel filled with beautiful deep blue water."

she asked if anyone explained that this bill would be higher and i said yep activation fees, corporate discount takes a cycle, etc. and shes said ""well did anyone explain the activation fees"" and of course i was like ""yep""

then she said she was going to waive one of them. i didnt ask. i didnt expect it. i wasnt going to say no but after being so used to having to threaten to leave sprint to get ANYTHING done i was almost speechless

"Allah says: “Do not marry idolatresses (al mushrikāt) till they believe; and certainly a believing maid is better than an idolatress even though she would please you; and do not marry idolaters (al Mushrikīn) till they believe (hata yūminū), and certainly a believing slave is better than an idolater, even though he would please you. These invite to the Fire, and Allah invites to the Garden and to forgiveness by His grace, and makes clear His revelations to mankind so that they may remember.”Qur’an 2:221.


It is permissible for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman if she is Christian or Jewish, but it is not permissible for him to marry a non-Muslim woman who follows any religion other than these two. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Made lawful to you this day are At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends”

[al-Maa'idah 5:4] "
"I think that's a very shallow interpretation of most religious beliefs where they go against marrying outside the religion.
Religious beliefs hold an immense and vital importance to a variety of areas in life. One example is finding a partner who holds the same beliefs as you. I honestly believe from experience and by rational logic that life would be better (statistically) if a religious person would marry someone who holds the same beliefs as them (and adheres to them, of course).

Simply claiming that ""if your religion prevents you from X then you're an asshole"" or ""the religion is shitty"" is a very shallow statement and requires more thinking."

"Actually you can't conceal carry a firearm on your person until 21, and in order to do so you need a permit. To get the permit you need to take a class, get fingerprinted, and all that jazz. Some states don't even allow conceal carry or make it extremely difficult to get the permit, such as only allowing rape victims or victims of assault to get a permit.

Handguns and handgun ammunition can't be purchased until you're 21. Rifles can't be purchased until 18. However, it's now 21 in some states to purchase rifles and ammunition, like in Florida.

Possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs or alcohol (no matter the age) is a crime in the US. This is true in every state, including ones where marijuana is legal for medical or recreational use."

Wow I had no idea! So the Soviet Union, a regime built on the ideals of a revolution against an an autocratic monarchy and the *idea* of a creating an eventual classless, communist society, the very *epitome* of what right-wing reactionary European monarchies had been trying to fight for the past seventy years is in fact a right-wing regime in itself?

"The podcast is aimed at a male audience, but I think that anyone can get some insight from it. I do on occasion read or listen to media that is mainly aimed at women, and I find that it's interesting to get a different perspective.

Though I do sympathize with your concern.

EDIT: I guess I'll go into what I got out of it. It got me to see that I had this idea of me and her being this great couple, and I was frustrated over, how could she not see how good I was for her? But this opened my eyes to my delusion. That's not loving someone. That's privileging my wants over hers. Like I'm saying that what I want for us (being a couple) was a better, shinier, happier thing than what she wanted for us (be friends). But the truth is, neither desire is ""better"" than the other, and if she doesn't want what I want... well, she gets to make that decision. I had always respected that decision, but at the same time I also felt that she needed to ""see things more clearly""... which was never for me to decide, of course! And I finally realized that, and moved on."
"I love basements, but we have a high water table here in the Midwest and having water either back up or seep in to the basement can be a real problem.

"I don't think people should make stupid laws with good intentions. Make laws that are well-thought and can actually make a difference.

They just made themselves more popular and made the problem worse because than most of the people have forgotten it. They just lowered awareness. "

The polls didn't get it wrong. the outcome of the election was unlikely, but well within a reasonable margin of error. The problem was the news talking heads have no idea how to read the polls, and instead based their analysis on the opinions of people they talked to every day: rich, mostly white people living in NY and DC.

"I completely agree about not borrowing more than you can afford.  We were approved for way the fuck more than would have been responsible for us to go for, and decided to set our limit considerably lower.  Our realtor wouldn't stop sending us houses that were well outside what we actually felt comfortable paying because ""oh, the bank pre-approved you for X amount!"" THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOOD IDEA. Had we come even close to the maximum amount we were approved for we would have been, at best, on very thin ice, and at worse really struggling to make ends meet. We ended up buying a condo instead of a house, with a goal of moving after 8 years or so, because it was the responsible choice.

"Mostly, what is it like to be a teenager nowadays? How important is social media to you and how much does it affect and/or control your life?

Also, what do you think about new rap and hip-hop? Mumble rappers for example. Why do you or people you know like or dislike them? I'm having to Google their names but the ""artists"" I'm thinking of, for example, are the ones like Lil Uzi Vert, Xxxtentacion, 6ix9ine, Lil Xan etc. I've tried so hard to listen to and enjoy their music and it just sounds terrible and I don't understand the huge cult like followings. No judgement here, I'm genuinely curious why they're so popular. "

"Hyper-mobility. I guess I have it pretty mild as I can't do any crazy shit like bend my joints the wrong ways, but in terms of muscles/tendons whatever... let's just say there aren't many yoga poses I can't do, without having trained in any yoga.

I injured myself weight-lifting and when I saw the physio, she asked if I knew I was hyper-mobile. I said no, I just thought that was something kids said they had because they were bending their finger back or something. She said she could only detect limited motility in one shoulder because my other was hyper - if she hadn't seen that she'd have missed it. Had me do a few stretches, put my palms on the floor without bending my knees, some other moves (the Beighton scale, but also some focus on my shoulder range) and then said 'yeah you're hyper-mobile. Generally people can't do that. Don't do yoga. Stick with the weights. It'll get worse as you get older.'

Nothing bad's happened yet, no joints have dropped out of their sockets, but I nonetheless remember the warning. I still don't see any of my range of motion as anything special and assume anyone could do the same, but having had the tip off, I don't exactly challenge anyone to a stretch-off or anything.

TLDR; Put my palms flat on the floor with straight legs."
"I was in fourth grade - so probably 9 or 10 years old. I was often sent out into the hall for being disruptive, so the new principal decided that I was simply a bad child. She would regularly call me to her office and either leave me alone to intimidate me or get in my face and berate me.


 One day, I told her that I was just going to leave and walk home. She said ""go ahead"", and didn't stop me when I left her office. She didn't stop me when I walked out of the building. She didn't stop me as I walked across the parking lot and headed toward the busy road. What stopped me was seeing my mom's car pull into the parking lot. I have never seen my mother angrier. She was upset with me, but she was absolutely FURIOUS with the principal.

There was another new principal the next year."

One time I had a panic attack at work so bad my arms and legs went numb, I couldn’t talk properly, could barely breathe, heart pounding &amp; beating all over the place and the colour drained out of pretty much everything around me. Was very surreal. Had to go to hospital for that one because I was certain it was death.

Bonus: not me but my uncle, had a full size truck and semi-trailer (not sure if it was loaded or not) roll over him slowly while was working on it. He had all 9 wheels on one side squeeze him like a tube of tooth paste, broke most bones in his body, punctured lungs and all. Nobody knows how he survived but he did, paramedics legit scraped him from the road. 6-7 months in hospital or something like that. Dude is pretty much 100% normal now.

"Yes when becoming an adult the social circle starts to shrink as the years go by. 

Overall what you want to do is find yourself a hobby/activity/community that you can involve yourself. That doesn't mean you have to be a social butterfly and be involved in everything. Just by joining something the pool of people you can meet grows and acquaintances can turn into friends or more. 

Pick something, try them all see what you like more and enjoy your activity. This alone will attract people to talk to you. 

Theater is a great example. Try archery, rock climbing gyms, hiking groups, for those who like the outdoors. even book clubs, craft making, sailing clubs, the list goes on. Look up to see what events are happening around you. 

If you can find a hobby/passion when you least expect it you will find yourself others that will want to share the experience. But first you have to step out of your home and try."

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence ,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

"Yeah thank you!! Did I mention the Dad didn’t work?? Played video games all day. He actually wasn’t that bad of a guy, she just had him by the balls. She would get soooooo fucking pissed at dinner every goddamn night because he was like holding his fork wrong or making the kids laugh. Sometimes I dream about the day the daughter realizes her mom is a psycho so I can help her escape and come live with me. By some miracle of God she ended up an absolute genius angel sweetheart (unlike her brother who, surprise surprise, was Mom 2.0). I’m just ranting but dude it was crazy, wasn’t it?? "

You have relationships. Parents, siblings, friends, teachers, classmates. Each with their own stats basically. Some are authoritarian over you (adults) others you stand on a somewhat even playing field (people your age). 

You are considering adding a romantic relationship to your already existing pool. You already know that different relationships interact differently (your friends gotta be respectful to your parents but no so much with you or each other, etc). This new one will be no different. 

Now a romantic relationship SHOULD IN THEORY be an elevated friendship. It's a friendship to the next level, it's harder, more personal, things will change. And while built on friendship, it now has different rules, challenges, and rewards.

You are not your parents, you are not your friends, you are not your SO, you are not your relationships. What I mean by this is be true to yourself. Just like you wouldn't let your friends pressure you into doing something extremely stupid (I hope), don't let this new relationship make you feel pressured to do anything. That goes for sex stuff, interfering with your established relationships, or keeping a relationship when you no longer want to, hopes dreams school work etc.

NOW GO FORTH, make friends, evolve those friendships. Relationships take time and work if you want them to be good. Good luck."

The private school was between the public school and my house so I passed it every day. 

One day when I was a freshman, some seniors from the private school were hanging out after school , and saw me coming. One spoiled douche yells out ""Hey, your from *neighborhood school*? Stay out of our neighborhood.""

I was just confused at first, but I didn't even get a chance to respond because a senior (lets call him Mike, I had never met him before, didn't get his name afterward)  from my school that none of us had noticed, took it personally. 

He yelled back ""The fuck did you just say? We go to *neighborhood school* and this is *neighborhood *!""

They didn't like that so the four of them started coming at him. Mike dropped is back pack, the lead douche went in for a punch. Mike grabbed LD's arm and slammed him into the ground, the rest of the rich kids try to jump him and I swear I've never seen 4 on 1 go so poorly for the 4. As they were getting up from their royal ass beating Mike surprised me by saying ""You ever fuck with my boy again and I'll be back, don't you forget it. ""

"It wouldn't be empty space, because space is within the confines of our Universe.  There are several theories that say there may be multiple Universes, but these Universes have 'decohered' with ours, meaning there is no possible way (within our knowledge of the laws of physics) to contact another Universe.  Other theories say that at the center of a black hole is a wormhole that connects two separate Universes. And of course there are theories that our Universe is the only one. Some say that its 'lifespan' is cyclic.  Hopefully these questions will become answerable by future understanding of quantum/astro physics"

"Somewhat similar story... My roommate was selling heroin. At this house there was a door going directly to my room from the backyard, which was connected to the alley behind the house via a 15 foot walkway. At 6:30 a.m. I woke up to a handgun inches from my face and a ski-masked man telling me to bite the pillow and not move. My roommate had passed out on the couch in my room, as we'd been watching a movie the previous night. The masked man ended up getting what he'd come for, as well as all the cash this kid had. Something like 3 grand."

The second was to allow a surgeon to perform remote surgery, using a robot and VR controls. 

Another surgical application was to forgo the controllers, and use a camera on the outside of the headset, and map n overlay in the headset so the surgeon could see what they were getting into with the aformentioned MRI, or doctors could leave virtual notes for the surgeon. 

And finally, the main project they were working on, was viewing absolutely absurd amounts of porn. "

"Because the movie is entirely believable.  The characters are realistic enough, there is nothing supernatural going on and it preys on a very natural fear of being eaten.  You're not shown the actual shark in full view for a very long time and most kills are relatively quick and not clearly seen so your mind is constantly making up the worst possible things going on to the victims.

"Obligatory not a doctor,  but this is one of the most embarrassing things I've ever said. 

Was in Los Angeles and was outside my motel having a cigarette when an elderly woman fell head first down a fight of stairs,  landing on the hard concrete. I immediately rushed over and her family was about to move her so I advised them I knew first aid and asked it they would like help. 

They agreed and I got the husband doing a neck immobilization while I checked her over for bleeding etc. I figured she had a concussion and given her age I advised calling an ambulance. 

When the paramedics arrived I delivered my report as first responder: blunt force trauma to the head,  no external bleeding,  pupils responsive but localized swelling over the occipital lobe. 

They loaded her into the ambulance and then shouted at me ""Hey aren't you coming? You're a doctor right?""...I kind of panicked and replied ""No,  I'm just Canadian!"". Epic facepalm moment after that. "

"Firefighter here! We had a small apartment fire, and I was on the first-in  search team. We did a crawling sweep of the living room, and as I rounded a corner, found a cage with a small, furry lump. I called to my partner, 

 ""Matt! FERRET!"" 

We finished the sweep, grabbed the cage, and carried it outside. Poor little guy didn't make it. Limp, no movement. Sorry buddy.

 We went back in on a hose line, but the fire had melted the plastic tube on the ice maker on the freezer, which put most of it out. We got the little hot spots, then got out so the next crew could overhaul.

As we exited, someone said, ""Hey, that critter was moving!"" 

 I checked the ferret, and he was twitching. I pulled him out and carried him to the ambulance. My (EMT) dad got a nasal cannula and gave him oxygen. He immediately perked up and opened his eyes.

The owner was called, and she took him to the vet. He was OK, and lived at least 3 more years (Then she moved away.)

"while platitudes like ""just love her"" or ""just be there for her"" or ""just listen"" are certainly noble, they're still a bit subjective and vague. Here's some concrete tips:

 if some sort of personal perceived trauma of any kind happens to her, no matter the scope, (can range from not getting to pet a puppy to scraping her knee to breaking her arm, etc)  always have her explain in her own words what happened. It's important that while she is explaining, you do not correct her words unless she asks for help correcting her.  do not offer solutions unless she asks.  (I know reddit will have some ""akshually"" responses so here's the outlier exception: obviously if immediate medical solutions are required then that should be attended to first)

 then after she finishes explaining, repeat back to her what she said happened, this time you can put any needed word corrections in. Example if she says ""i didn't get to petted the puppy"" (where petted is incorrect) you can say back to her ""you didn't get to pet the puppy.""

then immediately empathize with her, so the correction happens at the same time as the empathy, by stating how she must have felt when the trauma occured. ""You didn't get to pet the puppy, you must have felt pretty sad"" or """"when you fell off the swingset and scraped your knee, that must have been painful""

Finally, and most importantly, ask her ""and how do you feel now?"" She will always feel better than when she felt at the time of the trauma.

This does a few things. One, it gets her used to the idea of telling you about herself, about her day, etc. 

Two, it helps her stay connected to and aware of the present.  She will always feel better ""now"" than when whatever happened in past. Being mindful of the present is extremely important in building a healthy relationship with not just your daughter but anyone. There are a ton of other benefits to staying mindful of the present.

and finally,  this will get her used to the idea that whenever she talks to you, she will always feel better, no matter what.

That sweetener is in soups, yogurt, and all kinds of common foods and it can be measured in pool solutions.

The scientists calculated that one 220,000-gallon, commercial-size swimming pool contained 18.5 gallons of urine. 

Those contaminants are barely trace noticeable."

"Stormy Daniels, the lady who is suing Trump, was doing a show in Columbus Ohio on Wednesday. 

She's a stripper/porn star and is popular enough that she does guest appearances across the country, and not just because of the lawsuit. She was really popular before all that. 

Anyway, during her show on Wednesday, there were a few undercover female officers in the crowd who asked if they could motorboat her (shove their head between her boobs). Apparently she said yes. 

On Thursday morning, police showed up at her hotel and arrested her on charges of lewd conduct, touching a stripper excessively is illegal in Ohio unless you are a family member. No one gets it, it's not just you. 

The department said that they had been doing an undercover sting at that strip club and Stormy just happened to get caught up on it, the D.A. said, ""Fuck you, don't put that on us. No one has been charged with that shit in YEARS, if ever.""

"Not that this is acceptable, but I might be able to give a little insight into why this sort of thing happens.

You get a college degree for regurgitating at least about 70% of the stuff that the professors talk about. You don't need to remember it after the semester is over. 

Also, having an education degree myself, the stuff we're taught is advanced stuff. My degree has a major in chemistry and a minor in English language arts. 

All my English classes were university literature courses - I didn't have a single class that involved sentence structure, for example.

Likewise, my only science courses were university chemistry courses. Yet, I'm not just qualified, but *fully* qualified for junior high science classes. These involve things like the space unit, geology, mechanical systems, etc. I've never taken a space course in my life, and now I'm teaching it.

As it happens, I love lots of branches of science, so I easily keep up with a number of them. Still, while I do research things, I readily fall back on my pre existing knowledge, some of which is flawed.

The only official source we have is the textbook. I do read the textbook for the class, but any questions beyond the textbook... well, that's relying on us remembering things from possibly decades prior."
"Semi-retired teacher here.

The best sort of teacher is the one who teaches what they know to be true, is able to say that they are wrong when proven wrong, and has the guts to say ""I don't know"" in front of a class.

Of course you do need to give some leeway to teachers who aren't trained in that area. Your Ms. M was an English teacher, but she was teaching History. Sometimes teachers have to cover other lessons, but that doesn't give the teacher the right to say whatever they want to say and then punish students who discover she's wrong.

I'm trained as both an English and History teacher. My university BA was in both English Literature and Modern History. But there were times I was asked to cover a maths period because the teacher was ill. So I'd walk in, tell the students their teacher was ill, and for them to start work on page 54 and work as quietly as they can. Now if the class would ask ""Mr OneSalientOversight, we don't understand how to do this problem, can you help?"", I would certainly help but I would start off by saying ""Well I'm not a maths teacher but I'll do my best"". And as I struggle with the problem on the blackboard/whiteboard, one of the smart students would say ""No Mr OneSalientOversight, you got this bit wrong"", and so I would change it, I would ask the smart students to explain to the rest of the class out loud and might even get them up in front of the class and do it themselves for the rest of the class.

The fact that I don't know everything was never a problem for me, and I would often ask the students themselves for feedback to make sure I was doing it right, which in turn validated their knowledge. And if I honestly didn't know the answer to the question I would admit it.

Of course most of the above was when I was in classes of a subject I wasn't trained in. Get me into a History or English class and chances are I knew most of the questions they would ask, and actually know the right answers."

"there is a fine spectrum between acceptable awkwardness and comfort shattering awkwardness. I was with this girl in high school and the first few times we hung out I had to talk literally the whole time. She sat with her legs crossed, hands between them, head down. Even when asked direct questions she just looked scared and kind of muttered something. But was incredibly outgoing over text, so, I was hoping I could crack that shell. To this day I don't think anyone has, and I do feel bad for the girl she's a sweet person. Just plagued by an intensely awkward personality. "

"A good breakfast sandwich:

In a non-stick pan crack two eggs and gently give them a light scramble with the spatula. Let them cook until the tops are no longer wet. Flip the eggs then add a few slices of you preferred deli / lunch meats. Flip again to have the meats cook a little, give it that slight char. At the same time add a slice of cheese on top of the exposed eggs and top with a slice of bread. After a few minutes carefully flip the entire stack so the bread is on the pan's surface so it can toast a little. At the same time add the second slice of bread. After a minute to two minutes flip again (carefully) and let the other slice toast a little.

I find this process makes the sandwich as you cook and give the overall sandwich a better taste since everything melds together in the pan. It's better than toasting the bread in a toaster. The cheese is nice and melted. Everything about the sandwich tastes great."

"If you need to pull someone out of a bad situation (swift current, they're falling, slippery slope, etc...) grab at their wrist just below their hand, and have them grab your wrist just below your hand. This is a more secure grip and it's easier to maintain than a hand-to-hand hold.

If someone is cornering you against a wall, grab the waistband of their jeans as you press your fingers/knuckle down towards the ground into the hollow of their throat. This will take them down and give you time to get away.

Do **NOT** move someone who's just been in an accident or has just received a serious head injury unless keeping them where they are is more dangerous. You could end up making the injury worse or even cause damage that wasn't present.

If you have cats, be careful about bringing in plants, flowers, and using essential oil diffusers- cats have less tolerance to certain plants than we do, and even if it's just a cat life, being mindful could save that life. Google what's bad for cats and what's not if you use oil diffusers, scentsy-type melters, or candles that give off a lot of aroma.

The next day my manager calls me in to the office and explains to me that I've broken the rules and we cant use the discount on family and that I'll have to be suspended while they work things out. I explained to her that we had been able to use the discount before and that she knows I could have easily done the data backup at home, but chose to have my mom spend a little money in-store, and that I'd worked for the company for 3 years. Didnt matter to her.

I told her not to worry about the suspension. I spoke to my actual shift manager, who was a cool dude, and he told me he'd put in a good word for me at the computer repair place a mile away. Then I walked out.

"So my beloved cat Socks passed away about two months ago. He was being taken care of by our family friend since our apartment is non pet-friendly, and he ran under her car when she arrived home and passed away.

It had been about a week after his death at this point, and I hadn't cried yet, like it hadn't yet hit me that he was gone. I was lying in bed on my phone, at about 8 am. And I suddenly get this feeling of incredible sadness and grief wash over me, and I smell cat food.Specifically, the brand we fed all our cats for years, it had a very strong, distinct smell so I recognized it immediately. I began looking around, and at the end of my bed, where it's right against the bookshelf, the shadows looked a bit darker then the rest of the room like something was there, but not entirely visible.

Something in my gut told me it was Socks, so I spoke out loud to him and told him I loved him, and that he didn't have to stick around for me, he could move on if he wanted. I told him about all our previous pets who would be waiting for him. I then felt a small wet patch against my hand for a split second, this is important because Socks had one of his front canine teeth removed and this caused him to slobber a bit on that side. He'd rub that side of his face against me whenever he saw me.

I then felt the sadness lift a bit, and the presence in the room dissapear. I then finally began to cry. I haven't told my family yet, i don't know how they'd react, but I just know that was Socks coming to say goodbye to me before he moved on."
"I think that's a fair statement to make generally. But whether it's a biological, government, or personal decision it's all sort of a construct. And it would be up to each person who is XXY or any biological sex to have their own understanding of what they are.

I looked it up and came across this where people discuss it:

https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-persons-with-XXY-syndrome-self-identify-as-female

I personally have had very low testosterone levels for a long time. I never felt comfortable when I was referred to specifically as male as a child. But I didn't feel uncomfortable in my body physically. As an example, I didn't like when we segregated by sex in gym class. I felt awkward being around only other boys. I didn't feel I knew how to act around them. I was always more comfortable with girls. And being in a group of boys and girls, I felt comfortable because it seemed like boys acted differently when it was co-ed. As another example, if someone called me ""son"" it felt weird.

But as an adult when I don't have to interact with all those normative forces you find in elementary school, I find myself comfortable in my body and my sense of not knowing. Like I don't feel that I have to know what I don't know. I don't really consciously identify as male, but it's not a cause of distress. It's not something I think about much. The only time I really think about it is when I'm in public (rare, I'm mostly homebound) and come across a public restroom. And I look at the signs and have a sense of shock for a split second. And it feels weird to me to go to a bathroom specifically for males. It's not that I mind that there are males in the bathroom. It's more that it's segregated that confuses my brain a bit. When I go in I feel like I'm trying to ""pass"" even though I've never made any attempt to not appear typically male. And I don't identify as female, either. It's like I'm making some choice that if left to my own devices I wouldn't be making because in my head it feels like there is no choice to make. I feel like I sort of exist outside the realm of choosing. And I don't say that to sound like I'm on some enlightened plane. I just think I'm weird (I don't say that judgmentally of myself though either). And I acknowledge that I am atypical. I have very low hormone levels (my testosterone level is often in the 80s which is about the same as a woman with PCOS). So in my case, I'm XY but I don't really see myself as male in terms of a social identity. I don't make a big deal out of it, like if I'm filling out a form or something practical like that and it asks for gender. But I've always said, if I were forced to be in some sort of purgatory where I had to go to elementary school for the rest of all time (at least the way elementary school was when I went, which I found to be the most gender enforcing time of my life) and being transgender were an option, I'd probably transition to female. But given that I don't have those external social constraints, I'm happy to be in this ""don't know"" in between state. And I'm glad I don't have to choose in order to be comfortable. I personally don't find anything limiting about this body and the extent to which I am male. But I know that my mind and concept of self are different from most people who would call themselves male.

And so I think that could be true for people who are XXY or XX or any other genetic variant. I think it could be true for everyone. I do acknowledge, though, that stereotypes and binary gender exist for a reason. That there are large groups of people who have similar experiences to each other, similar feelings, similar patterns. But just like with the Kinsey report that found ""abnormal"" sexuality is more normal than anyone realized, it's probably hard to know the true extent of people who are outliers because we don't always open up and share our experiences."

None of the above. Hohenheim's death in Brotherhood trumps them all easily for me. His whole story is sad as hell.

Then he meets his sons and they resent him for leaving them behind and struggle to spend any kind of quality time together. Then he finally accomplishes his mission, finally sees his sons returned to normal, finally redeems himself, and then fucking *dies* before he even gets the chance to be with Ed and Al.  

He spends the entire series just about frowning because of all this, and that scene when Pinako finds him dead at Trisha's grave at the end, he's got a real smile on his face for the first time ever, and god damn did that just tear me to pieces. "

"My neighbor called the police on me when I had some friends over because one of them parked on a public street in front of their house. The cop came up to us in the backyard (we were being a little loud I'll admit but I kept the music reasonable and I literally never make any noise ever otherwise) and I assumed we were going to have to shut it down for being too loud.

Instead he just goes 'who has the civic. Yeah the neighbor called because you parked in front of their house. It's a public street you are legally allowed to park wherever you like on it. If she comes over here tell her she's fucking crazy'. And then walked away. Turns out cops in a high crime area that have to deal with lots of shootings and gang crime don't give a shit about small stuff.

"My husband dodged a bullet in a way. He was looking at purchasing a different pickup. Because we live in a very small town and I work at the schools, I would most likely be driving this pickup while he drove our car with better gas mileage to work everyday. Since I wasn't with him on the day he found this pickup on the lot, he gave me a call to tell me about it, how he had already took it for a test drive, even asked if he should go ahead and purchase it. But to do so, he needed me to drive our older pickup to the place so we could trade it in. (I was at home, about 30 miles away). So I get in the old pickup and take off down the road. Halfway there, I get a phone call from my husband to go back home. While he was waiting for me, he took the pickup he was about to buy for another test ride when not only did the check engine light come on but smoke started to appear from under the hood. 

Thankfully we purchased a different pickup from a different lot paying half what the other would have been. "
"I almost starved to death growing up as a kid. Lived with an alcoholic and didn't have the presence of mind to reach out to the other parent. I mostly lived on ketchup packets and pretzels, plus shitty microwaved grilled cheese sandwiches when I went over to someone elses house: the only person who would talk to me had some kind of mental deficiency and lived with a cranky 70-80 year old, but he was a nice enough dude.

The only reason I'm alive today is because the alcoholic eventually got busted for child porn and hauled off to jail, at which point I went back into custody to the other parent (they had given up custody a few years prior, which is why I didn't want to reach out).

We went out to eat the same day, and I was so malnourished that I couldn't finish a single sandwich because of how shrunken my stomach was. It's still kinda crazy to think about because none of it really feels real."

For example, I was seldom hit for any reason when I was young but I can still clearly remember the few times that it did happen.

We went into the gun room and my uncle mag-stripped, checked, and safed a little pistol and very reverently put it in my hands. I was so overcome with interest; I held it like a gun, then turned it on its side to look at it in profile - which was when my dad smacked me across the top of my head. It hurt, and I demanded to know WHY.

See, when I turned the weapon it to look at it I had pointed the barrel at my uncle. I had accidentally broken the first rule of handling firearms. Dad was just giving me a life-or-death lesson in a way that would be unpleasant but also unforgettable. I was grumpy for a moment, but also a little mollified when mom heard and said something like, ""how would you feel if you killed your uncle, or one of us on accident?"" 

Now? I will never forget: you do not point a gun at something you do not want destroyed. Dad took an opportunity to reinforce a pre-existent biological imperative in my little human brain: **pain equals danger**. It forever changed my perception of the danger of firearms in a tangible and immediate way. 

If I had got a beating every time I skipped brushing my teeth or every time dad had a rough day at work, that would probably have messed me up a bit. But when properly applied, a little pain can help a critical lesson sink in deep, where it will persist through into adulthood. And since the goal of childhood is to produce a socially contributive adult person, I see no reason why corporal punishment is wrong. 

tl;dr the people who gave corporal punishment a bad name were doing it wrong, either through incorrect application or overuse."

I wish you could have experienced my current salon. We're Vietnamese owned but very hygienic and sterile environment. We get along and share food all day.

He was informed it was a clerical error and didn't need to pay the income tax

Take taxes for example. If you have any gambling winnings (say, you win a reasonably big poker tournament), you have to report them to the IRS and pay taxes on them. But you could also deduct any gambling losses against the gambling winnings. How do they stop you from abusing that? Well, they can require parking receipts, ATM receipts, a log/diary of when you played and how much you lost,etc. Most important there is the log/diary.

"Or, you know, use a parliamentary system with proportional representation.

If a party receives 28 % of the votes nationwide, then they get the seats of the constituencies that they won, and then they get extra seats that are not tied to a constituency in order to get their share of the seats up to 28 %. This ensures that all parties are proportionally represented.

Then, instead of voting for a president directly, the parties form coalitions in order to get more than 50 % of the seats together. Then, the MP's vote for the president among themselves. If the governing part(y/ies) start pulling some shit, their supporting parties can withdraw their support, thus preventing the government from doing stupid shit. The legislative branch can even circumvent the government in some cases, if the supporting parties for the government would rather work with the opposition on certain issues. 

In the US currently, the executive branch derives authority directly from the people. In a parliamentary branch, the executive branch derives authority from the legislative branch. This allows the Parliament to elect the president/prime minister, thus closer matching what the people want.

But seriously, proportional representation is the method of election that comes closest to being fair. Condorcet Voting is better, but it's very complicated to pull off. "

She was older, had ""worked in the industry all her life,"" and knew that I was ""just being difficult."" She would always come back, make her impossible request, throw a bitch-fit when I said no because she already told the guest yes (guess who's got an awkward conversation coming her way, SUSAN?), get the FOH manager to come back and change my mind (usually the FOH manager was given a half story so it seemed like I really was being unreasonable, so thanks for the infuriating five minutes of conversation where I have to re-explain what you're ACTUALLY asking for), and ultimately she would go out and explain to the customer that I'm just too mean to do it and so they'd end up comping a bunch of shit.

They wouldn't fire her because she'd been ""loyal to the restaurant since it opened"" (about six years prior). She was loyal because the restaurant wouldn't fire her godawful ass. 

Things she told the customer I could do, but won't because I'm just a big ol' meanie:

1) make one portion of gluten-free new england clam chowder

2) make one portion of soy-free ribs (braised overnight, soy sauce in the liquid)

3) make dairy-free alfredo sauce for someone who was allergic to dairy (we don't have any non-dairy cream/milk-like substances in house, at all)

4) make eggs in a basket for a picky child (dinner time, none of those ingredients are even out, and that's not even an item on the menu during ANY of our meal times) during the rush

5) make a burrito (we don't have tortillas, when I pointed this out she asked if I could just pop to the store really quick... yeah NO)

6) sub out regular rice for our risotto as a side (we don't HAVE regular rice)

7) make one portion of pork-free bacon-wrapped scallops (to which I clarified, ""So scallops no bacon?"" No. They want bacon. Just make it pork free. Okay Susan you dumb bitch.)

8) make one portion of soy-free miso vinaigrette (you know what, I actually did this minus the miso, and she returned it because it didn't taste right \*NO FUCKING SHIT SUSAN\*)

So, in order for an air embolism to form, there has to be a pressure gradient, where in order to equal out the gradient, air has to be taken into the blood stream. So, maybe the pressure the empty bottle had on the blood vessels surrounding the vaginal area was too great, to balance things out, an air embolism formed in the blood stream to level out the pressure gradient. I may not be a hundred percent right though. "

However, if they do eat, they will grow faster.

I live in an area that has lots of cattle farms and a lot of flies. I also have chickens, turkeys, and quail so my area is typically loaded with flies. So, my plants that grow outdoors (which is almost everything. The nepethes and tropical drosera only come indoors in the winter. Flytraps and everything else stay outside all year long so they can go through dormancy)... They eat nonstop. They'are almost always full.

"This one is more specific to r/fitness, but here it goes. Sometimes people will post something asking for help fitting in some fitness routine in their already hectic routine. Usually these people will have more than one job, and will have more than one shift per day. By the time they get home, they have enough time to make something to eat and then go to bed to do the same thing over again after they wake up.

Some people suggest getting up earlier, but if anyone has experience working two jobs in one day, they’ll know that after working two long shifts in a day, waking up early the next day, that is with less than 7 hours of sleep, is less than ideal. 

But the worst are those Redditors who fail to empathise with another persons circumstances, and will repeat shit like “if it’s important to you, you’ll make the time for it” or “discipline is what you need”. They don’t understand how someone just can’t  have the time to have a long workout, or how they cannot have the energy to workout that can’t be explained by a simple “lack of discipline”."

"I’ve posted about this before but real gender reveal parties are not supposed to be huge extravagant gift bringing parties. They are supposed to be “Hey family and loved ones!  We want to share this moment with you because it is super special!” Not “Hey everyone and their 2nd cousin! Please come to this party, bring gifts and come to the baby shower and bring gifts! Because we want double your money!” 

Gender reveals are SUPPOSED to be a gathering of friends and family to share a special moment NOT a money/gift grab event. 

If I get a gender reveal invitation with a registry attached it goes in the trash. If we get a baby shower invitation from the same people it goes in the trash. Flip side of that if I get a gender reveal invite that states gifts are not required for this event then I automatically spend double what I would’ve spent at the baby shower.

But of family honor and shit they divorced we lied about it and me and my bro have a normal relationship and hes getting married again in february. I dont constantly think about it so everyone kinda sees him like a good white hearted (quote from my mom) sweet guy. But everytime i remember wtf happened i get sick and want to ignore him for live seeing he still gasslights me and my fam. Makes me feel guilty for things that are obviously his mistake. He abused me as a kid but we still acts like hes normal and so nice. My mom protects him like a new born deer, it annoys me somuch hes 32 now and she still feeds him his everymail eventhough he lives in his own house (same apartment building bc hes a mommies kid) he was 28 and she was 18/19. He fucking scarred her and we act like it was nothing makes me fk sick (when i think about it, cause i have been thought to just act like it never happened and they seperated bc they didnt fit that good together. Bc yaknow we lied about it for family honor bullshit)

edit: im only finding out now that i posted this a comment on someones comment, my bad

Being dirt-poor (at least in my family) always came with an undertone of mild criminality. So and so has a load of cheese his son ""picked up"" from the factory he works in. Your grandfather's brother can get cheap cigarettes imported from Croatia or Poland. Your uncle's mate has some car stereos for sale that he ""acquired"" if you want to head over and have a look. He'll even fit them for you for cheap. Younger cousins habitually shoplifting small, cheap items like snacks or toys for their siblings. It was just sort-of what life was like.

Moving into the middle class meant getting middle class friends, and people just.... don't do that. Because why would they? Why risk a criminal record just for a discount when you can already afford full price? Sure, middle class people still smoke marijuana, but they're getting it several layers removed from any actual drug dealers. Grey market, stolen stuff? Why even risk it?

"- eating too little or too much

- feeling the “truths” of hopelessness

- digestion issues

- **reckless behavior**

- no motivation to do anything

- anger overreaction

**Edit2**: Just want to add some advice.  Reckless behavior, substance abuse, and seclusion may be signs that you are in a bad place towards suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Seek out some therapy and give it a **chance**.  Might feel like a waste of time at first, and might need to shop around for a bit, but it does help.  

Reckless behavior was driving fast, casual hookups, and smoking weed.  I personally feel like it's a sign of getting ""tired"" of your depression.  Could lead to suicidal thoughts.  

Maybe start with routines.  It could be as simple as waking up a certain time, do x amount of pushups, pullups, situps, etc...  Take a shower, dress up, go for a walk/run.  Anything to give you a routine and keep moving.

For me personally weed helped me see the ""color"" in life again.  Honestly nice to know that I can feel like that again.  But, don't overdo it.  I went with micro edibles and don't do it to get trashed.  Sure, I experimented but only smoke enough to enjoy things again.  More warning is that it's different for everybody and some have really bad experiences with it.  Also could lead to a psychological dependency if you're using it as an escape.

Of course everything one of these bullet points kind of mixes and makes everything else harder to manage.  But seek therapy and doubt your hopelessness.  Feel free to PM if you want to chat."

First pass metabolism determines how much alcohol enters your bloodstream.  This will be mostly unaffected by amputation.   Second pass metabolism determines how fast your body gets rid of alcohol already in your system.  The dehydrogenase is mostly in the liver, so that isn't affected by amputation, but how much blood you have to dilute the alcohol is different.  

-

Additionally alcohol can be ""stored"" in muscle, but not in fat, because muscle has a high water composition and alcohol mixes with water.  So depending on how much muscle the limb had affects how much alcohol can be held in there as opposed to flowing into the brain via the blood.  After a mastectomy, there's not going to be a big difference.  After losing a leg, there's going to be a lot less muscle, so you'll get drunk a lot faster."
"Actually, no. We have dedicated channels for news from UK, Japan, China, and even Russia - each with it’s own international point of view - distinct from the main US news shows. The only news from Germany are two hour long Deutsche Welle episodes on the weekends. There are no free English language German news sites (that I’ve been able to find). 

I just came to the conclusion that Germany doesn’t care what the Anglo-speaking world thinks of it... or doesn’t get the power of News as PR in shaping US opinion (kind of like cup-holders in cars).

Update: Just discovered the Deutsche Welle news app allows free news (and the pictures of the Düsseldorf parade floats are HILARIOUS). Very happy."

They were asking why skinny people can get away with going out in their pajamas with messy hair but fat people always had to try to look their best.

The thing is...when someone who isn't fat looks sloppy it's written off as an isolated incident. Something bad is happening to them or they just need a break. Everyone is allowed to not take care of themselves once in a while.

A fat person...it is believed that they never take care of themselves. So that one sloppy day in sweat pants becomes part of this picture that they never take care of themselves.

And if you don't take care of yourself...why should anyone else?

I went to a Christian high school, which was a part of a larger ministry that included a bible college.  I think I was in 9th or 10th grade when this happened.  

Anyway, it was pretty common for new freshman at the bible college to work for the church or school to help pay for tuition.  This new freshman guy moves here from another state, and starts working for general cleanup/handyman type stuff for the campus.  He would come through every now and then and take out the trash at our school.  I don't know why, but me and my best friend were pretty mean to him.  We just thought we were being funny, we would slap him on the back and say mean things, which I actually don't remember anymore.  To us at the time, this guy was quite a bit older than us, he was in college, and we were in high school, so it was ok, just having fun.  
  
Fast forward 4 years, I was starting bible college myself.  I came from a rough background and was working 2 jobs to pay for school (parents didn't have any money to help).  I was really passionate about what I was doing, but it was hard.  He had actually since gone on to be one of the pastors at the church (large church, several thousand people) and I was involved in ministry there in some facets too, so I saw him all the time and remembered.  Eventually it dawned on me that we were really jerks to that guy, and I felt terrible.  It was super awkward, but I eventually got the courage to message him on Facebook and say that I was sorry for how we acted back then.  I can't find the message now (it's been years), but he just said ""don't worry about it"" and I'm honestly not sure if he even remembered.  Maybe at the time it was just fun and games to him too, and to him we were just a bunch of stupid kids or whatever.  Anyway, I was really glad I got that out there, at least for myself.  "

"I worked at a bar, as the bar supervisor. My general manager undermined my authority all the time with the bar staff. He would hire his friends to work with me and they were garbage bartenders who didn’t know drinks and would over pour like crazy. One night his friend forgot to show up for his shift so I had to bartend by myself on a busy Saturday. My bar was about four people deep the entire night.

About 4 hours into the shift guess who decided to show the fuck up? The friend shows up and I write him up instantly and send his ass home. Not five mins later my GM is there screaming at me in front of the full bar about how I shouldn’t have done that and the employee would work the shift with me. 

At that point I was completely done, it had been months of this and I was fed up. So I looked at him and told him “go fuck yourself and fuck this bar.” Took the tip jar and bounced. 

I got a call from the owner and the GM the next day asking me what the hell that was about, I told the owner that he should fire the GM if he wants his business to be successful and told him I would never work with the GM again.

On that Monday I went in and picked up my last check and the GM was there to give it to me. The smugness on his face made me want to kill him, but I let it go.

5 years later, the GM got fired for stealing alcohol for his friends and other business. Then I’m top of that, the idiot didn’t clean out his office and they found a shit ton of coke, so the owner called the cops on him.

Not sure what else happened to the GM, but the owner came into my new bar last week, which was 6 years after I quit, told me the story and told me I was always welcome back at the bar to drink and eat, and if I wanted a job, all I needed to do was ask.

That was nice but my new bar is waaaay better"

"My cousin got trapped in Amway for a while. It was getting to the point where his parents were considering kicking him out of the house-- he had started throwing things &amp; basically having a tantrum if his parents said anything questioning or negative about it (Amway literature will actually tell you ""your family will think you're crazy, they'll try to get you to quit, but they'll be so jealous once you have your own private island!""-- cult doesn't need the quotation marks, it really is one).

The thing that finally got him out (pointing out what the statistics printed on their brochures meant, or that he'd been bleeding money for over a year, and other facts &amp; rational arguments didn't do it) was a post I found by a pastor, detailing how Amway had ripped his congregation apart and making a well-researched religious argument against it. Luckily the kid was raised Born Again, so I guess his Christian cult-like values superseded his Amway cult.

Fire was in a hoarders house, and took awhile to contain as multiple firefighters reported hearing cries just inside the side door. Multiple entries were attempted while the owners assured them there was nobody else in the house. 

After containment, I attended the marshal and my father who was a lieutenant on a walk through. Once again, near the side entry we heard a cry for help, clear as day. Keep in mind this is a day later. So we tore through the place, along with a few others. After giving up, as the marshal was coming up the stairs, he noticed a glint behind the front door which had been knocked in, and the handle had stuck into the drywall behind it.

The home owner's cat had been stuck behind the door the entire fire, and was meowing so loudly we thought it was a person. It had single handedly nearly demolished the door and drywall in it's attempts to escape and was in rough condition. Ended up being just fine though, home owner's were overjoyed to get ""smokey"" back."

"I always used to look at people's feet in conversations and groups. People usually point their forward foot at the person they're paying most attention to and the other foot at the person they're also thinking about.
If they tap the foot up that is pointing at you up and down then they're paying a great deal of attention to you.

If you are not the one speaking but they are pointing their forward foot at you then you are probably a focus of their attention for other reasons.

 *Sometimes* (but rarely) they'll point the inside of the foot (below the ankle) at the person they're paying attention to.

Sometimes people will point a foot between two people, meaning they are paying attention to what they're both saying in a conversation, but again this is less common.

Tapping their foot when it's not pointing right at you is a sign of discomfort. They want to get away or don't like the topic of conversation.

If they lean towards you, smiling, chin tilted forward, inner wrists displayed, legs crossed with both feet pointing towards you, tapping their upper foot up and down, then you can probably consider yourself crushed on."

"No normal behavior should be taken as absolute evidence of a crush. That's how people get in trouble/make trouble for themselves. People are both incredibly complex, and can also be really dumb about how they present themselves. Ask yourself how many times you intended to put out some message or social cue and it was either completely ignored or you later realized the other person probably misinterpreted it, or you could have expressed it better, and assume you're going to be on the receiving end of that. 

And no, someone showing interest in you as a person doesn't mean they want to ride your wiener or lady-wiener. Some people are just sociable. It's easy to forget that as many of us are a bunch of weird internet social idiots."

My family and I used to go to the beach a lot in the summer when I was growing up. One time we were at this beach with a lot of small dunes. I was eleven and was just wondering around while my brother and his friend were swimming. I was walking about one of the dunes and saw this little boy wearing out of fashion clothes. I thought he might be lost so I called out to him. He looked at me and ran down the back of the dune. I ran around to find him and he was gone.

"Basically that Noah's flood was a real event and it knocked us so far back we forgot that this is take 2 ( at least). Heard it on the Joe Rogan podcast, the evidence so far is a controversial geological record in the Pacific Northwest - erosion like from a flood, but on a massive scale, the original quote about Atlantis  - that Ancient Egypt (sphinx era) was the legacy of a greater civilization that fell into the sea 6000 years before (Plato's grandfather, I think?  Heard the story)  which lines up roughly with the biblical flood and that geology.    

It sounded crazy at first, but between Göbekli Tepe, most cultures having a flood story, things like these idols separated by impossible distances, the oddly slow advance in technology in our early years, and what I hear about ancient Egypt and China, it works it's way into my noggin and doesn't come out. I know cataclysm isn't an academic explanation, but that's mostly because it doesn't leave evidence and science wanting distance from the faith."
"Dehydration, more like"
"I think I've heard about this theory before but I can't find anything when I search it. However, if I'm remembering correctly it's a theory that states that in the past there were highly advanced civilizations (think things like Atlantis) that were wiped out by some form of ""cataclysm"" and that humanity had to start over from scratch to get back to where we are today. I think in this context he brought it up to make the point that maybe there were these advanced civilizations in the past that did have the ability to communicate with each other over long distances and that's how images of the same creature appear in completely different locations."

"I dropped out mid way through my senior year due to get my then gf (later wife, now ex wife) pregnant.  School wouldn't work with me when it came to schedule, so I dropped out to work full time.

We were together for about 12 years and had four kids, all while I was the sole income the entire time.  To sum it up:  I made it.  I lived, but we were always pay check to pay check.  Parents had to help out every once in a while but we always paid them back.

I worked cell phones sales for at&amp;t back in 2007 (when I dropped out) when the original iPhone was released and made pretty good money because of that (~36k-40k in the midwest).  Did that for about 5 years then started job hopping.  I moved cell phone companies but usually moved up each time.  Went from Sales Guy &gt; Store Manager &gt; District Manager.  

How am I doing now?  Pretty damn good, minus being single (boo =( ).  Currently, I work for a big box retailer as a Store Manager making ~70k/year, which is extremely good for where I'm at.  I can live comfortably, while supporting 4 kids, on almost one paycheck a month leaving the other completely for savings and paying off my vehicles faster..  Since I didn't go to college, I have no student loans and I only have one credit card that has like $900 on it.

I do have my GED but it never mattered to employers back when I just had dropped out.  Definitely has zero impact at all now that I'm almost 30.  My job history outweighs school at this point for me. 

Do I regret dropping out?  Nah. I chose to take care of my family over finishing high school, which was more important to me.  After the first few years out of high school, it really doesn't matter to anyone that you dropped out.  "

"TL;DR is tough, but you can find the entire paper [here](https://github.com/srvanderplas/FeatureHierarchy/blob/master/FullPaper/Revision/features-jcgs.pdf).

So if you want to highlight clusters, add colors, shapes, and 95% bounding ellipses; if you want to highlight a linear relationship, you can add a trend line and error bands.

Colbert isn't going to change. He has no reason to. Typically, what happens in these situations are younger comedians find their own niche to challenge the mainstream and the big guys awkwardly try to adopt the new style. We need young blood.

I think Last Week Tonight has developed a good premise for the upcoming style. Instead of daily news events, which are bland and often petty, the newer anchors will pick a long fledged problem that hasn't been addresed or has lost public attention and bring it back to the dinner table"

I was so confused and intrigued that I watched the scene for about 10 mins and even commented on it to my friends. They saw and were mesmirised for a few minutes as well. 

The Germans were dancing in a designated personal space seperating one another that appeared to mimic a correogrraphed march of sorts. I could only wonder if some societal habits of social order never died, but merely faded into the collective subconscious.

"Someone did this to me once *but I was there first* dammit. 

A guy sat down next to me in a crowded airport when I was doing my sudoku. No free tables so I just ignored it. I had a little pack of cookies from the vending machine and this fucker just reached over and ate one. *He ate one of my cookies.*. Clearly he was trying to show dominance after I made the mistake of politely allowing him to share my table. Worst part was how he just sat there chewing on my pecan sandy like it was his. 

At this point I knew my manhood was being tested but making a scene would only display a lack of social prowess and vulnerability. I had to play it smooth, but I didn’t know how to go about it so I put on my best cool face, tried to look unfazed, and ate one of my own cookies. He looked shocked as if his victims usually cower away but I was having none of it. I just held my cookie in my hand, made constant eye contact and stared down this airport bully as I ate my cookie with pride. He winced and shook his head as if this had never happened before, and then...*he took another one!*

I did the same thing again, and we went back and forth until the whole pack was gone. Then he just glared at me, and I thought maybe it was a salutation to a worthy opponent or just a final insult but he got up and took the package away with him. Didn’t say a word. 

Feeling proud of myself, I stood up and put my sudoku book away, and under the book...were *my* cookies. Yep. Guess he had bought the same brand. "

"Step 1: Invest in Bre-X in 1994 or 1995. It was a stock fraud that started as a penny stock, split twice and then maxed out at $286.50. $20k in Bre-X at $0.25 a share in 1994 would net you over $90 million by late 1996-1997.

Step 2: Invest some of that $90 million in tech stocks and real-estate.

Step 3: Make sure some of that was in VC funds that were investing in obvious tech winners.

Step 4: Build a stock trading empire based on investing in obvious long term winners, but also shorting losers and flash in a pan companies.

Step 5: Liquidate the tech stocks in late 1999 (with the exception of any obvious longer term winners) to anticipate the 2000 crash and start shorting some of the obvious failures as well as the market in general.

Step 6: Buy a market index fund around a week after 2000 crash and hold that until September 2008.

Step 7: September 2008, liquidate the market index fund, sell the real-estate portfolio and bet aggressively against the market in general. Insure your losses with as large a Credit Default Swap that AIG will give you (shouldn't matter that you sold the portfolios, you can still claim the insurance on the losses, despite the fact that you didn't lose anything).

At this point you're a multi-billionaire, probably in the $20-30 billion range, but maybe more if you were clever and aggressive. But...you've also perfectly outguessed the market, seen through the bullshit and recognized the golden opportunities for around 15 years. People will beg for your advice, and beg for the chance to invest in your funds. The rich and powerful the world over will listen to and follow your advice, and your advice will continue to be amazing for another decade.

Use your power, wealth and influence to get access to all of the hot mike recordings of Trump when he was on the Apprentice, and get some Russian hookers to help you get a photo of Trump with his hair piece off. You now control the US President, and thus, the world."

He told me straight up 200 bucks to buy some equipment and save time when he has a team of guys he's paying 6 figures each is pretty dam cheap. Why pussy foot around with testing things and delaying because we were too cheap to get it done right the first time.

The dude was 78 and built the company up himself so he threw around some good advice I still keep in mind to this day that he passed down to me on my first professional job. "

"I had to go through HR to get my W2, because that was never sent to me either. It was a fucking nightmare. McDonald's legitimately does not care about any of its employees. The store didn't even have the right number for HR, and they were of no help either. It's pretty much set up so employees can't call and complain to anyone. Also, I was ready to get the fuck out of there. A lot of shady shit happened in the 4 years I worked there. They take older people who have worked for McDonald's for a minute, give them like a dollar raise, and slap the manager title on them with little or ineffective training, which is why you have managers asking people if they're retarded. It was frustrating for me because I feel like I've learned a lot of leadership skills in the military and through various outlets at college, and then to see the kind of people who were promoted made me realize it's just a title.

"I was walking down the hallway one night at home. As I passed a room a saw what I thought was my mom's small dog. I even heard small rummaging noises like he was sniffing the carpet. The dog looked slightly smaller and had longer hair than my mom's dog but I figured I was seeing things since it was dark. Any way, i walk into the living room and saw my mom's dog on her lap. My jaw hit the floor. Turns out, when my dad was a teen, the house on the property burned down and my grandmother's dog died in the fire. And I described what I saw and my dad said that sounded just like my grandmother's dog."

"I had a similar story. I was working at a company that was taken over in a merger, and my branch was absorbed into the closest competitor. The new district manager didn't like the arrangement I had with the store manager to allow me to work as a waiter on specific nights to supplement my income.

I had declined going full time at the restaurant because I was hesitant to work primarily in a gratuity environment. 

District manager forced my hand when he told me and the store manager that he was overriding our agreement and forcing me to work those nights so I could help his sales.

I pulled my cell phone out in front of him, called the restaurant, asked if they still wanted me full-time, and when they said yes ... can you start tonight? I looked the DM straight in the eye and said ""Yes I can start tonight. Thanks."" I hung up  looked at him, looked at my boss, shrugged and said sorry ... then walked out."
"I just saw that post on the front page of the 70 year old grandfather who graduated Community College... Here I am in my twenties all worried that I'm not hitting the Milestones other people are. You just got to worry about yourself, take life as it comes, and enjoy what you're doing. Don't get hung up on the things you  once expected yourself to do, or what other people expect you to do. Work toward the things that are meaningful to *you,* do the things that make you happy. 

You can always do something later, it's never too late to accomplish something that's important to you. You can always pick up a new hobby, you can always make new relationships. Life is amazing, and it isn't over until it's over."

"We actually have a family business that has it's 30th anniversary this year.  The biggest thing we've seen other people screw up on?

Expect to lose money for at least 5 years.  Even a seemingly successful business isn't going to turn a profit immediately.  It takes time to become a fixture that enough people know and trust to build up a good client base.

So, have your business, but don't quit your normal job right away."
"So you stop being a Muslim if you break any rule? No, that's ridiculous. That's not how religion works in the vast majority of cases.

"With the advent of the internet, people increasingly have expectations that can't be met in reality. In bemoaning these unmet needs with instantaneous reinforcement from their friends on social media, they focus more on unrealistic fantasy rather than pragmatic reality, thus making it very easy to dismiss those potential life partners who don't meet their lofty infatuation. 

In short, people don't think effectively about what they truly want."

"I used to work with homeless people. For women, you can do up little hygiene packs with pads, tampons, feminine wipes and a little roll-on deodorant. Pads are expensive as fuck and pretty much all woman needs them. 

For a more generic approach, little care packs are doable too. A bottle of water, a snack, a pair of clean socks, bars of soap, a toothbrush and a little toothpaste will go a long way. Grocery gift cards are better than money too. A handwritten note slipped inside the pack too can give it that personal touch. "

"Always take your should take your chances at love (physical or mental). 

My cousin is drop dead gorgeous and so introverted. She has trouble ever finding someone to date at 28 because guys are intimidated by her and she doesn't have the courage to talk to them herself. Almost like her beauty is her downfall due to her lack of social skills. I'm obviously ignoring really creepy people, which is one of the reasons she doesn't like to go to the bars with us when we head to the beach for a week

Moreover, it's nothing like the movies where guys just hit on girls and it's annoying. I have only been asked on a date by strangers/friends a handful of times when I was single. Wish it would've happened more to be honest.... would've been fun."

"&gt;15 anti-gay people got a boner from seeing gay people have sex, but only 7 non-anti-gay people did. We therefore conclude that homophobic men are more likely to be secretly bisexual than non-homophobic men.

"Angry looking girls have a special place in my heart. I'm a pretty standard white dude but I love when I see an angry goth hottie in a wheelchair or something.

 I think it's moreso that I would like to date someone atypical of the girls I usually date just to mix up the gene pool I guess. Most of my ancestors basically just look like older versions of most of us with slight variations here and there, it would be neat to be the new branch on the tree.

It'd be interesting to see the genetic variants that are passed down and combined over the years and what our future selves will all look like. 

Family trees would look so neat like, and then your literature-loving-tall-athletic- great-great-great-great-grandfather fucked that warrior princess from angola who had blue eyes and was great at math now we're a nation of well balanced mentally and physically polite genetic freaks who love sleeping in on weekends."

She always just dated men who were handy to get by, or paid someone to do everything, so now she's just used to being taken care of by anyone, and she's gotten old enough that she feels justified in playing the, ""I'm too old to learn!"" card.  It's insane. No one needs to be able to fix everything, but everyone should be able to fix something! "

We now have to actively avoid crane games. Either she pitches a fit because I won’t put a dollar into every machine. Or she pitches a fit because it won’t work the way that first time worked. 

I hate crane games now. "

"4x10s, and 3x13s are fantastic.

Think about it, if we assume all 125 million Americans working full time were to shift to 4x10 hour days instead, and we extrapolate out the average commute of 25 minutes you end up saving 10 million hours of commute time every week.

76% of workers commute by car alone, so that's 7,800,000 hours of cars taken off the road every week. At 19 miles average that's almost 150 million miles saved.

That's 52,000kg of CO2 saved, over 300,000 gallons of gas every week. 

And that's just looking at the Americans who drive themselves to work, alone, by car... 


Edit: I didn't double commute times for going home too... Just take all my numbers above and double them, my bad."

"Both my friend and I have had sex with a guy who has a micropenis. The guy I was with was diagnosable - under two inches when erect (micropenis must be less than 2 and 3/4 inches). She was with a guy who was similarly small. 

She had a great experience. Dude knew what he was dealing with, got super good with his mouth and hands, and gave her a heads up before they went downtown. 

The guy I slept with was awful - he refused to acknowledge there was anything different about him (found out later he might have had a hormonal condition as a child) and wouldn't do anything at all that was enjoyable for me. 

Plenty of men with micropenises are in happy, fulfilling relationships. "

As soon as the ambulance showed up they came right back in for their sandwiches like nothing had happened. Very calm. "

"The 80's was rife with stranger danger campaigns that put the fear of god in people and forever created the myth that kidnappings are usually committed by a strange man in a white van. Your kid is over three times more likely to be kidnapped by a family member than a stranger, and even then its not a lot because that percentage is 9%. Only about 100 kids get abducted by a stranger each year. Most missing kids are runaways, got lost, injured or taken by a family member. "

"How to meditate:

* Find a quiet place and sit in a comfortable  position. You could sit in a chair or on a cushion on the floor. However  you sit, sit up straight. It's easier to breathe and less likely you  will fall asleep.
* Let your eyes come to  rest on a spot on the floor in front of you. You aren't really ""looking  at"" the floor, just letting your eyes fall where they may.
* Turn  all your attention inward. Focus on your breath. Feel your lungs  expanding and contracting. Feel the air flowing in and out.
* Your attention will wander. That's okay. Just gently pull it back to your breath.
* Thoughts will come in to your head. Again, that's okay. Don't try to push them away. Just put your focus back on your breath.

When you first start, aim for five minutes a day. After a few months, try to build up to twenty minutes a day. It will change your life."

"I'm very sick of the asshole, literal murderer/torturer/unapologetic villain who hurts people foe funsies type characters getting shipped with the hero because of ""sexual tension"" does that count? that's more of a shipping trope, I guess.

in that case, I'm sick of the easily seduced by the hot evil minion sidekick. i love sidekicks but goddammit if she kidnapped and tortured you maybe don't make out with her. 

Edit, because I'm bad at explaining:

I'm sick of villains getting romantically paired with heroes they have done harm to, which usually happens because writers and viewers interpret any emotions / energy between two characters of similar importance as ""sexual tension"" rather than fear/hatred/ whatever other reasonable emotions people might have towards someone who has derailed a passenger train for funies. 

I'm also sick of sidekick characters who get seduced by the villain minions, and continue to be attracted to them after the fact that they work for the villains is revealed. (because evil is mysterious and hot or something?)

"Ridiculously late to the party, but here goes:
&amp;nbsp;

We had a family party on one side of my small hometown, it ended late, so there were no taxis to get home.  I decided that I would take my new boyfriend for a midnight stroll through the local 'haunted forest,' as it serves as a shortcut to my home (located at the opposite side of town).
&amp;nbsp;

We set off, with me trying to spook him with tales of ghost horsemen, spectres who guard the forest etc.  We reach the forest and its deadly silent - except for those weird high pitched bird screams you hear in horror movies.  The forest is small, and it leads to a long lane, which tractors use to get in and out of the numerous fields on either side of the lane.
&amp;nbsp;

We reach the middle of this ridiculously muddy lane, and I can hear something heavy breathing just ahead of me.  I stopped dead in my tracks, and I made my boyfriend stop and be silent too.  I could faintly see something up ahead that was just slightly darker than the surroundings (it was a really dark evening - no moon, no stars); and it looked huge.  I felt terror building up inside me, as we were trapped - both sides of the lane are lined with thick bushes and barbed wire.
&amp;nbsp;

I have a ridiculously overactive imagination, and my brain jumps automatically to a hound of Satan.  This thing blocking our path was obviously larger than myself and my boyfriend, and I could tell it was solid, as I could hear heavy thudding and squishing in the mud.  I whisper to my boyfriend that we are going to have to sprint by it, he was starting to freak out at this point as well.
&amp;nbsp;

We started to run at the demon dog... the mud was like quicksand, resulting in me losing one of my shoes... I reached it first, making a leap by its right hand side.  My heart was racing and I went to keep on running for my life, when I heard it... a long ""mmmooooooooooooooo"" from the 'demon dog.'
&amp;nbsp;

It was a fucking cow that had escaped from its field and had got stuck in the lane.  I was terrified of a goddamn cow.  Lost my shoe, because I thought a cow was a demonic beast sent from Satan. FML.
&amp;nbsp;

And yes, we helped her get back into her field. The bitch."

"My first relationship at 14. Didn't have many friends at that point in high school so finding a girl who was interested in me was a godsend, I finally had people to hang out with. I used to like how she was outgoing, outspoken, loud, dramatic. All that allured me but eventually I realised it could translate into aggression and that she was a troubled young girl who didn't know very well how to handle her emotions and would cope at first with shouting but then with hitting. She thought the hitting was funny and I pretended to think so as well because otherwise she'd call me a pussy. I didn't think a man had any right to be upset by a weaker woman hitting him as a joke.

As we got closer she got more innately curiously about relationships and wanted to make things ""more serious"" and ""be like older couples"". By this she meant she wanted to try out being sexual, but us both being so young I was skeptical and uninterested in anything like that. She coerced me in a number of ways such as saying this would be any teenage boys dream, she's lucky to have me, if I don't have her someone else will and treat her right. I let her do what she wanted and I couldn't imagine how this was any ""teenage boys dream"" because everything about it felt so uncomfortable and wrong. This went on for a few more months. I never enjoyed or wanted it but I convinced myself that not every couple has an equal sex drive.

We were together a year. I stayed with her because other than her and her friends I didn't have anyone, but I eventually realised I'd rather be alone than have to lie about bruises anymore. She didn't take it well, initially angry, then sad, then her way of coping was telling the other kids that I had raped her. The accusation never went anywhere and, it being high school, people forgot soon. I found actual friends who I'm still close with to this day.

I'm 19 now and just finished my first year at university. Occured me to now this is the first time I've put any of this into writing. Looking back I'd always let her convince me that I was the aggressor, because the boys always are, I had to have wanted it because all boys want sex. I've had relationships and flings and hookups since then and I know I'm not romantically broken, which I'm proud of.

Thanks for anyone who read, I haven't really talked about this before. I'm doing good. 💛

Assuming an idiot who brought back eggs for a refund is a $1,000/month customer is probably misguided too. 

Business managers far too often let their PR minds get the better of them. You’re thinking too much into a “what if” scenario that is unlikely in the first place. Plus, a company stoutly defending its reputation and dignity by taking a stand on things like this can also go toward winning brand loyalty from other customers who witness such an event or hear of it secondhand."

I think when you’re that young, you don’t realize just how creepy it is that people in their twenties still want to date you.

He thinks I’m mature and interesting” And it doesn’t occur to you until much later just how gross it is that legal adults are pursuing teenagers.

"Just want to point out that the article is a study from 2005-2011 when Zostavax was the only shingles vaccine. There is now a new more efficacious vaccine called Shingrix. Based on the makeup of the new vaccine, I do not believe it will prevent HSV recurrances. 

Right now your best option if you have common recurrance is to get a Valtrex perscription. It's exceptionally safe for longterm use. You may also try regular lysine supplementation. That has shown efficacy for some, but far from all. Lysine and Valtrex can also be taken together.

Another thing you can do is try to remember your stress levels 24 - 48 hours prior to the first tingling. Any stress inducing activity could potentially trigger reactivation. Also, consider looking at your diet. Foods high in arginine content have been implicated in agitating a reactivation, usually combined with some stressor. This comes back to lysine supplementation where high cellular levels of lysine correlate with lower levels of arginine as they compete for the same membrane transport system. 

I'm on mobile, but I could go on all day about this. I study shingles in school."

That means finding a polite and non-insulting way to avoid playing with someone you don’t want to play with.

Before that, he was a super homie who never had anything mean to say to anyone. I got sick of his shit and called him out for it and asked why he had turned into such an ass. Turns out he was going through a lot of shit with his home life, girlfriend and was fighting off a Xanax addiction. The combination of all those factors led to him turning into a general piece of shit. I'd look into and ask him if anything is going on with him behind the scenes.

"It gets worse. He woke up to discover me gone, and asked our hostel mates where I was. I’m still in touch with many people I met all over the world, including some of these house mates who helped me book a ticket, pack, and get to heathrow from waaaay outside city limits in time to make my flight and flee the situation that was clearly escalating, into something I could no longer deal with, nor wanted to on what was supposed to be a vacation.

Well, as I was later told, one of the hostel mates tried letting him down gently and told him I had left and to just let the situation go. He apparently rushed out of the hostel, abandoned his things, jumped on a bus, and about half an hour before my flight boards, I’m sitting there in the airport miserable and shell shocked over a coffee, second guessing if I should really leave and in tears over the entire thing, when I hear my name being shouted. I turn, and it’s him of course. Stuck outside the area I was in, as he didn’t have a plane ticket, begging me to come speak to him and causing a scene. For the first moment, I just stared at him in shock and didn’t know what to do, but he got louder and angrier as he grew more desperate, so I just turned, grabbed my backpack and exited as swiftly as I could to an even deeper part of the airport where he couldn’t see or scream to me. 

It was truly as miserable, frustrating, pitiful, and bizarre as it sounds. "

I repeatedly begged my managers to change my schedule and was met with indifference at best. The final straw came when I asked one of my managers how I was supposed to weather this and he said ""well, I guess you should start sleeping in your car"". I didn't respond.

"To be fair, it’s not the same evolution as most people think of.  Bacteria lose antibiotic resistance after several generations in the “wild”. It reverts back to wild type, since whatever it gained or more often lost to gain antibiotic resistance was made to give it an advantage in the wild. It’s a temporal an often self correcting form of natural selection. It becomes what most would consider evolution when the bacteria develops resistance that lasts in the wild which is what WHO and CDC is on the lookout for. "

"Year after we got married, my wife and I went to the Bahamas and rented an entire island (a tiny one with just one big vacation rental house, a boat dock, and some other outbuildings/facilities).  
  
One night, we were trashed (hell, *everybody* was trashed) and waded out into the ocean.  Some kind of weird plankton was actually making the water GLOW.  It was magical.  We started drunk making out.  Drunk making out turned into drunk groping.  Drunk groping turned into full on drunk sex.  
  
Unfortunately when you're drunk you forget about things like bathing trunks and bikinis floating away in the water.  So we had to walk up to the big house butt naked and streak through the living room while the other three couples catcalled and applauded.  Turns out they'd watched the whole thing from the balcony of the vacation house.  I'm told that the bioluminescent plankton made it quite the art piece.

He was like even in this small town I'm so paranoid, I have to carry this around at all times, and he pulls out a gun. Talked about how sometimes he's walking home from the bar and he thinks about taking it out and killing himself. 

I was just like, you carry that all the time? He says yeah. I'm like shit man we've done so many drugs together, gotten blacked out together, tripped together.. And you've had a fuckin gun? And you think those thoughts? Shit man..

I guess it helps to begin to put shit in perspective about how many military vets kill themselves every day. "

"A few things to consider.

First, when you remove funding that EU nations cover under civilian spending (for instance, most VA funding in the US is covered under other programs, available to all citizens, in Europe), the US is comparable in spending to the higher EU nations, possibly even below some of them.

Second, all Europe needs to worry about is Russia. The United States needs to worry about China, and thus requires greater military force. With that said, if you omit the US the EU is the world's largest defense spender, out-stripping the next several countries put together. NATO, in particular the US, can afford to cut spending, they don't need to raise it - with the exception of cyber-warfare and election defense. 

Third, the US 'buys' itself influence with that spending, on issues such as trade and other matters of national importance. For instance, the USD being the World Reserve Currency brings enormous benefits to the US, beyond the cost her military, and this was paid for by US military spending.

Fourth, feel free to reference such rules and procedures - they don't exist.

Fifth, NATO states are meeting their commitments. In 2014, they pledged to try and reach 2% by 2024, and they are on track to do so. For the past several years, EU defense spending has increased by around 4% each year."

"Yeah, two gas stations on the same corner is a classic example of a price-fixing scenario. It’s also a frequent example of “conscious parallelism” — a “lite” version of price fixing where the competitors never explicitly agree to anything, but they keep raising their prices in lockstep with each other. It’s been a debated area of antitrust enforcement for 20+ years. 

And of course if two businesses are in the same line of work at the same location, they probably have the same suppliers and customers, so in the classic market model we would expect them to have the same prices anyway. So you can see how this stuff can get complex once you get into the details."

But sometimes I’m proven wrong and they are really funny or interesting which is amazing.

"I used to work in billing for cable. Here’s the thing, most people in billing can’t help you. We can maybe waive your late fee, but most of the time the system bans you from giving more than 15-20 dollars in credit, and the employees can get fired at the end of the month if we give mouth more than like an average of 1-2 dollars per call. It’s annoying. Instead, if you call in ask to speak to a department known as loyalty and retention. They’re allowed to spend more time with you on calls and sometimes have more options in terms of promotions and discounts that other agents don’t have access to. 

The easiest way to lower your bill is to cancel. I know it sounds crazy, but the good deals are always going to be a year MAX. It’s offered as an introductory rate. If you cancel and put the account in a different name, or simply cancel completely and sign up again, then the system allows you to sign up as a new customer. I used to help families lower their bill by switching the account from their husband’s name to their wife’s, etc. 

And trust me, we know the company is evil, but when you call in please keep in mind you’re probably speaking to a depressed teen just trying  to make ends meet. We were NOT ALLOWED to say certain things or give credits/discounts without getting fired.  So if you explain your situation calmly we can do our best to get you to the right place. 

Also, you’re probably paying too much for internet. "

"I don't know about the rest of the EU, but here in Greece, we actually have something even stronger than the 5th amendment.

In Greece, the defendant in a criminal case is allowed by law to give false testimony, if it is done in order to not incriminate themself and if they don't incriminate someone else in the process.

So, for example, in a murder case, the defendant can totally get up on the stand and say, under oath, something like ""I didn't kill her, I was in another city that night"", even if they did commit the crime. What they can't do is say ""John did it"". That would be perjury, because it falsely incriminates someone innocent. But as long as it doesn't directly incriminate someone else, your lawyer can knowingly put you on the stand to lie your ass off in court.

This is meant to protect the defendant's right to not incriminate themself, even by the lack of testimony, since its absence may make the defendant appear guilty."

"It sounds like it may not be quite as bad in the US but in my experience it's not that different. Generally people seem accepting of the idea that if you're not feeling well then you're legitimately not feeling well. Unless maybe you're just habitually ""sick"" and never go for treatment.

But even still, there is less patience for men being sick as apposed to women. If a guy calls into work sick there always seems to be someone complaining ""I bet he's not even sick."" But if a woman is sick ""Oh she must be feeling so bad. We should send her a get well card or something."" Lots of sympathy for women. Barely acknowledgement for men.

Not that long ago there was some study, I think, that came out suggesting men actually get hit harder by the flu and suffer symptoms worse than women. I don't know if it's true or not but any time it's ever come up in conversation it's always referred to as ""man flu"" and typically mocked. Mostly by women.

I don't particularly care if men feel it worse or not. Being sick fucking sucks no matter who you are or what the intensity is. "

"It's honestly always going to a mix of what's on offer at the bar in question, and your price range. Maker's Mark is very popular and rather cheap, it uses red winter wheat instead of rye, so it doesn't have the ""rough"" spiciness of many other bourbons. 

If you're looking at scotches, take a look at anything finished in a sherry or port cask. Does a great job smoothing things out. Try out the Glenmorangie La Santa and the Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban for one of each, affordable and you can always fall back on the tried and true standard Glenmorangie.

If you want to try something a bit more modern, try monkey shoulder. A nice simple speyside blend.

For Irish Whiskey, give writer's tears a try. It takes that creaminess that makes Jameson so popular and kicks it up a notch.

For rye whiskey, it's a new product but give the Jack Daniels' Single Barrel Rye a try. It's very entry level for a rye and very smooth.

"Yeah but being gay is kind of a huge part of captain Holt's character. Sort of his entire backstory is that he was a gay black cop who had to work his ass off to climb the ranks. He mentions in the latest season that he was essentially a more progressive choice for police chief (commissioner?) over yet another John Kelly but has trouble when he has to compete with a woman. His gayness is emphasized quite often in the show for comedic effect such as when he is undercover and has to pretend to be straight which because he's gay he does in a very unnatural way. Now obviously his sexuality is not the only part of his character, arguably the largest part of his character is that he is often incredibly robotic, monotone, and kinda boring outside of being a cop. But even here I think the writers might have been playing at some comedic irony in making a character who is a gay 'straight man'. Brooklyn 99 is a fantastic show and Captain Holt doesn't play into played out stereotypes of homosexuality. That doesn't mean that his sexuality is not a large aspect of his character."

"We were down the country for a cousins christening.  We still live at each others parents house as we are saving for our own.  Anyway, we were taking a nap and the hotel alarm goes off (false alarm or something) and freaks us out like crazy.  My heart was going 90 and just as I was laying back down, she turns to me and grabs my shoulder and starts screaming 'WHO ARE YOU! WHO ARE YOU!' for what felt like an eternity!  I had to calm her down and remind her we were on a little holiday on the other side of the country.  Now she usually sleeps at her parents house in a small single bed and when she was half awake from the alarm, she thought she was at home.  This and the alarm one after the other was probably the scariest experience of my life.  I get great amusement reminding her of her exorcist moment! "

Alas we always find the perfect comeback 8+ years later. 
It's crazy that they still think they're nice guys when they're aware they've started harassing you! I've met a few nice guys in my time and I'm glad it never went this far. Glad it was all resolved for you.
"I had a friend in the last few years of college and about 3 yrs after graduation. Initially she was really sweet and seemed to have her shit together. Slowly over the years, our whole friend group noticed how into drugs and partying she was. I was close with her family and her mom opened up to me about her past. Apparently, drugs and alcohol were her way of coping with abuse from childhood. But, she was seeing a therapist and things looked good.

 But, in truth she was still very much an addict. Except now its was prescription pills, booze, and cocaine. My fiance met her, and immediantly said ""That girl needs help."" But she never could get help because of all her lies. She came to a Halloween party one year and told me she was ""totally sober for 3 weeks."" And she just wanted a few drinks to relax. She was slurring and swaying the entire time she was saying this to me. I was so worried, but she would never admit to needing help. She always said she was fine. You can't force an adult to go to rehab so I just kept an eye on her. 

The final straw for me was when we invited her to a BBQ for friends and work aquaintances. Including my fiances bosses. This girl showed up wasted and on something (idk what) and was asking everyone if they ""had any bud?"" My fiances boss was not pleased. So we corralled her for the rest of the party.  Then she decided that she wanted to go score, and she left. I have never seen her since. 

That was 2 yrs. ago. I got a voicemail from her about 8 months ago. Her voice was so slurred and she sounded really messed up on something. I think she said she moved to my city but Im not sure. She showed up at my house once about 4 months ago, but we were not home. She left a handwritten note in the mail box. All it said was ""Hey, call me. -Abby*""  
I never called. I feel extreme guilt over letting her go. But, I can't help her if she doesn't want help. And I can't sacrifice my life to enable an addict. I miss the good times, and even some of the bad. I hope she is ok. 

*not her name, obviously. "

"Semi-related story time: So I used to be a cook, and worked at a bunch of different restaurants in a relatively small town. And, as most cooks do, I spent a lot of time drinking and meeting/hooking up with servers. So one night I was going out to eat with my family for Father’s Day. Traffic was a bitch, and I was running late, they ended up getting a table and ordering drinks before I got there. I walk up just as my dad is finishing his first beer. As soon as I sit down and start looking at the menu, I notice the server walk up out of the corner of my eye. I start to turn around like “hey can I get uhhhhh oh. Hey...” Yeah it was a girl I hadn’t called. So that was great, and of course then I had to explain to my family how I knew her. 

I actually liked her too, but I was more concerned with doing other things at that part of my life. Mainly drugs. Addiction is a bitch. "

"A man looking to be in his late fifties came in wearing a nice suit, watch, tie; the whole shabang. Say him down, he said he had someone else coming. A bit later a pretty Asian woman came in. I asked her where she would like to be sat, but she gave me the “I don’t speak English look/gesture” and started looking around. She saw the guy and sat with him. He very obviously had been expecting her, I could tell by how he greeted her. Then proceeded such a one-sided conversation attempt I’d ever seen. He would keep saying things and asking her things, to which she of course couldn’t understand or respond to due to the lack of english. ‘‘Twas an interesting night.

Also they stayed 30 minutes after closing so ultimately, fuck them."

Last year I bought a top and paid for express shipping (so it would come in time for halloween - was part of my costume) and it didn’t come on time. It was supposed to come in 2-5 days after purchase and instead arrived 13 days after I purchased the top. I found out they used standard postage instead and basically stole my money. I’m so thankful I paid through Paypal because I ended up getting a full refund after a month of Dollskill refusing to fulfill their return policy. 

Recently, my friend bought something from DollsKill, (who at the time was well aware of my experience) and they treated her even worse. A listed item on their site (a checkered skirt) had an incorrect sizing chart. My friend usually fits a size large, and measured her waist before purchasing and compared that to the measurements on the sizing chart and it seemed to check out. 

She purchased the item. She recieved it, weeks later than anticipated. The skirt didn’t fit, and it was marked as a large but was a loose fit on me, and i’m a size small. Needless to say, she emailed them inquiring for a refund and they downright refused to do anything. They asked her to mail it back to them and then she “might” get a refund after they recieve it. She’s currently putting a claim through PayPal.

Wtf? 

Please don’t buy from these people.

Maybe he was just hammered, but at least interesting."

""Ha! Man, I got this one grohp guy real good. After everyone was off, I just chose this one guy. No reason, he just looked like a windowlicker. I held my gun on him the whole time. I kept making faces to, so he knew I'd fuck him up if he did anything. That's the best way to make the day fly, I try to see how many people I can make cry in a day.""

 I love the guy, but he can be a total dick. "

"I'm not sure I follow. An optimist might want to go back to a certain mistake that they made with the belief that they could make their life better, that things would work out positively because of the change. A pessimist might want to go back to a happy memory, since things aren't going to get any better. Just because someone is generally optimistic doesn't mean they are blinded to past failure. A pessimistic person could just as easily not want to go back to fix a mistake with the expectation that it would make things worse."

"My sister was very spoiled. Liked to make up stories about things that allegedly happened to we to get sympathy. Eventually turns out she was building up to trying to get emancipated. Which basically means the courts would consider you an adult despite not being the correct age. The reason was she'd been constantly built up and legitimately thought she was clever enough to run rings around other people. She always got what she wanted within the family, so she thought that that meant she could get what she wanted outside the family. 


Cue taking my parents to court. Props to her, it was a clever plan. For a teenager. The judge wasn't amused at all. Probably sees a half dozen actual cases with real merit a day. Result was a court order that actually restricted what she could do, and a social worker assigned to the case that would monitor it. So basically in a bid for freedom by gaming the system, she got restricted by the courts and a dude within the system appointed to enforce it. Remember kids, judges are judges because they're really good at this stuff.

But as in all addictions one turned into two. Then three. Till I had so many decks in my CHEAP hobby I needed to buy bigger and bigger toolboxes to carry them all. And if I'm willing to spend $35 on a single deck, what's to stop me from adding that much in singles? I mean, they'd help my decks out exponentially if I could just add a few choice cards here and there.

And the cost of the yearly commander decks is still locked in at the $35.99 USD. But a few months after they jump to $90. So I'd be a fool if I didn't buy the whole set right? And did you hear?

Some of these have had windspeeds greater than Hurricane Katrina. Again, this is a yearly occurrence. Just earlier this year, one of these storms collided with a snow storm from Russia, and I was snowed in for a week with my house surrounded by five to six foot drifts with standing snow of two to three feet that literally dropped down overnight. The weather here is wild.

I also have a distinct memory from when I was a child and lived in an area said to be quite calm in terms of weather, where we got pretty much every weather event in one day. We woke up and it was sunny, then it rained, then it hailed, then there was a thunderstorm, then it was sunny again, any by late afternoon it was snowing. It was June."

"&gt; Rules would change every other week. I would do as instructed, next week it was wrong, or sometimes next day it was wrong.

This is by far the most annoying thing I've ever experienced in my own work. One of my first ""white collar"" type jobs was with a small start up where the management had no idea what it was doing (it was improperly promoted by the owner who had no clue how to run a business in the US). Management always changed its mind whenever it fit their agenda, whatever it was.

One of the worst encounters I had was when they were looking to promote someone in my group that I led, I was called in and asked who I thought was best. I went over every single person and laid down the facts for all of them and gave my recommendation. The person I recommended the least, gave the worst comments about, was the person they chose. Basically they told me, ""Well we're going with him because we talked before this and had already decided."" Based on what? This was shift work, they never worked with this guy. Only I and his peers did. He consistently had problems, which were evident in emails I was constantly sending calling out his poor work and other issues (that they were CC'd on). Not only that, but why ask for my opinion if you had no intention of taking anything I said into advisement whatsoever? They had already made a decision. Why was I there? What was the point? This guy was later fired because when he failed and produced bad results, they demoted him back to his original position which has never worked ever because it made him bitter and uncooperative.

This kind of shit happened for months, I don't know why I never told them to fuck off and quit. Probably because I was on a shift where there was basically nothing to do so I got paid to work on my own stuff.

One day I got fired. They didn't tell me why. I just got called into an office, told to get my shit and go. That was it. I had started to line up a better job anyway so it doesn't even bother me except for the fact that they didn't even have the balls to tell me what I was being fired for, probably because it was something I could sue over if I knew the truth."

Edit: In all seriousness. There’s plenty to get mad about when it comes to gender discrimination, sexism, and gender politics. But attacking people who *may have* said something sexist wont change them. At best all you do is make them bottle their feelings and remember how progressive people made them feel. 

At worst they bottle them up so much that they will gladly support anyone who comes out as remotely against you or your cause.

By the time xmas rolled around I was completely embarrassed because I realized it was a pretty grand gesture for someone who was just my internet friend. Decided not to mail it to him.

"I live a mile and a half from my 89 year old mom and I am constantly going back and forth from her place to mine.  There's the most godawful intersection between us consisting of 3 highways and two sets of train tracks.  If I catch all green lights and no trains, I can get to her place in less than 7 minutes.  If I hit all red lights and if there's trains, it can take up to 45 minutes.
This is also a spot where 2 cities and one suburb come together (which matters, because how they handle panhandlers varies.)

So, there's a bunch of regulars who work these streets.
There might be as many as 4 of them out at one time, since there are that many directions/angles available, so they're not competing with each other.

I have a non-verbal (but not mute) 36 year old, autistic son who loves 'rituals' and he and I make up bags for all these trips to and from my mom's house.

Inside of a doubled plastic bag, the kind you get when you're at the grocery store, we put a bottle of water.  Then we put a paper napkin and a plastic spoon and a few pieces of hard candy in a ziploc sandwich bag and put that in.  Then a wet wipe in a separate ziploc bag.  Then one of those 'Tuna boxes' or 'Chicken salad boxes', for protein.  One pudding cup.  One fruit cup.  Then a sandwich bag with 5 or 6 cookies in it.  And then a single serve bag of potato chips, or tortilla chips, or cheese curls.
I feel kind of bad because the stuff is just from Aldi's, but we live below poverty level ourselves and that's where WE have to eat from too, LOL!!!

When it's hot out, like it's been lately, we keep the water in the fridge, in plastic bags, and put it in the snack bags right before we leave the house so if we hand the bags out fairly soon, at least they get it while it's still cold.

We give them the bag of stuff and $2.

We take three bags with us when we leave the house, since we have to go through the intersection twice.  And then one extra bag, just in case, because every once in a while something happens where there IS a need for a third one.
  My son loves doing all this stuff, LOL!!

I've been doing this for about 5 years now and it's sad to see what a toll this life takes on these people.
Two of them have died.  One was found dead in the alley.  I never did find out what he died from.
Another one, Josh, was in the hospital with a really bad resp infection.  Sad to say, he had someone sneak him in some drugs and he took them and passed out and fell down and cracked his skull and ended up on life support, until his family finally took him off of it.
He was about 30 years old and he was in such good shape when I first 'met' him.  I always had hopes that he was just going to 'bum' for a little while and then end up back on his feet.

And to make it sadder still, when I first saw him, he was part of a couple and his girlfriend, from some kind of a slavic country, I think, was a very pretty, really classy blonde who was always fixed up so nicely and wore really nice clothes, so she must have very recently fallen on hard times.  That was another reason I had high hopes for them.
Little by little, as time went on, she started going downhill, in just about the worst possible way.  She started getting all those 'faces of Meth' sores on her face.
I hardly see her anymore.

  Another guy, Tom, who 'owes' me $20 that I'm sure I'll never see, LOL!!!, used to have glasses but they broke, so now he just does without.
  He had a nice story once, when I asked him why his hand was all bandaged up.
  It was nighttime, and someone rolled down there window and called him over, holding out some money.  When he came over to take it, they pulled the old switcheroo on him.  They pulled the hand with the money back in and slashed his hand with a boxcutter, instead.  13 stitches.

Diaz, my favorite panhandler, told me about a woman trying to purposely hit him with her car.  For nothing.  They hadn't had any kind of interaction at all.
  
  They all have horror stories of really mean crap that people do to them.  I just don't get it.  It makes me wish I believed in hell!!!

  Oh, yeah!!  And about water!!!
  It's important even in cooler and cold weather, too!!!
  If you're offering some money and you have a bottle in the car, ask them if they'd like that, too!!!

"We had a couple of ovens on my submarine. I was one of the guys who maintained them and they were in perfect working order. We pulled into the shipyard and one of the projects was to replace the ovens. To fit out of the hatch the old ovens were cut up and removed. The new ovens were brought down in pieces, assembled, and installed. When the cooks tried to use them the ovens kept tripping out their fan motors on high temperature. From an electrical perspective everything was fine, couldn't find anything wrong.  I took a look at the technical manual and as I flip through I notice a drawing showing these ovens having a heat exhaust out the back. I poke my head in the oven and sure enough there is a vent except on the other side is the steel bulkhead of the submarine. The captain made some phone calls. The shipyard workers came down, cut up the new ovens, and removed them. New versions of the old model are rigged down, assembled, and installed. I cannot even guess how much manpower, time, and money was spent on replacing functional ovens on our submarine, but I am sure no tax payer would be thrilled to hear the number"

A lot of things. Mostly when a pet has been obviously neglected. Had a little dog that had a gash that went from elbow to elbow across the back, and about 2"" deep. It was horribly infected, necrosed, and smelled like death. Owner claimed it showed up that morning. Thankfully the dog made it. That's the most recent. 

Most breeder instructions for new owners. ""Do not vaccinate and feed your puppy exclusively goat's milk"" was my personal favorite. Thankfully the new owners brought him in right after they bought him, and we were able to steer them in the right direction. 

People who spend $1000+ on a new puppy, then complain about the price of vaccines. Or skip them all together, and when the puppy inevitably gets parvo, they euthanize because they can't afford to treat.

"After doing a bit of research for context, this law also bans any clothing made to cover the face, including helmets. It also only applies to public places, not the streets.

While some might argue there are genuine security reasons for doing so, especially in schools, banning burqa's is arguably a waste since supposedly only less than 500 Muslim women partake in the practice. While not on the street, the fact that devout Muslim women can't enter public places kind of sucks. 

While not of the same numbers, imagine if very conservative Christian women who wore the plain dress outfit weren't allowed into public places? Sounds pretty messed up to bar those from simply expressing a form of devotion to God to be barred from public spaces right?

"The problem stems in people now thinking depression is a *mood*. It just means *more sad*, right? 

But it's not a mood. It's a condition. It's a mindset that you can't just shake. You cant go have a spa day and suddenly you're better. You can be depressed and happy. You can be depressed and sad. 

You don't just wait for it to pass then get on with your life. It's something you have to do your every day stuff with. It's like running a marathon but now you're in a full firefighter suit. It's tough. It's grueling and you want to just give up. So you drop what you dont absolutely need and minimize your burdens. But it's still there.

Some things amplify depression as if it were a mood, but it's the underlying thoughts that are really doing the damage, not the mood change from whatever happened.

Depression seems to be going through the same desensitization that retardation and OCD went through. It's taking on a simpler, inaccurate meaning through overuse.

Edit: as u/omanagan has pointed out, this comment itself is romanticization, particularly the analogy used. In no way am I attempting to discredit those claiming depression or curious if they have it. Please talk to a doctor if you feel you might have depression. They're hella more qualified than reddit randos."

"You can bartend at 18 but can not drink until you're 21. If you're under 18 in WI, you can drink with your parents if its okay with the bar/owners as well (Door County, a popular tourist destination here has a county wide ordinance that no minors will be served). However, if you work at a restaurant or grocery store you can not touch alcohol, whether scanning it or delivering a drink to a table. So I often have a 17 year old that wants to hostess but can't because she cannot help deliver drinks, however, her mom could join her after her shift and get her hammered drunk off of tequila sunrises. It baffles me. "

"This will be one voice in a chorus of others, but here's a tidbit of advice: don't romanticize people. They have their own flaws and desires, no matter who they are. Being together is a pointless state of existence if you're not compatible, and if you don't naturally fall into that state of mutual attraction then there is no way you can paddle hard enough against the currents of their personality to unite yourselves. Even if you did... you couldn't keep it up.

Avatar completely failed to leave a mark on pop culture. People quote movies all the time, say to someone ""Why so serious?"" and they know it's a Dark Knight quote, say ""No, I am your father"", and people immediately recognise it to be Star Wars, say ""I'm the king of the world"", and people know you're referencing Titanic. All kinds of movies get quoted, meme'd or referenced, but for Avatar, there's nothing. 

The film was just a visual spectacle with a weak story, weaker characters, and was overall style over substance. It looked glorious in 3D, but that's all it did. "

So if we load cancer drugs in nanoparticles that are just larger than normal. blood vessel pores but smaller than cancer blood vessel pores them theoretically it should remove all side effects.

But practically its not that simple, it reduces side effects when compared to normal drug but the side effects are still bad. This is something that is already in use. And also cancer is a bitch.. even if one cell remains it comes back to kill you.."

"I lived far from my middle school and my parents always made me commute (we didn't have school buses).

One cop calmly spoke to my son for what seemed like forever, but he finally managed to get him out of the pool.  It was at this point that I realized I forgot to hide my pot plant from the cops.  Thankfully they didn’t bat an eye or breathe a word about it to me.

E: Basically the logic here is that if you don’t give notice it doesn’t count, so if you go in and say “I quit, today is my last day.” then tomorrow you will no-call no-show, which is grounds for justified termination. "

"My ancestors that were on the first fleet to Australia held the record for killing the most Aboriginals in Tasmania. They actually had it on a Plaque at one stage but no one knows where the plaque went.

Edit: my ancestors on my dad's side were from the Netherlands and we're both in the Army when the Nazis occupied Holland. My grandpa was a mechanic, but after Nazis occupied he wasn't allowed to work on vehicles incase of sabotage and ended up being a full time driver for a SS Officer. He spent weeks trying to get kicked out as they weren't allowed to leave service. He was on the top floor of his accommodation block and blocked the sink up and left it running all night, it flooded all the other floors but didn't get him kicked out.

He ended up crashing the car he was given as a driver to try to get kicked out again but still didn't work, although he said he was reprimanded for it. He ended up going AWOL and leaving to come to Australia. He is missing one of his fingers, I asked him about it one day and he went uncharacteristically evasive and quiet so I'm under the impression that he lost it while in the army, since he never saw combat I'm guessing they cut it off when he was trying to get kicked out as punishment."

What kind of a lame cultural tradition is that? We should be singing some kind of norse drinking song and then shooting a flaming arrow over a lake or something.

"German lawyers have so called professional courts with public prosecutors that handle cases where lawyers have conducted 'unlawyerly' behaviour.        
In this case the public prosecutor would first start a regular criminal prosecution (most likely due to so called 'Nötigung' - coercion, maybe witness intimidation) and following the results there open a case with the lawyers court. As this behaviour is clearly meant to undermine the 'trust in the judicial process' and the dad already has been sentenced it is very likely that he would face a heavy fine (up to 25.000€) and a suspension of his licence for up to 5 years. If he already has a record there is a chance that he loses his licence for life.        
This means he is unable to represent a client in any court or fill any professional papers with a court - normally ending a lawyers career. (You can only work for a larger company as a judicial advisor) "

"I worked for a major soft drink company. I was hired as a merchandiser, then got a promotion to a sales rep. I worked for a month as a sale rep. It was Monday through Friday, but I was salary. I was starting my day at 6am, getting home around 6pm, and then doing work at home until about 8. Never saw my kids, my wife at the time resented the hours I was spending at work, and I hated it on top of that.

So, on a Friday morning, I was in the warehouse planning my stops that day when the sales manager came by and asked if I had sold in some special 99 cent 16oz cans to the 3 convenience stores on my route. I said no, all of them refused to carry them. They didn't have the space or want to spend the money, even after I told them what the profit margin was and how it would benefit them. 

He looked at me and said ""I don't think you are working hard enough"", and went back to his office. I sat there for about 5 minutes in order to not murder him in cold blood, then called my wife and said ""I'm at the plant, come get me. I'll explain later."" I then walked into his office, dropped my badge, company car keys, and phone on his desk and said ""Now, I'm not working at all. Mail me my final check. And by the way, you can go and fuck yourself."" Wife came and got me, and I explained what happened. She wasn't pleased, but she understood (mostly).

"Unless something a company says a product does has a legally defined meaning and their product does not meet that requirement/definition, then legally they aren't advertising falsely. If I make a shampoo and advertise that ""Leaves your hair with 80% less futzits than competing brands!"", as long as futzits have no legal definition, I'm golden. Doesn't matter if futzits exist or not, or even if my shampoo actually leaves your hair with more futzits than competing brands.

In addition, you can fund a study and fudge the results to say a lot of things. So if I say ""studies show that X brand leaves less futzits"", all I need is one study I funded myself with a vauge definition of futzits and I am also good. For things like ""curl"" or ""bounce"" or ""split ends"" there's no accepted definition of terms, so there's no legal ramifications. It's illegal to say ""studies show"" if I can't point to any studies, but even a single example is a pretty good legal defense if someone tries to take you to court over it.

Obviously what I said is a vast over-simplification, but hopefully its a good baseline for why ""false advertising"" (especially for things with vague or subjective outcomes like health and beauty products) isn't really something companies get in trouble for. Part of that is how they present ""false"" statements, such as using vague terms or referring to a study they did themselves. You can make a great case for it being unethical or morally wrong, but it's not something that's easy to make illegal.

Sometimes companies go too far and do get in trouble, but 99% of your everyday advertising claims fit into the category of maybe false but definitely not *illegally* false claims.

EDITED TO ADD: I live in the USA and am discussing laws on that basis. Not sure how false advertising works in other countries. In the USA at least, theres a very big first ammendment argument to be made even if we wanted to change the law in the hope of reducing false advertisement, which I didn't even get into."

In France, it was women who couldn't feed their children. The Arab Spring uprisings were fueled by young unemployed men with no prospects.

"Not the worst thing commented here, but this happened at my grandmother's funeral last year and I still get kind of mad remembering it. Sorry if this is lengthy.

I attended with my mom, uncle, brother, and grandpa (ex husband of my grandma). I didn't recognize anyone else there, which was sorta expected since my grandma would visit us on holidays and I'd never really been to her house. As my family arrived, we were all looked at by some as ""the strangers that nobody recognized"". Yeah ok. Viewing and stuff went by as expected. Then we went to the gravesite to watch her casket be lowered.

As we were seated for final words, this old woman, who claimed to be my grandmother's best friend, behind me goes (quite rudely and somewhat loud) ""I don't know who these people in front of us are. We should be sitting there. Who are they?"" There were literally pictures of us all over my grandma's house. When it was time for close relatives to throw the dirt and roses, we stood up and she made some other comment.

Back at the mortuary after party(?) I went over and introduced myself and pointed out my family. The lady then acted like she was so happy to meet me, that she feels like she loves me like a granddaughter too, that my grandma talked about me and my brother often. It felt very fake. It just made the day so much harder for me. "

"Actually a new voice codec called HD Voice started appearing in cell phones around 2010. It supports a wider frequency range and should produce much more natural sound. Of course it took a while for networks and phone brands to all support it but it should be pretty ubiquitous by now. It never got much publicity, the likes of Apple and Samsung barely mentioned it at the time though they quickly added support, but it is kind of a big  thing.

Calls could obviously still have bad quality due to other factors, such as mic quality, signal, etc. but for a decent phone in a good environment there should be a perceptible improvement in call quality compared to ten years ago. Voices should sound more natural."

My wife and I share a knowing glance. I roll down the window and slow down, when we get close enough I muster my most authoritative voice and say...

""Hey, you probably shouldn't be doing that. Ok?""

""Ok...""

In my mind I meant they shouldn't do that or an actual adult might see them and get them in trouble. They immediately stop and look sheepish. Guess that means I'm viewed as an adult."

But like I said, no one really gives a shit, so it was cool."

"I love watching other people play horror games. I LOVE the horror genre, but when I try to play I get scared (duh) and I find it difficult to make myself progress.

It started as a meme shitfest for frogs and cuck jokes, and you want to call it a place for diversity of thought?  If I see it in someone's post history, they took the time to post some donald trump ass kissing crap there, then I write them off immediately.  It's not a place for republican/conservative ideals, it's a place for assholes to openly be assholes, and have other assholes pat them on the back. "
"True, but I think there'd be fewer. I get the impression a bunch of them show up at the incel subs and forums because they're genuinely sad about having such limited affection and sexuality in their lives, and then they get warped by the people they find there.

"Have the same thing so I think I can share.
It gets repeated often that the best way to start a conversation and move past small town is to be genuinely interested in the person and ask open ended questions. This is true, but it's often missed and confusing if you're not already someone who does it. The key I've found is to ask very few (as little as one or two) open ended questions - some easy ones are ""What do you do?"" or ""how did you get here?"", and you can use those if you're still unsure but you eventually get a feel for what people want to discuss and not and you can adjust - and treat the reply as the one thing you want to know more about.

Really try to learn as much as you can, but with the intention and the expression of infinite curiosity - even if you fake it at the beginning, you'll find yourself curious once you get deeper, and really get through to them that you're genuinely interested and not just making small talk. An example would be ""what do you do?"" ""I'm a plumber"" ""that's interesting. I've always wondered how you get into that. Do you do houses or is there such a thing as an industrial plumber?"" (Ok now I'm curious brb googling - yes there is and boy there's a difference)

There are forms of meditation that ask for strong curious focus on the things around you - watching a leaf and wondering about it's past and really knowing it, looking at a single insect and tracking it etc. I've found conversations to be similar - everyone is interesting once you get closer, but very few people actually think they are - once you get past a certain point it gets easier.

There's a conversation from The 40 year Old Virgin where he chats up a store clerk I think that really comes close. If you haven't yet, another fun movie to watch"

"Maybe i was partly to blame for this one but i honestly had no interest or intention with this guy at all.

So i was about 16 at the time and some guy i was talking to asked if i wanted to come watch a movie. Naive me was all for it so we went to his house. We sat on his bed and started watching the movie. Then he asked if he can lie with his head on my lap. I had drank a bit before i went to him so being all chilled and happy i said yes. He then takes this as sign that he can try something with me. I was so angry because i don't feel like i gave him reason to think i was interested in him that way. Maybe i was unreasonable? I don't know. I told him to take me home and never spoke to me again. He has recently contacted me again and I've been ignoring him like the plague because he makes me terribly uncomfortable. 

Another situation i often get with ""nice"" guys that are interested in me is that they will be nice until i reject their offers to take me on a coffee date or whatever.  Then suddenly these guys get angry with me and i personally think that if you were actually a nice guy you would accept that. I must add that i usually reject the date offers due to the fact that they make me uncomfortable in the first place so i always listen to my sixth sense. I also feel that they often take me being nice to them as a sign of interest but i am genuinely just a polite and friendly person in general with everybody.  Just a quick add: i don't believe all guys are like this so i hope it doesn't come across as if i am generalizing. "

the scenario i can think of where that would be offset is if a sizable portion of your group comes there more often than just the dnd/board game nights and gives them patronage. or if you are close/family with the owner.

I was knocked around a lot, had lost the people I was with, and started go have a panic attack. Some big guy saw me, though, and spent the next few minutes pushing people aside so I could get out.

I made it to a bathroom and vomited vodka raspberry, and watched the rest of the gig from upstairs, with a guy that worked at the venue.

"I can’t imagine there’s anything more annoying for the people who suffer in silence than seeing people brag and complain about their problems all of the time. Help doesn’t come from the internet, it comes from professional advice. All the internet will provide is momentary satisfaction through attention which I can only imaging will worsen the situation. Obviously raising awareness helps but people will defend their mental health issues saying it’s an infliction (which it is), but so is a broken arm and people don’t play that card every time they define themselves. Honestly sometimes it feels like depressed people feel like they are a different race to everyone else.

"I work on an exotic mushroom farm, the owners are real feel-good, hippie, for-the-children types, so we had two third-grade classes come through the farm and have a look at what we're doing. The first group was great, good kids, really interested. The second group the next week though, not so good. Two kids were obviously the troublemakers, Big Boss and Lackey, decked out in shiny new clothes with expensive coats and boots.

Big Boss decides after a few hours that he's done following the group and paying attention, and instead finds my bosses' kid's bicycle, and decides to take it for a ride. Immediately, I'm talking less than ten feet, crashes into a massive growth of stinging nettles at the edge of the compound, and gets covered in welts.

 About an hour later, I'm showing his group some stuff, letting them poke about and touch the mushroom food bins. Before I let them over, I warned them to be careful because this mixture (Sawdust and nutrient additives) could make you super itchy if they got too much on them, not an allergic reaction or anything, just what happens when sawdust and soy meal dries on your skin. Big Boss goes armpit-deep in the bin and then jokingly smears it on his face to make Lackey laugh.

Didn't turn out so well for him. "

After discovering that he has been written out of his wealthy father's will, Arlo ""Bucky"" Buckingham (played by Jack Black) is forced to take any job that he can in order to support himself. With no degrees, no diplomas, and no credentials other than a driver's license, the overgrown man-child manages to talk his way into becoming the bus driver for his old summer camp. At first, his weekly grind of ferrying rich children to and from a remote retreat seems simple (if a bit boring)... but when a freak storm strands everyone in a mountain forest, Bucky is forced to rely on previously undiscovered ingenuity and maturity in order to guide his charges safely to their destination.

"Sounds like me back when I was a full-blown alcoholic. I was young, attractive, female, and very talented in my field. Since I managed to be a functional drunk for many years, over time I got more and more risky and sloppy about it without really realizing. I was delusional and sort of like this woman, prided myself on the amount I could day drink and still effectively deliver on my work, which did work for a while due to my professions “work hard play hard” mentality, but it can only sustain you so long.

"Toxic bias in the news media, and I mean real news not entertainment networks that happen to have ""news"" in their title. 

I always defended newspapers leaning Democrat, Republican, Socialist, whatever, because that is how it's always been. Leaning one way or another was part of what sold the papers and why they existed. Everyone knew it, and that was fine.

But since Trump, things have gone off the deep end in my experience, even my stalwart favorite media sources (e.g. the New York Times and the Washington Post) read like liberal fantasy fiction sometimes. I used to read these papers every day, now I can barely even stand the headlines and I wouldn't go near an opinion piece. 

I really only want to read actual news, as in reporting things that have happened or that are going to happen. But the front pages now are covered with panicking speculative articles. I have a rule now that I won't read any article that has ""could,"" ""might,"" ""possibly,""  or the like in the title. I don't read many articles anymore.

I don't want to read their freakout interpretation of some tweet that will end up meaning nothing, or even some policy announcement that Trump makes, because we really don't know what they mean and he is likely to say the opposite two days later. 

It feels like people -- journalists, readers -- are now addicted to the reality show that is the White House and have forgotten about reporting almost anything else. Even if nothing of substance is really going on with the WH, it's like papers just can't stop themselves. 

I hear Flint still has no drinkable water and there have been no meaningful steps towards gun control despite repeated massacres. And I am sure other things are going on in this country. But who cares, right? Trump insulted the Sultan of Brunei in a tweet so let's write six articles about why we are probably going to war with Brunei and it will ruin the economy."

"Late to this thread but oh well. I play the clarinet, and the company you buy a clarinet from greatly impacts how well you could play. I just got my first professional level clarinet (Yamaha custom CSVR) . It's a great clarinet for anyone who's interested in upgrading. Anyways, buffet, a clarinet company,  in the early 1900s became extremely popular across the world. Now that they have that popularity, then tend to make clarinets on the cheaper side as well as put bad equipment (swab, reed, ligature, etc.) With their clarinets. They're still good clarinets, but in my opinion Yamaha is better.

Yamaha went around America and asked a ton of professional clarinet players to test out a clarinet they were making in order to make it sound really good. They put in a ton of work into making the clarinet model I just got. Overall, how well an instrument sounds depends greatly from person to person, but I think Yamaha is still better than buffet even if they aren't as well known."

"&gt;“So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table, on my left, the newspaper, on my right, the cup of coffee, in the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I see it perfectly.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What you don’t see,” said Arthur, “because I haven’t mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What’s he like?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn’t look,” said Arthur, “as if he was about to do anything weird.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Ah. I know the type. What did he do?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and …”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Ate it.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“He ate it.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. “What on earth did you do?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,” said Arthur, “to ignore it.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What? Why?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, it’s not the sort of thing you’re trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience, or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, you could …” Fenchurch thought about it.  “I must say I’m not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I stared furiously at the crossword,” said Arthur, “couldn’t do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,” he added, “that the packet was already mysteriously open… .”  
&gt;  
&gt;“But you’re fighting back, taking a tough line.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,” said Arthur, “it stays eaten.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“So what did he do?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Took another one. Honestly,” insisted Arthur, “this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably.  
&gt;  
&gt;“And the problem was,” said Arthur, “that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? ‘Excuse me …I couldn’t help noticing, er…’ Doesn’t work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigor than previously.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“My man…”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Stared at the crossword again, still couldn’t budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St. Crispin’s Day . .”  
&gt;  
&gt;“What?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I went into the breach again. I took,” said Arthur, “an-other biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Like this?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,” said Arthur, “that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I can imagine.""”  
&gt;  
&gt;""We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me…”  
&gt;  
&gt;“The whole packet?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, it was only eight biscuits, but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Gladiators,” said Fenchurch, “would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course.  
&gt;  
&gt;""As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper …”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yes?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Were my biscuits.”

"The second to fourth date are great ideas and work like a charm, its just that the first date, I dont think a coffee its the best way, it puts a lot of pressure to both parties, its like ""i'll drink my coffee while you talk and convince me that you are interesting, and why should I date you again"", i'm not saying that coffee sucks, its a good date, and sometimes it works, but, for the first date it is just to much... for two people that are literally just getting to know each other. There are no distractions, you drink your cofffee when the other person is talking, the one that talks the most gets a cold coffee. I just want to say that doing something more interesting that removes the ""first date"" tension, like a museum, walk together in a park (you can buy a coffee to go and then go to the park), go bowling or ice skating and then coffee. Its hard to be you, when you are sitting in front of someone for the first time like its an interview.

Those movies are so funny to me.  The villain is basically just really bad luck.
"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness."
What a fucking weirdo. I wonder if anyone else has to deal with him.
"I was young and he made me feel like I had emotionally taken advantage of him by getting to know him, ""making"" him like me and then rejecting his feelings without even giving a romantic relationship a chance. He was also the ""best guy nicest person"" at my high school so people just thought I was a bitch for making him sad. 

Looking back, I really wished I had told my parents or a teacher or been more vocal about how uncomfortable it made me to my friends. But at the time, things were really confusing and it felt humiliating to go to my parents and tell them that my ""friend"" violated me that way. Alas, things to learn with growing up.

"Not a doctor but I work as a nail tech. Lady with diabetes came in to get a pedicure and neglected to mention she had diabetes. No clue what type it was, but we usually refuse to accept service from people with diabetes, cause the skin just flakes off and no amount of scrubbing with a pumice stone will help. This lady was stubborn enough to blame it on us, and insisted she had a right to get pedicures and she did it all the time. If she’s anything like some of our former diabetic clients, it hurts to scrub and clipping the toenails for them is a no go. So no idea what was wrong with this lady to be stubborn."
"We have a number of old, narrow residential streets on the west side of Vancouver. One I drove regularly was three lanes wide, and people parked on both sides. Drivers would dodge oncoming cars by pulling into empty spaces at the curb. So one day, I see a city crew down on hands and knees with orange cones strung out behind them. They were epoxying large bi-directional reflector blocks down the the center of the street, which was absurd: drivers still had to straddle them to use the street. God knows how much money was wasted on that exercise.  
  
But they weren't through! That winter it snowed, and a city plow came down the street, making a driveable path through a foot of white stuff. And cracking off all the reflectors. Every. Single. One."

"ER medical provider, here's mine.

* IV normal saline.  May seem basic, but that's before you're puking/shitting/sweating your guts out from some unknown GI infection (more common with bad water sources), and you can't hold anything down, and you might be totally exposed to the elements.  You might survive without it, but any extended time of weakness in the apocalypse increases your odds of death.  Plus, you know there's gonna be some ragers that need a hangover cure.
* Insulin.  Not for myself, but odds are there are a lot of insulin-dependent diabetics to whom it would be more valuable than gold.  Not a bad bartering tool \*cough\* I mean way to make friends.
* Levofloxacin.  Antibiotic with a decent spectrum, for example good effectiveness against UTIs including kidney infections, skin infections, most pneumonia.  Plus it's oral, so it's easily stored, administered, and bartered.
* Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam).  Sure I'll jump on the Zosyn train.  Great spectrum, complements levofloxacin by covering anaerobes, and IV form in case someone gets meningitis or if someone's starting to look septic (although I feel pretty safe saying anyone who gets sepsis during the apocalypse is probably fuuuuuucked).  Also could be a non-surgical alternative for appendicitis treatment in a pinch.
* Ivermectin.  Anti-helminthic (anti-worming).  You better believe there's going to be a total breakdown of water sanitation and I'm not going to trust my chlorine tabs and boiling water to catch everything.
* Morphine.  Good painkiller if a fracture needs to be reduced or something, or for emergency surgery.  I could be convinced towards ibuprofen, since surgery would likely end in massive post-op infection anyway.

Obviously it's extremely difficult to choose just 6 meds, and will vary from doc to doc, but here's why I didn't include...

* Epinephrine.  Anaphylaxis?  Sure, if it's a known reaction for you or a loved one.  Otherwise are you really hoping to be in the right place at the right time to help a stranger with a relatively random and rare condition? Especially if transportation has gone to shit.  Also, cardiac uses for epi are a marginal benefit.  Pretty poor ROI putting it on a 6-list, imo.
* Vancomycin.  Seems like a waste, it's generally only used for resistant infections that occur due to hospital-bred bacteria.  Once the apocalypse happens we'll likely be getting the ""in the wild"" type of most infections, which have higher susceptibilities.  Also Zosyn covers pretty much the same spectrum plus some.
* Fentanyl/oxy/hydrocodone.  All great painkillers, just personal preference.
* Ketamine.  It was hard leaving this off.  If I re-wrote the list I'd probably switch levofloxacin for ketamine and morphine for ibuprofen.  Guess it just depends if you plan on dealing with more injuries (ketamine, ibuprofen) or infections (levofloxacin)."

"My dog died six years ago when I was in China. I never had a chance to say good bye, as my mother called from CA and said he had stopped eating. She put me on speaker phone and he perched his head up. She was going to take him to the vet the next morning but he never woke up. 

I remember coming home and my mother and I embraced and cried. We’re Asian so we’re not very affectionate but at that moment just sadness and love for our dog took over. 

That night I went to sleep and saw my dog in my dreams. I played with him for a minute and told
Him to wait as I went into my room to retrieve his toy. As I walked back out, he was gone. I think that was his way of saying goodbye. 

Exactly a year later I saw him again in my dream. He let me pet him for a bit and the dream was over. I never saw him again after that. "
"When I was in Essex, at first I would answer this by saying ""oh, I'm alright thanks, how are you?"" But then over time my standard response changed to ""Hello,"" and then eventually I occasionally said just ""alright?"" in response - I gradually learned that out was not an actual question, more a salutation. 

I appreciated their friendliness though. Everyone, from bus drivers to lecturers to my landlady, would greet me with a very friendly ""all right?"" - I found the UK a *much* friendlier place than New England, where I had been living for a few years just before moving to the UK. 

Edit: another weird quirk is all the kisses, like “x” or “xxxx,” British people put in texts or online communication (e.g., “u on your way? xx” or “Wish you were here! x”). It’s weird mainly because you use it with *everyone* - friends, lovers, acquaintances - while in the States this is definitely something you’d only do with an established romantic connection, if that, and you’d probably throw some hugs too, i.e. “xoxo.” "

She wore a big coat and sweatpants. At the time, us youths mocked her for her odd behaviors. But I had once been the weird kid, and I knew that even this level went far beyond the normal level of odd eccentricity. Something was not right. I was as kind to her as I could be, certain her family life was shit, as her social life was non-existent. She ate alone every single day. Of note though:

* She was kicked out of the school's anime club. The bastion for all the oddballs, and even they could not tolerate her antics.  
* One day she got on all fours and ran down the hall screeching, advising us she was a mythical deer.  
* She was found in the woods near our school in a princess outfit, and told everyone she was the ruler of a fantasy kingdom.

"Fun fact: Optimus Prime saved a life even in death.

See, Transformers and G.I. Joe both had animated movies in the 80s. Both movies were going to kill off the leader of the good guys, so both Optimus Prime and Duke were on the chopping block.

The Transformers film finished first, and the outrage over Optimus Prime dying led to the decision to not kill off Duke. If you watch the G.I. Joe movie, you'll see what happened in its place. Duke is pronounced to be in a coma after *taking a spear to the chest*. The line is even added in a frame where no one's lips move, so it was likely a last-minute addition.

For the record, there's a possibility that the two cartoons did exist in the same continuity. The season of Transformers after the movie saw the introduction of a character named Marissa Faireborne, who was later revealed by one of the writers to be the daughter of Flint and Lady Jaye of the Joes.

And there's the episode where a guy called ""Old Snake"" turns four Autobots into humans, grumbles about how ""they just don't make terrorists like they used to"", and starts the old ""COBRA!!!"" cry before having a coughing fit."

"This. As a (non-native) Russian speaker, it's very difficult to find substantial material on any slavic language that isn't Russian. And, once you learn Russian, most of the other slavic languages are actually easier to learn because many of them are grammatically simpler than Russian. In some cases (namely, Ukrainian) while the language does have a distinct grammatical system and different words, the two languages are compatible at a level where you can use one word/phrase in Ukrainian with another word/phrase in Russian and they work fine. This is why Ukraine has such a spectrum of speakers -- from hardcore, ""Speak Russian and I'll kick you out of my restaurant"" in Lvov, to ""Yeah, half of this is actually just Russian... if not more"" in Poltava, and ""What's Ukrainian?"" in Donetsk.   


So yeah... learn the most popular language in the language family and then move on to the lesser-spoken language."

"&gt; That the Ctrl+Alt+Del Task Manager can prioritize programs so you can make sure they don't crash.

That's not what that's for; and you shouldn't mess with it.  The dialog box that pops up when you change a process's priority that tells you ""Don't do this it can cause system instability"" is not lying to you.

A process's priority has nothing to do with making sure things don't crash, it's a way of signalling to the operating system that, if the CPU is fully loaded, which processes should have priority to get computing time first.  Messing with it will not stop crashes, but it may *cause* them by causing ""priority inversion"", where a high priority process ends up stuck waiting for a resource held by a low priority process which never gets to run because the high priority process is hogging up all the CPU in a spinlock, and because it's higher it always gets priority over the lower priority process, so the lower priority process can never release the resource.

Because people who don't know what they're doing like going in and monkeying with process priorities, Windows will take steps to try to avoid priority inversion, but those steps only avoid a total deadlock situation, they don't avoid the horrible performance impacts that codependent processes of different priorities can have.

In short: don't ever change a process's priority through Task Manager.  Processes that need higher priority will already be running at it; and processes that *aren't designed* to run at higher priority can only cause problems with it.

And if you're going to say ""but I want my games to run faster and always have high priority on the CPU so it only makes sense I'd raise their priority"", the answer to that is they *already* have higher priority (Windows gives a priority boost to whatever application is in the foreground so that it's always first in line for the CPU among normal processes), and that as I mentioned above, giving your game higher priority can cause supporting processes (like the Windows audio engine, or the background processes many games use now to run their user interfaces) to get starved, leading to overall worse performance."

"Working at Wells Fargo, back in the 80's.  I started as a teller, and was competent and didn't have many overages/shortages.  Over time, I managed to become a Senior Teller, which basically meant I could handle merchants bringing in large bags of cash and checks, could handle it quickly, and - again - did not make mistakes.  It's one thing to handle your average customer with a few hundred or a few thousand dollars to deposit or request, it's a whole 'nother thing when the state official brings in a few bags with a few million dollars of checks and handfuls of cash.  Or the dirty looking guy happens to be a millionaire and wanted a $325k in cash (it was as long as my arm).  

Anyway, as part of that role, I learned as much as possible about how the whole teller crew operated.  I had to keep them stocked with cash, help them resolve overages/shortages, give them travellers checks, and so forth.

One day a position for a Teller Manager opened up at our branch.  I read the requirements, and for the first time in my life I was 100% qualified for the job.  Just too perfect for words.  No one else at the branch had my skills or seniority.  I put in my application.

My manager, Judy, later informed me that I was *not* getting the position, even though I was highly qualified.  Instead, Mike got the job.  Mike was a new teller, and had been working for the bank approximately 3-4 months.  He had nowhere near the requisite skills for the position.  

However, Judy said, he got the job because ""Wells Fargo has a policy to only promote employees with a college degree.""  Well, I didn't have a degree, but Mike did.  He got the job.

I was stunned.  I looked her in the eye and said ""I quit.""  She said ""Are you putting in your two weeks notice?""  I said ""No, I quit.  Here are my keys, goodbye."" and I walked out.

I went home and took my father up on his offer to put me through college.  I later found out they fired Mike because he was grossly incompetent.  I graduated 4 years later and am forever thankful for Wells Fargo screwing me out of that position, as I now am much more successful."

"Applicable Terry Pratchett quote:

“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.”


Not always true with designer goods, but when they become well known for quality then you’re right they’re worth it. I bought some Hestra ski gloves 10 Years back, just starting to think about replacing them while I’ve seen friends go through multiple pairs of gloves only 30 bucks cheaper or so.

"&gt; I mean most people don’t wait for marriage and if they do, they’re typically married by age 21.”

See this is the trick. I know plenty of conservative Christian types, and they all got married... pretty much straight out of college, maybe even earlier. I had a cousin explicitly tell me that's why so many conservative Christians she knew where getting married in their early twenties: they where fucking horny. 

Also, a lot of them had been dating since as far back as high school potentially. There was this one couple I knew that dated all through college, all 4 years, got married a year after they graduated. I mean, I never asked, because it was none of my business . . . buuuuut I assumed there was a level of sex going on at some point in that 5 year relationship. "

## World War II[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bayer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7)]

During World War II, IG Farben used [slave labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_labor) in factories that it built adjacent to [German concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_concentration_camps), notably [Auschwitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz),[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-29) and the sub-camps of the [Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp).[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-Memoriales-30) IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-ahrp.org-31)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-32) IG Farben employees frequently said, ""If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed.""[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-33) IG Farben held a large investment in [Degesch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degesch) which produced [Zyklon B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zyclon_B) used to gas and kill prisoners during the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust).[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-34)

After [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business ""inheriting"" many of IG Farben's assets.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-ahrp.org-31) [Fritz ter Meer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_ter_Meer), an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the [IG Farben Military Tribunal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IG_Farben_Trial) at Nuremberg. He was elected Bayer's supervisory board head in 1956.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-35)

In 1995, Helge Wehmeier, the head of [Bayer Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_Corporation), publicly apologized to [Elie Wiesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel) for the company's involvement in the Holocaust at a lecture in [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh).[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#cite_note-nydailynews.com-36)"

"&gt;But I agree that it has become far more of a contest to make it seem like you're doing *amazing* and your life is awesome.

The biggest difference I remember from being on Facebook from roughly 2005 through 4 years of college is that, at the time, most people posted stuff that involved other people moreso than themselves. It didn't feel nearly as self-centered. It was more just about posting stupid/funny pictures of whatever shit you and your friends got into over the weekend so everyone could laugh about it and revisit it.

I can't speak for everyone, but this seemed to be the most common use-case at my (fairly large) university. Sure, people posted pictures of vacations and stuff, but the reason for posting them and the reactions to them felt different. Maybe it has something to do with not everyone having a camera in their hand 24/7 at that point, and everyone kind of cherishing the output of the 1-2 people who had their old school digital camera at the party and bothered to upload the photos.

I also think the Facebook audience change impacted it a lot. Initially, you had a lot of smaller circles of people all at the same schools experiencing roughly the same sorts of things. But as you opened it up to everyone, and the early adopters graduated and went their separate ways, there became more incentive to do the posturing-type brag posts."

"I was chubby as a kid, and it was boys who felt completely entitled to bully me for being “fat”. One boy even told me I didn’t have a right to any opinions about anything because it didn’t matter because I was fat. In my experience girls didn’t really give a shit. The only times girls said anything was if you were sharing your feelings about how shitty it was to be bullied and they focussed on how you could improve, not that those little pieces of shit weren’t entitled to comment about your body and harass you that you were worthless. 

What really burns me up to this day, is that I worked out, dieted and slimmed down and the piece of shit who bullied me relentlessly became morbidly obese. If you bully people about their weight you should be required to eat chicken breast and log some god damn treadmill time. Oh well, I guess I was right when I used to retort that “I may be fat, but I can always lose weight and you’ll always be ugly”. That little (now enormous) monster was ugly inside and out. "

The Weathertenko is a manouver that allows a player to skip the entire map by jumping backward over the start/finish line. Even with speed runners who can execute pixel-and frame-perfect manouvers, The chance of getting a single weathertenko is about 1/40, meaning the chance of getting all 3 required for a full run is about 1/64,000. It’s only happened once: in true speedrunner fashion, one guy decided that he’d do nothing but weathertenko attempts for like 6 months and eventually got it.

Last week I picked up a rental there and discovered I had forgot to specify automatic, so there it is, clutch and all. Apparently it's like riding a bike, you don't forget. In fact it was great, no need to try to trick it into the right gear, no need for the stupid override flappy paddles or kickdown. The fucking eco mode auto engine off at stop lights kept making me think I had stalled out though.

There's certainly something to be said for an automatic in heavy traffic, but I think my next fun car is going to be manual. If they still make them by then. If it's an EV I guess that's a nonissue."

"Not sex but it was sexual in nature.

Was at a club and, for the first time ever, a girl (and stranger) wanted to dance with me. She was VERY aggressive on the floor and being as drunk as I was I let her lead. She was bumping and grinding so hard for what seemed like a good hour. (On and off, not continuously.)

I go home and sleep none for the worst. The next morning I wake up, go to the bathroom, and see just a puddle of blood on the base of my penis.

Since I am no good with blood at all, and considering WHERE the blood was coming from, I just freaked the fuck out. The best/worst part of it all was that no one in my family was home and it was the one time I had the house to myself. So I had to ask a neighbor, who saw me look pale as a ghost in my car, to drive me to the ER.

Long story short: Nothing was physically wrong with my penis like it was broken or anything. It's just that the dancing this girl did was so rough and aggressive it just chafed the base incredibly hard. So the nurses gave me some ointment to fix the mess and I was driven home. I don't think I was ever more embarrassed in my life and vowed to never go clubbing again.

Until about 2 years later where my friend and I went to the same club and she wound up doing the exact same thing to me. So the lesson is that I can never dance at a club or have rough sex apparently."

You'd be surprised how many candidates are stumped on the basics, if they would have just done a little research on common interview questions,  prepared some answers, and practiced answering them, preferably in front of a mirror. 

Have questions and ask them, ask everyone who interviews you. If you say well the interviewer before you answered all my questions...then I assume either you dont really have any questions or you're not thorough enough to get everyone's perspective, makes you seem lazy.

"I've posted this on Reddit before, and I didn't actually see it, it was my mum.

This rich kid at her school decided to do donuts in the staff car park in his brand new sports car, and in doing so, smashed into the back of one of the teachers land rovers (a hardy bastard, usually used on the teachers farm, so the sports car was a banana but the land rover sustained minimal injuries aside from some red paint on the back corner of it).

Kid runs home crying to parents about it, saying the teacher hit his car with the land rover and my mum was refusing to do anything about it. They call a meeting with my mum, who was his head of year. Parents come in fuming, my mum sits quietly and listens to what they've been told by the kid, they're ranting and raving, threatening legal action, and the kid is sat there smirking. Then my mum asks if they want to see the CCTV footage of the incident, where all is revealed.

Parents silently get up, thank my mother for her time, and take the kid back home. My mum, and the teacher whose car was hit, get a bottle of wine and an apology letter from the parents the next day. 

Later found out that he was banned from driving all vehicles they owned, and if he wanted a car, he'd have to work for it himself. His little brother (who was a good guy) came in a couple of years later and he and my mum had a big laugh about it. Apparently he's still an obnoxious bastard."

"**EDIT**added height and weight for reference that everyone deals with these people.

I’m a dude, 20 years old in college, pretty big 6’4 230 and had the weirdest fucking experience. 

Before college I definitely had some nice guy traits and take full responsibility for them regardless of what was fucking my head up during the time, but because of that it’s made me see these people easier, and their intentions. 

Met a dude in my summer class who seemed kinda awkward but cool or decent enough, so after our class he approaches me and tells me he’s socially awkward etc not good at socializing, and says that he’s just looking at getting better at it, he noticed my laptop (I PC game and so does he) and used that as conversation starter. So obviously being awkward and kind of socially retarded before I don’t reject him, and ask him if he wants to get chikfila on campus with me

Dude seems normal, just talking about his hobbies and games he likes to play (tabletop warhammer, tf2) he was really getting into it so you could tell a lot of people might dismiss him for what he enjoys. Kid seems normal to me and since we play computer games and enjoy similar bongs I figured he’s alright just awkward. So after this I start to walk to my car, he follows me then asks for a ride to his car, (not too weird in my opinion it was across campus). So I have to stop st the bookstore and he’s explaining some warhammer character to me comparing it too ‘tentacle porn I’m sure you’ve seen’. 

So as you can imagine, this is where it gets weird. 2 hours later he snapchats me (we exchanged them) ‘are we still hanging at 4?’ I never made plans with him. I tel him I’m not in his city atm, I live in a metro area where cities are very close. He gets very mad and pulls the manipulation card acting like I need to hang with him cause I seem really cool etc, set off some red flags.  



So I’m cautious next day in class, and sit on the other side to “see better” and after class he immediately starts following me to my car every day without asking. I would tell him I can’t hang or anything but would just push the fucking issue.  While on these car rides he talks about he’s sick of people not understanding him and girls dismissing him and him not being treated “right”. And continues to play a song about being friend zoned, then goes on a fucking rant about how girls always go after dicks and avoid dudes that are their for them. 

So I stop at 711 while taking him to his car one time and he moves all the shit in the car while I’m inside, and while we were driving he literally peeps into my console and stares at my gun I have in my car (I open carry in an open carry state, was unloaded with proper precautions) and I catch him doing that.

So I Snapchat him telling him he’s outta fucking line and violating my privacy and to not hit me up again. He doesn’t get the message. Maybe 2 weeks pass and he comes back. In front of a class full of people he basically scream asks if I wanna hang with him, and at this point I’ve had enough and tell him no I’m busy looking like a total dick (manipulation clear as day).

All while this is happening, he coincidently ALWAYS ends up directly next to me or behind me on the highway even though I dropped him off and have a full 7-10 minutes ahead of him, even the day I got my bike fixed for an hour off campus he still ended up behind me. 

Now I’m not saying I handled the situation correctly. But I freaked. I told him to pull into a public parking lot and we need to talk, he pulls in and I back him into the spot and tell him straight up what he’s doing. And that I know he’s following me. And I hope he gets that it’s not what he likes that pushes people away from him, it’s the way he chooses to act and handle situations, and if you like warhammer etc nobody that’s decent will give a shit as long as your decent. Kid goes complete denial telling me I’m wrong and just “another one of them”. Told the kid at the end it’s either a restraining order or an ass beating and to stay the fuck away from me and anywhere I’m at. 

I felt bad, but I don’t at the same time. I wish I truly knew how to handle these people. "

"xyzPrinting, a company that makes 3D printers. I should say, they make large pieces of metal and plastic that might as well be trash because they become unusably broken after a month (assuming they work at all to begin with). Oh, and when they do break, good luck sending it in for repairs. They take *at least* a full day, usually several days to respond to one email, no matter how simple it may be. If you can manage to get them to repair it, the printer will be gone for at least a month, then they will I guess pretend to fix it and not test it at all, then send it back. I sent my printer in twice (they didn't fix it the first time), before I got it back from the second time I decided to sell it, and when I did get it back I found that they included two power cables instead of a power cable and a USB cable that's required to run the printer.

"Debt isn't all bad though. Yes, you end up paying more over the years, *but* you also get what you're buying up front. If I take a 15 year mortgage, I end up paying more, but it also lets me have a house for 15 years. If I just tried to save up for a house over 15 years, I'd be without a house for that long, even though I would pay less in the long run (except not actually, because I would have to find other housing).

And debt is not slavery, if you take on a manageable amount (or ever near actual slavery, because nothing can be compared to that besides actual slavery, let's be honest). I have to pay for housing anyway, so taking on a mortgage is possibly no more expensive than rent, besides the downpayment. Taking on some debt for college also isn't awful, so long as you only take a reasonable amount and also go into something that will pay it off.

That isn't to say that people don't take on too much debt, or that lending agencies aren't predatory in pushing it on people. But some debt is fine. And it really does run the economy, both for individuals and businesses."

Scientists are the type of person who do not like saying they’re 100% certain of anything (we’ve been hurt too many times before).

For example, there has never been a recorded instance of someone becoming infected with HIV while properly taking Truvada (to my knowledge). But still, any advertisement for it says that it has a 99.9% chance success rate. 

Though the takeaway here isn’t just to round up and consider a 99.9=100. The takeaway is to realize that it’s very hard to be 100% certain about anything, and to understand that  "

"We had a couple of racoons make their home in our chimney, way down in there next to the flue. It was summer when we moved in and didn't notice anything until the growling started in the middle of the day when someone would sit down near the fireplace. It sounded like a lion. We had a guy come by who said it was at least two raccoons and he had this complicated plan to catch them. One guy would sit on the roof by the chimney with a can of sardines and a cage. The other guy would poke this big long stick up the flue to wake up the racoon and then it was assumed he would just hop out of the chimney, grab a sardine and run into the cage, with his buddy right behind him. For this we'd pay $350.

 I said to my husband, why don't we just light a fire and get him out that way? Then put a chimney cap on? My husband was impressed by all their equipment, so we hired them.  Well those raccoons must have been in a coma because poking with a stick didn't work so they ended up lighting a fire and those racoons shot up out of that chimney like a piece of toast, had no interest in any sardines, climbed down the tree next to the house, ran across the street and one got hit by a car, the other disappeared into the forest preserve. For this we paid $350."

I believe strongly in protecting mentally ill and disabled people, but the protections (in the US at least) have been taken to a point where there are absolutely no consequences for their actions. I have been assaulted, screamed at (for extended periods of time, as in over an hour of non-stop screaming when alone on shift with 12 residents) belittled, sexually harassed, and threatened more times than I can count...and for 💩 wages too!


These are adults who can differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, they have free will. Are they capable of the same level of reasoning and self-control as a healthy or developmentally 'normal' adult? No. That's literally the main reason my job exists. Are they capable of learning and handling appropriate (for their level of functioning) consequences for their actions? Fuck yeah! That's another major reason my job exists. My job is to model and guide them toward appropriate and healthy behaviors because they are sure as hell capable of them when given adequate support.


Not to mention, the effects that their unchecked inappropriate or violent behaviors have on their fellow residents. It's kind of hard to achieve stability or learn self-control when you're surrounded by chaos, and it's difficult to get support from staff when they're busy trying to keep everyone safe (including themselves) and are overworked/short-staffed/underpaid.

"Similarly, only until a couple of years ago, a motorcyclist was required to stay seated and keep both feet on the footpegs whilst riding. That meant it was illegal to stand up (say to look over traffic or on rough roads) or stretch your leg/s out. It technically meant using your feet to reverse your bike was illegal....

It was only changed after a rider was fined for stretching his legs on a motorway, and then got himself a bunch of media attention about how absurd it was - helped by another motorcyclist videoing a motorcycle cop doing exactly the same thing a couple of weeks later, and subsequently the police commissioner admitting he often stretched his legs whilst riding."

We work a lot with birds, usually fledglings that's have fallen out of thier nests. Occasionally they need medical help but usually they just need someone to put them back up. We paint their talons to identify them so we know if theyve fallen out more than once. 

One part of the job is we also have to deal with dead animals on zoo grounds and dispose of them. It's always sad disposing of birds with painted nails because you know you helped them. 

The other day we helped this little guy back in his nest at like 9 am. Then at 11 when we cleaned out the Wolf Yard, he was dead and skinned basically. 

Another time we helped this one bird with a beard (special to them, it wasn't a species thing) back into a tree. He seemed a bit fatigued but generally okay.

"You need to realise that for many people, this is a core part of how they see the world.

Don't think of it just as religion. Think of it as a core system of ideals. Like if the daughter said she wanted to marry a child. It means a lot to them, and to understand you need to liken it first to something you oppose.

Imagine if somebody had vastly different morals. Like a vegan and a proud meat eater and leather wearer. Or somebody that considers something normal, that you might consider abhorrent and affront to all that is good and just, such as bestiality or watching anime dubbed.

If you look at it as two things you don't care about, it's hard to understand. You need to pick things that you feel similarly about. Like the whole ""abortion is murder"". It's not that they see it as just being bad, they LITERALLY see it as being actual murder.

I got as far as planning a wedding.

It's a much longer story but I'll try to hit just the relevant parts. My boyfriend (Jewish from a snobby affluent family) and I (Jewish and from a fairly low income family, yes we exist shut up) had established from day one that we were both interested in getting married in the relatively near future, and understood that our dating was essentially ""interviewing for potential lifemate."" Okay, no problem so far, its practical at our age, makes sure we're not wasting each other's time. 

Come to find out I'm his first girlfriend, first... everything. Kind of weird at 33 years old but okay, whatever. There followed the kindest, most loving, supportive, cared for relationship I've ever experienced. Except for some, uh, issues (think Lily Allen's ""It's Not Fair). Among other things. You know how it can be with rich boys who's parents never taught them to be independent...

But holy shit he was in such a hurry to get married! He was ready to propose to me like 3 months in and I was like ""do not even talk to me about this subject until we are at least a year in."" When we were coming up on a year, he was already planning the wedding. I once again told him to calm down, slow down. I'm superfocused on my career and was our main source of income, and he was all about popping out babies. I'm like how are you going to care for a baby when you can't even keep a job, I have to work and take care of you AND it???

He was so kind, and loving, treated me with so much respect and generosity (easy to be generous when it's your parents money, amirite?). And he wanted to marry me so badly. What was I going to do? He just sort of wore me down, and finally threw the most incredible helicopter ride proposal, so of course I said yes.

Wedding planning was a nightmare. He wanted a big beautiful white wedding like all his rich female cousins had, where he got to be the center of attention (I thought that's usually the bride but okay whatever). What I wanted was immaterial. My mother tries to help us out, but the money she has for us is nowhere near enough for what he wants. Instead of going for something more sedate, he goes to his parents for money, despite me begging him on my knees not to.

The parents are absolutely INCENSED that my lower-income single mother, who raised two absolute hellions on her own, couldn't offer more than $5-10k, and talked tons of shit about her (never mind that she had probably saved my entire life to scrape together that much). Agreed to pay for the wedding, but clearly it would be on THEIR terms. Eventually becomes the father telling my mother ""shut up, you're not paying for this  you get no say,"" says I'm not to have any contact with the wedding venue, insists we choose our venue based on which one can hold the band he wants, etc etc. Just miserable. And this entire time, my sweet, loving fiance who I am still to this day convinced would move heaven and earth if it would put a smile on my face, does NOTHING. Just sits around looking sad. Doesn't defend me, doesn't defend my mom, doesn't consider my wants at all, nothing. Even when I'm begging him and crying that this isn't the way I want our new life to start, please let's do something smaller and intimate. And why?

Because he wants that big $100k wedding. And because his father is the teat from which all his money flows.

I finally put an end to it and called it all off. Unbelievably, I stayed with him another year and a half after that. We had such a good thing going, were such a good team, I was loathe to finally make that break. But ultimately his spineless, cowardly sniveling was just too much. I need a man who stands up for me more than I need a man who takes care of me; I can handle that part on my own just fine thanks."

"Except that doesn't wash for people living on wells, like me.  If Nestle drains the aquifer dry, now I have no water, even for ""basic subsistence.""  And you need a certain amount of water to remain in an aquifer for the pumps in wells to even work.  If you need 10,000 gallons in the aquifer for the pumps to work, and another 10,000 for the people on that aquifer to drink, then you need a MINIMUM of 20,000 gallons to remain in that aquifer. If Nestle drains the aquifer to that level, any sort of drought will deprive me of water, while Nestle keeps pumping their however many gallons a month. When a large portion of rural America is a) on wells, and b) has no municipal water to connect to, the health and the water level of that aquifer becomes all the more important.  Nestle has an unfortunate habit of messing both of those up, even if they are leaving a ""basic subsistence"" amount of water."

"People are retarded.

I remember a case not so long ago here in Chile, where a diabetic woman took an injection in the subway.

Most people didn't care, none confronted her, but... two ladies thought she was a junkie or something, and called the cops.

The cops being just glorified green peasants with weapons like it often happens here in Chile, they just couldn't fucking wrap their heads around her having to need insuline, more like ""yeah yeah insuline sure and the earth is flat, that looks like drugs to me pal!"".

They took her, put her violently against the wall and from the cheer fear and how nervous she was, she puked, and they hit her with one of those weird police sticks in her back.

I believe the cops were put under trial or something, but people are just retarded, like, the fucking thing she used to inject herself with insuline clearly looks like something out of a hospital or something, not *drugs*, I mean how stupid you can be."

It was the kind that sneaks out with absolutely no warning. I went shopping with my adult grandson and was in a long frozen food aisle when the unthinkable happened. When I realized how goddawful it was, I tried to outdistance it by walking really quickly to the next aisle over, but it followed me. My grandson walked up and, laughing hysterically, said in a very loud voice, ""Grandma was that you who gassed the whole store?!"" Everyone within sight, already dealing with the noxious odors, stopped and looked at me, and each and every one of them walked the other way. I put down my groceries and left the store without buying anything. Never went back. I got my vengeance though.

When our hash browns arrived barely cooked on top and watery on bottom we called it quits. Hey, we were just looking for a small diner we could be loyal to and maybe feel welcome. So we switched to the best breakfast venue a small town could have...breakfast served in a pizza restaurant. A pizza chain bought this local restaurant with one proviso....that they continue the former owner's breakfast menu every morning.

"Application of knowledge in various fields, basic knowledge in chemistry and a lot of late nights on reddit/wikipedia digging further into things I find interesting.

But as some other people have stated further down most folklore is based on the understanding of the peoples of the time. The description of what happened to the prisoners is the biggest clue to the nature of the pit in addition to what caused it's formation. The screams as he was lowered in addition to his appearance, graying and white hair strongly indicates the presence of an airborne bleaching agent so a strong gaseous acid or base. Groundwater penetration of water soluble sulfide minerals (or other similar acids) will slowly create underground voids in materials such as limestone which may eventually lead to the creation of a sinkhole. Once exposed to air this slowly forming underground void leads to a process called Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) which speeds up acid production and can dissolve many other minerals usually toxic given the types of geological processes which lead to sulfur bearing rocks. 

Given the curiosity of lowering a prisoner into an underground void, the effects it had on him and descriptions of black winged creatures, half human and half animal clawing out of the pit at night strongly suggest it was a recent formation. So adding the ARD process producing large amounts of acidic substances eating away other possibly toxic minerals and outgassing in large amounts strongly suggests high levels of CO2 production along with other poisonous gasses leading to large scale hallucinations (see Lake Nyos disaster) of what seems like bats taking advantage of the hole. This large scale offgassing would have also kept any acidic offgassing lower down in the sinkhole given the nature of its higher molecular weight but the processes of a strong acid (especially sulfuric acid) reacting with the surrounding rock is a highly exothermic process and either creates a highly acified vapour (think acid rain) aside from other more complex acid structures more easily boiled at lower temperatures then the 337*c needed for pure SO3.

That is the most complicated way for the underground formation under Houska Castle but similar processes occur for volcanic offgassing basically leading to a prisoner being lowered into a hole into an acidic gas being held down by high levels of CO2 production and being very painful death being simultaneously bleached and poisoned. If the sulfuric acid was of sufficient concentration and dissolving a deposit of something like sodium nitrate it could have also possibly created nitric acid which is more easily gasified and even more volatile to organics.

"""The turkey is fresh?""   

""Yes ma'am, they slaughtered every turkey for the entire country, 5 days before thanksgiving.""

If you want a never frozen turkey, you need to find someone who does that shit during that time of year and fork over whatever the cost is for them to break it down for you.  The fact of the matter is, if you're buying a bird in a grocery store, that shit has been frozen a good while.  Deal with it.  99% of the turkeys you've always ate have been frozen.  

People don't seem to have any idea how meat works.  We have a 75 foot meat counter. It's probably the largest in California.  There's almost 10 of us running that thing on any given day.  There's sausage, burgers, ground beef, every cut of beef, marinated tri tips, marinated chicken, plain chicken, stuffed chicken, stuffed pork chops, bacon, every cut of pork, all followed by the best fish selection for a 100 male radius.  Then you have a freezer about 2/3 that size that's filled with less common shit.  Someone will walk in and ask ""Do you have Beef Brains?""   A once in every 6 month request.  

""I do have it actually.""
""REALLLY!?!?""
""Yes, it's right here in the freezer.""
""Oh, you don't keep it fresh?""

"You should never, ever pre-order videogames on faith (i.e. without reading unbiased reviews or playing the game in some capacity). It's not just risking your money, it's actively encouraging toxic business practices in the gaming industry; it becomes a better financial decision for studios to spend their development dollars on cinematic trailers and silly pre-order bonuses instead of actually developing a quality experience. Even if you *know* you're going to buy the game the day it comes out, you should still wait for it to come out, to hold the studio accountable for the quality of their product. 

Also, buy into early access assuming the game will never get another update; if you're not happy with the state of the game *right now*, don't buy it. "

"Legally? It depends on her location and the laws there. In NC this wouldn't legally be considered rape. She initially consented to the sex act and you can't rescind consent and call rape.

Morally? This is fucking rape. Dude hurt her and then wouldn't stop and then threatened further violence. Shit is fucked up. "
"Read it again. It started out consentual. Dude started hurting her and wouldn't listen when she told him so. He was holding her down. She was scared. He threatened to fuck her in the ass until she was bleeding, so she froze up, waiting for him to finish, and hoping he wouldn't follow through on a threat.

That’s so rough....I’m sorry for that 
"Thankfully in retrospect it was kind of a funny situation.   Last August our office got robbed.  We got the guy on security camera, give the footage to the police, yadda yadda yadda.  My boss is out going to get a cup of coffee and she sees the guy just strolling across campus.  So she decides it would be smart to confront the dude.  He takes off. She takes off after him and calls me and says, ""I found that guy I'm chasing him I'm between building x and building y.""          
To which I say, ""I'm pretty sure chasing him is a *bad idea* just tell me which way he's going and I'll call 911.""   
""No no, you call 911 I'm going to keep after him.""      
Uhhhh.....      
So I call 911 from our office phone which connects me to the campus police and I've got my cell up to my other ear.  I know our campus dispatcher because she's also the person I have to talk to every time our alarm breaks (which is all the time).  This is a paraphrase of what happened:        
""911 what's your emergency?""      
""Hey it's AbortRetryImplode again.  So (boss) just found that guy.""  
""The one that robbed you?""    
""Yup.""    
""Okay, is he in the building?""     
""Well, no he's...umm....hey (boss's name) where's he at now?""     
*lots of muffled swearing and a location from my boss*     
""He's between building a and building b.""     
.....
""Aren't you calling me from your office?""     
""Yeah.""     
""That's nowhere between building a and b.""     
""Yeah (boss) is kind of...running after him.""     
""I'm sorry she's what?""     
""She's running after him.""      
""Okay, can you tell her to....not do that?""    
""Umm.... (boss) 911 says to not chase him.""      
*boss stubbornly insisting she's going to follow him*       
Fortunately the guy either wasn't bright or didn't know the campus layout at all because he slowed down right behind the building that the police station is housed in so it ended with me telling her, ""Yeah just send someone out the south door they're out there.""      
Cops gave my boss a talking to and told her to maybe not pursue criminals next time and let them do it.  We never did get our stuff back but it was an interesting end to a week."

Jeffery Dean Morgan for when you can't afford Javier Bardem 
"When I was in Germany for a few weeks, strangers did not appreciate me paying any attention to their dogs. I live in the Pacific Northwest, so I'm used to somewhat cold interactions with people on the street, but that all goes away when there's a good dog. I even got dirty looks for smiling at dogs. I asked my friend over there about it, and she said ""Why would you smile at a dog? That's nonsense. The dog has someone to smile at it, why does it need you?"" Brutal. But it was honestly a good argument. "
"Nah, that forgetfulness is an important part of the husband's happy reaction to finding something. People who don't have that quality notice when they misplace something and often feel panic or frustration until it's located. When they find it, they're relieved but don't really get to experience that enjoyment of rediscovering the thing they lost - they're still getting over the remorse and worry over losing it in the first place. 

Forgetful people lose something and just forget that they ever have it, so they don't experience that panic and frustration. Instead, they randomly stumble over it later and react with excitement. They don't have any of the shame and worry over losing something to dampen the joy of seeing it again. 

This reaction tends to piss off people who aren't forgetful, but who have to deal with someone else's forgetfulness on a daily basis, so a lot of people get this reaction shamed out of them over time. My ex, for example, used to get furious with me over this because he saw it as an indication that I was careless and spoiled. He felt I should be too ashamed of losing something in the first place to be excited about finding it again.  So it's really good to see that OP actually finds this quality attractive in her husband and encourages it. "

X will always predict wrong in this case, so there exists no ""perfect"" program that can always correctly predict if Y will halt.

Letting the TV or YouTube babysit your children so you can get some relaxation time, or because you’re too busy, or even because you’re just stretched too thin is not a good thing. Kids need real human interaction and real human guidance CONSTANTLY. 

The worst kid on my bus is a 3rd grader who gets an iPad slapped in his hand the moment he gets home and spends all night watching gaming YouTubers. The kid is absolutely emotionally unstable, has no friends because he can’t relate to REAL people, and has extreme anger issues. Both of his parents are around, they both work good jobs and have a lot of money, brand new cars, huge and nice house. But no time for their kid and it shows. He has clung onto me because I actually discipline him and even though I’m always having to scold him for his behavior, and even though I have better, more friendly relationships with most of the other kids on the bus, he was the ONE kid to cry on the last day of school because he won’t get to see me all summer.

Parents, please stop fucking up your children."

"I knew a guy who did that with his truck at another friend's party.  He wasn't kicked out, the dude was just a dick to just about everyone he knew.

We see the guy leave and then about 5 minutes later, we see tail lights at the back door slider.  Then we hear the engine rev up and after less than a minute, we could no longer see outside.  Mind you, it had been raining all night.

You didn't even get mad.  You just expected that sort of thing from him.  As long as it wasn't your house, most of the stuff he did ended up being pretty hilarious and the stuff of party legend.

Another time at the same apartment, he stayed awake after everyone had passed out.  This was in the dead of summer.  So before he left, he turned the thermostat to ""heat"" and set it to 80+ degrees.  Then he put a porn video in the VCR and turned the TV up as loud as it went and walked out the door.  The story my friend told me of waking up in a pool of sweat and hearing porn had me in tears.

His biggest downfall though was that he was a pill addict.  Which lead to his death by overdose some years ago.  

But we still talk about his legendary fuckery."

"My first job was like that. I was 16 and even though it was the summer, the labor law wouldn’t let me work past 1030. They would schedule me till 12 anyway. It was a waitressing job and I was new, first job ever, and I wasn’t great at getting my side work done because I was trying to stay on top of my tables. So when my replacement would come in to take over my tables I would finally try to wrap up my side work. They told me I had to clock out. I said that’s illegal and wouldn’t do it.  Sometime shortly after that I was putting the final things together on a plate that had just come up for my table. It was a breakfast place so the cooks would put the plate in the window and we would put butter on the pancakes and pour syrup into those little cups etc. I was about to take it to my table when some customers walk in and my manager asked me to seat them. I said “Yes ma’am, right after I take this to my table” plate in hand. My thought...my table was waiting for 20 minutes for their food, the people at the door were waiting for 20 seconds. She turns to me and gets an attitude “When I tell you to do something you do it!” 

I finished my shift but I walked in the next day and handed in my uniform. "

"I also have a ‘quitting from Staples’ story!  I was in Copy and Print, which led that store in revenue month after month and I had built up relationships with a bunch of local business owners.  One day the store manager comes back from a regional meeting and says we can no longer sit on the bar stool we had next to the computer.  As C&amp;P staff we spent a lot of time at that computer entering orders, designing stuff, image editing, and so on - to do all that standing would’ve been a real pain.  But the manager thought it made us look “lazy” to be seen sitting.  I suddenly realized I’d been working my butt off for this lame, low-paying job and that they would never show me appreciation or treat me like a real person.  Typed up my resignation (standing, of course) and left."

So I’d also assume that you either have no empathy, or you’ve only met nice dogs, if you seriously cannot fathom why a person could possibly develop a distaste for dogs as a result of trauma.  I’d say the two people before me went with the less aggressive assumption, and tried to explain to you why a reasonable person could still hate dogs, assuming you aren’t accounting for non domesticated ones.  You responded with “Ha yeah, happened to me before, no big deal, people should get over it”.  In the same sentence you cited how something horrible must have happened to these dogs to make them this way and how it isn’t really their fault.  Fucking seriously?  "

"Lean manufacturing means you time everything so you never have any inventory. Everything is delivered on time and in perfect quantity to keep the assembly line moving.

The trick is this means you never have massive inventory sitting there for weeks/months which can actually be a lot of money. So if you time everything right those millions of dollars are being actively used and turned into profit at an incredible rate. Or from a different perspective you don't have millions in inventory 'doing nothing'.

The problem is exactly what you think. Disruptions, bad timing, complexity, unforeseen issues, inability to get parts, QA issues, bad parts, etc. can all lead to downtime, which invariably hurts *a lot*."

"I don't own a gun, though I would like to eventually. I guess it's really the same as a lot of things. Take knives/pocket knives for example. Why do people own them? They can be useful, they can help you defend yourself in some situations, people collect them, etc. Despite what the media would have you believe, civilian firearms are quite safe (more people are murdered with blunt objects, ""hands and feet"" than firearms, according to FBI stats). They are a part of our nation's history and heritage, and have served our people well historically. I personally just like firearms, and am planning on joining the military, so I find them interesting. I don't hunt, nor do I think I will be repelling an alien invasion with an AR-15, but they can keep you safe. I absolutely think we need stricter regulation (look at civilian pilots and flying. That's 100x more dangerous than firearms, yet with proper training/regulation we don't have too many problems with drunk flying or terrorism). Also if you look at statistics, nearly ALL gun violence occurs in areas or by people where guns are NOT legal. Inner city gangs get their guns either way (and not ones legally sold in the U.S.) same goes for mentally ill individuals and terrorists....But yeah, if you've never fired a weapon for sport or practice, it is a very fulfilling experience once you get used to it, and guns come with a lot of history and tradition, making them interesting artifacts of the human story, just like any other weapon or tool."

"If someone else spending money on their own furniture gets your blood boiling, you need to do a hard evaluation of your mental state.

You spend 1/3 of your life sitting on your couch, chair, or mattress, and you’ll probably have these items for several decades. It makes sense to want value comfort and design over price. 

By the way, my house is full of 50 year old hand-me-down furniture that I inherited from my parents and grandparents. But I still spent over a grand on my mattress because back problems cost more in the long run. Frugality isn’t about spending as little as possible while disregarding comfort and happiness, it’s about saving for the things you really want and need. And if new furniture and home decorations really make someone happy, then so what? Their life is better and I’m happy for them. "

"Egg facts are my most infuriating facts.

That chicken eggs you buy from a store are not baby chickens. That you are not killing baby chicks by eating grocery store eggs. That there is zero need for factory-style egg farms to have roosters because hens lay eggs regardless of being inseminated. That chickens of opposite genders must fuck in order for there to a fertilized egg ... so if there are no roosters at these farms there is no way your omelette could have been a living animal. That even if they were fertilized the eggs don't have babies inside them unless they have been incubated, which they don't let happen at those facilities anyway.

Chicken eggs are more like the equivalent of a monthly cycle on a daily basis instead of like a daily pregnancy with a viable baby.

"As someone who lives near this site I can provide some local lore and information.

First, rumour has it that there is a lost tribe of sorts who live there, as the area covers almost 27 Square miles the population is estimated to be in the quarter million range. 

Explorers report that there may be multiple tribes and outsiders are either welcomed with open arms or are met with overt hostility and suspicion. 

They supposedly have their own culture and play a sport not unlike soccer. The masters of this sporting activity are known as ""Wolves"". A great arena has been erected in the city for this activity. 

There are ""roads"" which approach the area but anyone entering has reported a confusing and disorienting criss cross of trails.

Local rumour also states that in the past the tribe regularly traded with outsiders. Wool, coal and jewellery were their main offerings.

In recent years some signs of advanced structure building has been reported with signs of mass transportation structures, large civic buildings and areas for the large scale production of wares being spotted over the last several decades."

"So, I'm still not entirely certain what this condition is, but it can be really annoying, and I thought everybody had to deal with it up until I was about 16.

When I sleep, I'll occasionally be woken up by a stabbing pain in one of my eyes. It's very painful, and I can't open my eye without it feeling like it's been scratched badly. This can also happen if I'm woken up without enough sleep, and even putting eye drops into my eyes, opening them slowly, etc., doesn't seem to help.

If I'm able to go back to sleep immediately, it helps loads. My eye's a bit sore the next day, but that's all. If it happens when I'm being woken up, it's really inconvenient, because then I need to walk around with one eye shut for an hour or so until it feels good enough to open properly again.

From what I've read, some other people have said they have this problem, and it might be that I sleep with my eyes partially open, causing the cornea to dry out and stick to my eyelids, where either REM causes them to get scratched or I just wake up and move them normally. However, lubricating eye drops don't seem to help at all, which means this might not be the case (or maybe mine is really bad).

It only happens once or twice a month, and it's never affected my vision in the long term (although things might be blurry (or even clearer!) out of that eye for the rest of the day).

Anyway, I found out it wasn't normal when I was talking with some friends in high school about it, and how it was really inconvenient. I mentioned that it was unrealistic that people in movies just opened their eyes from the dead of sleep without being in pain. They just looked at me like I was crazy, and explained that it's absolutely not normal.

TL;DR: Dry eyes?"

"Astronomer here! When a dying star explodes in a supernova explosion it sends out a giant shockwave. This will rip through any material that was around the star already before its death, often expelled by said star before it died, and this interaction gives off radio waves.

Fun stuff! :D"

"Straight chick-It’s not that you’re being excluded. Do you feel excluded at someone else’s birthday party? Graduation? Wedding? Pride is just like these other celebrations. Pride is celebrating freedom. Love. People being able to be who they are. Sometimes I get a feeling like it’s not my place to be there, but that’s not true. I’m there to celebrate and as a show of support for the LGBTQI community-“I stand with you.” “I’m proud of you.” “I’m happy you’re here.” “I love you.” It feels awkward for the same reasons you feel awkward visiting someone in the hospital-you can’t make everything better yourself, but you wish you could. You hope you’re there for the right reasons-to support the patient and be and get what they need, not to make yourself feel better-but odds are, if you’re thinking these things and asking these questions-and most importantly: listening to the person you’re there for, you’re just fine. You just push that feeling aside, or at the very least, don’t push it on the person you’re there to support, and do what you came to do: celebrate at Pride, or support in the hospital.

I hope this helps. :)"

We used to pick everyone one up in one car (we'd take turns) and then drive to the theater. Without fail, let's call her Patricia, would always be late. We tried everything. Texts, calls, day and hour before reminders, none of it left an impact on her. 

Till it was my turn and I said ""I'll be leaving your front door at X o'clock. If you're not there we're not going to be late for the move. Hope you're ready!"" She even got a friendly text when we arrived, and we got there early. X o'clock came and I pulled of. Ten minutes later on the highway she texts back ""Where'd you go?!?!"" No one was allowed to text her till after the movie. When they did it was a lot of, ""We missed you! Next time just be outside when we're ready.""

So the next girl in line for driving does this to and she pulled the same. After that second week she stopped replying to our texts about going to the movies at all.

"One thing I love about the UK is that the law around pints of beer is very, very strict. If you order a pint you get an honest-to-God 20oz (568ml) Imperial pint. You can ask for a half pint and some weird places do 2/3 pints but if you explicitly ask for a pint, that's exactly what you'll get. I've heard in many parts of the world a pint can be anything from a 16oz American pint, a half-litre or another random smaller measure which just won't do.

Football's not coming home, our politicians are a bunch of pillocks and our economy might be about to hit the fan in a spectacular fashion but at the end of the day, our pints are still held sacred as they should be and as long as we can go into the pub, order a pint and get precisely that all is still ultimately well."

"I was laid off with a bunch of other tech dudes in the early 2000's. I was burned out with the culture and in all honesty probably needed to grieve properly over 9/11. Or at least come to terms with it.

I got a rad severance - 6 months plus all my PTO at full rate. I moved in to a cheap apartment, started collecting unemployment, and spent my afternoons day drinking at hip brewpubs.

I stumbled into a guy with a screenpress and some giant oversized ironing type machine. He'd given a shot at a t-shirt business and then gave up. I bought them for just a couple hundred each.

I was a mediocre rave/club DJ at the time and had a bunch of connections with that scene. I put the word out and met up with some pretty talented graffiti artists. One of the bigger name local promoters offered to let me set up a table at his weekly club night.

I started with a couple 10 packs of plain white t-shirts, screwed up a couple shirts, got a couple right and by the last ones they were looking pretty good. So, after two lousy 10 packs of shirts, my stupid drunk ass clearly knew all there was to placing images onto clothing. Clearly.

We came up with a hamdful of honestly pretty cool graphics that had nothing to do with each other. I found a bulk batch of blank shirts. I spent the money on some good Hanes ones or something, I didn't want to sell flimsy shirts. I ordered different sizes but completely forgot to order ladies baby doll type t-shirts. I also ordered long sleeve t's even though no one in my target market really wore long sleeves, but I did and I liked them so I figured I'd make the market like them.

We printed a shitload of graphics onto shirts, some were a little dodgy, most were okay. They all had the same half dozen or so graphics. Just random ""cool looking"" graffiti images with graffiti looking characters that looked kinda cool but had no real rhyme or reason to current events nor did they nod to the history of the culture.

A few of the bigger name DJs and promoters bought one, out of respect and to try and get things started but the trend never really took off.

The statement I kept hearing from potential customers was ""whoa you got a screen press kit??! Dude could you make me a t-shirt with this cool shit I drew, I'd pay you for it""

No I can't do that potential customer. I already burned through my blanks.

***
So what would I do differently?

Practice harder on more diverse fabrics. Practice on fabrics not garments. I fucked up more than a few nice pullover hoodys for example as I learned that hoodys are way different from t-shirts.

Analyze my target market better. Figure out what they're interested in.

Use less source material up front during launch.

Hype the product better prior to launch.

Have a god damn company name that sounds cool and makes sense.

Stricter artist/contributor/contractor controls. I let myself get pressured into some dumb decisions by gaslighting graffiti guys and I let a bunch of stupid shit get through the non-existent approval process. The pictures were fine; we should have beta tested them though.

Slightly less democratic business model. I invested the most money. No disrespect to the artists but all they did was get high and draw cool pictures; they were gonna do that with or without me.  I'm not saying hoard all the profits. I'm just saying, all they did was get high and draw cool pictures; I should have kept them out of the conversations about inventory.

Most importantly I should have been ready to change my business model. My potential customers also got high and drew cool pictures just like my company's artists did. They wanted their own shit on a t-shirt not someone else's. I wasn't able to provide this.

I ended up selling the screen press and iron to someone who ended up doing exactly. Fucker had a web form and everything.

"Fun fact: banana flavor is actually based on a kind of banana called the Gros Michel banana, which was the kind of banana that Americans ate until the 1950s, and is a very sweet banana. During the 50s a banana plague wiped out almost all of the Gros Michel crop and suppliers couldn't meet demand. They substituted with the Cavendish, and that ended up becoming the default banana we still eat today. Gros Michels are still around, they just aren't popular in Western countries anymore. But the banana flavoring is still Gros Michel flavor, because it's actually sweet and at this point everyone expects the two to be totally different.

"My biological father is 50% native American (Inuit). This makes me 1/4 native. He never registered me with his tribe though and only tribal members can register another tribal member.

He ran away when I was 18 months and I didn't hear from him again until my 18th birthday. I was out when he called and when I called back he was in jail and the lady answering the phone said ""he doesn't have a son"" .. which was a bit of a punch to the gut.

My mom remarried when I was four. She married Mel. Mel was giant, well over six foot with broad shoulders and a deep laugh. He loved hoisting me on his shoulders and I loved being carried. Mel was a long haul trucker with his own big rig. Mel was also had his pilots license to fly light aircraft and helicopters and had his own airplane. Mel was also a former amateur race car driver. So to five year old me, Mel was basically a super hero.

Mel died when I was five, in a plane crash. But that one year I was exposed to Mel left a deep and lasting impact on me. I yearned to be a father for years and now that I am one I do everything to emulate the goodness I saw in him, and to be a hero to my own sons.

I began using Mel's name as my own in first grade and by 13 I made it official by getting a legal name change.

"At the last company I worked for the tree climber said to me fairly calmly on the comm ""I think a hydraulic hose just blew.""  I look over and the elbow of the boom is obscured by a cloud of hot oil.  The line that blew was the pitch control on the upper boom, so he couldn't move that.  He managed to park the lower boom while I ran to grab tools, the second I saw that cloud I just started moving.  Grabbed a few adjustable crescents, a driver and a channel lock, as well as whatever JIC or NPTF fittings were immediately handy, threw them in my pocket and sprinted back to the truck.  The lower boom was parked but the upper boom was straight up in the air, I'm sure there are safety mechanisms to prevent it from crashing down but as far as I was concerned he had maybe minutes before it fell like a tree.  I don't know if you've ever climbed the back of a chip box truck while it's covered in hot oil raining down into your face, but suffice to say it's a little difficult.  I could barely reach it without climbing out on the boom.  I managed to kink it off, pull the broken fitting, and jimmy rig the hose back on with the wrong adapters.  From beginning to end felt like an hour but it was probably under two minutes.  Every orifice and pore on my face was thick with oil; sometimes when you're straining really hard and you need that extra oomph you grit your teeth, it filled my mouth and coated every nook and cavity.  It was interesting."

We got married in a barn, and about 1/4 way through the evening he awkwardly stands in the middle of the dance floor til I bumped into him and asked if he could fly the drone indoors. I looked at him and said “you’re fucking kidding right?” And asked him to stop with the drone altogether. At about 830 he starts packing up and asked me if it was ok to leave (we paid for him til 10) and again “you fucking kidding?” 

Get the video back and it’s 90% drone footage. "

"&gt; Porn companies test their performers consistently for STDs and such.

Yes they do! ...But that's not a legal requirement, that's an industry standard practice endorsed by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation.

As far as I can tell (with some very surface-level Googling), the only legal requirement in the US is that Porn producers verify that all models are 18+ and they keep records of that verification, though I can't find out how long they have to keep them for.

As far as a ""clean and safe environment"", there's no such regulation I can find, certainly not federal. Let me know if you can dig up something substantive.

(As a side note, every AMA I've ever read from people in the industry describes an environment with SO much drugs. But that's Hollywood for you.)

"I worked with a woman who went through that.

When I started at the company she was just turning 30. She was part Asian, part Black, part Portuguese and part French. It was startling how pretty she was. But she had always been that pretty, in addition to thin. She was unbelievably rude, condescending and dismissive, because it never had any consequences for her - people would want her company. She thought every opinion she held was right, and was genuinely confused and pissed off if you disagreed with her. She had a long line of guys who would swing by her desk to flirt with her, and she was used to that level of attention her entire life. Any straight man who didn't drool in her presence she just couldn't get along with - which about sums up my working relationship with her.

But, at around this time her looks started to fade, as it happens when we all get older. One year her crisis was that she had to watch what she ate because she started gaining weight. The next year it was that she had to join the gym because watching her diet was no longer enough to be a size 3. This was in addition to the general signs of ageing; droopy skin, wrinkles, etc.

Most of the guys stopped coming by her desk, but one or two still did our of genuine friendship. We started getting new fresh 26 year old women hired at the company, and they seemed to attract most of the attention now. She stopped getting her way in meetings, people stopped fawning over her. 

I watched (with a little malice, if I'm honest, she was really mean to me) as she just became like every other woman in the office, still generally attractive, but people didn't put up with her shit.

She actually became a nicer person. She started to develop a bit of a playful personality to regain some of that attention back. She would actually listen to people, and enquire about their lives now. She would compliment other people and not dismiss anyone under a 7/10 attractiveness.

A lot of people didn't want to open up to her, and I absolutely respect that considering how she treated people before. Particularly the middle aged crowd, the women feeling spurned by her shitty comments, and the men not appreciating being flirted with when she wanted something.

But I do give her credit for changing and not just becoming bitter."

He was a war monger , he attacked tribes after making a peace treaty .. he married a 6 yr old Aisha and consummated the marriage when she was 9.  he made his adopted son Zaid  divorce his wife after getting smitten by her beauty so that he can marry her and then declared adoption as illegal to avoid incest .. he was caught fucking his slave Maria by his wife and then declared that allah told him it’s fine to have sex with his right hand possessions.

In the battle of khyabar, he killed every male member of the tribe and allowed his troops to divide the females as sex slaves and then he marry and immediately consummated with safiyah just few hours after killing her father and husband

"When I was in HS, my dad had a new employee over for a bbq dinner. We lived in nice suburban/rural area - there were housing plans *near* our home, but our home wasn't part of them, it had been built by my grandfather, just before he passed long before I was born. So it had a nice back side patio, and a pool my father had installed. So we were all sitting on the deck, at a picnic table. 



My dad was cooking on the BBQ, and had been sitting next to the new hire, so the new hire and his dog were facing the rear door to my house alone, and my mom and I were on the other side of the table. Suddenly the dog looks at the rear sliding door to my house and lets out a *growl* - my mother and I look at the dog and the new hire, call him Andy, Andy says ""linuxhanja mom, don't move, just act normal... is there anyone else home?"" under his breath. He's wearing sunglasses, and he's looking at the sliding glass door out of the corner of his eyes. ""I'm going to get up in a minute and go to my car, I have a car phone (yes, this was long ago) and I'm going to call the police."" 




my mother asks him to describe the man, and he pretty  much says it looks like linuxhanja's father, but about 1 ft shorter, and wearing an old style baseball cap. My mother laughs at this and says that sounds just like my grandfather, while turning around to look. Andy says the guy just vanished as my mother turned around.... And goes on to tell him lots of people have thought my father was home and came to see him when he wasn't, etc, and its just my grandfather's ghost. (keep in mind this was our first meeting with Andy, and my father, to this day has *never* spoken about his father, even to me, I've learned 100% about him from my relatives because my father was away at Uni when he died in an accident and my father to this day can't bring himself to talk about it. Andy was also kind of nervous - like new hire nerves - so doing this for a ""funny"" would make 0 sense...  



Anyway, house was checked cause my Dad didn't like that, and my dad doesn't believe in that kind of shit, etc. But, at that moment I recalled several older memories from when I was younger - once I was late to a sports match, and my dad  was supposed to come home from work and take me and he was late. While my mother was helping me put on my uniform, I saw my dad walk up the sidewalk. But he wasn't home. I was absolutely sure I saw him and ran outside, but he wasn't there. came about 10 minutes later. And when I was even younger I was playing out by our shed, and a neighbor came over and yelled at my mom, ""stop lying, I need to talk to linuxhanja's dad, and I just ****ing saw him walking up your front sidewalk into the house!"" I remember my mom crying and saying he really wasn't there and the neighbor puffed off. Anyway. Those were all at daytime. a few things happened around my house later when i was older and back from uni, but that was at night, lol."

Turn that into a double while keeping the four ounces of OJ and it probably still drinks pretty easy since those are both sweet and lower in alcohol than a spirit like vodka, gin, or whiskey.  That's assuming they are using regular schnapps and not the high test stuff which is more in line with flavored vodka."

"I've cut my father from my life on 3 separate occasions.

First time was right after my mom died (he and my mom were divorced because he thought it was more important to go out drinking and not hold down a job while my mom worked a full time job while battling cancer), he basically calls me and tries to turn my against my brother by telling me that he might try to not give me my fair share of the inheritance.  I cut him off for a good year after that, but eventually forgave him due to guilt.

Second time was due to him killing my mom's dog (who she thought the world of) that he was entrusted with after begging the family to let him have it.  Well one day he calls me drunk at a bar and as a matter of a fact tells me my mom's dog died because it fell off his motorcycle while he was going 75 down the interstate with it strapped to the back (who the fuck puts a dog on the back of a motorcycle).  I was furious over this as this dog was basically a daughter to my mom.  I cut him off for a good year after that, and was once again guilted into forgiving him and letting him back into my life when he decided to pay me a visit at my in-laws during Christmas. 

Third time was the final straw for me, I get a call from my brother telling me that he was arrested because he apparently got jealous that his girlfriend was getting back with her boyfriend, and went over to her house stark naked and threatened her with a loaded pistol.   He has since been released from prison and all charges have been dropped (I'm guessing she decided not to press charges for some reason).  I haven't spoken to him since.

I honestly still feel guilty about cutting him out of my life even after all of this, but I don't think I can put up with that kind of negativity in my life any longer."

Most people with color blindess have red and green color receptors that react at wavelengths too close together, making it hard to tell red and green apart.

My cones do the opposite - I can see *very* slightly infrared compared to most people (occasionally, I can see the light at the end of remotes!) However, I have some issues where yellows are not very vibrant - I have the hardest time seeing yellow highlighter on white paper, which would be much more useful than the tiny infrared glimpses imo."

Alligators would certainly be an issue, but there's just no way to even get there or move around once you did (in any meaningful way).

"Unfortunately, I doubt Beyul actually exists.  It is 1000's of years of folklore/gospel/religion doctrine that was likely intended to persuade people to follow the religion of Buddhism.  And while Buddhism has no gods, it can still be benefit from followers (ie. tithe/donations; commonality/unity; etc).

I find it very similar to how Christianity promotes ""heaven"" as being a place where only good followers go.  Or similar places in other cultures/religions that promote good behaviour/worship.

I am not Buddhist myself, but it has some really interesting ideas that promote ""Beyul within ourselves"" (ie. peaceful; stress-free; openness).  I practice Buddhist meditation which is taught across the world in various venues (usually for free; check out https://shambhala.org/).  Thus, through meditation, you'll reach nirvana and bring the reality of Beyul to the world you live in.

"Cancer drugs can be very toxic and dangerous. When we test them in a group of humans for the first time, we simply assess whether or not each patient’s toxic response is too toxic or not too toxic (binary outcome). But there are hundreds of types of toxicities that could occur, and each toxicity has a range of levels of severity. Simplifying a complex outcome like this ignores a lot of useful information. I developed a more refined way to assess a patient toxicity, and it turns out that using more patient toxicity information does a better job at finding the best, safe dose to give to people"

"I was in a similar situation. Born into Catholicism, educated in it for 12 years at Catholic Schools. Church twice a week.

It's funny how priests and teachers explain the answers (or lack thereof) to the questions they start getting from students around the age of 10-12.

Everything is a ""mystery"" that can surely only be solved by deep faith and questioning. Questions with no answer are key to the development of faith, they say.

Eventually you either accept that it doesn't make sense and trust in your faith to give you strength (which is fine, for that matter); or you realize it doesn't make sense and choose to seek truth in other ways.

I myself never felt a connection with God so I went down the latter path. Religion at it's core relies on a personal relationship with God and I never in 18 years experienced anything that eased my doubt.

I don't judge others for their beliefs. I know a lot of people who are steadfast in their religion and that's great for them. If it is giving them happiness and peace of mind then who am I to say anything?

I just want everyone to not be assholes to those who don't agree and for the love of all that is holy stop politicising religion and killing people over it."

It depends. I didn't do the degree to get a job. I did the degree because (when I started at least) I wanted to continue learning/continue the work started in my MA (*edit*: and my PhD was paid for through fellowships/scholarships). It's a degree technically in theatre studies and performing arts, but also could've just as easily been in English lit. What would you do with a degree in English lit or theatre? Some end up in academia (not for me), or teaching (did for a while). Publishing, editing, journalism, youtube vlogger, etc... it's not what the degree is in so much as the demonstrated ability to work hard and learn. I can't be an engineer or a doctor, but many other fields are wide open. Friends I went to school with ended up in all sorts of places. One works as management at Starbucks. A few others went off and did post-docs and then took up teaching positions. One works in a communications department. One works in a hospital doing admin work. A couple work in theatres (one's a dramaturge, the other is a playwright).

But if I wanted a job that was specific to my thesis/degree: teaching, working in theatre, professional play seer/reader."

For me after dealing with depression for around 5 years I've always found video games to help. Because those games (especially games with a plot like fallout that are focused on your character only) really help you feel meaningful. In no way am I saying you're meaningless because trust me you aren't. But games like that really make you numb to anything going on around you and help boost confidence in a way.

I've learned some fun techniques from it too, so unless it's obsessive or guving you unrealistic expectations from your sex life (vs. actors who have full makeup, an editing team and are paid to be enthusiastic about sex acts that not everyone enjoys) then I really don't see it being an issue.

"I had sex one morning with my partner while I was 24 weeks pregnant and afterwards started getting very painful cramps every few minutes. I call my dad who works IT at a hospital and he tells me to get my ass to the ER, he'll get the paperwork started and whatnot so I can be seen ASAP. Sure enough I'd gone into early labor. They gave me medicine to stop it and I was put on bed rest. I had a OB/GYN appointment a few days later and had to remind my doctor at the end that the ER docs had requested I get an ultrasound. So I get the ultrasound and the doctor there turns to me and says ""uhhhh...you're seeing a doctor right after this correct?"" I told her no, I'd already had my appointment. She tells me ""ok, stay here a minute"" and walks out. She comes back in and tells me to head right over to the OB Ward at the connected hospital, the doctors are already waiting for me. I was in early labor again and dialated. Our town is somewhat small, we don't have an NICU here if I gave birth so I had to be airlifted across the state to a hospital that did. Anybody here not like airplanes? Try doing it with a catheter, through turbulence, while your unborn child keeps kicking at the catheter and the meds the doctors gave you turn your hands funny shades of yellow and blue. The doctors across the state were able to stop labor but it was a week before I could go home and I was on bed rest for the next two months. When I first got to the hospital across state they were telling me great things like if I gave birth right then the chances of my child having brain damage was 33% but if they could keep her in for at least another week it'd only be 25%. Fun times. "

"I'm on the fence at the moment. I own a house and my fiancee lives with me. We're planning on moving to a bigger place and getting married in the next year.

Her mom is kind of an idiot and cannot handle money at all. She's at a low point right now and can't get a better job (used to work in medical billing for good money, now works at a gas station) because she refuses to stop smoking pot and keeps pissing dirty, among other bad habits.

Anyway, we've been saving for a down payment for a new house and my fiancee keeps giving her mom money, the last payment to the tune of $1500. She owes her mom money from like 8 years ago when she started her degree, and she's been paying that back at a reasonable rate of like $250/mo and it's down to the last $2000. Unfortunately, this is the only thing keeping her mom's head above water right now and it's about to run out.

So the dilemma is that my fiancee's empathy for her mother's poor choices is seriously hampering our ability to purchase the house we want, and will likely continue to be a financial drain as far as I can see into the future. I'm afraid she's just going to keep giving her money and racking up a reverse tab, and I know we'll never see it back.

I didn't work hard to put myself through school to support her mom; that was supposed to be for *me* and for *us* and for our future kids. So now I'm having serious doubts about the relationship and it really sucks; we've been together for 7 years. The worst part is that she's steadfast about supporting her mother and does it without consulting me, even though half of that savings account is my money. I don't know what to do."

It didn’t used to be there. When I was younger, maybe 7 at most, I went with my mom, my friend, his sister, and their mom. It was a pretty dead night so we were each doing a different combo, me and my friend, us with our moms, etc. Then a big, loud lady comes over and starts yelling how we’re hogging the machine and there’s people waiting (it was only her, and like I said, pretty dead night, plenty of other things to do). She even said “I’ll drag that whore out of the booth if I have to” referring to my friends 13 year old sister. So my mom, not one to back down, and one for being petty, said back “well there’s no sign so we’ll sit here as long as we want”. The lady said she’d fight my mom in the parking lot too, my mom who’s tough but is definitely a proper, nice, not a “fight in a Chuck E. Cheese parking lot” kind of lady lol, but she replied “fine bring it” and then the lady scurried away. Anyways yeah, next time we went the sign was there.

"Big box PC games. They were a little bit larger than a ream of printer paper, but there was so much room for artwork showcasing the game outside and inside the box, not to mention a thick manual or two and extra artwork that came inside. I think it was a holdover for when software shipped on 5.25-8"" floppy disks.

Over time, more games came out on optical disks, which meant that there was more than enough space to store a digital ""on-line"" manual. As a consequence, boxes shrank, and those full physical manuals became booklets, which later became basic instruction cards. And now even those are being phased out over digital downloads.

"I used to work out at an all women's gym. The only man there regularly was the owner's husband, who was a massive bodybuilder-type dude who instructed some of the weightlifting classes. The gym was in a strip mall, and the guy who moved into the offices next to it didn't like the music that was played during classes. He started low-key bothering women as they showed up/left for class (think mild catcalling), which escalated into outright threats and yelling. One day he came into the lobby of the gym and started screaming at the receptionist, and when the owner came out he started calling her names and threatening her, all sorts of nasty stuff. The fun part is that this guy didn't know about the owner's husband, since he'd never seen him before. Owners husband happened to be there that day, so he came out to the lobby and just said ""is there a problem here?""

"I worked with a guy who seemed nice enough at the start. I was a cashier at a grocery store and he was the person who watched self-checkouts and organized breaks. I gave him my number because he seemed decent and I was new and didnt have any friends at work. He would constantly ask me to hang out or go on dates with him after I told him I wasn't interested in that. Once he finally got the message that I didnt want to date him, he began bombarding me with messages about how he was suicidal to guilt me into going on a date with him.

One day I was cashiering and had to use the restroom.  So I told him I was closing down to go. He told me I couldn't go unless I said ""Please"". I told him no, and went. I was miffed. Then I went to the manager and told him about the problems this kid was causing. 

This is not the first time he harassed the girls he worked with. He caused one to quit already. My manager suspended him for his conduct, thankfully. But that wasn't the end.

I was working until close (midnight) and I am the only cashier and the only person in the front of the store. He comes walking in (after he quit) a few minutes to midnight to use the bathroom and then leaves. When my shift is over, I walk outside and see his car in the parking lot. I ask the manager to walk me to my car and I haven't seen the guy since."

As soon as he came out with his creepy line, my wife looked over at me, and said to the guy ""you know, I really don't recommend talking to random women that way, especially when their husbands are sitting five feet away like mine is"", and pointed at me.  The guy changed gears real fast, and walked over to apologise, promising it would never happen again.  I told him it damn well better not, and that he should probably learn to be more respectful to women, since respect will get you much further than being a disgusting asshole.  Then I told him I'd recommend getting his coffee and getting the hell out of there.  He complied.  It's funny, because that guy was a lot bigger than me too.  I don't know if he was scared of me, or just had a lot more respect for men than for women, but my wife never had any more issues with him following that incident. "

I worked at Walmart as a cashier for a few years, and was on my way out to become an IT tech. This was when that whole price matching thing was in full swing, and there were people that were fucking *serious* about that shit.

Two days before I was done, this lady who was notorious for collecting *literal binders* full of coupons and filling a cart full of price-matched or discounted items, and ruining everyone’s day by essentially shutting down a register just for her. She would price match *so many* items that customer service managers (CSM’s) had to do multiple overrides on the register.

By this time, all these crazy price matching types were really starting to annoy everyone, because of people like this hold up the line practically indefinitely, argue *vehemently* over any coupon or price match that is deemed invalid, and are generally insane.

Cut to the CSM on duty, who was herself notorious for her way of being “nice” (read: patronizing and condescending), and new exactly who I was dealing with. They bickered, threatened, and bitched at each other for a good 45 MINUTES, over my shoulder, as I scanned each and every single item that this lady had, which either had a corresponding coupon, price match, or fucking BOTH.

I got through it, and after this lady left my register, I told the CSM that I was done. I walked back to the manager’s office, told *her* I was done.

I left, and haven’t looked back.

In employment law, constructive dismissal, also called constructive discharge or constructive termination, occurs when an employee resigns as a result of the employer creating a hostile work environment. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination.

Still ended up spending a lot of money to get the house ready, first time ever going above my credit card limit. Everything else could wait until we found something we really liked and could pay for it outright. It took us almost 2 years before buying something for the living room. The lack of furniture did make painting the rooms easier."

"Alien to other cultures, yes.

Insane, probably not.

Good investment, definitely not.


Why I say that it is not insane, is because that's how the culture of 1.3 billion ppl have been for years. The use and throw culture of the western world is not the norm here and so is living the life in debts. Everything from food to clothes to house or vehicles is conserved and used to its fullest possible extent. There are hardly any wastage when it comes to the expenses of an average family in India. Cars don't get sold off after the loan period or warranty period is finished. Houses are built by saved up cash and is passed on for generations. Two families in a house is not uncommon. Healthcare is dirt cheap or free, so that saves up quite a lot of money. Vacations are very minimal and never expensive. As another person mentioned, education is very cheap too and almost always paid for by the parents in cash. Using cash instead of loans saves a lot of money. A combined annual interest of 7-10% accrued over all expenses like mortgages, car loans, student loans, credit cards etc, does add up in the western world, and if those are saved over a period of 25 yrs before a child has to be married off, it can be a substantial amount. 
 So a wedding is often the one thing that parents have an opportunity to spend on their kids and also meet everyone on their family and celebrate. So it is extraordinarily expensive.

So, tldr, every culture has their priorities and save money up from what they can to spend on other priorities."

"No way you can afford $342k on a $60k salary.  

I mean, just take the standard mortgage, 30yr, fixed rate.  And say you get it at 4.5% (because it's your first home, you don't have 20 years of credit history, and you're probably not getting the 3.9 offer).  Average property tax in US is about 1.2% (your mileage will vary greatly here, can be over 7.42% in Hartford CT or 1.1% in Greenwich, CT etc, generally the pricier the town, the lower the tax).  Then let's say you pay about $1,500 in homeowner's insurance.  And say you don't have the $70,000 in cash to put down (because who the fuck has that?) so you do an FHA loan or something and only put down 3.5% (so now you only need $12,000 cash to put down on the offer, much more reasonable).  Average PMI for that is probably about 0.75%.  

OK, this is a very typical first-time package.

And the monthly nut is going to be $1,847.96 before fees.  Just round it up to about $1,900 because there's probably some kind of fees rolled in there (closing costs like origination fees, title searches, all that shit).

So that's a much better realistic estimate.

Now, let's look at the salary again. Actual mortgage lenders tend to use the 28/36 rule--which makes it a bit easy.  They just roughly say that 28% of your gross income can go to housing and 36% can go to total debt service (student loans, credit cards, mortgages, etc).

So that's $16,800 per year towards the house and $21,600 per year towards all debts (or as long as you owe $4,800 per year or less towards student loans, credit cards, etc. you can afford up to $16,800 per year on the house).  So, assuming your debts don't cost you more than $400 per month, and you make $60,000 gross, the max monthly nut you should be looking at is $1,400.  The $342k house is $500/mo north of that.  Probably not a good idea.  

$280,000 is probably your actual reach price.  It won't be too comfortable.  But that's pretty close to 3x salary.  You'd probably be happier at $240,000 paying closer to $1,250 per month.  And if you're in a high tax town and a high tax state, you're going to have to go even lower.  To really be comfortable, you probably want to pay less.

This is, of course, assuming there is no HOA and associate HOA fees, which can be hundreds per month...

The thing is, the wealthier you are, the easier you can afford a higher percentage.  Flat fixed prices like gasoline and lots of foods and health insurance premiums and other stuff take up a proportionately smaller percentage of your overall salary as your income increases.  For someone making $240k per year, dropping $10,000 per month on a home might be easy because they still have $4,000 per month to live on or whatever.  It's going to be tight to pay all your bills and eat and save if after your home you only have $400 per week or so left over, especially if $400 of it has to go to student loans and another $400 to a car.  Now you're down to $30 per day for food, utilities, clothing, entertainment, savings, and misc. expenses.  Do-able maybe.  Until you need a root canal or a new roof or something.  Then you're fucked."

By the time I was in my teens, their abuse and lack of support caused me to sort of retreat into my own mind. I developed a terrible stutter that I had for many years, when I used to be unusually articulate for a child. I stopped drawing and painting, because I get PTSD symptoms if I so much as look at art supplies. I stopped writing, too, and reading... I often wonder what my life would be like if my family and teachers and friends had been supportive and loving. And then I feel guilty for thinking that way, because it sounds like I'm victimizing myself."

"Insanity if you ask me. Grew up JW, had to have major spinal surgery at 13. Mom decided against blood transfusion but I received blood fractions and was on some medication to increase my red blood cells prior to surgery. Here it is nearly 20 years later and I'm still pissed off about it. I could have very easily died in the OR.

Oddly enough, I'm not so mad that my mother did this because of her beliefs, but more that no one ABSOLUTELY no one - not the elders advising her, not her, not my doctors, asked me personally what I wanted. EXCEPT my surgeon riiiight as he was putting on the mask for anesthesia.  He leaned over and asked me if I was absolutely sure I didn't want a blood transfusion. Of course I said no because I was scared and confused being put out but the implication of that question at the last minute has stayed with me all these years.

I also had a recent conversation with my aunt about this. She and my uncle were opposed to my mom's decision the entire time (I had no idea) and were ready to kidnap me and kick my mom's ass (lol and seriously) to prevent her from making a stupid decision if it came down to it. Luckily things went well and I didn't need a transfusion, but what a shit show.

My daughter had to have open heart surgery at 4 months old and of course the question of blood came up (I'm not a JW so it wasn't even an issue for me). Naturally my mother was with me at the Dr. office when this question was asked and I ignored the shit out of her and said 'absolutely yes. if she needs blood goddamnit she will get it if i have to open up my jugular myself'. My daughter was in serious trouble and was barely hanging on (VSD, trouble eating and gaining weight, all sorts of issues). I mean come on, she was so damn tiny and didn't have blood to spare. My daughter ended up having 4 transfusions. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me mad lol. No one in their right mind considers placing their child in jeopardy like that, which is why I call the whole thing insanity.

My daughter is absolutely fine and healthy now BTW. Just turned 4 this past Saturday."

"It was a very windy, snowy morning and I was driving my two little girls to daycare before work.  Got to an intersection, and I was turning left, so had to wait at the red light for a green left turn arrow.  Light changed from red to a green arrow, I hit the gas but my tires slipped in the snow/didn't get traction, and the engine did a weird sluggish pause/hiccup as well.  In fact i thought my car died for a second.  

A semi-truck then BARRELED across the intersection in front of me at full speed, not stopping at their red light.  We would've been pulverized.  T-boned by a semi at full speed in an SUV doesn't end well.  I was stunned, started shaking even, and felt like i was going to throw up.

I looked around to understand why that truck did that.  Turns out the snow was blowing into the streetlights and covering up the red/yellow/green completely.  So the truck just - blew on through the intersection and almost killed us.

Thank you heavens for smiling upon me and my girls.

But wait, there's more.

So, I make my left turn (looking carefully as can be) and drive down that street and drop off my girls at daycare.  I now proceed out of the daycare lot and back on the road I earlier turned left onto - now i'm turning right to go back the way I came.  I have a green light and on most days, I would've just turned right.  But as I'd just flirted with death by semi-truck, I stop turning onto the road and look left and ZOOOOOM.  Another semi-truck blasts through that intersection, through a red light, and again would've turned me into bits on the road.

Thank you heavens x 2, I am not worthy, but am very thankful.

Changes made and resubmitted for consideration. Again, thanks for the changes, but Rs won't sign until another set of things get changed. Wash, rinse, repeat till it turned into the nearly toothless, gutted attempt at an improvement that only worked a bit in states that supported what was left. Virtually all R states did whatever they could to strangle what was left, then having made it as inconvenient as possible, blamed it all on Obama. Shoulda just made a single payer plan, but the Rs are even more horrified of that on behalf of their donors."

"When I was 17 and had my first foray into college I took a community college English Composition course.

We had to write a persuasive paper about something we found interesting. I wrote a paper about quantum physics and the way that our perceptions possibly affected our view and experience of reality by discussing some ""miracles"" in the Bible and offering a alternative explanation. The paper could be opinion and required no sources (it was our first paper due).

I received a zero on the paper. When she handed it to me she made a big display of it and told the class that I plagiarized and there was zero tolerance for that. I was on the verge of tears and went up to her as she sat down at her desk and quietly asked why she said I plagiarized. She said she had no doubt I had stolen the paper from somewhere online. I asked her ""Why? Did you find this somewhere online?"" and she said:

""I didn't need to. There's no way that you are that smart."" She said it VERY loudly and the whole class got very quiet.

I walked out and didn't return to college until I was 32. I just completed my bachelors and two masters degrees in five years. Fuck her."

Is your mom Kitty Forman?
"My wife and I had just found out we were pregnant. She was ~5-6 weeks along. We were terrified but excited. We were also dealing with a number of family issues and homeowner issues. It was a generally stressful time.

So on a Saturday afternoon we decided to get out chores done before noon, turn off our phones, and just have a chill day to decompress from all this stress.

Right as we finishes out chores she said as a joke, ""Do you want to try for twins?"" with a rye smile and a wink. So we went and had some amazing sex. We didn't do anything crazy, but with all the stress we just let it all out with some vigorous sex. It was for sure up there in our top ten.

Afterwards I went out to the backyard to chill in the hammock and have a beer. She said she was just going to have a shower and then join me (not the beer part).

She came down 10 minutes later, hair still wet with a terrified look in her eyes and said, ""I think we need to go to the hospital"". She was bleeding from the vagina.

So we waited in emerg for hours. They were really nice and pushed us through the process as fast as possible. But there was still long stretches of us just sitting there, holding eachother, waiting. I just couldn't stop thinking about how I'd live with myself, let alone how I'd ever have sex again if I aborted my child with my dick. 

Thankfully, they came back and said everything looked great! We got to see their little heart pumping away for the first time on the ultrasound. They said the bleeding was just some of the stuff that would normally have come out if she had her period. Our sex just sort of got it all loose and flowing at once.

We now have a very healthy one year old boy."

"I originally registered Republican. A lot of the ideology made sense to me at the time (2003), and bought into the ""fiscally responsible"" marketing.  
  
However, when getting into debates, I started diverging into my beliefs instead of the party talking points. *(Well this is what I think about this. This is my opinion on this. This is how I think it should work.)*  
At this time (2006-ish), the GOP took ignoring science to a whole new level. Before I felt that they were slow adopters, and I could justify it with ""well lets see where the dust settles on such and such study."" At this point they were full on ""You can't explain the tide!"" and ""well 99% of scientists are liars, but this 1% who happens to be hired by Big-Oil says otherwise!"" so I began to identify as an independent.  
  
I voted split ticket (favoring Dem) in 2008, 2010, and finally changed my registration from ""Republican"" to ""Democrat"" in 2014. I feel that voting straight ticket is generally bad for the country, but after 2016, I feel that any vote for GOP is a vote for fascism.

"So I had cancer (retinoblastoma) at the age of, like, 6 months old. I lost an eye because of it, and have a very realistic prosthetic replacement. Most people don't even notice or realize this unless I've let them in on the secret.

Point being, I have this massive blind spot on the right side of my body. I have accidentally cut people off in hallways, and not seen people trying to get my attention or pass me things. All of my friends are ""in the know"" but because it's not super noticeable since I've had 23 years to adapt to my condition they'll forget. So someone will try to pass me a drink while on my right and I won't see them so they may think I'm just ignoring or declining. And then I'll be like ""hey man my bad I'm blind you know"" and I definitely only ever bring it up as a joke or to bust their balls about it. I find it funny because it's like ""oh I'm half blind because cancer don't you feel foolish"" and in 9 out of 10 cases they find it funny too.

"In addition, there are some major plot holes that really break any sense of immersion that indoctrination theory explains beautifully. Not everyone experiences these plot holes... These are spoilers, but the game has been out long enough that I'm just going to give that caveat and go ahead:

1)I brought my romantic interest and my favorite character along with me on the final mission. After Shepard is knocked senseless, he gets back up and everyone is gone. I go looking for them, fearing they are dead or something. Maybe they were obliterated? Maybe they abandoned me at the most critical moment (I don't buy it at all). I got the sense that something was ""wrong"" while looking for my comrades - the ethereal-ness of the scene, but you can easily just buy that's how they're representing Shepard's concussion. This is the smallest plot hole, but it comes back into play in #7.

2) You have to kill a mook before progressing to the next level, but only with a shaky pistol (you're badly hurt, and apparently they took your guns when they abandoned you.) I noticed that the pistol doesn't have an ammo counter anymore. I tested it. Yep, infinite ammo. WTF?

3) You go into the Citadel, and some guy on the radio is ""right behind you."" (You can't talk to anyone else, though). You go down a long corridor with no other ways in or out, into a room with no other way in or out. The dude who was right behind you is already there. WTF?

4)You get shot, and bleed A LOT on the floor. In the next scene, you recover, and the blood is gone. Did Shepard regenerate? WTF?

5) There's a mystical star child. This isn't really a plot hole, but crappy writing imo... if its literal.

6) You choose between controlling the reapers, hybridizing with the reapers, and killing the reapers. The star child tells you how reasonable it would be to MAKE USE of the reapers, and a waste to kill them, and a propagation of the cycle of violence. Two of those endings involve letting the reapers live and working with them somehow. Hmmmm. If you choose to KILL the reapers, (and your score is high enough) you get a special cutscene at the end where you see Shepard's body take a convulsive breath. His body is among BLACK rubble, where the fight on Earth took place, not amid WHITE rubble, like the citadel. Hmmm!

So, to recap, if you give in to the star child's suggestions and decide to work with the reapers... Shepard never wakes up. If you reject the star child and KILL the reapers, Shepard wakes up, on Earth, where the Reaper knocked him out... and began the forced indoctrination process?

7) This is where #1 comes back into play. You and your two buddies go on a suicide mission and the Normandy (your ship) goes into space to evacuate everyone else from the conflict area. You say all your goodbyes, you and your 2 besties go to storm the citadel, and the Normandy goes into space.

Well, when you make your choice, there is a cataclysmic explosion, and the Normandy just barely makes a mass effect jump in front of the wave... which ends up catching them mid-jump, and knocks them to a random planet. The game is programmed to have your two most-played companions be the first two out of the ship to explore the new world. Yep, my most played characters were the ones I brought with me in the final battle, who got abandoned with Shepard, and apparently annihilated... somehow they're on the Normandy and crash-landed on a utopia. Either horrible lazy writing, or a fever dream? Oh, and...

8) that cataclysmic explosion that destroyed the Normandy across literal light-years of space? Shepard lives through it if you pick the kill ending. Right...

Anyway, that's indoctrination theory. Either bioware wrote an awful, lazy ending and just threw up a massive middle finger to their fans, or they wrote a really clever way to represent an attempted indoctrination. My money is that EA forced bioware to stop work, chopped the intended end of the game off, and made the indoctrination sub-climax into the ending of the game. It just fits way too neatly. I went on the forums, confused and kind of pissed off after my ""shepard wakes up"" ending, and someone said something like, ""Maybe it was an indoctrination attempt?"" and holy shit, everything just fit perfectly.

She had just broken up with her long time boyfriend and moved out, etc. Well she gets a phone call from him and all he told her was ""I'm at the hospital, can you come pick me up?"" So she goes to pick him up, after he practically begs her to, and he gets in the car holding a box. Naturally she asks what it is and he reeeeally doesn't want to tell her. 

Long story short, he got a vibrating dildo sucked up where you don't want a vibrating dildo sucked up. He went to the hospital, they did tests and told him they could get it out, and they did. But my favorite part? They made him wait til the batteries died!

They literally told him that they couldn't remove it until the batteries died so they sent him back out to wait in the waiting room until that happened. Then they removed, boxed, and sent him on his way. 

TLDR; My friends ex boyfriend had to get a vibrating dildo removed after getting it stuck and the doctors made him wait to get it removed until the batteries died. But he also didn't want his family or friends to know he liked it up the butt so he called his ex girlfriend (my friend) to pick him up after. "

I saw what I jokingly called a chupacabra in Northern California when I was around 13 or 14. I was with three of my friends and one of their mothers driving home at dark (this is a rural area with houses every few miles). My friend's mom abruptly stops the car because she thinks she sees a naked child standing under a lone tree in a field about 50 yards from the road. We could barely see it, so she maneuvered the car so the lights could shine on it. As soon as we could somewhat make it out, this thing turned its head 180 degrees and looked at us right as it jumped straight from the ground into the fucking tree. It was a vertical jump of about 12 feet to the lowest branches. It happened all fast we couldn't see it's face. It was human-like in form- not any other animal. We peeled off so fucking fast. No one believes us to this day, but the five of us remember it clearly. I have no idea what it was. I still think about it to this day and will not walk outside at night because of it. "

"Not my experience but it happened to my husband shortly before we got together. He loves history and was visiting Gettysburg. It was dusk on the battlefield and he was near the angle, admiring a really cool old barn that was part of a small farm on the roadside.


He saw a horse. Nothing special about it just a regular dark brown or black horse except that it had materialized out of nowhere right before his eyes and had kind of green eyes. It was running around the farm yard and he could hear the hoofs as it galloped. He felt a breeze as it ran by and could see the nostrils flare. It ran around for a minute or two and just disappeared.


There were a lot of horses killed there so it kind of makes sense that horse spirits could be restless there. "
"I've posted this before in another sub, but I'll put it again here because it's pretty relevant. 

This story is long (in fact I made an amateur film based loosely on it)- and not for the feint of heart. It's probably exactly what OP was looking for, but be cautioned, you will never be able to un-read this:

By far the most creepy and terrifying thing I've experienced to date. My good friend Paul and I, both about 17, were headed to a nearby mountainous rainforest to spend the day foraging for mushrooms. We both had a couple of seasons worth of 'shrooming' under our belt, having gone several times to this exact area in prior years, and a few times already in that same Winter. 

After waking up early and spending about three hours travelling to this mountain range, we began into the rainforest the same way we'd always done. Our normal route was along an old, disused railway track that skirted about halfway up the mountain slope - it was good to have this flat ground to walk on, as we got deeper into the woods. After walking a while, we decided it was time to delve into the surrounding bush and start our mushroom hunt. We would normally go downhill from the train track when it was time to veer, as it was generally more moist the further down the slope you got = more mushrooms. However, this time for some reason, we decided to try our luck on the other side of the track, and started walking uphill away from our walking track. 

We didn't have to walk very far from the path before the landscape started changing. The higher portions of this mountainside were drier, and started resembling a sparce pine forest as opposed to the normally damp rainforest that most of the terrain grew. The area was fairly open, and not filled with undergrowth or overgrowth. We split up a bit, to spread our efforts, still within earshot of each other, but not within eyesight.

My attention was focused on the ground, constantly surveying for mushrooms. After walking up a small raised mound for better vantage, I noticed something strange on the ground, just on the other side of this mound I'd walked up. It was a manmade construction, that was for sure, but still to this day I cannot work out exactly its purpose, or why it was there. The best description I could give would be a large guinea-pig (hamster) hatch. It was large and rectangular (~2m X 1m), but very flat and low to the ground, probably less than 30cm high. On one end was an 'entry' hole, and the entire structure was covered in corrugated iron and tin, and it looked like it had been there a while judging by the moss and leaf litter that was encrusting the roof and walls. I stood shocked and confused, trying to evaluate this structure as best I could. It was in the middle of a quite large ditch. That mound I had climbed before? Just part of the surrounding rim that cratered this ditch, where this structure was in the middle.

Already I had thoughts of terror running through my head. A human could definitely fit inside this structure, could this be some hobo's home? Or perhaps something more sinister? I still can't quite place the purpose of this hatch.

As much as I wish it, the story doesn't end there.

My shock-paralysis at coming across this thing in this ditch was soon interrupted. I felt something heavy, and wet, land right on the top of my head. Before I could reach to touch my head, it was already oozing down my face and neck. To describe this material, it was thick like tree sap, but black as pitch, like tar. I'd never seen anything like it before, and seeing it on my hand was when I first felt the urge to panic. I looked up, to brave a glance at the source of this strange black substance - and that's when I knew I had to get out of there. All of the trees growing around this ditch clearing had massive globs of this stuff dripping steadily from their upper branches. I could see these masses of black stuff clear as day, and I would've noticed them earlier if my attention wasn't focused on the ground. 

Now, the icing on the cake. As I was struggling to process the situation I had walked into, I heard something moving in the area across from the ditch-edge I was standing on. Now when I say I heard something moving, what I mean is that I heard the ground giving way to whatever was moving. The all-too-familiar sound of crushing leaf litter and twigs underfoot was nearby, in an otherwise silent atmosphere. However, it wasn't rhythmic, there was no stepping, it just... came. Before I could rationalise what I was hearing, a large shadowy blur wizzed by, just in front of my eyes. It moved along the ground, and at lightning-fast speed, darting between trees, as it was gone from my vision as quickly as it entered, leaving the sound of crushed ground as it went. My original thought was that it was wildlife, a kangaroo specifically (yes I'm Australian), but no animal moves that fast..

I'd never been so scared in my life. As much as I wanted to move or scream for help, I was paralyzed. I knew my friend Paul wouldn't be more than 100 meters away, and that he was carrying a knife (in case we got jumped), and that's all I could think of at that time. I broke out of the crippling fear, and sprinted toward where I thought Paul would be. When he saw me, I was as white as a sheet, trembling, crying, panicking, and for a while I couldn't make any words. 

I told him what had happened, and he naturally didn't believe me, or rather, wanted to get a look for himself, even after my cautioning. I pointed him in the direction of the ditch-hatch and the surrounding tar-trees, and told him I was getting as far away from there as possible. He caught up with me a few minutes later, having seen more than enough to confirm my story, and being sufficiently spooked himself. 

We have never returned to that mountain range, and it is still the scariest ghost story I have... telling it always leaves me scared. I'm sweating profusely after just having written this, to give you a sense of how malign that day's events were. Why did all this phenomena occur in the same location, and all at once? From noticing the hatch to sprinting away in terror from the mystery shadow was probably less than 10 seconds, but it felt an eternity. 

And before you ask, no I had not eaten any mushrooms. I understand the potential effects of some mushrooms, and would never jeopardize the quality of my forage like that."

"Dated a girl, we were teasing each other in bed, she jumped on top , held my hands down and kinda just forced it in her. 3 weeks later she’s pregnant, despite saying she was on the pill. Proceeds to tell me over and over I’ll be a great dad. She forced herself on me the day we started dating 

It fucks with me horribly. I kept trying to say an abortion is the best thing, she thinks and tells me how horrible i am to want to kill my baby. I eventually just suck it up and try to make the best of it and commit. She then goes and gets an abortion. Which fucks me up mentally ten times more.

Mind you this all happened within about a 2 month period from the start of us dating to the end.

After the abortion we break up. She then comes back to me after 3 months of partying and coke filled nights. Starts to emotionally manipulate me into dating her and tries to get me to sleep with her. I refuse without a condom, she says she’s on the pill but i refuse to give in. She surprises me with how she’s moving a couple provinces over, we decide to try long distance.

Well she starts uploading pictures holding another guys hand and posting his name with hearts, all while telling me she’s just friends with him and how she wants to marry me and shit.

Two months of this pass and yes I’m a ducking retard in denial. Until she cuts contact with me completely, find out from her sister that she’s pregnant with his kid. Mind you all of this has occurred from March until November of 2014.

This all fucked me up royally and i was very suicidal and depressed for a long time and still struggle with anxiety

In 2015 i decided it was time to go back to school and figure my life out, so i spent two years in college in a new city and busted my ass.

I got honors in school and have a wonderful girlfriend that knows my past and helps me with my issues

Now she’s a single mom living off the money for child support. And i have turned things around to be better. She still messages me once a year to try and communicate or start shit, she recently started following me on Instagram to creep my and my girlfriend.

I would say while it sucked horrible and almost ruined me as a person, that abortion helped me dodge 18 years of hell. I will always be thankful how lucky i got with that. Hell there is a high chance she was pregnant before we started dating"
Was twice approached back in the '50s by men that wanted to get me alone (I was around 6 or so years old).  Once I figured out it was weird and walked away and once my mom hollered for me to come home and I ran off.  Still ended up getting molested a couple of times (I think lots of girls will tell the same story that it's pretty hard to avoid getting molested) but they were minor incidents whereas the other two times were definitely possibly I'd end up dead.

She proceeds to drag me back to the bakery to point at a shelf where she claims she found the cake. The shelf tag says Fudge Cake $5 and German Chocolate Cake $16. Both spaces are empty. I say those spaces are for Fudge and German chocolate, not Carrot Cake. YOU EXPECT ME TO READ THE TAGS she asks. The tags list the cakes, ma'am, I say. BUT IT WAS THERE, she says, I WANT IT FOR $5. and im thinking so convenient that youre not bitching about it if it was in the German Chocolate slot so by your logic I could charge you $16. But I say no its $9, sorry, it says here on the tag. She bitches the whole way until my boss gives her the cake for free and sucks her dick on the way out.

"I'm trying not to overreact, but this information is absolutely not right.

Take a permit to carry class and they will drill you on what to do if you actually end up shooting someone.

Once the threat is eliminated, call the police. Give them your location, name, and phone number. Be sure to tell them that the man with the gun is you.

Unload your firearm before the police get there.

Remove the magazine and any rounds in the chamber. 

Set it on the ground in front of you.

Sit in the most unthreatening way possible.

When the police arrive, ask for your attorney. If you don't have one, spend the time waiting for them looking one up on your phone. Criminal defense. If you don't do this, they'll appoint a public defender. Either way.

DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE TO THE POLICE.

I can't stress this enough. Say nothing. Do not explain the situation. Do not tell them that happened. If there are any other loved ones nearby, calmly instruct them to do the same. 


Nothing you say to the police can be used FOR you in a court of law.

Process that and understand it. Your lawyer and the prosecution CANNOT use what you said to the police to prove you're innocent.

The only situation in which you should speak to the police is if there is another threat that is not yet eliminated. If someone fled the scene, tell them which direction they went and what they looked like. If there is a threat, tell them where and what you know about them. Do not say ""Oh well two guys came in here and I shot one but the other one is in the other room hiding"". Tell them there is another armed man in the other room hiding and SAY NOTHING ELSE. 

Give them the pertinent information to remove the threat or find the bad guy. Explaining the whole situation will not help. 


Do not speak to anything else."

Being house poor. Had friends who bought a house too big, that needed remodeling in some places but was livable. They remodeled as much as they could until they ran out of money. Now their AC doesn’t work and they are having to pay for that. 

Read the HOA rules before you buy or make sure you get a copy at closing. It’s your responsibility to pay the dues. Even if they don’t send you a letter reminding you. You won’t win a fight that you “didn’t know” and “weren’t contacted” about. 

Don’t fill up the place with furniture right away. Save your money. We had half of our house empty for a year. And it was not a burden to us when I had emergency surgery after buying a house and we could easily pay for it. Had we furnished the entire house the medical costs would have put a strain on our savings. "

Yes, this happens in the US. In Europe, not so much.

I think I’ll always have some form of economic anxiety. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it forces me to be very careful with spending. But I do hate that I’m always kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop."

My own father is very old and for some years now I've been thinking ""maybe this is the year he goes"". The Logan-Prof relationship in this movie gave me a good ponder of how I might really deal with it. The scene was done so well, like Logan as getting a sense of catharsis from putting the Professor down to his final rest as if to say, ""Rest easy, old man, I might not have been the best son, but the weight is off your shoulders now because I'll try to be a good father.""

"It's sickening that two adults get together, marry (or not), make some kids and then decide that they no longer want to be a couple. One gets mad because of something the other done and looks frantically around the room for something to punish him with, and she spots................. their 2 year old son quietly playing legos in the kitchen, surrounded by his blankie and their 5 year old son playing trucks, lying on his favorite cozy rug in the living room, and thinks 'that's *it*! I'll get him back alright - with **them**!' and so the battle begins where the unwilling children are now forced into the lives of two selfish, angry people who care more about themselves than they do these precious, innocent children who should not be hearing the awful things daddy and his family says about mama and vis-versa. Their early vocabulary words are ""shared parenting"" and ""visitation"" and ""the lawyers said"" etc.  

If you find yourself in a relationship with someone you no longer want want to be romantically involved with, fine, break up and go your separate ways. If you have children, fine, break up but know that until the youngest is 18, you're still connected to your ex and the priority for *both* of you is those kids. They're not your way to punish the other, don't talk bad about mama and daddy to the other and don't let anyone else do it either. Please - love your kids enough not to do this to them. "

I taught my son the letter sounds at ~ 2.5/3, and once they understand what letters sound like start with simple 2 and 3 letter words, ""cat"",""dog"", ""it"", etc. Once she can combine short words, teach her some of the ""rules"" about words, like how in a ""vowel, consonant, e"" word, the e makes the first vowel ""say it's own name"". Then begin with simple words that don't follow these specific rules, but that they will quickly be able to recognize by site,(such as ""the""). You might think that you dont know many of these rules, but if you are literate you absolutely do.

"Hate is a strong word, but I'm definitely not fond of Ben Shapiro. 

I respect the hell out of him for his ability to debate. I'm not fond of him because, like any good debater, he presents a shit ton of evidence but doesn't break down those evidence points and you're left to deal with all of this information that's basically just 'in the wind'. That, and he debates topics that really can't be debated without some general consensus (like abortion. If you can't agree on when life starts, you can't have a debate on whether or not abortion should be legal. Not a productive one, anyway.)"
"Or the whole thing: ""Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

"Serious question: what's the best way for the partner of an abused person to raise their own feelings? 

There's a lot of content out there condemning (rightfully so) actions that pressure people into sex they're not ready for. Some of this content suggests that expressing a desire for sex once a party has previously expressed their discomfort is unacceptable pressuring. Just so, there's content condemning breakup ultimatums because these place emotional pressure on people, and these messages could be interpreted to mean that even expressing that abstinence is a deal-breaker is unacceptable. 

I'm a rule follower by nature, but nobody ever taught me the rules for relationships. I've tried to pick it up from published/broadcast media; but a lot of it is contradictory or seems intentionally over-strong to compensate for folks likely to only halfheartedly comply.

Consider:""He waited all night in his car for me to finish breaking up with my boyfriend, and then drove me home. I realized what a gem he was, and he told me he'd stayed because he loved me and wanted me to be happy."" vrs. ""I was having the worst night of my life, and he waited all night in his car, at my apartment so he could make a move on me as soon as we were done breaking up."" It's the same story.

"[Auriel's Ascension from Oblivion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YKicBAMlBk)

I still remember little 8 year old me sitting in front of the TV with a borrowed PS3, being *blown away* by the game. Just walking down the various paths through the absolutely stunning environments, with the Imperial City and ever looming white-gold tower as the backdrop. This song always seemed to come on, and I remember it so clearly over 10 years later. It was my first real introduction to what games can truly offer. Auriel's Ascension takes me back to that time whenever I listen to it, that incredible child-like feeling of awe and wonder.

There are *many* honorable mentions (The entire Undertale OST, [Journey from Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYfe9caNqfA) come to mind) but I don't think anything can touch Auriel's Ascension for me personally, the nostalgia factor is just too huge."

"I'm a guy in my late twenties with a condition called Chronic Non-Bacterial Prostatitis. ""Prostatitis"" is a term for when your prostate gets inflamed. It can cause pain and general nerve dysfunction in that area of the body, which can lead to Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome. Sadly, there's still almost no medical research that has figured out how to fix it for sure.

Anyway, the crux of it is that, if I let my prostate fill up too much, it can sometimes press too hard against the nerves in that part of my body. It can be INCREDIBLY unpleasant, especially from a psychological standpoint. So, under orders from my doctor, I ramped it up to once every 1-2 days. Honestly, it feels like just some annoying thing I have to remember to do on a lot of days.

Not to mention, I have a lot of lingering religious guilt about *ever* masturbating due to the conservative religious environment I was raised in.

I read the book. I understood its a very easy popcorn read that just used a lot of descriptive words on each page to describe the setting. I understood they had to change the plot because it wouldn't translate that well with the movie. I trusted in Spielberg  to do a decent book-movie adaptation but I was very underwhelmed. Most of the scenes were played out in the commercial.

Everything about the movie just seemed rushed. Yeah the action scenes and pop culture Easter eggs were ok, but they started halfway in the actual plot, used pop culture cameos for cash grabs and randomly forced the romance to come out when the 2 main characters aren't supposed to meet until the end.

"As a former server who's benefitted from the practice, I agree. Restaurants are more than capable of paying their staff more without dramatically ""increasing the cost for the customer"".

One great example is the Ivar's Acres of Clams (the first Ivar's, which is a sit-down restaurant) in Seattle. They pay the servers Seattle minimum wage ($15 an hour vs the drastic base wage cut most servers have), have a profit-sharing program (8% for the front of house staff, 9% for the kitchen) all while only increasing what the customer pays by 4%. They inform you of this all over the menu and tell you not to tip.

Hopefully more restaurants adopt this model, it works."

We get back to hers, have a few drinks, other people leave and the girl makes it clear to me that she wants to bone. This guy starts stalling me for ages in the kitchen, asking me really tedious questions. Eventually I say I'm tired and I'm going to bed and he's like ""ok man, which sofa are you on?"" I just looked at him, then went into the girls bedroom.

He came into the room and stood there awkwardly, before giving this speech about how I was taking advantage of this girl and how I was just using her etc etc. She went into the living room with him and spoke to him about how she's sorry but she likes me etc etc. And he's like ""SO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE THEN? FINE!"" and slams the door.

"Tl;Dr Nice guy college friend very publicly asked me out in an elevator which lead to what was probably the most awkward moment of my life.


One of my friends, let’s call him Chris, had a very obvious crush on me my sophomore year (he was a freshman).  I made it pretty clear through various conversations I was not interested. One night before the end of term I told him and another mutual friend about a dream I’d had the night before that we set him up on a date with a cute girl in an elevator (it was sort of like the 5 minute date  in himym) 
Weird concept, but it was cute in the dream.


Next day I get a text from him to take the elevator down to the dorm lounge. It was weird phrasing, but I didn’t think much of it. Until the elevator doors open, and he is standing there holding flowers. A music stand made up as a makeshift table with a cloth over it, two slices of cheesecake from the campus restaurant, and two chairs laid out in the middle. I stepped into the elevator in shock, not really knowing how to respond or what the fuck was happening. 

“As you probably know, I’ve been in pretty serious “like” with you for a while now” he started saying (yes that’s a direct quote)


Before he could continue, the elevator reached the ground floor and the doors opened to a small crowd of people waiting to get on, many of whom I knew.  After looking at our red faces, him holding flowers, the makeshift table and chairs, the girl at the front said, “...should we take the stairs?”


“That would be best” Chris curtly replied.


The doors closed and he finished his spiel. I was about to respond to him when the doors opened again. This time a nun walked into the elevator. She pushed the button for the top floor, and we spent an agonizing few minutes silently standing there as she looked from him to me to the table, and commented something about “this looks fun” before finally getting off.

When we were alone again I told him I liked him as a friend but I wasn’t interested in dating him, and was about to get off on my floor when he handed me both cheesecakes, because “I don’t really like cheesecake but I got two for the aesthetics”


The doors closed and I collapsed into a chair in the lounge in disbelief. I felt horrible, both angry at him for putting me in that situation when I made my feelings clear already, and upset that I had to reject him after he clearly put so much effort into it. Had I been into him it probably would have been cute.  


Please do not try to make a grand romantic gesture unless you know they like you."
"I'm not superstitious, but sometimes the evidence is against that perspective.

For example, it *really* seems like I have a cursed pocket watch.

Many years ago, I bought the cheap (but interesting) timepiece at a junk shop in Chinatown. It was of the variety that needed to be manually wound, which I considered an appealing trait. Upon purchasing the watch, I wound it up... and for the next day or so, I had a streak of monumentally good luck. Everything went my way! A girl that I liked agreed to a date with me, the webcomic that I was running got 15,000 unique views, and the lottery ticket that I bought – purely on a whim – resulted in me getting something like $150!

Clearly, it was the watch. I was tempted to keep using it, of course, but I didn't want to wear out whatever charm it had. As such, I stopped winding it, and resolved to only take it out when I needed a little bit of random fortune.

That was when everything went downhill.

As soon as the watch stopped, my luck reversed entirely. I wound up in the emergency room on the day of my date. The webcomic's artist quit. My car's back tire blew out on the highway, and the damage cost well over $150 to repair. Everything that could go wrong *did* go wrong, as though the debt of good luck that I'd incurred was being repaid with incredibly steep interest. Once again, I was sure that the watch was to blame.

Needless to say, the implications were astounding. If I was willing to steel myself against a potential calamity, I could be assured of having exceptionally good luck whenever I wanted. I might even be able to use the bad luck to my advantage! Unfortunately (hah!), things didn't work out that way in the slightest: Regardless of what I prepared myself to endure, the consequences of using the watch were always – without fail – of a nature that both completely undermined its own benevolence and left me off worse than before.

Once, while hoping to hear back about a job to which I had applied, I wound the watch. Within hours, I received a call from an enthusiastic hiring manager, who immediately set me up with an interview. When the day of the interview came (which was not long after I had stopped winding the watch), the bus I was riding broke down. I had to take a (very expensive) taxi ride to my destination... and upon arrival, I was told that the position had been filled.

Since then, I've tried winding the wretched thing a handful of other times, and I've always regretted it. The price in bad luck is never worth the brief increase in good fortune. Someone once recommended that I simply keep the watch wound indefinitely, but what happens if I forget one day? I shudder to think about what could occur if I went through a week, a month, or even longer with nothing but good luck, only have the watch's hands grind to a halt.

Perhaps my heart would stop with them.

I am not a superstitious man. I can think of several *rational* explanations for why my luck appears to change when I use that watch, but that hasn't stopped me from wrapping it in a paper towel and hiding it on the uppermost shelf of my closet.

**TL;DR: My pocket watch is a karmic loan shark.**"

Funny story when i was younger me and my cousin would stay down my grandmas in the summer we were about 10 my grandma in her early 70's . She was watching tv( only tv in the house) the titanic was on and this scene came on my cousin startes giggling and of course it made me giggle which then became full blown laughing which then turned into my grandma yelling at us to shut up thats not funny. Being kids and getting yelled at to not laugh just makes you laugh more. Thanks for bringing back the memory good times.

You being young is something employers will take advantage of too-don’t budge when you know you’re right. 

You’d find a local employment lawyer, or do what I did: I filled out a complaint with the NLRB on their website, and within a day, an investigator called me and set up a phone interview. 

They took my statement about the incident where I was illegally threatened, and kept in touch over the weeks where she investigated. She amended the original charge, which had 3-4 violations, to a final one including 9 violations based on the law and the offending event. 

I had to sign the sealed testimony I gave, and the charge forms as well as my initial complaint, certifying its veracity based on my knowledge and understanding, but the NLRB and my investigator handled everything else. 

It didn’t have to go to court, and my employer had to rescind the rule about pay secrecy and the penalties for discussing pay, and post notice of the settlement where all employees could see, as well as addressing it in front of the entire company. 

Then everybody knew what their right was. "

"The french revolutionaries were not at all in line with America's philosophy. The Jacobins and the Committee of Public Safety were basically a bunch of proto-communists who started the reign of terror, executing everyone they didn't find equal enough. Their horrendous economic policy also immediately caused a famine that killed more people than the grain shortage. 

The National Assembly also wasn't very democratic, given that the second the revolutionaries had crystallized out two major parties in the assembly the Montagnards tried to have the Girodins rounded up and executed, sparking off another civil war in the midst of the ongoing revolution.

When the peasants were starving because the newly formed army had taken posession of basically all remaining food they marched on the assembly with 60000 people, were held off, and then the Jacobins had every assembly member who sympathized with them executed as well.

This kind of crap went on for 10 years of governments just killing each other, starting coups, starving the peasants, and murdering anyone they didn't like. Even the royalists retook the country for a short period. Finally Napoleon managed a successful coup by gaining the confidence of the army and was able to stabilize the country under a military dictatorship that was no less autocratic than the monarchy had been, just without inherited titles.

So, the French revolution had pretty much no values in common with the American revolution, nor did it achieve a similar goal. If anything the French revolution caused all the countries that still had monarchies to adopt constitutions and become more democratic, because it was such a stellar example of what NOT to do if you want freedom and equality. The French didn't really get their first functional democracy until a hundred years later. "

A particularly rowdy punter was bashing in to a people while dancing like a goon, and I was running the bar that night.

Basically got aggro straight away. Tried to pick a fight with me, and my bosses saw.  


Now my bosses were three very larged, very roided up Serbian blokes who survived the Bosnian-Serb war. Cold and calm but little patience for bullshit. Also, brutally protective of their friends and employees - I was considered to be both.  


The youngest of the three, Zoran, was the biggest and saw this lad shove and attempt to punch on with me. Zoran stormed over to us and picked the lad up by the scruff of his neck and screamed in a heavy Serbian accent ""You don't fucking come in to my fucking club and fucking touch my fucking staff,"" and proceed to drag this guy, who was shitting himself, to the fire exit. A fire exit he threw the guy head first in to without opening the big, heavy, fuck off fire doors. The guy broke his nose and started whinging about being assaulted and going to the cops.   


Zoran set his story straight by punching said door right beside his face, and leaving a moderately sized depresseion in it, followed by ""No, you tripped. Get the fuck out of my club.""  


It was both amazing and terrifying at the same time."

"If by “something wrong with it” you mean he may have autism or another neurological issue, that is possible. In that case, the parent needs to employ some other strategies (medication, sensory items, buying an extra seat) to limit the disruption. Parents know their children and know their limits. (Whether they want to admit that is another discussion.) YOU KNOW if your kid can sit down for an eight hour flight. If they can’t, you either don’t fly or you prepare them by talking about it, watching TV shows about it, and practicing.

I’m sympathetic in that I have flown with kids (my own and others) and it’s not always easy. You can do your best and they still sometimes freak out. But that’s when you keep trying to calm them down while NOT getting in the way of others. If that kid had been crawling on my seat, I would have told the mother, “He needs to sit down. I don’t want him to fall on me.”

"You have to understand that *most* people were racist and homophobic when I grew up in the 1950's and 1960's. That was normal.

They had other values though. Tolerance. A real sense of ""mind your own business,"" and respect for other people, whatever their condition or preferences. Everyone had struggled up from the Depression, everyone was trying to make a life for themselves. 

Their prejudices were for stereotypes, and loosely attached. They disappeared upon meeting some individual from one of the slandered groups - my folks grew up with the idea of courtesy and friendship for fellow humans. That was an ideal of the times, too.

As the 60's progressed, my folks gradually tried to shed their legacy of prejudices - succeeded mostly. For me, it was some lingering unpleasantness from their past, just a part of the times back then.

They were decent, hardworking, honorable people who grew up in a time of unexamined hatred and bias. And when it came time to examine these things, they did their best to discard them. Can't ask for more'n that.

They were a good example for me. "

(Three little siblings, 8 years of baby-sitting, one summer as a teaching assistant, four years volunteering with the kids at my church.)  5th graders are even more prone to defeat by embarrassment.

And you've got to be talking about your fairly average kid, because the fact that they're 2nd &amp; 5th graders mean they're in school.  So these aren't like, genetically modified kids with rage issues who'll keep going after being slapped across the face &amp; pantsed in front of their peers."

"I believe in having the ability to defend myself in my own home with the same level of firepower that could reasonably be brought to bare against me.

If you don’t have the power to resist when someone tries to assert their will over yours by force then you have no recourse and are at their mercy, which if they have broken into your home is usually or at least potentially very bad. 

Not every home invader wants more than to rob you, but do you want to rely on that when in an ever more fucked up world the worst case scenario is being raped or tortured for fun?

"For say, early Battlefront II (2017), in which Loot Boxes were undeniably pay-to-win, banning to use of Loot Boxes (rather than the entire game itself) would be a great idea. It creates balance.

However, in the case of say Overwatch, in which Loot Boxes are 100% cosmetic, can be unlocked via regular gameplay, and are simply purchasable with enough credits, banning the Loot Boxes would accomplish nothing positive, never mind banning the _entire game_.

But it doesn't seem like it would work, anyway. Labelling the next Call of Duty M for Mature never stopped that 12 year old from banging my Mom.

The law should be ""Banning gambling for features that directly affect gameplay"" rather than ""Ban all gambling in videogames because EA fucked up again""."
"This isn't about lying about your age, it's about being literally incapable of defending against the manipulative tactics that are quite literally just gambling concepts and Skinner boxes. Companies can't be allowed to use those methods when children are the audience for the same reasons that children can't go into the casino - kids factually don't comprehend the value of a dollar versus the value of a blinking light box that eats dollars. If these companies want to sell gambling boxes in their game, then they're subject to gambling regulations, including financial information, odds in the game of winning a prize, and officially verified payout systems.

The thing is, it's ridiculously easy to make money by tricking people, even grown adults. That's basically the entire point of casinos in the first place. Adults have the freedom to ruin their lives, and are assumed to have the responsibility to not do so. Kids need to be protected from those who would use these tactics to profit on their inability to understand the game of chance.

Think of a gumball machine, but with a slot handle on it. A child puts his quarter in, pulls the handle, and gets no gumball. How long does this machine get to stay in operation, precisely? Who gets a gumball? How does any player know the machine even can dispense gumballs at all? With regulation, you at least know it's not literally just a rip-off, because they have to prove their claims as to the odds and payouts."

He was also from Illinois and one of my fondest memories is of walking up to that display in the museum and staring those lions in the face.

When he was old enough I sat my younger brother down and watched the movie with him explaining the backstory the way my father did. A few years later I did the same thing with my best friend. 

I recently bought my own copy of the DVD to have in my own collection. I can't imagine it not being a staple of my life and maybe it's obstinate but I'll not take any bad reviews seriously. It's a great movie. "

"This is long but it creeped me the hell out!

It happened around 10 years ago. I worked in a really old building that was mostly unoccupied except for the basement (where my office was) and the ground floor where there were a couple more offices. The building was 8 stories high and most of the unoccupied floors still had old furniture/beds etc in them from when it used to be student doctor accommodation - however, on the 7th floor, we kept a lot of our older files in filing cabinets. 

The whole building was locked at all times and you needed a programmed security badge to get in and to get on to each floor.

One day, my boss asked me and another girl to retrieve some files from the 7th floor. I can't remember what they were or why they were needed but there were a lot of ghost stories about the building so neither of us was too happy about being sent. So we're up there looking through filing cabinets and chatting and we hear what sounds like a man clearing his throat/coughing from down the hallway. Donna and I are frozen and we stare at each other for a few seconds before I shout ""hello?"" - to no answer. 

After another few seconds pass we decide we were probably being silly and get on with getting the files. A few minutes pass and we're feeling ok again until we hear a man's voice kind of weakly and more distant than the previous coughing sound, shouts ""hello?"" 

Again we're frozen. No one but us has access to these floors (it was my job to programme the badges so I knew exactly who had access) and they were not accessible by the public or homeless, the ONLY way in was with a security card. Donna and I swiftly left and went back to our office to inform our boss, who decided to go check it out for himself. 

While he was gone I checked the access point on the system and no one but me had swiped in. Then I saw my boss's card showing up as being used as he was up there checking it out for us. He returned several minutes later saying the whole floor was completely empty with no sign of life in any of the rooms.

That building is due to be demolished soon."

"There are strains of the disease that have no known 100% successful cure, mostly due to the fact that it’s victims are usually poor, and that there aren’t enough people worldwide with the disease.

"I worked at a country club and there were a pair of 16-year-old twins (dudes) who'd frequent the pool on a regular basis. One owned a Ferrari and the other owned something similar (more Fast &amp; Furious-street-race-type than a Ferrari though). They also apparently had a dance club in their basement. 

Quite honestly, I don't know how spoiled they were attitude-wise because I'm pretty sure I was just jealous and projected my own biases as I saw fit. ""They walk like they think they're all that,"" I probably said in 2002.

Anyway, one day I was driving to work and I saw the Fast &amp; Furious kid driving on an approaching road that was supposed to yield into my lane (sort of like an on-ramp but with only one lane heading in each direction). He didn't yield. Because I was an 18-year-old punk myself, I assumed the worst and figured that he thought he could drive into my lane and assumed I'd swerve into the opposite lane or jam on my brakes to accommodate him. 

Instead, behind the wheel of my turquoise 1993 Mercury Tracer, I stood strong, apparently willing to get to t-boned to prove a point. At the last moment, perhaps once realizing I was going to hold my lane, the kid swerved off the road and swiveled onto the shoulder and part of the ditch, coming to a complete stop as dust billowed in my rearview. 

In hindsight, he probably just sucked at driving. He was only 16 and the yield-merge area is kind of a unique stretch of road. But in my head, I'd shown that spoiled jerk who was boss.

"Not a salesman: but this year I bought a 2018 vehicle with 13 miles on it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it...but I love to argue and work a salesman over.  It MSRP for $25,000. I managed to hit the dealer on the last day of the month. The brand of car was offering $7,500 in rebates (which drops it to 17,500). The lowest they told me they would go was 16,500 which included a ""friends and family discount"". I took a picture of the deal. Called the dealer ship in the next county, showed them the sales contract. I said they said the lowest they would go was 15,900 but I only had 15,700 in my bank account (not necessarily true but they needed not know that). After an hour they called back and said they would. I told them I wanted everything labeled out the VIN number and stock number signed by the sales manager. I showed up and we signed the paper work. I left with a 2018 vehicle MSRP'd at 25,000. I also had to sign a contract stating I couldn't sell it for ""x"" amount of time and turn a profit. But totally worth it to me."

"That just doesn’t make sense from a physics perspective either. Acceleration from gravity is only 9.8m/s/s. If a plane was just falling for 3 seconds without any air resistance it would only fall like 45 meters. To move downward at an average rate of ~165m/sec against the force of lift from the plane, you’d need some serious force. The only way it could be true is if a large passenger plane immediately shifted to be pointing very downward, which just isn’t possible."
Yea elementary school is the worst for bullying. But in middle school and high school the people who still do things like that end up getting bullied the most.

The kids behind us were kind of obnoxious, talking loudly and making lots of noise with their snacks (I know I sound like a grumpy old man, but there really is no need to shake the ice in your otherwise empty cup around for five minutes). At one point the kid behind me kicks my seat (she feels it too) and we both get up, turn around, and with our best strict-teacher faces on (we both teach ESL), just said: ""up."" The kid sat bolt upright from the slouching position (he'd still been kicking my chair), and was pretty much subdued after that. Also, I'm just realizing that I use a lot of brackets when I write."

"After being scared away from where I sat by a erched owl that stared  at me for a good long while, I began to walk home. On the darkest road in my town at roughly 3am, I was walking down the middle when I saw two dogs walk side by side to the edge of the road in front of me. They looked like wolves, but were too small-at first I thought they were coyotes. They stopped ahead on my right side. They didn't look at me and didn't really move at all after stopping just short of the edge of the road. One was jet black, the other a bright, unblemished white. I walked past them, then they continued their straight path across the road and beyond. I never saw them again.

I asked my now late father, an old Cherokee medicine man, what it meant, and it turns out there were two messages to have been taken away from that. Unfortunately I didn't realize what the second was until it was too late. He interpreted the experience as a sign I should make a major choice some time down the road regarding the direction of my life. The white dog represents positivity and confidence. The black dog represents negativity and aggression. I'm sure you've all heard the ""there are two dogs in every man's heart"" story. That's what I'm talking about.

Unfortunately, like I said, there was a second meaning. The black and white dogs also guard the two sides of the path to the afterlife. From this afterlife, messages are delivered by owls. Those dogs are represented in the night sky by the stars Sirius and Antares, which are on opposite sides of the visible milky way. They are never both out at the same time, except for around the time I was out there. I was warned of my father's death that would come soon after, and I didn't catch it."

"Going to the bathroom and mannequins. Yes, they were connected. The dream I had was probably the most vivid and horrifying dream I can remember, aside from having my dad turned into vegetables and egg, before being cannibalized. It started off in a desert where there was no wind, cracked earth and no noise at all. I was running from something that was chasing me, which turned out to be mannequins, their expressionless faces swapped with ones of either malice or despair.

They were very fast and chased me until I reached an Oasis that stretched for miles lengthwise. Naturally, having no control over my dreams, I dived into the water and began swimming across. The mannequins sunk into the soil behind me, before their hands latched onto my ankles from the bottom of the oasis and dragged me down. I kicked free and crawled onto dry land, before running like crazy again. Finally, there was an old outhouse that I could use as shelter from the creatures and hid in it. 

The hands came from out of the toilet and dragged me down into pitch black before I became a twisted mannequin myself.

That’s what scared me and still does, hbu?"

His buddy mainly just stumbled back and fell on his ass but he was so stunned after watching his buddy get leveled and me coming out with what must have been steam coming out of my ears he didn't move. I told that dickhead he owes me a back tire or im going to stomp his fucking legs like he did my bike and he ended up having $160 bucks in his wallet.

"I had a very abusive relationship with my mom up until around 16. My mom for the longest time would berate me and make fun of me every time I made a mistake. Every time I wanted to try something new, she’d always want to be like “Since you said you liked chess, I signed you up for this tournament” which in any case can be a curse or a blessing. But in my case it took the fun out of anything, and anytime I didn’t want to do anything competitively she’d always make fun of me then. I think she just wanted something to brag to her coworkers about. I once was on a summer league swim team and she came to 2 of the meets out of the 18 we had. I saw her posting stuff on Instagram about being a “swimmer mom” regardless of the fact she didn’t even know what our suits looked like. I took the blame for everything around the house, she always gave me directions that contradicted each other, so I’d be getting berated and called a retard anyways. Now after years of this, I started to get depressed around age 12. This was when she started the lying. Any type of promise she made in the past was going to be broken, and to this day I don’t take everything she says 100% to heart. One day she was cursing me out and punching me in the face for missing a spot on the toilet “Because she doesn’t want to see that while she’s in the bath” and I finally told her that I was suicidal and she was making it worse. This woman goes on about how she didn’t know and why didn’t I tell her. I told her whenever one of us children confide anything private to her, she always exposes it during one of her outburst in makes fun of us for it. She was like “How can you judge me on something you think I’m going to do?” She tells me she promises not to mention the depression and the suicidal thoughts. That lasted about 2 weeks. She was making fun of me calling me a pussy and how I’m “not being abused, you not one of these white kids I’m not going to baby you” I asked her about her promise and she said she didn’t give a fuck and I needed to grow a pair of balls. Later on that year she told me if I killed myself not much would change and my brother would replace me. After that I just didn’t talk to her, didn’t really respect her or listen to a word she said. Later that year she had another outburst and during that she said she would punch me in the face or choke me or something. So I said to my brother that’s abusive behavior. He takes his snitch ass and tells her this and starts yelling in my face how it’s not abusive if she doesn’t do anything. Honest at this point I was 15 and I had had enough, so I started going in on her like she did with me all these years, and you could tell it was getting to her because at one point she just was telling me to shut up and tried to play the victim role. I ended up leaving the house and tried to sleep at the playground before she got me and since then she hasn’t done anything as bad since then. I really don’t trust any of my family, especially my mom and brother. "

Manipulation is a horrible thing, but it's really weird to see people in this thread think that it justifies a literal death sentence. If you think that someone is literally dying to be with you then you first need to get over yourself. Your rational choices are to direct them to help, to direct help to them (e.g. by calling the police), and / or to set a boundary to protect yourself.

"&gt;It was clear she was lonely and just wanted friends, but any time she tried to approach me or my friends (and while I didn't have many either) we would ignore her or just stop talking until she went away or we would leave.

That's bullying.

I'm not saying this as an attack on you; just as a statement of fact.

From what I've seen, there are at least four types of bullying. I separate them based on who I've seen do them; but also how people are effected by them. They are:

\- Physical bullying. Using one's physical power to (often literally) push people around.

\- Emotional bullying. Name calling, teasing, taunting, or other actions intended to get an emotional response (often anger, upset, or frustration).

\- Mental bullying. The nerd equivalent of physical bullying, based around intellectual capacity.

\- Social bullying. Using social connection to isolate or otherwise impact the social life of a person.

What you did was social bullying.

As someone who reacted worst to social bullying, I can tell you it leaves a mark. I could take physical bullying without issue; but feeling isolated is what hurt me. And if I hadn't had a family to support and anchor me... Well, let's just say that Columbine had an impact on me anyway. And even with a supportive family who provided me what I needed to rebound (mostly) through high school, it still took me over a decade to be able to forgive all of my bullies. If I didn't have them... I'm not sure I would have, or ever would.  
...  


I don't mean this as anything against you. I'm just hoping I can provide some insight to you from the other side.

"Oh god, the list goes on and on and on...

Here's a few common mistakes.

* Losing your cool in the thrill of the moment. You might be very interested in them, but don't profess your love, okay? This is not a Shakespearean play.

* Treating them like they're TOO important. Yep, you can seriously overdo it. 

* Not behaving like a human. Just relax, everyone isn't perfect and you don't have to save a schoolbus or be Captain Comfortable with everyone in the service industry that you encounter.

* Not putting the goddamn smartphone away. {edited for clarity}

* Don't have a fallback plan. Missed the reservation at the restaurant? ""Well, I thought maybe you'd like to do this other thing instead"" can be huge.

* Fail to compliment your date by the second or third time you see them. Doesn't even take words, an appreciative look or a smile can be a compliment enough. 

The list goes on."

"There is a difference with being at fault and being criminally negligent.

Car accidents happen all of the time but we don't put people in jail for causing an accident unless they were criminally negligent (texting, DUI, breaking speed limits etc.) and the LAPD found no evidence of Jenner being criminally negligent. Accidents happen all the time. Because she is still at fault the family of the deceased can sue her in civil court for damages so it is not as ig nothing will happen either. "

"That's one thing I absolutely love about WoW. It *is* huge. And each zone is so unique as well. There are some truly gorgeous places in that game. I've played for years and even now I sometimes just get on my mount and go exploring. It's relaxing.

On the other hand, the game does feel ""smaller"" even though more zones have been added, due to the addition of LFD and being automatically teleported to your dungeon. But I also get why LFD got added and at this point it wouldn't really be possible to remove it.

Still, WoW is a beautiful game and I recommend it to people on that basis alone, especially since there are so many different ways you can play. You can get a lot out of that game without setting foot into a dungeon or a raid. Some people simply like to level and explore and that's a perfectly valid way to play. But if you're a competitive player, WoW's high end raiding/dungeon (Mythic+) scene can be extremely competitive and then there's the PvP side of things as well, so basically there's something for everyone."

Now, I like bats. They’re awesome creatures, and they get a bad reputation. When one gets into my house I catch it and let it go outside so he can eat bugs and go in his merry way.

"Traditionally / originally, the recipe would have been rye because that’s the variety of whiskey that was commonly distilled in New York.

Prohibition happens in the US, and Canadian whisky becomes the go-to.

Takes a couple years for US distillers to catch up once Prohibition ends, because of the months/yearslong aging process with whiskey. Flash forward to our modern day tastes and marketing, and bourbon is the most commonly distilled variety among American whiskies. 

Rye’s gained a bit of a foothold over the past ten years or so as the public’s become more interested in “classic” cocktails and reviving traditional recipes. Along the way, people have learned to mix Manhattans with any of the above mentioned varieties, and that’s the taste they’re accustomed to.

Personally, I much prefer rye. But the only thing that matters is what tastes good to *you*."

"One of my best friends from childhood developed a pretty severe drinking problem in his early 20s and turned into a complete raging asshole.  Before everything went down, he had been kicked out of his parents' house in our hometown, so I invited him to come stay with me on my college campus to give him the opportunity for a fresh start away from his toxic family.  He got a job as a server and devolved pretty quickly into partying - hard - with his coworkers.  At first I didn't think much of it; he had come from a shitty situation and was just blowing off some steam, he would get his head on straight soon enough.  Besides, the rest of my friends and I were always out drinking, so what was the big deal?  I neglected to appreciate the fact that we were still going to school, getting things done, and he was literally just going to work, getting blasted after, passing out, sleeping all day, then doing it all over again.  Literally all he did was sleep, work, and drink - rarely helped around the house, didn't buying groceries, etc.  He starts sliding further after a while: started drinking away his share of the utility money, then the rent money, putting away fifths of vodka in a go, getting into fights in bars, trying to drive drunk.  He hit one of my friends (his roommate, no less) after she tried to take his keys from him at a bar.  

We tried to stage an intervention for him and he stormed out, and retaliated by threatening to kick out one of our mutual friends who wasn't on their lease, but had been helping pay the bills.  One night at a party, he asked to talk to me and I agreed, hoping (foolishly) that we could work things out.  The conversation started off innocently enough: why was everyone so mad at him?  I should have seen it coming considering how willfully obtuse he was being, but he got *pissed* when I told him that his drinking was hurting everyone around him, and that more than anything we were worried about him.  His demeanor changed completely, and he started yelling at me about how I was in no place to judge him, that I didn't know the first thing about him.  I told him that I had known him since we were six, and knew him better than most people; that claiming otherwise was bullshit.  He retaliated by pulling up some truly painful shit from my past, and telling me that it was my own fault that it had happened to me; that he had never told me before, but now he wanted me to know that I deserved the abuse and trauma, that no one loved me, that he had only pretended to be my friend because he pitied me.  To call it a low blow is selling it incredibly short - it was a betrayal beyond what I could have conceived from someone I considered to be the closest thing to a sibling that I had.  He knew the worst way that he could hurt me, and executed it with surgical precision.

I was sobbing, my then-bf was pounding on the door and threatened to break it down because he could her me crying and couldn't get into the room.  Ex-friend unlocked the door, and threatened to kill him if he tried to get me out of that room.  I ended up having to call the cops on ex-friend because he was getting violent and threatening to kill everyone there.  
  That was the last time I've spoken to him.  Breaks my heart that he went down such a dark path, but you can't come back from something like that. 

TLDR; friend developed drinking problem that brought terrible personality traits to the surface, betrays mine and my friends' generosity, says truly unforgivable things to me, and threatens to kill everyone.  I call the cops on him, we never speak again, and I am still sad that the person who was once one of my dearest friends is gone."
"It erupted. Multiple times, for 1,5 years. I thought I had IBS, anxiety and depression all at once. For the last time the pain got so bad I almost passed out.

Check your tummy folks. Haven't felt any anxiety after it's been removed. "

"Oh I think I get it! Just trying to logic this one out so lemme know if I’m way off. A constant force (pressure) is applied through the pipe. Assuming no friction, the flow would be something (x) evenly through the pipe. If there is friction, the flow on the inner surface of the pipe must travel less than x (because a force is exerted against the flow) but the pipe pressure hasn’t changed so the flow that isn’t touching the pipe surface has to travel faster as a result (so basic physics holds true.) i assume its more complicated than that but am I close?

His parents saw the entire thing but said to him 'come on we don't have time we got to go.' They didn't say anything to me and that kid had to walk out with nothing while all his family and brothers and sisters got their ice cream.

I went to buy a couch last year, and I don't own a truck so I paid for their delivery service. Set it up for my day off a couple days later.

They no showed. So I called customer service and they told me the delivery company was moving warehouses that day and rescheduled the delivery for my next day off. They also assure me that I'm going to be refunded for the delivery charge.

That day comes around and no delivery. I call and ask what's going on - this time they've lost my couch in the warehouse. I tell them to cancel the order and give me a refund. I then asked a friend to come help me get this couch, but I had to buy the couch AGAIN because Ikea couldn't set it up for me to just pick the damn thing up. Fine. I needed a couch so I sucked it up.

A week later I'm still waiting for my refund, so I give them another call - turns out that even though I had 4 different people tell me the refund was processing I had to go INTO THE STORE to finally get it all refunded.

Such a headache.

"Think about 0 and 1 being absence vs. existence. Contrast. All you need is nothing, and then something. Then expand that concept. In terms of “wavelength”, I assume you’re thinking electromagnetic radiation. Now imagine you were sending me constant a signal, “blue”. That’s your 0. Now send me intermittent “red”, and those are your 1’s. You can alternate, and now you’ve got binary. Now do this with every wavelength. And that’s just wave length. As someone else said, there are other “signals”, like, duration, that can be used to setup a different “channel”, so that you can fit more information into a single “pipe” at one time. So, any time there is contrast, and change, there is information being conveyed. And if you’re using a computer that can detect very minute changes, you have much more to signal with."

"It does to the degree that people who are married (or in an equivalent cohabitating/committed relationship) have more financial stability, at least if both are working. And if you don't stay with your kid's other parent (more likely if the child is born out of wedlock), that can have huge consequences for you. As just an example, a relative of mine broke up with her boyfriend shortly after their baby was born. They have split custody, and the court order is that she can't live more than a certain number of miles away from the dad. But that area is crappy with no job opportunities, and even though she has a college degree in a STEM field, she works a shitty job and is impoverished, living in a bad neighborhood."

"I could make this one into a longer story to share but I'll give short details. I was 12 years old at the time, one day I was climbing trees because they were fun, I climbed 2 on that day. 1 that went perfectly fine and 1 that didn't go so well. The one that didn't go so well had thin branches that fell off after I'd climb on the tree.

I climbed to the very top and it was time to get down you know, at 5 branches down, I didn't see an easy way to get down so I'm fucked. Although I had my helmet on since I was lazy to take it off while riding my bike or scooter. This branch fell and I tried to hold onto the branch on top of me but that didn't go so well.

I fell pretty high, I didn't hit any branches, my tailbone hits directly to the ground. Thankfully it was pinestraw and dirt. When I hit the ground, my knee hit my jaw thinking my braces are all fucked up and my jaw was displaced. I think I'm a tough boy shortly after I fell down, by that I got up like a normal person then I feel major pain in my tailbone and ass.

I felt so nauseated from the trauma and stress. I shit you not I felt like this was the end of my life. I had to get home and it was so hard for me to walk. I went back to the street walking in pain to hold on to my scooter to support me while I walk back home. It would normally take a full minute to scooter to the area I was climbing trees at.

It took me about 15-20 minutes to get back since of how much pain I was in. I didn't have a phone at the time and there was nobody near me, I was all alone. Especially I was a loner back then and still am to this day, this happened 4 1/2 years ago.

Needless to say, I haven't climbed up a tree since then."

Our species would be better off if we were **temporarily** sterilized as children  **in a reversible way** and then applied for fertility / having children when we actually wanted to have them. There are a lot of easy and obvious arguments to make against this idea, but the reality of what you're arguing for boils down to giving people the option to do something they would not choose to do - the definition of unplanned pregnancy. Other ways to attack the idea are saying it could be used to deny various races and other *undesirables* the right to procreate. That doesn't attack the idea, it merely projects your fears onto society. You're probably right, though.

"getting some dudes to buy weed with a $10 i had and they bring back a crack pipe, so i end up smoking crack in a doorway while it rained with 2 dudes i just met. other time was trying to shelter from a storm and a dude said to come to his house. i was in idgaf mode and freezing so i went to drink cider with him and his friend. tho i ended up falling asleep so his friend decided to molest me, then the other guy started punching the dude in the head and we left.

idk, don't trust people. i was 120% a dumb fuck and didn't really care if i lived in those days."
"If you think he's going to have a heart attack he will ! . 

I don't be like me. I suspected something about my father but never knew it was preventable. And guess what it pretty easy to access your heart attack risk and current cardiovascular health. They don't just come out of no where . A good doctor  can usually see them coming from a mile away and take preventative measures to set your cardiovascular system on a trajectory that prevents or delays heart attacks. 

Want to prevent it and not have regrets after ?please follow what I think would have helped me 


GO TO THE DOCTOR WITH HIM! If his stubborn and does take care of himself he's probably under playing what the doctors tell him. You can be his buddy to ensure be goes and does everything he has to follow up with.
First I'd go get his physical with him . Then go back after the lab works come in and ask as many questions as you can and get the doctor to spell out everything. If the doctor doesn't seem like he wants to spend the time  go to another doctor that will. Ask specifically you want to access his cardovascular health. Ask you want to consult a specialist.

You really should see if he needs a calcium score and stress test. A calcium score is outstanding method for accessing the probability of a heart attack for the next 5 years. . It will tell you risk levels in your age group, sex and ethnicity. If there is small traces of calcified plaque  he can take corrective actions or pills to reduce your risk. Like all test it's it has limitations so do read up on what it actually screens for and what it does not. I hope one day this test becomes standard and common knowledge like women and breast cancer and colonoscopies etc. Note stress tests only show immediate problems (70%+ blockage) not slow long term problems 

Please please this is 2018. We live in an age where we should never say yeah my pops will probably have a heart attack. There is no reason to sail in the dark. There are tools out there you just got to follow up and ask questions . Insurance doesn't want to pay for procedures but just like breast cancer it is easy to fix id you catch it early. But unfortunately heart health is not advertised even though it's top killer. 

Please don't let your thoughts become a reality  . I hope these  words  help someone .  I lost my father because of my ignorance if I can get just one person to start to ask questions and prevent another heart attack maybe my fathers death would mean something.

"Not a mechanic and I don’t have a car, but I can tell you with the 100% certain authority of a commenter on AskReddit that honks are actually a complex pneumatic system!

There’s an intake near the back of the cabin which sucks in the air as it wooshes past. This air gets pushed back up to the front of the car by a small electric pump. This system serves the dual purpose of making the process more efficient, and keeping the air cool so it doesn’t overheat and catch fire on the way to the honkbox. 

Once it reaches the honkbox, the increased pressure spins a small turbine, which rests lightly on a rough axle. The spinning against this axle creates a squeaking noise we call a “honk” (which is why you sometimes need to get your horn serviced! If oil from the engine gets on this axle, it will no longer squeak, and your horn will be weak!)

I’ve prepared [a diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/df/47/36/df4736c1dc45ad18142439edd8ce4856.jpg) which shows this process in more detail.

Hope that helps!"

"I gotta say to you and the others giving me praise, I really wasn’t looking for a teaching moment. I just wanted to see little Johnny cool kid get schooled. I’m lucky he didn’t get violent or bully other kids worse because I was 17 and wanted to knock a brat down a few pegs. I don’t think humiliation usually works with bullies, especially in front of a bunch of his peers. But what do I know I don’t have or want kids, or coach anything anymore, they’re kinda shitty. "

"A lot of guys don't have a healthy outlet for emotions that are seen as acceptable growing up (a lot of men stick to angry, horny, hungry) and a lack of a support system that will say ""Hey, the way you're acting is NOT okay."" So, these negative emotions build up inside and create an almost alternate reality for them. Since the only feedback they have is themselves, and that's obviously a pretty serious echo chamber, everything they think, say, or do is justified and anyone that doesn't agree just ""doesn't understand."" 

Unfortunately, these people often get bad enough to take it into dangerous, extremely creepy, or just flat out illegal territory and that's where a lot of these posts are coming from. Not saying this justifies anything in the slightest, just hoping to provide some insight because I've been there before (though luckily not as bad as these posts.)"

Just because she didn’t up and start punching and kicking the guy who was touching the most sensitive part of her body and wouldn’t minorly adjust his body placement for her sense of comfort and safety, doesn’t mean that she couldn’t tell in that moment that her initial consent was just the excuse-invitation; her consent in his mind wasn’t necessary for him to continue doing what he wanted. 

This is INCREDIBLY important: Her response in that moment is not a “surrender of consent”; rather, it is a freeze response, a natural fear based survival mechanism that is the primary refuge of many victims of sexual violence. Sex should be a tango, not a gauntlet. "

Behind the door, I can control time there so I decide when it's noon and I decide when it's midnight. I can just let time move as it does in the normal world if I want to.

I can also control the season. If I want to feel cozy, I can just decide that's it's winter and stay inside with a hot chocolate while admiring the blizzard outside. If I wanna go for a tan, I decide that it's a hot summer day and I go to the beach.

If I'm gonna spend eternity here, I might as well have a good time. 

The beach is not far away from the mansion. There, I can hang out with my best friends and my first love. We swim, we play football,  we play video games in a small cabin by the beach. Whatever we feel like doing, we can do it.

The Last Man on earth. I am now boycotting fox for that fucking piece of shit cliffhanger ending.
"Some that really pissed me off:

**Dark Matter** - A show I really enjoyed, but got cut like most great shows of SyFy. Unfortunately it doesnt seem that it will ever get saved like The Expanse, but one of the creators/writers/producers /u/JosephMallozzi has given some idea of where it could have gone.

**Reaper** - Hilarious show that probably would have done better now than when it originally aired. Ended on a HUGE cliffhanger and left so many questions unanswered.

**The Mick** - Recently ended and I was sad because I enjoyed the show (Jimmy was the best) It was getting better and better and ended on a cliffhanger too that we will never know what will happen.

**Great News** - It was Tina Fey's latest project (she even had a role where she was like a female Jack Donaghey) and I thought it was pretty great, but the rating weren't and it got quietly cancelled.

**Everything Sucks** - This one surprised me because it is a Netflix original and they didn't give it a chance past the first season, which I thought was fantastic. Reminded me a bit of Freaks and Geeks, but set in the 90s. "
"PRETTY LITTLE LIARS. I still feel betrayed.

"Just to expand on this bare bones comment, MaTN does Let’s Plays, and is most well known for his Fallout New Vegas You Only Live Once run. He is consistently funny, is very informative about games he knows, and often hilariously terrible at ones he does not. He’s also relatively family friendly (almost no profanity), which was a plus for me after kids came along. His recent livestreams are an exception, though. 

I enjoy watching him play games that look interesting but that I will likely never have time to play, because he will try and follow the lore of the game, letting cutscenes run, and reading through things he finds. His SOMA run was great with this. He produces content regularly, and has varied long running series and one-offs. He’s the only LP’er I’ve watched so far who I immediately threw cash at when he set up a patreon. Can’t recommend his channel enough!"

She showed me some ""abusive relationship"" videos on youtube. I stood catatonic for a solid two-hours in the couch. I had no idea I'd been doing that, and for so long. Sometimes crying. Sometimes not. Manipulative, abusive. That was 2 years ""in"" our relationship. I recognized so much shit I did on those videos, examples and things like ""I didn't go out with my friends, you shouldn't go out with yours"". When I had the **balls** to leave the living room, I gave her a long hug and went to bed, at like, 3pm. There I stood for the whole weekend. I also posted on reddit with a throwaway about being ashamed of my attitudes. Then, I simply changed. I read the whole weekend about some behaviors I should avoid. I read ""The Loser List"" and even had the balls to ask her best friend (and then her) about which of those she did relate. She gave me a 14/20 of the list. She then proceeded to have the best 11 months of relationship ever, and then broke up with me, because on her words, ""When I showed you those videos, I wasn't expecting you to change. But you did. And I don't love you anymore like I used to. When I showed you these videos, I wasn't loving you enough already. I can't do this anymore. I won't go back to loving you like I once did, and I really tried.""

And that's it. The end of a 3-year relationship, whereas two sucked mad balls because of me. I just let her. I can't pursue her. Maybe, if my previous girlfriend had told me, I wouldn't do it this time, right?

**I can only thank her. Because my next girlfriend will have a fucking blast.**

"There are a lot of good ones for the original Pokemon game. Some of my favorites:

This is taking place after a very serious war. You meet a disproportionate amount of people who are very young or very old, there is a sophisticated medical center in every town, and Lt Surge straight up says he fought in a war. 

Pokemon are invading aliens that function similar to John Carpenter' The Thing in that they consume things and replace them. Thats why they all look like weird parodies of plants and animals. Then eventually they will control everything. Also, you could argue Mew is some sort of ""proto Pokemon"" that the others descended from. 

Team Rocket's main goal was to capture Mewtwo. They stole the Sylph Scope because ghost types are good against psychic. And thats why they wanted the Master ball. 

You killed your rival's radicate. When you see your rival in Pokemon tower, he seemed surprised to see you, commenting that none of your Pokemon are dead, implying he doesn't think someone without a dead Pokemon would be there. Then, when you fight him, the radicate he had the fight before is gone. 

This one was more of a web comic than a serious idea, but I did see something once that said that Mr Mime isn't a Pokemon, just some creepy dude dressed as a clown. 

Edit: one more I thought of; the pokeballs store Pokemon as energy and they are recharged at the Pokemon centers. MissingNo is the result of pokeballs that lost power."

What makes it a bad movie isn't the tone, which was actually I think *exactly* what they were going for, but how convoluted everything is.

"There are multiple reasons why many things don't make it to movie from a book. Some things are just difficult to convey. A lot of internal stuff for characters are just near impossible to convey on screen. Even an actors best performance doesn't necessarily portray the complexities of something like internal conflict.

Also, some things are legitimately unnecessary for being on screen. They don't add to the story. Or it's something like a short term character that has no real significance other than this one thing and there's no need to spend 5 minutes setting up a character for a single event when you can already use an established character for that same event and save the time.

There's a whole slew of other reasons. Often related to money. So if we do remove money as a factor then we're pretty much just limited by time and consistency so that the movie is capable of being understood and followed. So maybe instead of a movie you take that infinite money and make a series of it. Similar to Game of Thrones but with an unlimited budget, you're not restricted by those costs and can actually add more than 2 giants. You can actually show the dragons regularly. You can do more than 10 episodes a season. You can drag it out as long as you need to, basically.

Except pacing is still an issue. Yet another reason why some things get cut or added. You'll bore the audience to tears if you try to put everything from the book on screen. Going back to stuff like internal conflict; as a reader, you get better pacing by being capable of reading that kind of stuff. The drama and intensity that can be derived from even something like that is enough to keep your interest. Sometimes something that happens for many pages only takes up mere seconds in time. It's extremely difficult to convey all of the internal struggle of a character in the first place, let alone doing so in a matter of seconds. Sometimes that struggle in a book takes place surrounding slower paced things so placing that in a live action format removes the intense moment and just elongates the slower parts. Even if they're necessary they need to be placed properly so you don't get bored as a viewer.

None of this is to say that it couldn't be done, taking a book and putting it on screen verbatim. But even with an unlimited bank role, you're going to be hard pressed to actually transpose a book to a movie (or tv) while keeping *everything*. Something will get lost. "

"I like people like you. Idk, I guess it seems that what you like is the basic spirit of what political debate should be. It's so nauseating hearing people just recite the headlines they saw and nothing more. What's the point?

It's frustrating for the people who debate like that though. I'm constantly accused of being conservative when I'm talking to liberals. Like no, just because I'm willing to discuss the logistical ramifications of building a wall on the border, that doesn't mean I'm a racist conservative. Nor does it mean I'm even defending what I'm saying - it's a mental exercise and talking hypothetical doesn't change whether or not a wall is build. 

It's frustrating. The world isn't led by rationality. It probably never will be, because too many people just want to hold an opinion and feel right. Oh well. "

"We had a boss who had a policy that you had to take 4 days minimum for annual leave. We worked in mining so we would fly to site and his argument it created flight changes, which was true but leave created flight changed regardless and generally people only wanted one or two days off a year. Generally people would take an entire roster off. So, according to the policy you could take 7 days off of an 8 day roster but not 2 days. 

So what happened was the shit employees would just call in sick when they wanted less than 4 days off. People with morals just sucked it up and took 4 days or missed whatever it was they wanted less than four days for. The problem was two fold. Good employees got bitter because bad employees did what they wanted and we would often be under-staffed as a result of unplanned leave. 

We eventually we able to get the policy changed by going to Fair Work Australia. An employer cannot refuse a reasonable request of leave and the policy was deemed unreasonable. "

"TL;DR: About 60.4 Petabytes per Minecraft world

Long answer:

Before I answer this question, it’s important to list a few details about a Minecraft world and its structure:

Chunk: A square area of 16 blocks long, 16 blocks wide, and 256 blocks high.

Mca: A file format which is used to save parts of the Minecraft world. A square of 32*32 chunks (Height doesn’t matter, as it’s still 256 blocks). Average file size = 4,400 KB.

The size of a Minecraft map: 60,000,000 blocks wide in both directions (still 256 blocks high).

Now that we know the details, let’s do the math.

We know that a chunk is 16 blocks wide, and an mca is 32 chunks wide. That means a mca is 512 blocks wide (32*16=512).

When we divide a Minecraft’s map length by a mca length, we know that a Minecraft map is about 117,187.5 mca files wide (60,000,000/512=117,187.5).

That gives us a total area of 13,732,910,160 mca files per map (117,187.5^2 = 13,732,910,160).

To create that number of mca files, considering an average mca file is 4,400 KB, we need about60,424,804,700,000 KB of free space.

60,424,804,700,000 KB = 60,424,804,700 MB = 60,424,804.7 GB = 60,424.8047 TB = 60.4248047 PB

So there you have it. 60.4 Petabyte of space for a Minecraft world. Here are some fun statistics about this number:

You’ll need more than 60,500 (average) computers just to store a fully generated Minecraft world.

In order to store a fully generated Minecraft world, you’ll need more than 4 of the current largest data array in the world (15 PB).

This Minecraft world will take more than half of the upcoming largest data array in the world (IBM, 120PB).

With an average download speed of 14 Mbps, it’ll take more than 136 years to download the Minecraft world.

"It isn't methamphetamine (the breaking bad drug). Methadone is an opioid pain killer. You can find methadone clinics all over the place. But it's used as a pain killer, or a way to taper someone off of opioid addiction. It seems counter intuitive, and to be honest, I'm not sure of all the fine details, but I think the way drug addiction and withdrawal is presented in high school health classes makes people think that withdrawal is a mind over matter thing (at least in my hick school). It isn't, and quitting  opioids cold turkey is actually pretty dangerous. It's better to use methadone to taper off, or cut down gradually to prevent serious damage, or even death (death is more likely when you cut benzos out suddenly).  Now, as it is an opioid, it is possible to overdose and develop a dependence, if you don't follow doctor's orders. But unborn babies are especially susceptible to this. Unfortunately, right now, putting drug addicted mothers on methadone is our best ""least shitty"" option. It's hard, but it's easier to wean a baby of the methadone than to have it be born with HIV or worse. "

"I was working as a costumed character at an Valentine’s Day diner evening event. me and some other workers were dressed head to toe in a cloak and mask costume so you can’t see the person underneath. The costume is meant to be a bit scary and intimidating but nothing to bad. 

So the dinner is finished and the guests start to come into the attraction, I had done a few of these events before and know that there will be a lot of drunk people but at first everything was fine. We scared a few people and had some photos and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Then this really short man comes up to me and just stands in front of me and starts staring and pulling a very creepy smile and licking his lips. I knew instantly that this guy was trouble but played along to hope he would go away, I tried to make him jump and took his glasses and he just stands there. I am behind a barrier because there had been problems in the past with characters getting harassed so we had to keep some kind of protection between us and the guests, the barrier is small and I didn’t have much room so I try to walk away but he follows. His wife I think notices and comes up to him and says to him “it’s ok honey you win, you win” and he walks off and does it again to another character.  I don’t think he liked that we were female characters that weren’t scared or interested in him. 

Not long after that he starts to be abusive to his wife and staff and throws his drink. Security then watch him and when he notices he kicks off and storms up to a one of my coworkers who is standing by tenser barrier and she asked if he is ok as the area he was walking into was closed and he push’s the barrier into her and goes into the area. Then he starts to threaten one of my managers and finally squared up to security who were all a lot bigger. They take him out side and he starts throwing things and pissing in front of other guests so the police are called and he then fights with them and gets arrested. At first were thought he was just very drunk but later his wife said that she was glad he got arrested otherwise she would have been at the receiving end of his rage when they got home.

As in, people would have had no way of knowing that Plato hadn’t just invented Socrates as a character instead of him being real. Luckily, a few other writers included him as a character with similar details, which allowed us to be relatively certain. But then the Socratic problem comes in where we are unsure where the views of Socrates ends and the views of the philosophers who wrote about him begin. The solution is comparing the attributes from the 4 or 5 sources we have on Socrates, and trying to separate the personal musings of say Plato for example from what Socrates truly thought and said. Fascinating stuff. "

"Can we extend this into respecting kids' wishes over trivial things? (not eating veggies, bathing and sleeping and the likes aren't trivial btw)

Because it also teaches consent and respect to kids earlier on. If a kid doesn't want to hug someone, then don't force them to, or they might grow up thinking that it's okay to force such issues, or that they don't have a choice. And neither of those options is okay. 
Same goes for sharing. If a kid doesn't want to share a toy, they don't have to. You wouldn't share your phone or laptop with another person, so why would a kid have to give up their stuff because ""the other person asked nicely.""
Same goes for cutting a kid's hair or picking out clothes, let them pick some stuff out and have some autonomy. Respect their choices, even if they're a bit daft at times. "

"Yup, I used to work at a Target store who was just as shady.  In Fresno, CA.  On Shaw/Marks.  Target #275.  If you happen to be someone in charge over there and you're reading this, then fuck you!  You all run your store like shit and you deserve every bit the bad attitude your employees all had.  Well, that was back around 2008.  Maybe there's a better quality of leadership there by now, maybe not.  I have no idea since it's been 10 years and I don't even live in that state now.  But if you were in charge over there around 2007, 2008, then I will stick to my fuck you!

I do know that right before I was let go, one of the biggest examples that sticks out in my mind was one of the kids working that early morning shift with me got fired for getting stabbed on his way to work.  Seriously.  This store was kind of right on the border between some more nice areas of Fresno and the more shady areas.  You walk down Marks towards Shaw, can be pretty shady.  We'd clock in at 4am, so early as fuck this kid was walking to work.  He didn't have a car.  Gets fucking pistol whipped with something hard and manages to turn around.  Gets stabbed for turning around, gets his wallet ganked.  Obviously no-called no-showed to work that day on account of bleeding out in the middle of the fucking street and all and getting ambulanced to the hospital.  Comes back, was all stitched up and has a big ol' bloody bandage to show under his shirt for the trouble.  Still working while it heals, because I'm sure in addition to not being able to afford taking time off work, he doesn't want the extra hassle and bullshit from our illustrious leaders over calling out even further and taking the extra time off and losing his job for it.  Within a week or so, they fired him for not being at work the day he got stabbed."

"Yeah... I find it funny [and depressing] how americans like to claim theirs is the land of the free... but they have so many restrictions on silly things as well big stuff.

I just found out a few days ago that americans can't distill their own drinks. It's illegal to make distilled alcohol without a federal permit in the US.

A person is prohibited of making something for themselves... instead the government forces them to buy from companies. That doesn't seem like the land of the free to me.

I understand if they imposed law prohibiting the sale and distribution of spirits without licence... since the person buying a drink have an expectation of safety... but it's illegal to make spirits.

It's absurd in my opinion. Distilling your own drink is very fun...

EDIT: Without a permit... forgot the out.

EDIT 2: For people saying it is legal... They don't know anything.

&gt; You cannot produce spirits for beverage purposes without paying taxes and without prior approval of paperwork to operate a distilled spirits plant. [See 26 U.S.C. 5601 &amp; 5602 for some of the criminal penalties. You should also review our Home Distilling page.] There are numerous requirements that must be met that make it impractical to produce spirits for personal or beverage use. Some of these requirements are paying excise tax, filing an extensive application, filing a bond, providing adequate equipment to measure spirits, providing suitable tanks and pipelines, providing a separate building (other than a dwelling) and maintaining detailed records, and filing reports. All of these requirements are listed in 27 CFR Part 19.

 &gt; Federal law states that it is legal to own a still of any size. It doesn't matter if you have a 1 gallon still or a 100 gallon still. According to the feds, it is legal to have a still for decoration, distilling water, distilling essential oils, etc. The still does not need to be registered with anyone and no permits are needed as long as it is being used for the aforementioned purposes. **However, be advised it is illegal to distill alcohol without having either a ""distilled spirits permit"" or a ""federal fuel alcohol permit."" It does not matter if the alcohol is for personal use only, not for sale, etc.**

"1. Give yourself an extra 30-60 min to get ready than you think you need.  I take a while to get ready in general and I like a cushion of time in case I mess something up, want to change last minute, or just to have some time to read or watch something relaxing before I go out.

2. Especially if you're a girl, send a friend a picture of your date, an address of where you'll be going, and a time that you should be home by/otherwise check in with them by (either code words or calling).  Lots of unexpectedly scary people out there, better to be safe than sorry.

3. Obviously you should be yourself but my mind goes blank when I'm nervous.  If you already know a little about the person, come up with a few things you have a common, a few interesting things about them to ask about, and a few interesting things about you to talk about (or just the last one if you don't know the person at all).  Try to let the conversation flow naturally, but it's nice to have a few key things to fall back on if you're really stuck.

4. Make sure to ask about them.  It makes people trust you more and be more open and I can't tell you how obnoxious it is when the other person is too busy talking about themselves to try to get to know me.  Balance is important.

5. Remember that one awkward night is not the end of the world.  I was a nervous wreck on my last first date and it went so uncomfortably that I thought the guy would never speak to me again.  We've now been together for a year and a half.  Just relax and have a good time :)"

It depends on context and the way the questions are asked.

For example, someone working as a security guard probably has a higher occurrence rate of citizens arrests. A security guard working alone may find themselves in a situation where they have to rely on a dispatcher to call the police. Or they may have to walk someone to an office to call.

In that instance, asking how long you are able to detain someone legally before contacting the police isn’t an unreasonable question to ask someone.

If you’re asking a question about being able to legally “gag” someone you’ve arrested who is persistently attempting to bite you or spit at you, again not an altogether unreasonable question.

Better yet, make some simple syrup with mint leaves beforehand and you'll be able to make the drinks even faster. Pop that stuff into a squeeze bottle and you'll be ready to go all night.

He stated that the dates for the final group presentations were pre-decided and could not be changed. He said if she skipped that class, she would fail the course for the semester. When she said he was still going, the professor stated that having an incomplete group would cause her group mates to fail as well, not just the assignment, but the full course, if she wasn't there. Her group supported her and told her to go, but she didn't want to sink them. She missed the funeral and it's been one of her biggest regrets. In retrospect, she admits she should have gone straight to the dean or other administrative staff over the professor's head, but she wasn't thinking that way at the time."

"Saw a UFO when I was sitting in my neighbor's kitchen. The thing is that it was absolutely clear sky sunny day and it was relatively close to see some details. About 2 times closer than an average helicopter flying height.   It looked like that one on a ""I want to believe"" poster, but much more flat and very metallic in colors. It was immobile for a few seconds after I noticed it and then suddenly accelerated to what it felt like few times faster than a jet plane.

All UFO stories starts with ""it was a dark night"" or ""I was in a forest/fields"", but I saw it damn clear. If it was a plane I would be able to tell exactly what was this plane's model.

 It’s a win–win: Uber would not exist without the drivers; the drivers would not exist without Uber’s technology.   It’s a collaboration.  And it works to their mutual benefit.  Nobody is holding a gun to the drivers’ heads and forcing them to work.  It’s entirely by choice.  

Self driving cars are inevitable.  The technology is already here and is simply a matter of being refined.   This is not Uber’s fault.  And if Uber doesn’t adapt and embrace the new technology, it will be out of business, and thus the drivers will be out of a job.  

Concurrently, self driving cars are inevitable.  The technology is already here and is simply a matter of being refined. This is not the driver’s fault. And if the drivers don’t adapt and find new work, they will be out of a job.  This happens all the time. Innovation causes some industries to die and new ones to emerge.  People must adapt.

How about if Logan Paul goes to Japan, a country where whites have no institutional power?  Is he immune from being racist?

It breaks down because that supposed definition of racism being 'prejudice plus power' isn't the definition of racism at all.  It is simply prejudice based on race."

"&gt;The Sentinelese maintain an essentially hunter-gatherer society, obtaining their subsistence through hunting, fishing, and collecting wild plants; there is no evidence of any agricultural practices and no evidence of fire making.

&gt;Food consists primarily of plants gathered in the forest, coconuts, which are frequently found on the beaches as flotsam, pigs, and, presumably, other wildlife (which apart from sea turtles is limited to some smaller birds and invertebrates). Wild honey is known to be collected and the Sentinelese use a kind of rake to pull down branches to gather fruit or nuts, such as sapodilla and pandanus.

The majority of true oppression in modern society is unseen and heavily contextual, and I don't think most people would be exposed to it on the daily unless they live in/near it. The average teenager outside of that sphere of reference would, perhaps, have an inkling of it. 

You're spot-on about how they may feel oppressed in their lives, though. That's why another hallmark of these YA dystopias is that their problems are simple to solve, either by escape or upheaval. It offers the escapist fantasy that the world's problems are, similarly, easy to remedy, instead of horrifically complex."

"My sister very much over indulged her youngest (divorce guilt or something) and my niece was a real brat until she was about 11. Once when she was about 8 she was just being an obnoxious little shit at a family event and her loving grandmother (my mom) looked at her and said ""Maddie, I'm going to KICK YOUR ASS."" The kid withered, but I was like hey, it shut her up for a while."
"Funny how some spoiled kids clam up as soon as they run into an adult who won't put up with their shit.

One of my friends went to visit her friend who lived in Oregon with her kid. The mom had always been a hippie type but I remember her as having a spine once upon a time. She had a kid and would just let him walk all over her. He'd swear at her, talk shit, be an asshole and she would just put up with it. The two women were driving somewhere with the kid in the back and he was being a fuckhead like always when my visiting friend had finally had enough, turned and yelled at him ""HEY! Don't you talk to your mother that way!""

The kid apparently looked like he was going to shit himself and shut right up. She didn't even say anything extreme to him, just yelled at him to behave. I can only assume that he had never been talked to like that in his entire little life and didn't realize not all grown ups were going to put up with his behavior"
"Copyrights don't work that way.  The author of a work gets exclusive rights for a limited time (well, theoretically limited, since Congress keeps extending it) and then the entire work enters the public domain, at which point anyone can use it.  There's no ""I'm still making money on it"" escape hatch.  That would defeat the purpose of having copyrights expire, which is to encourage the creation of new works when the old ones have become public-domain.

You can produce a new version of a film by splicing in a few extra minutes of footage.  If the old parts are otherwise 100% identical, you can't go after me for distributing copies of the original film because you re-published it later in a different form.

"This happened 2 years ago. I was considering putting my apartment up on Airbnb and did a trial run with a friend of a casual friend who was in town with her newborn for a wedding. I was going on vacation that same week, so the timing was great and I was happy to have some extra sending money for the trip. 

Since it was a last minute arrangement, I spent two nights at my boyfriend's place before leaving for my trip, and let her know that I would need to pop by the apartment once before leaving to pack up a few things I had absentmindedly forgotten to pack. We agreed on a time and she let me know that I was welcome to stop by whenever as her and the baby would be out during the day. What I came home to was so awful. 

She had left what looked like a dozen pairs of her bloody panties all over my coffee table. I was shocked and didn't know what to do and settled on ""I'll just bleach every surface of my place when I get back."" After my trip, all I wanted to do was get into bed and sleep, but not before changing my sheets. Upon lifting my comforter, I discovered she had lactated in her sleep leaving massive stains on my comforter and all of my sheets (I had bought this new set for her arrival and future guests) that soaked right through to my mattress cover. As sympathetic as I am to the fact that she's a new mother and the trip was likely very taxing for her, it was just too much. 

Needless to say, she was my first and last guest of that kind. I was also too embarrassed to share any of this with the mutual friend who put us in touch. "

"I live in a country that currently has 9 parties in parliament. While some of the parties are much like each other, the smaller ones have a lot of actual differences between them, so there's usually a party that fits your own opinion pretty well. There are certainly ways to do party systems properly.

We have official party support, meaning that the state gives some money to the parties based on how big they are. This ensures that the parties are not reliant on donations. "

"Mostly confined, starved, kept naked, sexually mistreated, and malnourished from last September to March, drugged to make me accept it and not realize what was happening, then held hostage on St. Patrick's Day with the intention of him getting a gun back out of pawn and shooting me 46 times. Not kidnapped in the sense of abduction I suppose. I already had extensive therapies for PTSD and I deal with this sort of thing very well. I took my life back, my ex-husband has been convicted, divorce is finalized in September because of state mandatory minimum waiting periods. Are you SURE that you want to get divorced from a psychotic asshole? Well gee, let me think about what God wants. My divorce court judge feels so bad that he has no discretion to waive that, but moral panics don't really care about exceptions. My take is that we said ""until death us do part"" and he decided to cash in that chip so why do I gotta be yoked to him just because he's bad at killing women? Sigh. His life isn't gonna be great from here on in. Not my circus anymore.

I do not do well with being expected to hide or be meek or be a ""compliant victim"" which is constantly emphasized in the victim assistance program that capped my financial help at $1000. It wasn't even enough to pay my rent to stay in town for trial as required for ""compliant victims."" They honestly expected me to sell my car and trailer, to which I have clear title, get rid of my dog who turned against my husband and still stands watch over me, and move into a temporary shelter. I'm probably more angry at them than at my ex, who did what he did because he is a criminal and an awful waste of a human being. Helpers should actually, you know, help people. Especially if they're getting paid to help.

Reddit helped me far more than the financial award from Victim's Assistance.

My family and former friends neither understand nor sympathize. They are Professional Public Good Persons who can't handle having the line between ""helper"" and ""victim"" being erased so directly. Not only did 99&amp;#37; of them mock and belittle me when I tried to call them for help, but at least one of my cousins has been trolling me with personal shit on throwaway Twitter accounts for the past two months. The only thing they're sorry about is that I lived.

Most people I knew before I freed myself, I have come to see as a painfully limited group of cowards who are only in public service for the paycheck and the awards. When it comes to getting their hands dirty, in retrospect they always looked down on it with a kind of sneering contempt. For other people, I have endured getting shot at, getting death threats, I live in poverty while my bullshit cousins pal around with millionaires and enjoy their third vacation homes. Escaping the murder plot, and the therapy afterward, helped me connect a lot of the unease I already felt with these people.

It crystallized for me why they'd refer to every job I ever had as a ""hobby."" Why they made fun of work with sexual assault survivors. Why, after I was raped as a kid, suddenly I was the only one of my grandfather's grandkids not invited to the holidays year after year - and why nobody even noticed my absence. A lot of people SAY they would help someone in my situation. Almost none of those people are capable or willing to suffer the slightest inconvenience in even life-or-death situations. And a lot of those people help others as a means of feeling powerful and superior. They can't ever allow themselves to feel like they could become victims, which sucks for them because their money and power have not prevented them from suffering violence. It prevents them from dealing with it and they suffer in silence. Especially now that they've seen what happens when one of them is in extreme need of help: they know that their family absolutely will not be there for them if something happens. And they don't have the inner strength and reserve to be there for themselves, because they've been taught that being a victim is weakness.

Thank God I was only raised with that shithole family for the first seven years. Thank God I was a bastard in a family where that mattered, because that always set me apart from them - it was intended to set me below them, but I can be awfully obtuse about that sort of thing. Thank God that their behavior was so appalling, I no longer care for their approval. I'm sad that they aren't good people at heart and that they will continue to hurt themselves and each other, and I'm leaving them to suffer their own awfulness. I have a life to lead, man.

Reddit was nicer to me and more of a comfort than my own family and ""friends."" Y'all bought me pizza, paid for my storage unit when I found out he'd been kiting checks, paid half my lot fee one month and kept me from getting evicted. Y'all told me I was strong when I needed to hear that.

I feel so awake. Not in a concerning overstimulated way, just in the way that I always feel after I've dealt with someone else's trauma or my own: I feel competent, tough, determined, certain. My new therapist specializes in people for whom trauma is sort of a ""norm,"" and I'm not defined by dysfunction. I'm encouraged to date as long as it's with someone in a profession that exposes them to emergency situations. I have a great social calendar, I'm making new friends who know how to survive, and I'm strengthening some other friendships that now have all the room in the world to grow thanks to the absence of toxic people. Gainful employment... I'm supposed to wait until September. It looks like I'm getting back into teaching college. In the meantime I'm trying to sell photography, doing some online stuff, volunteering, and lining things up for the fall.

I even have a booty call going, though he's pretty freaked out and defensive about a woman with a weird sexual past and that's killed hopes of an actual relationship. Whatever, isn't that what the rebound is for? Some stupid fling that makes little sense? I know it's not the usual victim narrative, but what better revenge on the ex than to take all of that sexual flexibility, artistry, and skill he'd taken for his benefit... and use it to please some other dude as well as myself? I learned so much while I was confined. Gonna be a damn good year. A damn good life.

And quite frankly, Ireland is FULL of idiots that never leave their hometown and inherit the family farm. 

I love the facilities the US has that we totally lack and I really love the positivity I've seen in most Americans. You guys are so darn happy and eternally hopeful. The Irish could really do with adapting a more positive attitude, as a nation we are pretty cynical."

"Yeah, it's either pedo shit, or it's every female character being a sex object.

Like if I was watching Breaking Bad, and every time a female character bent over, Jesse got a stupid look on his face and tried to grab them, I would think, ""This is really stupid and ruining an otherwise great show."" Then some neckbeard guy would try to break down for me how Jesse grabbing the character's butts is actually high comedy and that I just don't understand."

"Any one of the main websites can provide you with the plants and tools you need to succeed. Flytrapcare.com, californiacarnivores.com, just use google.

Here are the major mistakes I see most people make.

1. Incorrect growing media. They cannot grow in soil or clay. They need peat moss, alive or dead with something to help the soil drain. (they have to live in a specific type of nutrient poor environment. The simplest is Long Fiber Sphagnum moss. Just avoid the Mosser Lee brand. It is shit. Also, you will need to wash any moss you get with distilled water.)

2. Incorrect water. The water these type of plants require also has to be nutrient poor. Anything above 50ppm will kill them. Pretty much all bottled water and literally all tap water will kill them. Sometimes as quickly as a single watering. They won't appear dead right away but, the roots are burnt and they will slowly fade way. You need either Distilled, Rain, or Reverse Osmosis water.

3. Too much water. Flytraps are not tropical. They grow in North Carolina and are not in any sort of swamp conditions. The live in the sandy fields of Wilmington NC. They get a lot of rain but the sand makes the water soak into the peat moss quickly. They then grow roots down to the water line (which is about a foot down) Water them and wait until the top 1"" of moss dries out before watering again. I only let my plants sit in water when it is going to be over 95F outside.

4. Flytraps need a dormancy. They must have a winter but, they should not get under 28F. They need this dormant period for at least 8 weeks. 12 is preferable.

5. Too little light. Flytraps live in big open sandy fields. They get sun all day long and love every second of it. The only time sun is too much is if you live somewhere that breaks 100F often. If so, put a sunshade above them. Otherwise, get them outside and in as much light as possible.


6. Too much light, too fast. Sounds contradictory but, it isn't. A lot of people will try to grow their fly traps indoors and they will grow but, poorly. They will grow long skinny leaves with tiny traps. They're growing in search of light. Then, they learn this, and they immediately throw them out into the sun. Then, they burn black. The issue is, when plant is grown in low light conditions, the layer of waxy portion of the leaves is made thinner and thinner to allow more light to pass through. So, When you toss them outside, they're not equipped to handle the drastic change. To stop this, introduce them slowly. Do an hour direct sunlight a day for 2 days. Then jump it to 2hrs per day for 2 days. Then go to 4 and then it will be fine.... In between, place them in a shady area.

She'll tell me things about race relations - both within the black community and within the larger ...all races community, I guess? - about which I had zero clue.  Regarding what you mentioned, she specifically said a phrase she'd hear growing up was, ""She can pass,"" which was apparently enviable because it meant that that person could pass as a white person who happened to have a darker complexion.  She also said this was common in the 60s-ish era when racism was sadly super prevalent.  So I guess what you said was carry-over from that time. 

She also oddly enough told me to pay attention the next time I heard a black person talk about anyone of Asian decent.  She said it's common to refer to anyone Asian as just Chinese.  I haven't had any sort of sample size to go on with this, outside of her saying so, so I have no idea if that's just unique to her and her sphere of influence."

"I was 17, it was New Year’s Eve, I had plans for midnight and I was getting out of work at 10. It was getting close to 10 and I was working the kid check near the ball pit. It was pretty slow since most had left early to go and ring in the new year. There were still a few families sitting at the tables by the ball pit. I was watching the kids play and noticed two kids throwing balls out of the pit. Those things take forever to round up. 

I walked over there and told the kids to stop throwing the balls out. The little shits wouldn’t listen so I turned to the parents sitting in the booth, who didn’t even notice. I told the parents to make them stop and they started yelling at me for assuming those kids were theirs. Now to be fair they were the only family there of their race but what she doesn’t remember is that I was the one who checked them. 

Before I could respond to her, a father at the table behind them started yelling at the family that was getting angry with me. Next thing I knew it was group brawl. From every direction parents were snatching up their crying kids and they ran for it. Arms and knees are flying and I’m trying to get out of the area without getting hit. 

That’s when I saw the woman next to me pick up the metal napkin holder. She swung it almost hitting me and smacked a man in the head with it. Blood started poring out of his head. Great. She goes to swing again and another person had grabbed a dispenser of their own and swung just in time to hit the the other woman’s dispenser. So now those two were going at it while the guy who got hit made his way to our office. 
I ran back there with them and police were already on their way. 

The fight started to spill into the main entrance/front counter area and one of the brawlers wanted to go into the back to fight the guy who just got smacked in the head. My boss finally yelled that the police had been called and they were on the way. All the families involved in the fight couldn’t get out of there fast enough. We did get the plate number of the woman who hit the man. 

The police showed up and questioned everyone who stayed behind after the fight. It took forever.I spoke to an officer and gave a written statement. The man was taken to the hospital and after emt cleaned him up it looked a lot better than it did before. Finally I got the okay from the police to leave. It was just before midnight and there was still a chance that I could make it to my friends in time. I walked in with 2 minuets to spare. It was a crazy way to end the year that’s for sure.Not long after that I moved out of state. About a year later I got a notice that I’d been summoned as a witness to the fight. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to go because it was just too far. Other than that crazy night I usually had a lot of fun at work. "

(Not to mention in my contractual agreement it stated I couldn’t work certain shifts due to my status as a student and I couldn’twork more than 20 hours a week.)My Manager wrote me up and took away the few shifts I had. (Usually 5-6hour blocks 2-3 times a week) for “not being a team player.” I walked out the night I found out about the write up."
"Don't keep it a secret, let the child know right away. *I Love You Like Crazy Cakes* is a good picture book to read to a child. You should also include your own pictures. The pictures of the people they're going to see, the orphanage (if applicable).

You should also find out about other adopted people so you can point them out. If Steve Jobs is on TV you can mention that he was adopted. So was Kristen Chenowith, Faith Hill, Ray Liotta, and of course, Superman. That normalizes it, you child sees they're not the only one.

I didn't get into the detail with my daughter about why she was given up, but I tried to cast it in a good light. I didn't know too many details anyway, but I know a little I'd rather not say.

As it turned out, we had a neighbor that had welcomed my wife and I into the neighborhood when we moved in, we became good friends with him. When we decided to adopt we asked him to be Godfather, and he accepted and then told us that he'd never talked about, but that he, too, was adopted. He'd always known but it wasn't talked about openly growing up, he felt like he was the only one. We go to church, this is something I see an example of God having His hand in my life.

The fact that my daughter is adopted occasionally gets questions, as we're different races, but it hasn't been a problem for her at school or with her friends. I know some other children aren't so lucky.

If you have any specific questions I'll be glad to answer them.

"An inherent limitation of our education system. A good student and a genius student look the same on paper when they get 100% on tests. It doesn't matter if the genius could have written a PhD level thesis on the topic while the good student studied for several hours. They get the same output.

This is what crushes many gifted kids once they get into the high school age and start realizing how unfair and absurd the system is. I can only imagine it crushes the true geniuses earlier and more thoroughly."

"Maybe it was this way.  OP pays developer for property that hasn't been built yet (off plan).  In the developer's accounts, until they transfer the completed property to OP that payment stands as a debt to OP as a liability but the developer still owns the land/unbuilt property as an asset.  If they go bust before transferring the property those things are unconnected in their accounts unless OP has some sort of specific charge over the property which they probably don't.  GS are also owed money but their debt is protected by a specific charge over the assets of the developer so in the liquidation they scoop all of the assets up to the value of what they are owed and the other creditors, including OP, get what's left, which is probably nothing. 

EDIT:  Like I say I don't know what happened to OP and its not my field but out of personal curiosity I did a bit of googling and found out

"A few weeks after my dog died, my parents went out to the store and left me at home. I was fairly young (11-ish) but still used to my parents trusting me to be okay by myself, being alone for an hour or so is pretty normal to me at this point in my life. 

So I’m sitting in my room, reading and listening to my radio. It’s about 4pm in December, so the sun is just starting to go down but it’s still pretty bright out. All of a sudden I hear something SLAM on my door. Like an adult was furious at me and was taking it out on my poor door. I honestly thought I was hallucinating but my cat was awake and staring at it too. I put my book down and really quietly pulled the covers over my head and my cat (and y’all I swear to god this cat hated being under covers more than anything in the world and she was FINE with being hidden that day). The slam turned into frenzied scratching and finally ended with something sort of sliding against my door and thumping at the bottom...

... Which was the same ritual my dog did when he wanted to sleep in my room but my door was closed. That slide-thump was like the fucking Head-On commercial of my life. It was so common and so distinctive that I will never forget it as long as I live. After he died and after that incident I have never heard that slide-thump ever again. 

Needless to say I was absolutely frozen in terror until my parents got home and my mom opened my door to ask me to help bring in groceries. It’s been about 10 years since this happened and I have no goddamn clue as to what happened that day. "

He was quite cute and friendly so I didn’t mind the flirting but he was a bit odd from the beginning. So as the bar closes we decide to head to their house with a large group of people. The plan is drinks, Mario kart, etc. and I’m with a bunch of people I know so I’m feeling really safe. 

As soon as we get there, the nice guy invites me to his room. I politely declined and suggested we chill with the group. He nags me a little more, and I continue declining. Then he goes into a RAGE, demanding that I come to his room immediately because he paid for my drinks and I owe him. At first I thought surely he was joking, but he grabbed my arm and tried to tug me toward his room. I broke free and he went to his room to sulk while me and my friends stare in shock. We all decide to go to my friends room to smoke and watch a movie while I waited for my uber. Within a minute or two, creepy guy appears at the door and says “are you fucking kidding me.” Presumably because I’m in another guys bed (platonically, with like 3 other people). He tries demanding that I join him in his room again before my friend locks him out.

"In high school, I worked at a pharmacy that sold lotto tickets. People would buy scratch-offs and then scratch them on our counters, holding up the line and making a mess. So we put a sign up that it was BAD LUCK to scratch your tickets on the counter. Lo and behold, not a single person did it after that. They all wandered off and scratched them elsewhere. I had no idea so many people were so superstitious/dumb as to think there was luck involved with where one scratches a ticket, the sort of luck that would affect the outcome. But then, many of these people were serial scratch-off players, some spending more than they probably should on the tickets, so being smart wasn't really a common trait.

In retrospect, it was pretty sad how addicted some of them were to scratch-off tickets. Still pretty dumb to think scratching on the counter was bad luck, though. "

"That pertains more to freediving, when freediving the volume of the air in your lungs shrinks as you descend. The threshold for where you become negatively buoyant depends on the individual buoyancy characteristics of the person (adipose tissue is much more buoyant than muscle). Scuba diving is different in that you are compensating for the pressure differences every time you take a breath."

"I personally don't think this one *is* stupid though because if you know the *basics* of states of matter then you know that solids are denser than liquids and probably don't think on it much past that, so when someone who *knows* how water is exempt from this general rule tries to explain it, probably a layperson's immediate reaction would be ""I'm not saying I know *how* ice floats on water, but I know it's not because it's less dense, because solids are denser than liquids"".

I imagine it would be sort of like explaining that lightspeed limit is a thing to someone who doesn't know about relativity and thinks you can just take something moving at c and apply a force to make it go faster. If you don't know how it works it's easy to think that someone who does must have misunderstood something because to the layperson they seem to be violating basic rules, so *surely* you don't even *need* advanced knowledge to know this is wrong.

Especially considering ""things get denser as they cool"" is much easier to understand than how it actually works with water"

"I think describing my husband would be a good way to answer this. I’m definitely the female version of the guy many people here are describing, who tended to smother and run men I was interested in off, mostly because of a lack of confidence and lack of well-roundedness and emotional health. As for my husband, he taught me quite a bit about this indirectly, just via his actions:

(This story starts off sounding sort of conceited but I’m not sure how to say it otherwise.) When my husband and I met, I wasn’t in a good place (I was in an abusive relationship I was struggling to leave behind), but he fell in love with me pretty quickly. In the past when a guy was into me who I wasn’t immediately into in return, but perhaps was curious about, his constant pursuit of me and reminders to me that he was into me were a turn off. It wasn’t for any reason other than I felt like my space wasn’t being respected, or my boundaries. Feeling smothered doesn’t feel good.

My husband, however, let me know he liked me, but his personality was otherwise very confident. Not confident that he would eventually “win me over,” but confident that he’d be fine either way. He wasn’t “black and white” about the unrequited love, in that he was able to accept and enjoy the middle ground of being my friend because he had other things in his life that brought him joy (friends, family, hobbies, passions) and he knew he’d be okay no matter what. When I told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship, he knew he had the freedom to decide for himself whether he wanted to stick around and be my friend and enjoy those aspects of the relationship, or walk away.

We got married around 4 years later. For about 2 of those years we were just friends. I definitely had an attraction to him but just wasn’t ready. But that attraction grew for many reasons, in part because in giving me space and respecting my boundaries, my love for him had room (get it? space? room?) to grow. He was the first man to really do that for me.

So, to answer the question, I think something men who tend to have success in relationships do is to respect boundaries, and have a well-rounded life, and confidence. They don’t put all their eggs into a basket with a woman and give any indication that his happiness hinges on her. That doesn’t mean acting aloof though. My husband is extremely sensitive and affectionate and hell, even the definition of “needy” sometimes (which I don’t mind at all, even if that word is negatively connoted) but he also doesn’t just cling to me. We both enjoy our space and hobbies as well as each other. So do that: be kind and generous and patient but also take care of yourself, do things you love, spend time with your family and friends, etc. All those things outside your relationship strengthen you as a person, making you more attractive and also giving you the energy and depth to be able to emotionally provide for someone as well as have the confidence to ask for things within the relationship when you need them."

They were fighting in the cafeteria and they got seperated, HR wanted to find out what is going on.

Guy 1 yelling says guy 2 has been putting thumbtacks on his chair on the 4th floor. Sounds outrageous right? floor 2 guy going up to floor 4 to put a thumbtack?

They fired guy 1. 3 Days later Guy 1 comes in with a cop to pick up his stuff, Uh oh Guy 1 hid a camera above his cubicle plugged it in and watched the footage of lo and behold guy 2 putting a thumbtack in his chair.

"Was banging my first girlfriend in my room. 18 at the time. Was going a little fast and I ended up ramming it up her ass but was clueless I did. She had a convulsion/seizure from the sudden pain. We called her mom and said the seizure ""just happened"" out of no where. I thought she had it from the amazing sex i was providing her.

Her mom came and took us the hospital. My girlfriend went to the bathroom and came back to tell me her asshole is bleeding. I didnt even realize I had sodomized her until she told me that ""you put it in my ass; thats why we are here""..

Needless to say we are no longer a couple

"CUT IN:

INT. TIM MEADOWS' HOUSE - NIGHT

*Bond casually walks through the shadows in an impressive mansion. After appearing to get lost a few times, he eventually comes to a large sitting room with a painting as its centerpiece.*

**BOND:** (*To himself*) Bingo.

*A sudden burst of static causes Bond to wince. M begins speaking through the man's earpiece.*

**M:** (*O.S.*) ""Bingo?"" Did I seriously just hear you say ""bingo?""    
**BOND:** Please stop shouting.    
**M:** (*O.S.*) You're supposed to have some witty-ass quip for everything, Bond!     
**BOND:** I didn't have one this time, okay?     
**M:** (*O.S.*) Oh, so, what? You just say ""bingo"" instead of keeping your mouth shut?     
**BOND:** Goodbye.

*Bond touches a button on his watch, muting the earpiece. He steps closer to the painting. As he's reaching toward it, another burst of static causes him to jump and knock over a nearby table.*

**M:** (*O.S.*) Oh, you did *not* just try to mute me!     
**BOND:** *Shhhh!*     
**MEADOWS:** (*O.S.*) Can you see what that was, baby?

*A hidden door opens in the wall to Bond's right. Beyond it, in an enormous bed, TIM MEADOWS can barely be seen. He is soon obscured by ANITA DICKINSIDEMERIGHTNOW, who comes walking into the sitting room wearing only a flimsy négligé. Her eyes go wide when she sees Bond.*

**ANITA:** James!     
**MEADOWS:** ""James?"" Who's James?     
**ANITA:** I, uh... that's what I say instead of ""Jesus.""     
**MEADOWS:** Why were you saying ""Jesus?""

*Bond gestures frantically at Anita. His motions don't make much sense.*

**ANITA:** There's, uh... there's a raccoon in here!     
**MEADOWS:** A raccoon?!

*Bond shoots an incredulous expression at Anita. She gestures back at him with tense encouragement.*

**BOND:** Cheep cheep! Cheep cheep cheep!     
**MEADOWS:** That don't sound like any raccoon I've ever heard!     
**ANITA:** Uh, uh... I think it's scared! It's knocking things over!     
**M:** (*O.S.*) Hey, man, is she naked right now?

*After jabbing his finger at his watch again, Bond knocks over another table. He begins scurrying around the room, making a mess of anything he comes across.*

**MEADOWS:** I'd better call security.     
**ANITA:** No, no! No, uh... they'd just shoot it!     
**MEADOWS:** Yeah, and?

*Bond pantomimes crying. Anita looks confused, but shouts back toward the bedroom.*

**ANINTA:** That would make me sad!    
**MEADOWS:** Why? You have some soft spot for raccoons?      
**ANITA:** Oh, yeah! My... I had a pet raccoon when I was a kid!      
**MEADOWS:** Well, get it out of there before it breaks something valuable!     
**BOND:** (*Whispering*) Close the door!     
**ANITA:** My clothes make me look like a whore!     
**M:** (*O.S.*) Damn, that's *better* than naked!    
**MEADOWS:** I mean, you picked them out, baby.     
**BOND:** (*Whispering*) Close... the... door!

*Anita nods, suddenly understanding.*

**ANITA:** I'm just going to close the door! You know, so the raccoon doesn't get in there!

*The hidden panel swings shut. Anita rushes up to Bond.*

**BOND:** What are you doing here?     
**ANITA:** What are *you* doing here?     
**M:** (*O.S.*) *Who* are you doing here, more like.     
**BOND:** I'm here for the egg!     
**ANITA:** What egg?     
**BOND:** The... flavor jay egg.     
**M:** (*O.S.*) Seriously?     
**ANITA:** ... The Fabergé egg?     
**BOND:** That's what I said.     
**MEADOWS:** (*O.S.*)(*Muffled*) Are you *talking* to that raccoon?      
**ANITA:** (*Shouting*) Just shooing it out! (*To Bond*) Look, be fast. I'll keep him occupied.

*Anita reopens the hidden door and struts through it, closing it behind her.*

**M:** (*O.S.*) You know how she's going to do that, right?     
**BOND:** I would prefer not to think about it.     
**MEADOWS:** (*O.S.*)(*Muffled*) Oh, hell, yes!

*M starts humming funk music over the earpiece. Bond squeezes his fists, then walks back over to the painting. He gently lifts it from its place to reveal a blank wall.*

**BOND:** ... Crap.     
**M:** (*O.S.*) No safe, huh, Bond?     
**BOND:** (*Petulantly*) No, there is no safe here.     
**M:** (*O.S.*) Uh huh. So, what are you going to do?     
**BOND:** I'm going to look elsewhere.     
**M:** (*O.S.*) Bingo!

*Bond trudges out of the room as the sounds of squeaking bedsprings become audible.*

George: Well, that's really not fair.

Jerry: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do you like?

George: Movies. I like to watch movies.

Jerry: Yeah. Yeah.

George: Do they pay people to watch movies?

Jerry: Projectionists.

George: That's true.

Jerry: But you gotta know how to work the projector.

George: Right.

Jerry: And it's probably a union thing.

George: (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports, movies what about a talk show host?

Jerry: Talk show host. That's good.

George: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.

Jerry: Really?

George: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?

Jerry: Well, that's where it gets tricky.

George: You can't just walk into a building and say ""I wanna be a talk show host"".

Jerry: I wouldn't think so.

George: It's all politics.

Jerry: All right, okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?

George: This could have been a huge mistake.

Jerry: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.

"I was going through a tough breakup and a guy I’d met through a friend group was really sweet and supportive through it. We’d go on hikes, go out for a drink and talk. Nothing at all creepy ever happened. One day I went to his place and we were just chilling in his bed watching tv. Up until this moment he’d made no passes at me, so I felt safe. He started putting the moves on me, and I declined. He then asked if he could take care of himself, and me thinking that meant he’d leave and do his business in the bathroom, I said sure. Nope. He whips his dick out right there next to me and starts going to town. All the while he’s groping me and groaning. I curled up in a ball and went stiff, in total shock at what was happening. After he finished I got up and made an excuse to leave. Never talked to him again. He would call and text and leave messages asking why I was being so weird and “I thought we were friends.” "

They showed up and tried to stay with us. When I asked him why, he told me it’s because he’d rather spend the day with them than alone with me. And he didn’t even offer to pay me back, nor did they, and I also got an earful for “not even attempting to look like I was having fun” and “embarrassing” him in front of his friends."

I then proceed to take my pants off, and insert the didgeridoo into my anus.  
I start vigorously playing using the air flow from gas trapped in my colon.  
The agent is immediately impressed, “I wish my butthole could do that”.  
I play the Aussie wood pipe for too long and fecal matter starts evacuating my rectal cavity through through the instrument.
The agent finds humor in this, “talk about some didgeridoo doo”
The horse sees the pile of dung and decided to join in, “neigh”
I invited the agent to join in but he respectfully declined, “I ain’t the Scat man”
Now there is a very large pile of poop in the room, more than the average person should ever see.  
At this point I am fully erect, my assistant is instructed to rip her clothes off, get a running start, and leap on to my penis.  
Clothes, off
Distance, 15ft
Palms sweaty 
Knees weak 
She runs, she jumps right on to my dick.  
Breaks it right in half, blood is spurring everywhere.
She freaks out and runs out the room. 
The agent is amazed, “Is it you Mr. Barkley?”
I get up, dick broken, spirits lifted, ready to pull it all together.
I grab the grenades, pull the pins, look the agent directly in the eye and say, “The Aristocrats” 
The grenades blow, I explode.
The agent is stunned, “Really went out with a bang”

"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

It’s crazy what weddings do to even the closest families. 
"When I was a teenager, maybe about 15, I was at Boy Scout camp with my troop.  The camp gave us all sports bottles, and various other things that we could cook and eat on our own time for meals and snacks.  One of the things they gave us was corn for popping...  well, I had figured out that if you put a handful of corn in your mouth, and take the straw out of the sports bottle, you had a nice little corn (and spit) shooter that could accurate shoot a mouthful of corn in about 10 seconds or so...  We had some fun for about 20 minutes...  Then a kid got hit in the eye.

I immediately felt bad and made sure the kid was OK, saw to it that he didn't need to go to the nurse or anything.  While I'm talking to him, an adult I'll call Dick comes over and starts yelling at me.  He wasn't the scoutmaster, just an over-involved dad who shirked any actual responsibilities.  Now at first Dick was justified in reading me the riot act.  I was leader, and should have seen that kids could have gotten hurt...  But...  He... Just...  Kept... Going...  Purple in the face, incoherent babbling...  No idea what he's saying except for the parts he's repeating.

I eventually get out that I would like to address the troop...  Our scoutmaster interrupts Dick and says that would be appropriate...

So, I call over the entire troop and basically apologized for setting a bad and dangerous example and I would appreciate it if they didn't to shoot each other with corn.  All in all, I think I spoke for maybe a minute.  I really did feel bad, and it was absolutely sincere, and doing that was one of the most memorable and formative things to happen at my young age.  I walked over to my scoutmaster and said that I would monitor to make sure nobody else did it, and he said that he was pretty sure that they wouldn't.  

Anyway, Dick wasn't done...  He wanted to yell some more, and so he tried to interrupt my scoutmaster with more yelling, and he asked me to do some chore or another to dismiss me.  As I walk away I hear Dick continuing to argue with him, but I can't really understand dick.  From across the camp, I glance over, and 4 other adults are behind my scoutmaster, and Dick is just incoherent...  Most of the kids were looking at him.

Once Dick settled down, the Scoutmaster came over to me and said he was proud of me, how I took responsibility, and addressed it publicly for all to see...  I asked him if Dick was going to be OK...  The Scoutmaster smiled and said, ""I think you handled it like an adult, and he handled it like a child, and deep down, that probably ticks him off even more""

I didn't love Boy Scouts, but there were a few men, and a few older kids, who taught me a lot, and I will always remember them.  Boy Scouts isn't inherently good, but when a troop has good leaders, it can be a good place to learn about leadership. "

"Went to a top 15 undergrad, so relatively prestigious. It was a really big deal from my background. My town is very small (technically a village) and hit hard economically in 2008, so high unemployment and drug use. To my knowledge, I am the only person from my town to ever go to a school of similar academic reputation. It was a culture shock at times to be surrounded by so many students who had access to significant resources, whose parents were paying for their schooling out of pocket, who were going to Paris for fall break, etc. My university also had one of the highest (if not highest) proportion of students whose families fall in the top 20% (and 1%) of US incomes. I was on an almost full scholarship and worked during the academic year and the summer to get by. However, I never felt that the other students treated me any differently because I didn’t have the money that they had. They definitely had opportunities that I didn’t, such as more study abroad options, unpaid summer internships in DC, and things of that nature that having money can give you easier access to. However, it all worked out, and now I’m going to law school in the fall to hopefully continue my upward mobility, though sadly no longer with a full scholarship. "

"Modern Democrat and even progressive ideas are not even close to Marxism though. That’s just how they are painted by the right wing. It isn’t realistic and nobody is actually pushing for that on the left. We are still capitalists.

The distinction is about elasticity of demand. The simple fact is that the profit motive can have no place in any transaction where the consumer has no choice but to buy. I.e. healthcare, emergency services, education etc.

The progressive left simply wants to remove corporate greed from those things that have perfect price elasticity so that the state can act on behalf of the public to control costs. At the moment supply side has all the leverage. If he has cancer, it’s not like the layman can shop around (without years of medical training) and then decide not to buy if he doesn’t like the price.

The free market economics that republicans profess to love, by its own definition simply cannot be applied to a situation like that without exploitation of the consumer."

Worst part is, she is the one that invited me out, not the other way around, and seemed very keen on it. Literally told **me** ""don't dare cancel on me, this is set in stone"". So I was left wondering what the fuck did I do in the meantime that made her go from inviting me and setting it in stone to not even telling me she wants to cancel. But we didn't even talk between her inviting me and the planned meet, so I haven't got a clue.

"I just said fuck it and asked. She and I were already fooling around and we had already had plenty of sex but it was all pretty vanilla. I like being dominated and hurt during sex.

I finally told her ""Hey, look. You and I have been fucking for a while now. I want you to do this to me"". Surprisingly enough, she was 100% okay with it and actually was into that stuff as well. Now our sex is 100x kinkier and weirder since we're both on the same page. In my case, I just happened to get lucky since she liked all that stuff anyway. I'd say just go for it and ask straight up. There's no use in sugar coating it or side stepping around it since you're embarrassed. What good is sex if you're not genuinely enjoying it? Everyone has their own fetish that gets them off. If he/she judges you for what gets you off sexually then you shouldn't be with them. The only exclusion from this is if it's something super odd like having him/her shit on your chest while shaking maracas or nailing you with a strap-on while wearing a Nixon mask. You should probably run something like that by them first before asking to have it done to you. "

There is a sidewalk out front, but there is almost no foot traffic.  Most customers park on the side of the street or in our parking lot.  No one actually walks from somewhere else.  Even the lady who works literally across the street.   She'll park out front of our building, then drive 10 feet to park outside of where she works.  It'd take her 15 seconds to park at her work and walk over.

"&gt; These reasons alone are why I hate cooking and do not find it fun. 

Most people (not all) don't you factor in the costs associated with not cooking, which is usually paying more money, getting unhealthy food, and still spending time. Let's ignore the factors of time and health.

When you eat out, you will spend substantially more money on food. To make that extra money, you have to work more or spend less on something else. So, often it comes down to whether it's worthwhile to work more hours so that you can afford to eat out.

For me, I'd rather save the money so I don't have to work more hours.

Using your numbers, Hillary would have only had 30% rounding. Less than a third. I fail to see how voter turnout has anything to do with this discussion other than using the popular vote percentage as an indicator of public consent. Because as you have astutely pointed out, using it as a specific hard number means most candidates in history have fallen far short of even 40% of overall voters, let alone 50%."

Now let me tell you, this was during fall and during this time we tend to get some of the most blinding pea soup fog around. I mean you can’t see ten feet ahead of yourself. Anyways, he got lost, tried to break into a parked car so that he could go home. He ended up almost getting ran over by some guys who called an ambulance for him. He got his stomach pumped in the hospital while his dad flew in from out of state to pick him up and move him away for two years. I missed that guy. My post rave vibe was killed instantly"

The understanding is that if the Dalai Lama refuses a successor, then the CCP is successful. If he appoints a new successor, like /u/MoralisDemandred said, the CCP can just parrot out the old one and declare Tibetan Buddhism a farce.

Except, they don't need the boy to be alive to win. The current Dalai has declared himself likely the last. And this boy would be too powerful of a martyr to stay alive, so they simply play in limbo, since the Dalai doesn't want to call their not-really-a-bluff.

"Doing some quick Google searching, you can find out that a human skydiver in the ""belly to earth"" position can reach a max speed (which takes into consideration air resistance) of 120 mph. The average distance to the center of the Earth is 3,959 miles, so doing some basic math and assuming that as soon as our diver starts falling they immediately hit max speed (not realistic but otherwise itd take ages for me to calculate this and it would have no massive impact on answer) it would take around 33 hours to reach the center of the Earth. But none of this matters, because way before you reach the center you will die of immense heat. The mantle, which is the layer of the Earth you find below the crust(the crust is what I presume you are standing on right now), reaches temps of 900 to 1600 degrees F at the very top (closest to the crust). And it's only 21 miles to the Mantle. So it'll take our diver only around 10 minutes of falling before they die due to heat (again assuming they hit max speed instantly, which is not realistic). So there ya go. May not be accurate because I only used Google and researched for like a minute, but it's a good start."

But he was basically not prepared in terms of equipment or experience, lost control and went into an uncontrolled descent early in the footage. Really scary.

Also he didn't have the right tank setup for a dive that deep, though it is unlikely he intended to go deep.

Only instead of deriving labour from non-human animals, it's food.

It was just a bunch of us 4th graders alone, and I remember everyone was wondering what was going on because they never up and left like that for that long and not come back. A couple of us left the room and walked by the teachers lounge and they were all sitting in front of a TV with the news on and I seen the buildings on fire. 

I still remember one of the teachers saying something about ""oh my god the kids"" when they seen us in the doorway. I look back now and just can't imagine how chaotic that day must have been for the teachers

It's a different distribution system; each restaurant usually carries one ""brand"" and each brand has their own version of pilsner, weissbier(s), and other.

I actually don't think it's a good system because sometimes I have to choose between having my favorite beer and having the food I want. It's kinda silly. The saving grace is that all German beer is pretty good. Imagine going to a restaurant that only serves different types of Budweiser...

"The weakness of the party to stand up to Trump out of fear of losing their seats. It's cliche to say, but it's true, that if Obama (or any president, really) had said or done even a fraction of what Trump has said and done, articles of impeachment would have been drafted overnight. They treat him like he's the drunk uncle who everyone just puts up with at Thanksgiving and then secretly talks about how terrible he is once he leaves the room. They're afraid to speak out against him because their constituents are pro-Trump and they don't want to be ousted in the next election. I respect a good mea culpa in saying ""You know what? I was wrong in supporting him"" more than I respect blind loyalty just to keep an office on Capitol Hill.

"Many many years ago, I was doing water observation and rescue for the swimming section of a triathlon.  I was the first kayak the swimmers passed, approximately 200 meters off shore.  I was to observe all swimmers and then follow the last person all the way in.  They stagger the starts- competitive young men first, competitive middle age men 2nd, competitive young females 3rd... all the way back to non-competitive seniors.  They do this so you don't slower groups getting trampled by the competitors. 

After \~3 hours the 2nd to last senior passed me and the last swimmer was at least 50 meters back.  I though ""ahhhh shit, this is gonna be a long day."" As he approached, I saw that he only had 1 leg and was 70+ years old.  My perspective changed rather quickly-  it wasn't going to be a long day.

I learned to force myself to start tasks, because it helps me maintain momentum and remain productive"" but admitting to depression would be a red flag, so I can't say that.  I usually go with ""I have a tendency to be overly technical and detailed when communicating, so I have to be aware of it and try to look for body language/verbal cues in the person I'm talking to"".  I really think that I'm reasonably technical/detailed in communications and some people just have short attention spans, but I'm aware that that isn't going to help me when answering that question."

"In high school there was a girl that was in a few of my classes. I didn't really know her outside of knowing her name, we never really talked. She ended up paired up with me for a project in a class, so I got her number and we were project partners.

We met up to talk about the project at the library, and when I got there she had clearly been crying. I asked her if she was okay and she unloaded all this shit about her family and how her dad was really mean. I didn't really expect that so I tried to be super polite to her and after we were done she asked me for a hug. I gave her it 100 percent just because I felt bad for her. I also told her I hoped it got better, etc.

Get home after the library, and she sends me this absolute manifesto about how much she likes me now and how nice I am. She also starts sending me pictures. Not nudes, but borderline. High school me didn't know how to handle this so I just didn't respond.

Next day we're in class and we have to partner up for the next step of our project. So there I am with her. She starts physically coming on to me BIG time. Super close to me, rubbing my back, caressing my thigh. I was incredibly uncomfortable. I ended up telling her that I was sorry but I wasn't interested and she absolutely freaks out in front of everyone. Like literally screaming at me because I didn't want this girl that I barely knew at all seducing me in public. It was so bad that the teacher put us in different groups.

She also sent me a bunch of super angry texts afterwards, ended up having to block her number because she was texting me so much. Honestly I still do feel bad for her. I hope I wasn't like the first person to not treat her poorly.  


I should edit to say that she kept insisting that I wanted her because I was simply polite to her and gave her a hug that she practically begged for. "

"The verified safe maximum for ginger root capsules is 4 grams per day, which is 8 500 mg pills.

If you've ever taken any of the abortive migraine meds (Imitrex, Maxalt, Axert, Amerge, etc.), then take the ginger the exact same way.  First sign of the migraine, take one.  It may take as long as 20 minutes, if it's going to work.  The bonus part is that if it doesn't work, you're still safe to take your other meds without having drug interactions.

Hubby is currently taking three to four pills daily with his preventative meds, plus they're the first thing he takes when vision goes sideways or he notices he's turned into a raging asshole.  Oddly enough, the mood change is the most consistent prodrome.

"I make a prequel to Inception called Extraction, where a young Miles (Micheal Cain's Character) is an army Captain in a fictional late 80's ww3 - Democratic west vs Soviet Russian and China. Its a cyberpunk movie.

He and a partner develop dream sharing, he as dreamer (due to his existing ability to lucid dream and background as an architect) and the partner as an engineer. They do the first extraction on a captured Chinese officer. Since they only knew a few the techniques, they have difficulties getting info from the highly mentally disciplined officer.

So Miles comes up with a plan; build a story for them to act out with the officer. They come up with this surreal warrior's epic based on Chinese mythology, and posing as characters in this story, they battle with him. They say the officer has a secret message for the emperor, and only the emperor can read the secret - which they hope will be the secret their after. 

However, the officer's own memories start tainting the story they created, and they grow to empathise with him. One of the things they learn is that the officer has been brainwashed to subconsciously take his own life if interrogated - stop his own heart. They surmise he'll probably take his own life when he wakes up after extraction.

Mile's partner sees all of the officer's painful memories and resolves to reverse the brainwashing and thus he and Miles GO DEEPER to a dream within a dream. Mile's partner comes up with the idea of inception - plant the idea that he's not being interrogated but was actually working for the West all along.

Shit goes bad deep in the dreams within dreams. Mile's partner thinks he achieves inception on the officer. When they wake, Mile's partner think's he is being interrogated and stops his own heart. While the officer doesn't stop his own heart, he's not incepted and knows they were in his dreams.

Miles continues his work on the dreams extraction program - but is adamantly against the idea of inception. In the final scene we see him training a new recruit - Tom Hardy's character - and Miles resigning his commission and moves to Paris with his wife and teenage daughter, accepting a teaching position. 

The whole movie would be way more colourful and way more surrealist than Inception. "

"Spring 2015

My wife and I were leaving for work one morning. On our way to the car we suddenly heard screaming. A woman came out of the apartment hallway shouting. A teen came bounding across the parking lot followed by his dad. My wife and I stopped at the car just to see if we needed to jump in and help. The mother was frantic. She handed a note to her son who read it, then dropped it and sprinted out into the parking lot towards the front of the complex. The dad picked up the note and read it. He spoke to his wife and handed her the note then ran to his car and drove away. 

We knew something bad had happened, so we went to the woman's apartment and knocked on the door. She opened the door with a blank expression. We explained that we heard the shouting and wanted to help. She explained that her younger son left a note. He just graduated Friday past. His birthday was last week. He just turned 18. Husband bought him a gun for his birthday...She trailed off. 

I asked if I could read the note. In summary, it said that he was hurting and that he didn't know what to do anymore. He told his brother to be strong for his mother. He said he loved everyone and that this was goodbye.

I looked back up to the mom and asked where the brother and the dad had gone. She said they were checking the front of the complex to see if he had run away. I asked for his name and told her that we would join the search and closed the door for her. I looked to my wife and softly explained that this was not a runaway. 

We went out to the parking lot and I called 911. I explained that they probably just received a call for this location about a runaway, that we were joining the search, and that I had read the note and it sounded like a suicide note. I gave all of the additional information and then hung up.

After hanging up I thought for a moment. There was a nice trail that ran along a river adjacent to our apartment complex. I figured that this would be a good place to start looking so we quickly made our way over to the trail.

The trail starts in a field, then enters the woods. Once in the woods it is essentially a giant oval with the far long side running along the river and has a path through the center of the oval for shorter runs. Since it is a community trail, it is well travelled and well maintained.

My wife and I start around the trail, keeping our eyes peeled. As we are walking along the river side, next to a giant oak tree we see the kid laying on the ground. I called his name several times as I approached him and dialed 911 for the second time that morning.

I explained the situation to the operator and they told me that police were at the complex, so I looked to my wife and told her to run get the officers and bring them back. I turned back to the kid and took a step forward, then the adrenaline hit. My breath drew up and tunnel vision kicked in. I paused, took a deep breath and brought myself back into the moment.

I approached the body still calling his name and letting the operator know what I was seeing. A pool of blood, ants on the exposed skin, the gun. I knelt down to check for a pulse, the whole time relaying what I was seeing and doing. No pulse. Skin was cold and blueing in certain areas. No breathing.

I stepped away from the body and stayed on the line with the operator until my wife came back with two officers. I let the operator know that they arrived and they told me it was ok to hang up.

As the officer approached I stepped away from the body and kept my hands at my side. The officer told me to step away and I did. The second officer demanded to know how we knew where he was. I explained that this was a community trail, that it was the most peaceful place around, and that if I was going to do something like that, this was probably where I would go to do it.

The second officer led us back to our apartment and my wife explained that she got to them just before they knocked on the mom's door. He asked us to hang tight and fill out a report.

A little while later an ambulance arrived.

The family was brought out to the ambulance and told that he had passed. The mother released the most blood curdling wail I have ever heard in my life. Pain, anger, heartbreak, confusion all in a single sound. She said she was going to kill herself and then descended into unintelligible whimpers and cries. A little while later the ambulance took her away and the family followed. 

We finished our reports and took them out to the officers. They apologized that we had to go through all of that, but honestly they seemed more shaken than we were. You could see the gloom in their eyes. I think for us that came later. They've dealt with this so much that the shock comes and goes quickly. We were running on adrenaline.

We got to work late that day. The drive in was so surreal. This poor kid had just taken his life, a family had just been devastated, but the world just kept turning. People had no clue. Things just kept going. That was by far the weirdest feeling I have ever experienced. "

"I have small breasts and I can assure you that they're quite real. And this perfectly normal trait does not mean that I am somehow less of a woman or adult. Breasts come in many shapes and sizes, and preferences vary. ""The fuck"" is not an appropriate reaction to someone liking small breasts.

How convenient. 

It's almost like paedophiles exist with any demographic of race or religion, but no. You just want to focus on a single case that involves Muslims. They didn't abuse kids because they were Muslims, they abused kids because they were paedophiles.

All of which she flaked on or turned down. I love her but after the last time I couldn't help but think o how much slack she expects to be cut but always assumes the worst in others.

"A lot of people say this. I'm kind of in this boat too but at the same time I think if WoW came out today it would completely suck. Like the WoW Classic that Bliz is working on to bring vanilla back is basically going to be original WoW but with some modern updates so it won't be as bad, especially bug wise, as it was then but it's still probably going to suck compared to what it is today. Very grindy. Questing will be very bland. The overall difficulty will be much higher.

Some of that is ok. Like, I like the challenge. But I'm also not a college student anymore. I don't have nearly as much time as I did back then. I can't make time to put 40 people together to go raid BWL. I can't dedicate 4 hours or more in a night on one boss fight. I don't have the attention span for that nor do I have the actual time.

I will still probably play it. Just cause I'm curious how it will be but I doubt I'll stick with it. I doubt most people who long for that nostalgia to return with Classic WoW will also stick with it."

I took the photo just as the lion grabbed the meat, and when I lowered the camera, everything had frozen in place; the crowds, the lion, everything. In broad daylight, too. This went on for a good couple of seconds until I blinked and the lion dropped down again.

It to this day remains the weirdest thing I've ever seen. The photo, incidentally, developed with a massive lens flare over the lion; I'll have to see if I can dig it out."

"Yeah, it's definitely BS, but as someone watching it can be hard to know how to help. Would the woman want me to intervene in some way? If so, how?

I definitely reacted strongly to the comments on several occasions like ""Whoa, that is ... an insane thing to say"" but beyond that I don't know if there's anything I should or could be doing.

I kind of always figure the best way to help is just ... to ... not be a dick? Just play the game and enjoy it as people with a common interest, without making it all weird for women gamers. I view that as a kind of support in that hopefully it's encouraging to be treated as an actual human being and not just some piece of meat that's being bought online.

"I was about 17, and there was this guy who was about 21 that I was interested in. He'd always take the time to talk to me, even when he was at work, and he was usually pretty touchy feely with me, and always giving me hugs.

He asked me to meet up with him one weekend, and I was so excited to finally spend some proper one on one time with him, and see where it would go.

It started off okay, he had his arm around me as we walked through town. But he bumped into a couple of his friends from work, who obviously recognised me, so he put a bit of distance between us. His friends were teasing him about hanging out with me, but also saying, ""I thought you liked Erin's sister?"" and things got awkward fast, so he just tried ending the conversation and moving on.

Afterwards, he eventually said that he didn't want to start anything with me, because he was interested in me and my sister at the same time, and he couldn't figure out who he liked more. I didn't talk to him much after that because I was a bit weirded out."

They were pressuring me to smoke and making it clear I couldn't be in their group if I didn't. So I figured, I'll watch this film they talk about, that'll help me fit in.

And it starts and I'm all ""oh wow she is just like me"" even down to the girls mocking her innocence, and there's Danny and I'm thinking ""maybe there's hope for me yet"", and boom, she's all ""Yeah, well, goodbye Sandra Dee"" and it's catsuits and smoking. And that's the message I took from it. ""Sorry, loser, but them's the rules. Skintight and light up, or you're gonna be a loser forever!"" Everyone cheers! She finally loosened up! Yay!

I was heartbroken, it was honestly the only film I'd ever seen at that point where the moral-of-the-story was the actual opposite of what I wanted to see :p "

"""Don't worry. I'll hook you up and make the drink stronger"". Bullshit. I'm a bartender. I've learned a lot of skeezy tricks from a lot of shady bartenders. Hell, I took a bartending class with my friend and our instructor showed us all the ways bars rip you off while making it seem like they're helping you out. Almost every bar and restaurant has a pre-set amount of liquor to put into each drink; typically 1.5 to 2 ounces of liquor per mixed drink. The rest is mixers, syrups and ice. If someone bitches that their drink isn't strong enough, I always take the drink, turn around, drop a few drops of liquor down the straw so that the liquor is sitting right on top then give it back. The patron takes a sip, gets a massive rush of liquor taste, thinks I added 4 extra shots, doesn't complain the rest of the night and orders 6 more drinks. It's literally mind games and psychological deception. Congratulations. You just bought multiple more drinks simply because I dropped 1/50th of an extra shot into your drink to make it taste like it was stronger. You're not actually getting any extra liquor when you ask for a stronger drink. You're being manipulated by the bartender into thinking he/she hooked you up with more liquor free of charge so you'll give them a larger tip at the end of the night. The only time you actually get any extra liquor is when they upcharge your bill for the drink. If the bartender in question didn't upcharge you, they deceived you and you fell for it. "

"Dunno about other countries, but in Belgium they are reforming education that kids don't learn the most basic things or learn them not sufficiently enough. They want to focus on use of knowledge and almost forget the studying, the acquiring of the knowledge.

"I cannot fucking believe I'm not dead yet.

In a rough chronology, here's a layout of what that looks like, looking back;

Starting around the year 2000, at the age of 18, I drove drunk, And high. And drunk and high. On winding, twisting, deadly West Virginia back country roads. All the time, for a steady two years until joining the US Army at the age of 20. Well, surely that's safer, right?

In the next decade, from 2003 to 2013, I deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan four times. 

During my service at Fort Hood TX, a drunk in Austin stabbed me twice in a back alley bar fight. I lived. 

Also during this decade, I had four vehicles, three HMMWV's and a Bradley burnt out from under me. In Afghanistan, I stepped on no less than two IED's, the ones designed to hit dismounts, triggered by pressure-plates.


Both failed to detonate. 

A guy stepped out of a mosque, aimed a PKM directly at me, and cut loose. Missed me with around 40-50 rounds. To this day, no idea how or why.


In Iraq, my Bradley clipped, JUST clipped the edge of a Russian-made AT mine, but didn't roll over the pressure-switch in the center, thus not detonating it.

I still have no idea how or why I'm still here. 

I joke to my friends and family now, now that I'm 35, and I say something like, ""I never expected to live this long, now I actually have to make a plan for my future, har har""....none of them really grasp or understand how serious I am when I say that...

They finally turned it back on after a week and charged us for a reactivation fee. Problem is, that we did pay our bill on time so there was no need for that.

"Physician here who gets cold sores/fever blisters and has since I was in middle school. 

I seem to have a pretty good technique down so maybe it’ll help others.

The problem with cold sores is that the virus comes on strong in the first 12 hours as the blisters rapidly expand and get painful, but after 12-24 hours the actual virus has calmed down and now you are just dealing with your body’s huge immune reaction that caused a a lot of cellular damage in the area.  The sore that lasts for weeks is not the virus, it’s your body’s response to it.

I have an acyclovir prescription, they are 400mg each.  When I feel the very first tingle of one coming on, I take 3.  The problem with taking 1 every 8 hours is it takes 4 doses to get to max steady state concentrations and by then, the damage is done.  So I front load it to get immediate high levels and stop viral replication ASAP, after the initial dose, I take 1 ever 8 hours for 36 hours or so.  I also put on abreva from the first sign.  Basically fighting the initial viral replication very strongly.  Then I take Aleve as an anti inflammatory.  

I have made huge improvements with duration of the scabs after, literally from 2 weeks down to a 4-5 days or even less.  I carry the stuff in my car at all times.  

Maybe this can help other people.  

of course as a medical professional I urge everyone to discuss any specific treatments with their physicians and you should always follow your Doctors recommendations. "
"Giving to St. Jude's is a great cause, but might I suggest Alex's Lemonade Stand as another option?

My nephew was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in 2014. We tried everything, including a bone marrow transplant and saving the cord blood when his sibling was born. We were referred to St. Jude but were told that they would not enter him into any experimental trials or treatments because the way the woman worded it was that they only accepted children they thought they had a more likely chance of curing. We were then explained in more wordy terms about how too many deaths would make them look bad and less likely to receive funding to help more kids in the future. It completely changed my view of St. Jude's and made me realize how carefully crafted their image is. It's still a great hospital, but it had never occurred to me that they keep their success rate high by intentionally avoiding trying anything on children who were too sick. I guess that does enable them to save more children in a way but it didn't sit right with me. However, they can only treat less than 500 kids a year so they can be a little more picky.

"I had a ""friend"" like this in high school who got pissed when I kept refusing to go out with him but some how ""led him on"" by talking to him about random shit like doctor who and pokémon. Other friends would go and say ""Oh give him a chance, he's so nice!"" and wouldn't leave me alone about it. 
He would make up stories about how I would flirt with him and he would buy me stuff and I would take it and it was just...he had made up so much shit about how I supposedly acted. I was flirty but also bipolar because I would snap at him in front of other people when he put his arms around me. 

It culminated with him finally saying that I would totally go out with him but I was actually a crazy psycho lesbian which led to a couple of female friends refusing to invite me out anymore because I was totally thinking about fucking them according to douchebag. 

Jokes on them I realized I was a lesbian later on and they weren't my type. 

(It did keep me from coming out to people for years though because I didn't want them to think anything he said about me was true)

"I was the bullied one, but I think my experience fits in from the opposing point of view.

My bully was one of the popular kids in our school, but he was angry almost all of the time. It seemed like everything I did would set him off. Not being popular myself I made a few unsuccessful attempts to befriend him, and each time it was meet with hostility. I got bullied a fair amount, but I never really held it against this guy in particular. Even at a young age I knew something was driving his anger that he couldn't control.

Flash forward a decade and I see a post from a mutual friends on social media that he responded to. It was in regards to depression and he had replied with a similar sentiment. I replied and told him that if he ever needed anything he could reach out and I'd help him. I don't know why I did it. After school we didn't cross paths again and I had no reason to care about him.

He messaged me a few minutes later to let my know how much it meant to him that I offered my help even after what he'd done to me. We talked for a while that night, and many nights after. He admitted that much of his depression stemmed from how he treated everyone during what turned out to be a bad point in his life. I forgave him for everything and made sure he knew I didn't hold any grudges.

We keep in contact now. I like to check in to see how he's doing. He has a family now and it looks like he's an amazing father. In the end it turns out my biggest bully was really a good guy going through some stuff. We had a lot in common and could have been great friends, had circumstance been different.

He helped me a lot by reaching out. A lot of the weight I had carried from my school days had fallen away. I'm glad to now call him my friend."

"Didn't happen to me but I got to be a real nice guy and help some creeped upon girls out.  


Hanging out with a buddy at a local bar in college, two cute girls come over and immediately say ""can you help us out, creeper over there won't leave us alone and we used you guys as our out ""oh there are our boyfriends"". Without skipping a beat we both gave the creeper the 'boyfriend look'. We got a ""happy to see you hug"" and a chance to chat with some great girls. I knew the creep from high school and he was the classic ""Mr. Nice Guy"".  


I was flattered to be asked for and happy to help them out, but it makes me sad and angry that finding their ""boyfriends"" was the only way out for them. 

As I watch my kids grow up I think of those 2 girls often. I hope my daughter never has to find a ""boyfriend"" and if she does I hope he's a standup guy, and I'm doing my damnedest to ensure my son is never the ""nice guy"" and that he is a true/real nice guy."

"Worked at a small chain restaurant down in Florida as a busser. They tend to have the bussers be a little more than just picking up tables though. We would end up bussing, serving, and even sometimes prepping food. The restaurant itself is big enough to house two full bars and over 300 seats for customers.

Fourth of July weekend I get to work and see that there are no other bussers there. I go to the manager and ask him where everyone else it at and his only reply was, ""They'll show up eventually. Just do your job."" 

Saying fuck it, I start running around frantically trying to keep up with the pace of the all day rush. After a point it gets to be too much to where I end up asking him to assist since he was lazily standing around and watching everyone work. ""You just need to pick up the slack for everyone else that isnt here."" 

After that I took a bathroom break, walked back out to see a party of 20 come in, and proceeded to walk out the door. From what I heard recently, that manager was fired for poor management.

"I worked at a museum as a security guard. I had already been getting shit daily from my supervisor for calling out only 1 day because I hurt my back and had a hard time standing up. This person was not a nice person. They kept making me do things like guard places where I would have to walk up a bunch of stairs and making me work sections of the museum where there was no downtime so I could sit a couple minutes and rest my back. Anyways, while that sucked, I just powered through it.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple of weeks go by from that point and I get a call from my dad saying that my grandfather is getting near the end and is in the hospital. I wanted to go see my grandfather at that point before he died but I was just starting a 5 hour shift at the museum. I radio my supervisor to come talk to me, and in the mean time I'm talking to a co worker of mine. I told my co worker the situation while waiting for the supervisor to get there and I could tell something about it bother them about it.

&amp;nbsp;

My supervisor gets there and I explain to them the situation and my co worker calls the supervisor over to the other side of the room looking pissed. A few minutes later my supervisor comes back and says that I can't leave because the museum needs me and that my coworker refuses to work alone (There were 4 other guards on that day mind you and this is a small town.) So I say to my supervisor that if I don't leave now there is a chance my grandfather would die and I wouldn't be able to say goodbye to him before that happened. Supervisor looked at me and said ""You signed up for this job, now you're gonna do it."" I handed the supervisor my radio, threw my badge on the front desk, and walked out without saying a word to anyone.

&amp;nbsp;

edit - Not metaphorically at all, I want to add that the second I walk out of the museum I could literally feel a weight being lifted off of me. "

When you’re surrounded by complete chaos sometimes a hint of stupid amounts of responsibility is the craziest thing you can do.
"Can't be, he said school time."
"We're aiming to spend only 8-10k on ours, and that is going as cheaply as possible. I keep asking if we can elope, but he wants a ceremony and a reception. People keep asking if we're doing a small ceremony with just our parents. *Just our parents,* for 8-10 grand. That's how you know the cost of the average wedding is to high.

In reality, we're planning for anywhere from 60-70 guests. It's not easy planning to keep the budget small if you want a decent amount of people to attend."
"When I'm dead, just throw me in the trash."
"Let's not sit here and lie to ourselves and pretend that people inside of coffins don't rot and that coffins themselves don't leak and rot eventually. Also, it's good to have what's best for the Earth in mind and to look for green burial options, but people can mourn and make their funeral arrangements however they please. For some people, that means bearing their dead in a coffin in the ground with a gravestone. That is a person's right to choose how they want to be buried and to be able to follow the wishes of their loved ones about how they want to be buried as well. 


What we need to get rid of, if anything, is embalming. It's completely unnecessary and most people simply do it because they aren't educated about it and don't realize that it isn't necessary for most regular burials. I think at the very least, that there should be a lot more education about things like embalming and the risks that they pose to living people as well as how useless of a cost they are to those who are grieving and trying to pay for often already costly funeral arrangements."

"Well one thing I can say about it is that people are failing to see or understand basic human behavior. It doesn't matter how good your message is, people will be opposed to it if it's shouted at them. If you really want social change you might want to rethink your method of delivery. My professor once told me ""A polarizing argument is polarizing"" which she meant that if your intent is to finger-point, condemn, and chastise don't be shocked if people feel attacked. And what do people do when they feel like they are being attacked? They get defensive. If your message is good then you got to put a goddamn bow on it so people will listen. "

"Reminds of my first HS party when I pissed the bed. Of course my buddy and I found a super expensive bottle of absinthe in this girl's house mixed with the first time I smoked weed (and beers). Called my mom to pick me up. Right when we got home, I opened the door and threw up everywhere (and I had been playing it so cool...). Went to sleep, and woke up in pee from my chest to my feet"
"Shaking hands.  It's supposed to be a friendly greeting, not an opportunity to show off how strong you are or to sadistically attempt to break someone's hand.  A few days ago I shook this guy's hand and not only did he have a crushing grip, he put his thumb on the back of my hand and pushed as hard as he could for maximum pain.  What the fuck?"
"I ran into a coworker taking an insulin shot in the bathroom, and she apologized to *me* about it. I was more horrified that she felt she had to hide in the bathroom to do it, and I'd much rather see a needle than have someone get sick or die. "
"Indeed, you can't have a good movie when your characters are all retarded, those things are mutually exclusive."
"One time I saw a customer pulling this shit on a server in a restaurant, and I walked up and asked them, "" Do you talk to your kids like that?"" the bitch said, ""No, but I don't see how this is any of your business."" To which I replied, ""I would really appreciate it if you didn't speak to my daughter like that, now you should apologize, and go home."" The customer turned red and walked out saying, ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."" I was treated like a god by everyone in that restaurant from then on. Every time I walked in they would shout, "" Hi Kelly's dad,"" and laugh. "
People thinking that the rules don't apply to them. Pretty self explanatory.

"when u have the money to spend, most will spend accordingly. "
Historically yes. That doesn't make it more acceptable for anyone to think they can have a marriage in a developed country that would work like that.

"don't worry, they are all coming back"
"A situation like this was one of the reasons I left the Army. We did 1-month field exercise where we traveled from New York to Louisiana for training in preparation for an upcoming deployment, which would be at least 12 months. This was all part of the job, and expected.

Subsequent to the exercise, my unit got a 4-day pass. I did the diligence and had my vehicle properly inspected, submitted a travel plan, got it signed off by all the right people, and woke up at 2:00 in the morning so I could start my trip to go visit my parents 490 miles away in Maine (the limit for a day's drive was 500 miles according to the division safety plan).

I got to my parents' house around noon and we had a really good visit. They showed me how they had remodeled the attic as a nice neutral space I could always consider ""my room"" and my mom had baked me a cake for the birthday I missed on the training exercise. I decided to take a nap.

Around 2:00 in the afternoon my phone started blowing up because the entire division was being recalled. Apparently there had been two motor-vehicle related fatalities that day and the commander believed that ""bad luck comes in threes"". I was informed by my immediate supervisor that I needed to be present at 7:00 for a mandatory safety training day, back at my post 490 miles / 10 hours away. I told him I didn't think it was safe for me to drive 10 hours, sleep for 2, and drive 10 hours back, and that it seemed like the exact sort of thing the training was probably going to address. He agreed with me and we decided I would go up the chain of command with his support.

His superior was not available (I learned later, drunk in Montreal) so I escalated through the first sergeant and company commander. The commander agreed that he would never sign off on a travel plan that required that much driving in that amount of time, but he couldn't rescind the order because it came from the division commander. The buck finally stopped somewhere between battalion and division and it was decided that I was going to make that drive. So I made a huge pot of coffee, stocked up on energy drinks and drove all the way back to Fort Drum and went to the fucking safety training the next morning on a few hours of sleep, and the first thing they addressed was that driving exhausted can be as bad, or worse, than driving intoxicated.

My boss's boss didn't have to drive back because he was drunk, and that was an automatic pass. But I gave up a weekend with my family and for whatever reason, under those circumstances, it was one of the saddest moments of my life, explaining that I had just gotten there but I had to leave again.

And that, kids, is just one example of the kind of idiotic fuck-fuck games you can play if you join the Army."

"Off the top of my head....

Lactate Ringers Solution,
Cefepime,
Albendazole,
Naproxen or ketorolac (some nsaid),
Prednisone/prednisolone (IV form),
Bupivicaine

LR is an important fluid for treating sick dehydrated or hypoveolemic people. Life saving supportive care. You'll definitely need this when you pick up some nasty diarrhea from that untreated water you're drinking.

Cefepime is a broad spectrum antibiotic

Albendazole is an antiparasitic that'll knock out most worms (trust me, you'll get worms in a post plumbing world). Probably more important to stay dewormed than to have a miltivitamin.

NSAID for pain and anti-inflammatory

Steroid for pain,, anti-inflammatory, and adjunct therapy to loads of conditions. This is a lifesaving drug in asthma attacks or allergic reactions. I could be convinced to give this up for another antibiotic though.

Bupivicaine is a local anesthetic. It can be used for epidurals and nerve blocks in case of the need to do abdominal surgery or something on a limb. This is probably the bottom of the list. Maybe id take an opioid like fentanyl that doesn't suppress CV function a whole lot instead.

We remained FWB but I couldn't stand the thought of her with him so broke it off. Husband also got really suspicious and it got way harder to meet. She swore and cried every time she left she was leaving. Then wouldn't call for a few days. She always decided to stay but I couldn't resist meeting even though I swore I was done if she wouldn't. Ghosting her was the only thing that worked. Felt really horrible about it, I really believed her that she had no other option but was just too painful."

She also apologised to my husband for her behaviour. She had many regrets and I believed they were genuine. She may not have been the best mother growing up, she was strict, narcissistic and often abusive but I saw changes in her that made me think things could be different. It wasn't really a conscious decision to make up as such, but with time trust was built again I learnt to forgive. She is no longer controlling of me and she is a lot more open minded than her other religious friends.

"I worked at a preschool as a teacher for a few months. I brought in my nice camera to take pictures for the parents during one of our huge activity days (after receiving permission from the principal). 

The day started out as usual and everything was going great until my lunch break. I had left the school to get lunch from somewhere nearby during my scheduled lunch time and I came back 10 minutes before my break ended. As soon as I walked in the front office the principal was extremely annoyed and told me I HAD TO go back in the classroom as the law requires us to have 1 adult present for every 10 children. I tell the principal that I actually have 10 minutes left on my lunch break and she shakes her head telling me “we NEED you in the classroom NOW”.

So I shrug my shoulders and head back into the classroom, I really liked the principal before this and I really didn’t mind going back into the classroom to help out. As I walk into my classroom, the head teacher asked me to go get my nice camera from the front office to take pictures! Excitedly, I walked back to the front office only to be met with an extremely angry principal who commanded me “GO BACK TO YOUR CLASSROOM NOW”. 

As I was forming the words “ the head teachers asked me to get my camera from the office to take pictures” the principal snapped her fingers in front of her and pointed at the door to tell me to just leave and go work. I quit there and then. Absolutely I will never work for a boss who snaps their fingers at me like a dog."

"My family was ""middle class poor"" growing up since we would prioritize paying off the house over anything else, so we would eat a lot of chicken and rice. Instead of going out to somewhere like McDonalds, for special occasions, we would go to this place called Sunny Teriyaki and pick up a box of rice and teriyaki and split that 4 ways. Add some homecooked veggies and it's a complete meal for 4 for like $10ish bucks. Rarely ate school lunch ($2.50 at the time) except on the days when they were serving something really good (3-4 times a month) but would instead brown bag it with PB&amp;J and various snacks. When I got older and started swimming more that PB&amp;J turned into cup noodles.

Nowadays I can't justify eating out at all really, so i'm nicknamed ""The Jew"" among my friends haha. My coworkers come in every morning with Starbucks and spend minimum $2 buying a snack and water (even though there is a water fountain) out of the vending machines every day, then after work go and buy more food from a nearby cafe or fast food drive in. Every single time 10-12 days after we got our paychecks they go ""I don't know where my money went"". Meanwhile I make a lunch of a 33 cent cup noodles, a refilled water bottle, a bag of doritos (filling up a small ziplock with doritos myself instead of buying the little snack sized bags) and either a apple or orange.

"I dropped out of high school at around the age of 16, I wanted to be a writer, but looking back in retrospect I think it wasn't so much about being a writer as it was finding a way to live a location-independent lifestyle and making money from home. I picked ""writing"" because that's the only thing I was remotely good at or interested in at the time.

At 18-years-old I moved from Atlanta to Savannah, GA with no money in my pocket. I eventually got a job working temporary labor jobs on the dock through labor agencies like Ablebody and LaborFinder. I'd make about $50 for a full day's work (sometimes working form 6 PM to 6 AM, other times working from 5AM to around 5PM). I developed a drinking problem and did a lot of drugs.

By the time I was around 19 I got published in a magazine in Savannah. I actually still have the very first article that was ever published - I got paid $180 to cover a restaurant in Brunswick, Georgia (most of which was spent on the gas and the actual dinner): [https://imgur.com/a/YebvN2h](https://imgur.com/a/YebvN2h)

But I lied about my age and they found out (I was covering bars and restaurants for ""The Bar Exam"" column, but I was 19 with a fake ID hah hah). But I had my name in print.

I moved back to Atlanta, still doing temporary labor jobs, and got some low-pay jobs covering the music scene around 2007 - 2008. Then I developed a crippling addiction to amphetamines and started drinking even more heavily.

I switched my focus from print to freelancing online. During that time I did a lot of SEO content, blogs, web content and whatever else, and in the process ended up learning a lot about online marketing.

In 2009 I stopped amphetamines cold turkey, started working at a 24/7 porn shop and a dog daycare, then began cold-calling online marketing companies in Savannah because I wanted to move back. One of them hired me for $400 a week.

Three months later I got fired.

I started freelancing again, this time taking it much more seriously. I started ghostwriting books, doing all sorts of general copywriting jobs and more.

By 2012 I was more or less making a small, but stable income writing. Maybe about $1500 to $2,000 a month. I started getting more and more interested in other ways to make an income online because many of my clients were making money selling products / services online, so I started getting more into the marketing aspect rather than the content aspect.

By 2014 I was much more stable. Still making the same amount of money, but I had a process, my knowledge of online marketing and online business had grown, I was much healthier hitting the gym regularly and I decided that I wanted to start my own online business.

So to limit my expenses and hook up with people who were also running online businesses I packed my bags and bought a one-way ticket to Thailand in the Summer of 2015.

From 2015 to 2016 I tried all sorts of ideas, but not many came to fruition. Finally, I started talking to some other copywriters and learned that they were charging WAY more money than me. I learned more about them and found out about ""Direct Response Copywriting."" I bought some courses, read a bunch of books, and realized my ability to write persuasive sales-oriented content was worth WAY more money than I was charging.

So then I started looking for higher quality clients outside those freelance sites (like Upwork) and got $30,000 in projects in one week through cold emailing.

From 2016 to now I'm still live in Thailand, but I make a high six-figure income as a direct response copywriter. I did an AMA about it a few months back on r/entrepreneur here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8lhofp/i\_make\_about\_10000\_a\_month\_as\_a\_copywriter\_proof/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8lhofp/i_make_about_10000_a_month_as_a_copywriter_proof/)

Now I've put all of my focus on day trading. I bought a mobile trading station: [https://imgur.com/WUumcrm](https://imgur.com/WUumcrm)

Studied every day, about six hours a day, for about six months, started trading on stocks - but wasn't very good at it. Switched to Emini Futures, demo traded for several months until i found a trading style and strategy that fit my personality and risk tolerance, went live and started making about $400 to $500 a day (which I'm hoping to scale up).

Now much of my focus is on trading, I don't do copywriting as much as I used to, and now I'm learning how to take my money and invest long-term and create a nice iron-clad nest egg for myself that grows organically.

At this point I trade about an hour a day and I don't do any other work and I make six figures.

So ultimately I reached my goal, which I would distill down to this: Make the most amount of money, for the least time commitment, independent from any single location.

And that's muh stawry!"

"It's a tough story, because there are so few characters to like.

First, the Republic...well, the Republic started falling apart long before Caesar showed up on the scene.  

Sulla basically did the same thing as Caesar, just 40 years before him.

And really, the problems started getting intense 150 years before that.

They started doing lots of stupid things.  They limited suffrage a lot.  Both by insisting you had to vote in Rome, even as the empire grew, so the far flung pieces would almost never be able to get there.  Then by having increasing numbers of slaves who along with women and other non-citizens couldn't vote (hence Spartacus in the same time period as Sulla).  Then by abolishing the secret vote and making citizens vote publicly in front of a crowd (dangerous).  Then by limiting the number of voting tribes to 35 so new parts of the empire couldn't form tribes and vote.  Then they gave the censors (census dudes) power to assign new lands to existing tribes, so it became a big dirty gerrymandering clusterfuck.  And pretty soon rich people were buying votes and it all became pointless.

Of course, by the time Caesar's coming up, Crassus (richest man in the world) had already bankrolled Sulla's dictatorship and used his wealth to raise basically a private army and put down Spartacus.  And he would have gotten more political power for himself, but for Pompey the Great, the other consul to Caesar, who was a pleb and not so wealthy, but who had the goods on Sulla and blackmailed him to get a triumph and gain political prestige in Rome.  So it wasn't too much of a stretch for Crassus to fund Caesar AND Pompey and form the first triumvirate.  Legend had it the Parthians poured gold down Crassus' throat when they final got him.

But they're all really scummy people.  The republic just got increasingly corrupt.  Even Cicero who many fancy the hero is an elitist douche who most people are happy to see get fucked around because he was so adamantly against debt relief or anything that would help the poor.  He almost loses the republic to the catinine conspiracy like 20 years earlier as consul. And then in 44bc he takes over after Brutus kills Caesar only to almost immediately get steamrolled and executed by the second triumvirate the next year.  That's a shitty job restoring the republic.  

Brutus was a turncoat who was with the populares until a last minute switch to the optimates, something like going from being a progressive to a conservative overnight.  Then suddenly he was following Pompey.  But Caesar pardoned him anyways and made him Governor of Gaul then Praetor, positions he happily took.  That's why it shocked Caesar that he killed him.  Caesar was so beloved by the majority of the public that after making that switch and stabbing him, even though Mark Antony again pardoned him, Brutus had to flee the city with Cassius because the mob was going to come for his head.  Then they use their cash to raise an army in Greece and start a civil war that they immediately start losing, so Brutus kills himself.

I mean, there are few characters with many redeeming qualities here.  "

"For anyone who hasn’t adopted - it can be unbelievably difficult - not every adoption is picture perfect and there are just some issues that can’t be solved by a typical family.

A friend of ours had made the mistake of adopting an entire sibling set from a wide age range, they had an awful story from how they led up to being adopted.  

Anyways, hundreds of problems with the adoption later - they made multiple attempts to kill their newly adopted parents, all caught on tape. It sounds sad to want to “un-adopt”, but not every case is a miracle.

"That is where lawyers arguing and the judgement of a judge would come in. If you bought a lot of wood and burned it to stay warm in your wood-fire-heated cabin in Alaska over the course of a winter, you might be OK. But if you bought a shitload of combustibles and just randomly had a huge-ass fire, it'd be pretty convincing for the other laywer to argue that your true purpose was destruction of assets. Unless you could show that you had huge fires with lots of expensive supplies \*every\* year as a tradition or something, and this was the same.

Similarly, as a guy who never buys produce as a business move, buying a truckload of it randomly is weird and will be easy to convince a judge was done for the purpose o destruction of property. But if you're a shipping company and \*often\* buy large amounts of produce and \*accidentally\* have a load spoil before reaching the buyer, you might be OK. If you intentionally delayed it to cause the spoilage and told the court it was accidental, you'd still be committing fraud though - just you might get away with it.

Even just giving it all to charity will probably get you in trouble when the other side shows that you historically occasionally donate $50 or so, and now you suddenly sold your home and donated your $500,000 life-savings right after filing for divorce. It is likely that a judge would see that as intentional destruction/loss of assets, and treat you accordingly."

"In college I had some classes with a girl that has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM), which only like 60 people in the world are known to have.

I witnessed her give a wildly fascinating speech (TEDx) about her life with this condition, during which she poses a general question she’d commonly be asked - “why don’t you study something like nuclear physics (or something similarly complex)?” Mind you she was in a social sciences field. Her explanation paralleled exactly what you said: memorizing and understanding are different things.

The question is how much of their wealth would you say is appropriate? Should they leave themselves with a certain amount and donate all of the rest? Say 1 million a year to live on and donate every other cent? Who are we to say how others should live or spend their money?"

"One time my wife and I went to [chain restaurant] and she ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. She does like them. However she did complain that this one was not strong enough. I took a sip of it, and it tasted like a glass full of iced sweet and sour mixer. A long island iced tea should really taste like alcohol. I mean the joke is that if you don't know what liquor you want to order, just order a Long Island iced tea because it has all of them. When we complained to the waiter he brought the manager over, *who actually argued with us* that the drink's flavor should be very subtle. He said he would take it off of our tab, but he lectured us about it first. For a while. It was really embarrassing. He also argued with me about the ingredients, and told me there wasn't tequila in a Long Island iced tea. Then after he left taking the drink away, we saw him pause at the bartender and lean into her and say, ""tequila,"" and roll his eyes.  We got up and left, and have never been back.

"Guy I had been dating for a month or two started inviting me to his mom's birthday dinner, sister's grad party, meet the family type stuff. A couple of weeks later when I asked to hang out, not really a date since he was between work trips and tired, but just chill together and watch TV or whatever, he told me things were moving too quickly and he wasn't ready for this to be like a serious relationship. Okay? To me, inviting someone you're dating to meet your family is a sign that it's becoming a bit more serious (definitely a bigger sign than watching TV together!), but whatever.

Although that was 10 years ago (wow, getting old) and I don't believe he's dated anyone since. So there was probably other stuff going on there."
"An odd thing about the park is there is a zinc mine that was built in the early 1980's to ~90% completion in the middle of the park before being basically abandoned after zinc prices crashed. The park was formed after the rights to the mine were bought so the park is kind of shaped like a donut.

"&gt;And if you don't agree that I am a necessary implant in every action movie - you're a sexist incel neckbeard.

I'm not convinced this is a common attitude. Most feminists I've talked to hate that character trope. They're not gonna be accusing people who *agree* with them of being sexist incel neckbeards.

Well, when I say feminists hate that trope, I don't mean the part about female characters having leadership positions in male-dominated fields. There's nothing wrong with that. Just because something's rare doesn't mean it's unrealistic for it to ever be depicted in a movie, and not all movies take place in a 21st-century Earth setting anyway. 

But when we say we want strong female characters in movies, we mean that we want fully-realized, three-dimensional female characters who have agency, drive the plot, and aren't sexualized in ways their male counterparts aren't. A token ""action girl"" character in a skin-tight outfit who's allowed to pal around with the men because her four older brothers taught her how to act in traditionally masculine ways (thus making her better than other women), and whose role in the story is ultimately to be surpassed by and fall in love with the male lead, is a cheap copout that misses the point entirely. That trope is at best marginally less garbage than ""delicate damsel in distress/plot MacGuffin who could be replaced by some kind of desirable inanimate object without meaningfully affecting the plot."""

"That isn't what a Mary Sue is. A mary sue is an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character. They can usually perform better at tasks than should be possible given the amount of training or experience. That was taken straight from the Wikipedia page. 

You can't peg Luke as one because unlike Rey, Luke can't use the force until trained, and even then can't do it that well. Yoda has to lift the X-Wing from the swamp for him. Luke has actual hurdles along the way of his journey. He loses to Vader quite badly, and has to wimp out.

Rey on the other hand uses the Force in Episode 7 despite not meeting a single other Jedi. She can lift that pile of boulders like it was nothing despite hanging out with Luke for maybe all of two days and even he didn't really teach her much. She defeats Kylo Ren, who is much more trained than her in both the Force and combat, because reasons.

"This is either very poorly worded or you have a significant misconception. 

Water is most dense at 4 degC, so as the temperature drops from above that to 4 degC, the volume decreases. But from 4 degC to 0 degC, the water molecules begin to line up into the positions they would have in the solid, which pushes them slightly farther apart. Water doesn't ""appear to expand"" when freezing. It actually expands. Are the water molecules getting bigger? No. But they're not creating tiny spaces between the molecules that didn't already exist in the liquid.

It's like if you have a group of people packing a room while standing (completely filling the room), but then have them sit on the floor. When each person sits, they have to find a position in which their legs don't overlap the people next to them. This inevitably spaces people out farther than when they were standing. Your group of people now takes up more space while sitting than it did while standing. Each person is still the same volume they were before, and you don't have empty places between people in the way that you might if people sat in chairs with aisles between them. A group of sitting people will simply take up more floor space than that group of people will while standing smashed together."

"Not me (20 at the time), but my younger brother (17 at the time). He'd also probably kill me if he knew I was about to tell this story. (Thank god for anonymity)

My brother runs into my room late at night in hysterics, but not really being able to say what's wrong. My brother and I are super close, and we can talk about anything with each other, but the subject of sexual exploits can still be understandably embarrassing to talk about.

I eventually get him to spit it out, and he says that his dick is bleeding from his urethra. He had just finished choking the chicken, and when he went to pee and clean himself off, he felt something pop, and then he started bleeding and it wouldn't stop.

Now I'm no doctor, so I have no clue what's going on, and the poor boy probably thought I would have the answer to his problem, and we could go about the rest of our nights and never speak of it again. So when I said that we'd probably have to wake up one of our parents to drive him to the ER, he looked like he'd rather die. I would've just taken him myself, but then our parents would've blown up about going anywhere by ourselves in the middle of the night.

So I go wake up our mom, who is super chill and understanding, and she takes my brother to the ER. When they eventually return home at around 6AM (The ER near us is infamously slow with even the more serious issues. It took them about 5 hours to help me after I was in a car crash.), I find out the doctor said that my brother just peed a little too hard and that caused him to bleed. Apparently if you put too much pressure behind it after masturbating, it could happen.

My brother was incredibly embarrassed, and we only lightly teased him about it."

And you didn’t really want to, you weren’t quite ready for anything like that but you go along with it because it probably would have happened anyway at some point.

"Yes, communication is key in sex and sexual contact with others, I absolutely agree.

However, when you're in that situation, you freeze in fear. It's survival instinct, in a way; you freeze and wait for it to be over rather than risk making it worse or making him violent. 

In my case I did repeatedly say no and resist, but when you're being threatened with being anally raped until the point of bleeding as OP was, the response of ""lay still and wait for it to end"" is the one most victims resort to. 

In OP's case, sex should've been over when she informed this guy she was in pain and was repeatedly ignored. He persisted, and even threatened her with anal rape until bleeding. As a victim, in fear and in pain, you don't want him to get angry and actually follow through with the threat or become otherwise physically or sexually violent. The ""best"" thing to do (or, what seems like the best thing to do at the time) is to lay still and wait for it to be over

Hope this helps with perspective and stuff :)"

"I would like to take this comment to point out that there is a difference between child molesters and pedophiles. 

Pedophilia is sexual attraction to prepubescents that often constitutes a mental illness. Acting upon this attraction is where they become child molesters.

But due to the stigma surrounding the whole topic, it is very difficult for anyone to disclose this and get help, without fear of persecution."

"Let's rewind time, back to the good old days of 2003, long before Obamacare was a thing. 

My job didn't offer health insurance, as was far more common then than it is now. There wasn't a public option, at all. So if your job didn't offer insurance, you were fucked. 

One day I start running a low fever. 101. Nothing to bad. I decide to tough it out. 

For a week I run a fever. By the end of that week my fever is staying around 103.5. Please note I'm still working during this time, because my job didn't provide sick days or paid time off. (The joys of working retail.) 

The 8th day of my fever I start getting severe stomach pains. Bad enough that I call out of work. 

I go to the hospital. They diagnose me with severe dehydration. 2 iv bags of fluids and 4 hours later, I'm released to go home. By this point my fever is down and my stomach isn't hurting. 

A few hours later, I'm hurting again. Worse than before. Plus my fever is back up. Back to the hospital I go. (No money, no insurance. A doctors office won't see me, hospital has to.)

This time the diagnosis is food poisoning. I should be fine in a couple of days. Sent home. 

A couple of hours later the pain is so bad that I""m passing out and vomiting. Please note, at this point in my life I had been having near daily migraines and worked through them, so I had a high tolerance to pain. 

I go to a different hospital. They tell me it'll be several hours before I can be seen by a doctor. I go back home and pass out. 

Day 2. I haven't ate in over 36 hours. My fever is topping 104 at this point. I'm in so much pain that I have little to no control over my bodily functions. 

I go back to the first hospital. Get taken back to a room, and asked for a urine sample. I go to the restroom, piss everywhere because I can't control anything, somehow get some in the cup, go back to the exam room. 

Doc comes in 10 minutes later and says I have to be rushed into surgery, now. 

They take me back to pre-op, get me going on something, have me sign papers (no clue what at the time, I was damn near delirious with pain at this point. Turns out I'd signed paperwork stating I wouldn't sue the hospital.) They put me under. 

4 days later I come back to my senses, with my stomach a gaping wound. 

Turns out my appendix had ruptured back when the stomach pains started. It took 2 days before anyone figured out what had happened. I had gotten so bad that my heart stopped beating on the operating table. 

I went home once they were sure I was stable and recovering well enough. 

My hospital bills alone were $57k. My surgeons bill was $2k. My anesthesiologist bill was almost $1k. "

Once, at a parking garage, we were very close to getting out for free, but there was a car in front of us taking its time. We get up to the booth and the elderly lady working at it tells us it'll be $1.00. A freaking dollar. 

My ex starts arguing with her, saying if she hadn't been so slow with the other customer, it would be free. The woman looked terrified. I tried calming him down... but he started screaming at the old woman, calling her a bitch and saying she needed to be better at her job. 

We started fighting because that shit is ridiculous. I paid the dollar and he sped off. We fought about it the rest of the day.

Very few people saw this side of him because he was good at pretending to be a good person. I lost friends who couldn't believe I'd leave such a good man. I'm sorry, if you're going to scream and berate an elderly woman to save $1.00, you are not a good man. "

"As someone who has lived in Canada for almost 30 years, and the US for the last 20 years I have a pretty good perspective on how to answer this - but it is complicated.  


As a Canadian, my first introduction to the American health care system was pretty eye opening. The hospitals were like nice hotels. Private rooms, very clean, good food. It was so easy to book appointments with specialists. I was able to get an MRI scheduled the next day for a very non-critical back issue. ER wait times were consistently under an hour. With my immediate family, I have been through pregnancies, surgeries, broken bones, regular run of the mill preventative, multiple different specialists. I have also experienced treatment in 3 or 4 different states. I honestly cannot think of a single bad experience.   


Where I grew up in Canada (Winnipeg to be specific) the hospitals are not nice (to be kind). They are old and not clean - often there is a nasty smell. They do not have adequate staffing (from nurses to doctors to janitorial staff).  Recently, we needed to hire a private nurse to provide care for a family member while he stayed in a hospital (and eventually passed away) because there was not adequate nursing coverage to care for him (St B hospital if anyone is interested). I am not sure that there are ever private rooms - I have seen as many as 6 people share one room. My father spent almost a week in the hallway of an ER on a gurney because there were no rooms available. For non-life threatening cases, ER wait times were staggering... 6...8...10 hours I can remember waiting for stitches one time and a broken wrist another. I know it is really tough to see specialists - very few Pediatricians taking new patients. Getting an MRI when I lived in Winnipeg was almost impossible if it was not life threatening (I don't know what it is like now though). I also don't know if Winnipeg is particularly bad as far as Canadian cities go - I suspect places like Vancouver and Calgary have newer facilities and more people wanting to work there.  


There is no comparison between the ""comfort"" of the care that you get in the US health care system. I say ""comfort"" because I believe the quality of care is similar - you will get the same modern treatments in Canada as you do in the US.  But, I am someone that has a good job with decent medical insurance. Its easy for me to say how nice the American health care system is. One of my greatest fears is losing my job - not because of the income loss, but because of the medical insurance benefit my family would lose. And that is just me looking at it from a purely selfish point of view. What about the people not fortunate like me to have a good job with good medical insurance? The thought that someone would have decide between incuring a huge financial burden and seeking medical care for a child is heartbreaking. These are things that Canadians do not really have to worry about (though there are medical procedures and drugs that are not covered  in Canada). In a modern society, I don't think it is something that anyone should have to worry about.  


I don't know what the right solution is. It is very complicated but I think that the best solution would be some type of hybrid private/public type of medical system. One where a base level of care and service is provided to all."

"The worst one to me is purchasing something for myself that is unnecessary!  I will walk around and pick clothes out, walk to the register, and then go put them back.  

I start thinking, ""what if I have to go to the hospital and get surgery and my out of pocket max on my insurance is so high and SO wrecks his car and needs a new one.  Or a water pipe explodes and insurance wont cover it because it is my fault for some reason, and I wasted this stupid money on a shirt I dont need.  I have plenty of shirts (I don't)""

My Fiance has to force me to buy things I like or he will buy them.  If I like something and pick it up and start to put it back, he will take it and say he is buying it for me if I dont. Because he knows, there is one thing stresses me out more than buying things I dont need.  Other people buying me things I dont need.  

It makes me buy the thing.  "

How much is too much? If you're having a good time and not hurting others I don't think there is such thing as too much.
I always tell people to really think about complaining about their spouse immediately after an argument without processing it themselves (don't apply this rule to any physical or serious verbal abuse). This especially goes to people who complain ALL the time. You may forgive your spouse but your friends/family won't.  They will always think of your partner as being the bad guy based off of the things you complain about. This is especially true with people who complain a lot about others since chances are they probably say very few good things about them.

"What you are referring to is the model minority myth. While it is used to tell Black/brown ppl ""why can't you be like Asians,"" it is also used against us as ""you don't have it as bad as Blacks. shut up"" 

The price of model minority is the erasure of our history, one that is filled with oppression, exclusion, pain, and suffering. Politicians, both on the left and right, control the education we receive, you think they care at all about Asian American history? The fact that Chinese people were once excluded, Japanese were incarcerated, the largest mass lynching on US soil was done to Asians (1871 LA Massacre) run contrary to the meek, ""model"" image that Asians should be. The model minority myth serves to split apart minorities and uphold white supremacy, b/c they're scared of POC coming together to take down the warden. Meanwhile, some of us proudly flaunt being model minority, unknowingly serving as pawns of white supremacy and relegating themselves as palace eunuchs and concubines. "

From the finale:

Malcolm: You know what? I'm glad. This is appropriate. Now my life looks exactly how I feel. How could you screw me over like that!?

Lois: Because you were gonna take that job and we are not gonna let you throw your life away.

Malcolm: How is being rich throwing my life away!?

Lois: Because, it's not the life you're supposed to have. The life you're supposed to have is you go to Harvard and you earn every fellowship and internship they have. You graduate first in your class and you start working in public service either district attorney or running some foundation and then you become governor of a mid-sized state and then you become president.

Malcolm: ... What!?

Lois: of the United States!

Malcolm: Dad!

Hal: I'm sorry, son. It's true.

Francis: Thought you knew.

Hal: Our expectations started much smaller, but you just kept upping the ante.

Malcolm: What if I don't wanna be president?

Lois: It's too late for that. You're gunna do it.

Malcolm: Oh, really? Have you decided my position on capital-gains tax cuts? What are my foreign policy objectives?

Lois: That doesn't matter. What does matter is that you'll be the only person in that position who will ever give a crap about people like us. We've been getting the short end of the stick for thousands of years and I, for one, and sick of it. Now, you are going to be president, mister and that's the end of it.

Malcolm: Did it ever occur to you that I could have taken this job, gotten really rich, and then bought my way into being president.

Lois: Of course it did. We decided against it.

Malcolm: What!?

Lois: Because, then you wouldn't be a good president. You wouldn't have suffered enough.

Malcolm: I have been suffering all my life!

Lois: I'm sorry. It's not enough. **You know what it's like to be poor and you know what it's like to work hard. Now you're gonna know what it's like to sweep floors and bust your ass and accomplish twice as much as all the kids around you and it won't mean anything because they will still look down on you and you will want so much for them to like you and they just won't and it'll break your heart and that'll make your heart bigger and open your eyes and finally, you will realize that there's more to life than proving you're the smartest person in the world.** I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path. You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury.

Hal: That's Dewey.

Dewey: (happily) Really?

Malcolm: This is unbelievable. You actually expect me to be president. No, no, I'm sorry. You expect me to be one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.

Lois: You look me in the eye, and you tell me you can't do it."

"You know what?

When I was seventeen my biggest fear was that I would die before I got layed.

At sixty one I wish I had never had a sexual desire in my entire life.

I fucked up so many possible lifetime relationships because I wanted so much to be in a sexual relationship that I put myself and my desires before the people around me.

A lot of those people cared about me, but they will never want anything to do with me ever again. This is not about you so much as it is about me. When I look back on my life I regret letting my sexual desires cloud my thinking. It screwed up a large part of my life and a large part of me.

The problem is, a hallmark of Parkinson’s is the inability to dual task...walking while talking is super hard, let alone walking while listening to music. So, you have to introduce it slowly starting with literally walking while talking. Then introducing a metronome while they’re sitting and marching. Then while walking. Then add music at a certain beats per minute. Then up it. 

The research is sound and building. We can’t cure PD, but we can improve the quality of life in our patients by improving their mobility and allowing them to participate in their lives again!"

This creates a nice benefit whereby (1) join the extension school or continuing education program (2) work hard and show that you have an interest in your studies (i.e. participate), and (3) apply for matriculation after your first year.

I was ultimately responsible for putting myself into this situation with my roommate, and therefore I had no one else to shoulder the burden. I just had to pull up my grown up pants and make it work.

"Yeah, people seem to think that clingy just means that they want to spend a lot of time with them and cuddle. No, clingy is when they give you shit for wanting to hang out with friends, or blow up your phone at all hours of the day needing constant updates about what you are doing, and being paranoid whenever you interact with a member of the opposite sex.

Clingy =/= affectionate, and it's a big red flag. It may seem nice in the honeymoon phase of a relationship, but it will get real old real fast. "

"Now see initially, he was the sweetest sappiest prick I’d ever talked to. Made me feel bubbly and nice all the time. Now, somewhere along the line he must have realized I’m not all I was cracked up to be. Instead of simply telling me this (which I honest to goodness would have preferred), he just strung me along in a very half assed manner. Wouldn’t talk to me for days, yet would apologize for it. When he did decide it’s due time to acknowledge my existence, he’d wait until about 11 at night to message me so he could use the ‘I’m tired, gotta be up early. Night’ so he wouldn’t have to spend too much time talking to me. He didn’t say sweet things anymore, he didn’t seem to even enjoy talking to me. Which is why when I broke it off with him I was thoroughly confused when he said he’d always enjoyed our time together. I don’t know which to believe. He says he enjoyed spending time with me but his actions screamed otherwise. He was so nice in the beginning, blew my mind with the sweet things he’d say. “If I ever treat you badly then feel free to slap me upside the head, cause a girl like you deserves so much.” Haha piss off, knew ya were lying. I’m just going to keep telling myself I’m over it until I eventually am. He’s definitely thrown me off the dating scene for a while, though. That shit was exhausting. "

"The problem is that not everyone can get into that mindset since they are not aware of those kinds of references. Using Wayne's World as an example, a lot of people will not find it very funny because they don't understand the references due to not being exposed to the original material they reference (e.g. not finding the Terminator 2 joke funny because you haven't seen Terminator 2). It is easy to say that you just have to put yourself in the mindset of the time, but unless you have a frame of reference or background knowledge of the time it'll be really difficult.

As a side note, I think it shows how well a movie or show ages when it is still popular as well as getting newer viewers who missed out on the original run or showing. "

"If you're talking about domestic infant adoption, it's not like a pet store. You don't choose what baby you're adopting from a list of selections.  Most often you are matched with an expectant mother (and possibly father) through an attorney or adoption agency.  When dealing with agencies the expectant parent(s) review profile books created by waiting families and they choose the families they would like to meet.  Lawyers may also use profile books or just do a bit of matchmaking and try to put together two compatible individuals/families.

Sometimes you meet them beforehand and mutally agree to move forward.  Most adoptions today are open adoptions, meaning the birth parents maintain some level of contact with you and the child (how much and how often is up to the families) so it's important that you get along or at least have a mutual respect.  

There are cases where adoptions happen quickly (phone call about a baby born at a hospital, etc) and you don't get to meet or know anything in advance.  In those cases usually you have talked with your lawyer/agency and partner beforehand about situations that will work for you (i.e. if you as an adoptive family are open to possible disability, premature infants, exposure to drugs/alcohol, willing to take twins/multiples, etc) and are prepared to make a quick decision.  

There are other types of cases such as international adoptions, older child adoptions, or (some) foster care situations in which there are child profiles available and an adoptive family can express interest.  It does not mean that you will be matched with that child, only that you've indicated an interest.  You will still need to meet the child first and, often, everyone (especially older children) have to agree to move forward."

It makes sense that if they did exist in the same universe, then the two warrior cultures would have to meet at some point. I like to envision it as an AVP scenario where the predators try to collect and breed Klingons for sport, but when they try to quietly infiltrate, they blended too well. Predators interbreed with tos Klingon to get the cranially textured tng Klingon.

"Sounds like the company I work at. Someone decided we had too much inventory of spare parts at our various locations around the world. So of course we immediately implemented a freeze on new manufacture/purchase of anything we had we had ""excess"" stock of. Excess was defined as 60 days of stock. With no input from operations, of course.

The problem is that lead time (incl. vendor delivery time, sea-freight, customs) is a lot more than 60 days for many of our spare parts. Which is why we held more than 60 days stock in most locations. But no one would listen when we tried to tell them. Company politics got in the way because ""inventory reduction"" was the hot thing.

So fast forward a bit, and we constantly resorted to $1000 urgent air shipments for fucking o-rings which cost like $2. It was that or no-quote $100k+ jobs. But inventory technically came down! Hurrah!"

She also lived out in the country side, just got dropped off at the bottom of her driveway. She said she was walking up the road and she seen him squating down in some bushes watching her walk. He was to the right of the house like 20ft away. She was freaking out, still walking to the door. It was locked, but her little sister was home. My mom was really pounding on the door and that freaked out my  aunt. My mom ran in when she opened the door and started crying.  Both my grandparents were out playing BINGO.

"I feel like your first two examples are simple enough, but happiness is a pretty complex concept. You can certainly practice seeming happy, smiling when talking to people, etc. But happiness as a whole is way to complex to ""fake"", I feel. I'm not saying you have no control over your happiness, on the contrary. But to say you can fake it kind of understates its complexity. Most people don't even have a clear undestanding of what they think being happy is about. Not even of just what would make specifically them happy, let alone humans in general.

Edit: I realize that this question is about what worked for you specifically though. So if faking being happy worked for you, I'm happy it did."

"I'm pretty similar to /u/schmidty98 , and it may be a result of empathetic tendencies. If you have more mirror neurons than most, you tend to try to match others, because you become aware of the minutea of your impact on others. In order to not step on toes to the best effect, it requires matching them and adapting instead of just ""being yourself"". I can be myself, but only when others are not experiencing their insecurities or anxieties, otherwise I will feel guilty. The ability is kinda a double edged sword, I've been able to get every job I've ever had an interview for since I can fill their psychological needs, but it makes socializing exhausting with most people.

I do agree that my capacity for withstanding others insecurities has increased with my own self-esteem as I continue working out and doing what I want. However, my behaviors or beliefs have not really changed, just my willingness to carry them out instead of running away.

Edit: I do want to say, it is important to try and ""be yourself"" whenever you can, and those who you are able to do this around without rebuttle are those you should keep close to you. Avoid emotional blackholes like narcisists, they cannot be satisfied. "
"I don't think it's fully possible to tell actual homeless status, but wanted to address the second point. Sometimes local organizations will throw dinners/benefits for homeless folk during the holidays which may explain disappearances around that times, though if you're talking about a few days surrounding the holidays then who knows, perhaps they have family/friends that will only have them around holidays. But regarding the being gone at certain times of day, sometimes different groups or events are help at certain times and people may be attending them (one that comes to mind is Alcoholics Anonymous and similar programs that have fairly set schedules). Also they may be trying to get out of bad weather at certain times (e.g. moving into a shady spot or air conditioned building during the hottest parts of the day)."

Neither can children understand delayed gratification or penalties, so waiting before punishment does no good but confuse and possibly disturb them, nor does lax parenting as a strategy teach them a socially viable amount of sympathy and compassion.

"I used to volunteer at a Salvation Army to get a scholarship. It was, on the whole, a pretty enjoyable time because some really nice people worked there.

So what I did a lot was rearrange the VHS tapes in the back because they were always getting looked through and people don't put them back. I notice a VHS. Oh, look, it's Akira, that's a cool movie. And, oh, look, a Street Fighter movie. So I look through this anime that I guess some dude donated and then I see an odd one. Now, I know that a lot of anime often has suggestive covers, but this one went kinda far. There was a girl whose breasts and bits were barely covered by some tentacles that were binding her. So I look on the back and sure enough, ""This is not a video for children. To be watched by adults only.""

Some dude, or maybe someone who didn't know better, donated a shitload of hentai VHS tapes to a Christian charity, and the nice Cuban lady who ran the place stocked it all without knowing any better.

"He died. 

Roommate let some dude claiming to be maintenance into our college apartment. Guy walks to the water heater, grabs his bag, and pulls out a gun. 

Makes us get on our hands and knees while he goes around robbing the place. I saw his face and remembered that one line from a song about if they have a mask, they're coming for your stuff. If they don't have a mask, they're coming for your life. I thought I was as good as dead. 

Fortunately he ends up just robbing the place and then finally left. He went on to rob a Jimmy Johns that one of his friends worked at. Big mistake. 

Why? Well we ID him after seeing him in a picture with someone we went to college with. And so we report it. The KC Police thank us as they were seeking to press charges on a Jimmy Johns thief that matched the one who robbed us. I say great and ask how to help. 

After a couple days the District Attorney calls my cell phone and asks if I'd be willing to testify as a primary witness. I couldn't have been happier, I wanted to get this fuck after having him point his gun at me. 

Well months go by, nothing. Hmmm okay, just takes a while I guess. College finishes, still no call. So I go home back to California. About 6 months or a year later I get curious and google his name, only to find his obituary.

"This wasn’t my job but I was having brunch at the Flying Biscuit once and saw a group of ladies come in after church. Six of them, church clothes and the matching hats and bags, staff pulled two tables together (right next to mine) and the women basically kept the waitress running for the whole time they were there. 

They ordered the cheapest things on the menu - basic scrambled egg and toast type plates but then asked for a bunch of extra stuff. This place gives you free biscuits, butter and jam and they asked for two additional refills of biscuits, constant refills on coffee and water, and one lady sent her scrambled eggs back three times (after she took several bites from each place before noticing they were ‘wrong’). 

I’m sitting there at my own table enjoying my cheese grits and my flight of mimosas, watching this all go down, and they weren’t super nice to the waitress either. I was sure they were all going to ask for separate checks and I think the waitress was expecting it too, but surprisingly they did not. All on one check, paying cash. She drops their check and they start putting in money, hand it over to her and she goes to cash them out. They’re getting up and heading toward the door which was behind me, and the waitress hustles over and tells them that they didn’t put in enough and were short. 

One of these women tells her ‘Jesus’ll make it enough, baby’ and they walked out the door. 

This poor girl just looked like she was about to cry herself into a puddle on the floor, and there was no manager around that I could see. 

I am not sure how short she was but I gave her a $20, and tipped extra well on my bill. 

So Jesus didn’t make it enough, but another Jew did.

"ACLS is Advanced Cardiac Life Support. It's the intervention given during and MI or cardiac arrest. These are cardiac intervention medications, all with different effects. Traumatic Cardiac arrests have a very low survival rate (~7%) and might require thoracotomy-opening the chest cavity to relieve cardiac tamponade (equal pressure inside the heart and in the pericardial sac, which houses the heart) which will kill you because you're heart is unable to produce normal blood pressure. MI's, myocardial infarctions, or heart attacks, ACLS intervention is require to resuscitate the patient, however many of these patients will require heart catherization (usually opening occulded vessels) to cure the situation. However post-apocalypitcally, you won't have a cath lab nor a cardiologist.  So the intial intervention (ACLS) might revive the patient, but will not save the patient.

My math teacher reprimanded us whenever we used 'and' in a number as it is supposed to represent the decimal. I think it would be 'one hundred one' unless it is a 100.1 which would be 'one hundred one AND one tenth'. 
"Same situation, different outcome. I have a problem with hoarding food for later. I'm getting better now but for a long time I found it hard to finish things because if I could save it then I could have 2 meals instead of 1. Also avoided me getting yelled at for ""eating all of xyz"". Now I have to consciously remind myself it's ok to finish things because I can and will get more."
"Agreed. I'm 6ft1, very comfortable about my body etc. Constantly see ""Under 6ft? Swipe left"" and I have no hesitation.

Honestly the best moment for me on Tinder was asking a girl out who i'd been talking to for about 20 minutes, she asked if I was 6ft and stressed it was important, I answered, asked her height - she was 5ft3...
Knowing I didn't want to really go on a date with her anymore, I just wrote back ""Oh, I only like *real* women, I don't date below 5'10. Sorry!"""

"Similar situation.  Where I work we have a monthly potluck where you sign up and bring something for at least one month.  We even have labeled name tags to just stick on a month.  So one lady who is also a BBB signed up for the first month and brought a six pack of diet soda.  That’s it for 40 people.  Then every month she comes in at the beginning of the day and fills two plates and takes them to her room and then she comes back and eats during lunch shift.   So lots of people starting doing this and it got so bad that there wouldn’t be anything by lunch and half the staff wouldn’t get anything.  

This year I was in charge of November and I decided to do something about it.  So I sent out an email and talked to administrators and said we were doing a thanksgiving lunch and everything would be served at lunch so that everyone gets a chance.  So the day comes and BBB shows up at 8 in the break room and I’m setting things up.  She asked where the plates were and I reminded her that nothing is available until lunch.  She got upset about it and complained for almost 10 minutes and I ignored her.  She left but then came back an hour later expecting me to be gone.  Joke was on her though because I had planned on being there all morning to set up.  She then left and complained to our boss who reminded her about the email.  

She then rounded up a few people and they all came in at 10am trying to eat and I chased them out and they complained to our boss that they had always been allowed to eat before and my boss made an announcement reminding everyone that it was a special dinner so everyone was eating TOGETHER.  

Finally lunch came and much to BBB’s frustration she found out that people were dishing up food and serving people instead of everyone having to help themselves.  She tried even getting seconds and we didn’t let her because not everyone had been served.  

Then she was furious that I Wouldn’t let her have the leftovers because I was giving them to a couple of kids for their families.  We are talking kids that were so poor that they couldn’t afford dinner.  She threw a fit saying that I should let her have them because the kids probably didn’t have a way to reheat the food so it would just go to waste.  

Needless to say I didn’t feel bad at all.  "

"It's because people have lost all faith in the establishment politicians. The Republicans have been especially frustrated since the Democrats have mostly had control since Reagan. Meaning they either had enough of the house and Senate to counter balance a republican president, or they had the presidency as well. So someone who was considered to be outside of the dirty, backroom deals was going to be the guy to clean everything up. AKA ""drain the swamp"". Whoever ran his campaign knew exactly what they were doing, and they did a very good job at understanding how deep those frustrations ran in the general population. They sold him as the guy they had already seen on TV in the apprentice, cleaning up Washington with the phrase, ""you're fired!"". It was a great strategy if we're going to be honest. Even though Trump isn't actually that guy, people knew his TV persona and thought that was exactly what we needed right now. "
"&gt; If someone is not charged, they cannot be arrested.

In the UK you are arrested in order to take you 'downtown' for an interview. They then have 24 hours to interview and decide whether to press charges (more if it's a serious crime in question). An arrest in the case of a person being killed is entirely to be expected while the facts are determined, but does not require any charges to be pressed at the time."

Secondly, and this is the more relevant point to be honest... why can there not be overlap between the groups? There is nothing that makes group 1 and group 3 mutually exclusive? Hell you could even have people in both 1 and group 2. These 3 groups could account for 60&amp;#37; of Americans."

I broke it off with him and he went back to his old pot-smoking, drinking, partying self.  We are still friends now a decade and a half later but he got divorced just a couple months after marrying a devout Muslim woman and has reverted back to his wild days of travelling and adventure once again.

"So interestingly enough, a local cave here in TN had a similar legend. Back when this cave system (Cumberland Caverns) was being discovered and explored in 1810 by Aaron Higgenbotham, he was in the cave when his lantern went out. With no ability to see or know where he was going (and he hadn't told anyone what he was up to), he was trapped for 3 days before he was found. When he was found, his hair had turned completely white.

I found it so fascinating. I briefly researched it some because I found it also to be highly improbable, but found some information saying what has on occasion happened to people in high stress situations is all their hair EXCEPT their grey/white hair falls out, leaving them to look as though they have aged considerably in a very short amount of time.

I still don't know if I buy it, but it interesting nonetheless."

"&gt;I've actually known the light bulb story for many years and have used it as a way to convince people of the evils of planned obsolescence.

The light bulb story isn't quite as cut and dried though.  One of the reasons that bulb keeps going is that it has a VERY thick carbon filament compared to an average thin tungsten filament bulb, a side effect of which is it's a lot dimmer for the same wattage.  So an argument could be made, do you want to spend extra money replacing bulbs, or spend extra money on electricity making light?  And of those two options, which is cheaper in the long run?  Probably replacing bulbs to be honest."

"&gt;I've noticed that looks don't matter.

Online dating is people's expectations and views boiled down to the most basic level - if they're not attractive enough, you swipe away.  End of story.

Barely anyone reads profiles.  Most women don't even try on their profiles.

""I love walks, Game of Thrones, travel, laughing, hanging out, Netflix and want a partner in crime.  I dunno what else to write, so just ask!""

Who doesn't?  But there you have it, like 80% of women's profiles online.  And almost all don't respond to any message, regardless of how thoughtful.  ""Take the time to send a specific message to each profile you like the look of, mention something she wrote and go from there!"" Nope.  I've had far, FAR, FAR, FAR more success from generic copy-and-paste messages about which gin and tonic is best than actually trying.

Yet they expect yours as a guy to be some deep, meaningful insight and make her laugh.

Online dating is reflective of how people ACTUALLY think when dating.  

Looks over personality, always.  Which is why we're all so miserable and alone - because we all want someone really attractive and muscular or curvy with a great ass etc.  

Reality is, you won't get that, so accept it, lower your standards and you will be so much happier.  Chances are you're going to date and marry someone slightly overweight but matches you personality-wise.  So stop fucking trying to find your Chris Hemsworth as he's already taken.

But we don't, because you have so many options online now.  ""Why 'settle' for this guy when I've got 100 other messages waiting?""

People act like this online because it's how they ACTUALLY think in real life.  Real life just has consequences.  Ignoring people online has none."

"To tag on to this, if a dude makes comments about how slutty/ugly/fat other women are (like, making comments about strangers), I am immediately not impressed cause frankly I'm already thinking ahead to how he'd treat me if I didn't toe the line enough. I had an ex who had a very narrow range of what found acceptable from a partner and he started making those comments early on about other women. It's never a good sign and is an indicator of how he'll treat you. 

No one wants to date a shitty bigot who doesn't respect his partner.

For me, it happened during training.  We were doing a basic extrication class, we were cutting a door off a SUV.  I was positioning the door (had been cut at the hinge, needed to be cut at the nader pin for practice) to help the guy with the spreaders get a better bite.  He got his bite, the force of which closed the door.  Well, my dumb ass had positioned so that when I held the door open, I was between it and the frame.  There was a good 3 feet of space between the two when I started.  Then it was door-idiot (me)-frame.  That FREEZE! command was crystal clear from me.  Now I can honestly say I've been slammed in a car door.  With 30,000 pounds of force.  Never did that again, either.  Oh, I was just fine.  Not even a bruise, but when the spreaders stopped, I could't even wiggle my torso.  No pain, just pressure.  A friendly reminder that the tools we use can crush a man without so much as straining."

"I have a friend who has two sons - 1 my son's age (15), one my youngest daughters age (8). The youngest boy was born with some significant health issues he survived - but is on the spectrum. The older boy is normally very sweet, very quiet, and you can tell stopped getting a lot of attention when the youngest was born. They lived with their grandma &amp; mom, but all of that just changed as mom and grandma were at each other's throats for a while. We hadn't seen them in about 8 months, and my three kids &amp; I decided to help with this move. 

- while cleaning the garage, my kids were working harder than I've ever seen them work. The 8 year olds were supposed to be sweeping - but only my daughter was. Grandma said something to the boy to which he responded 'You shut your mouth Grandma!'.  My initial reaction  was to swiftly drop what I was doing, get in this kids face and start yelling at him as if he were mine.  I felt like I was in Talladega Nights. On the spectrum or not, and no matter how 'mean' Grandma is, we fucking don't talk to her like that. Ever. 

- Grandma and the older boys went to drop her stuff of that water loaded in her SUV at her new place. Gma felt her grandson was being a lazy ass and leaving all the work for my son, and an argument ensued. The kid takes his 74 year old cancer riddled grandma's coffee from her, and starts playing keep away. 
My son told me later he didn't know what to do, so he calmly walked up to hit friend, put one hand on his shoulder, took the coffee away and with a :| face said 'dude. What the fuck? No.' and gave the coffee back. 

- whew. We got in the car and drove away when done. At a light I gave all my kids high fives and praised their hard work (my 17 year old was there too), and we had a celebration for not being the most dysfunctional family we know anymore.  We had never been to THEIR house before, just them at our home or on adventures. "

"I once saw an old German couple travelling along the 401 near Toronto Canada stopped at one of those On Route visitor stops. Well these places are full of fast food restaurants, this one having an AnW, a fast food restaurant famous for their root beer. 

Now for those European friends who don’t know, most fast food restaurants don’t sell alcohol, but I guess this elderly German tourist saw the word “root beer” (which is highly advertised at AnW) and assumed it was an alcoholic beer.

"I realize I'm not 100% in line with your average consumer - but I can't imagine many of purchases being better if bought from a local business. On the day to day stuff they probably can't beat the pricing of Target or Amazon. And honestly, that goes for most things.

Totally on board with supporting local businesses but the times have changed. It's not entirely some corporate conspiracy either. Things just change. Even the big players like Wal-Mart have had to expand their offerings to keep up with Amazon.

I just moved and have probably spent upwards of $500 in the last month on retail purchases. There isn't a single item that I can think of that would have been cheaper or more convenient than how I bought them (Target, Amazon, IKEA).

You're left with with services, custom goods, niche goods, and high end goods. Maybe more but that's all I can think of at the moment. Services is a big one and I think that's the place where people could really put in more effort if their city offers it. Your local restaurants and bars will always appreciate the business. Seems like movie theaters are pretty popular too.

"Out of touch with what!? I have to kill 4 billion people. So I use that unfortunate scenario to get rid of the worst threats to global stability and the future of humanity. I’m sorry, but I think Islam has been a pretty fucking awful actor on the global stage.

Christians came much later on my list because, while still often annoying, Christians are by and large a peaceful group that have been openly secular for decades and who continue trending positively on human rights issues. Furthermore, there are literally zero influential countries (potentially zero altogether, except the Vatican) that are “Christian states.” If we wiped out Christianity, we’d wipe out the majority of Western culture, which would be very bad for humanity. If we wiped out Islam, we’d wipe out a fuckton of evil regimes with it. Cold? Yes! But READ THE QUESTION AND TRY TO GIVE ME A WARM AND FUZZY ANSWER!

If it were the 1500’s, I might consider wiping out Christianity. But it’s not the 1500’s, and Christians aren’t trying to become the one and only global religion AND enforce a Christian version of Sharia law on the world. So sorry, I’m gonna take out Islam if forced to kill 4 billion people. Thankfully, I don’t have to!"

"I run a bar and grill and we have a steady number of tourists coming in. Last Friday a dude sat outside, ordered a few pints and a steak, nothing wrong. A bit later one of the waitresses came up to me and told me this dude was creeping her out. I asked her what was wrong. Apparently the dude was staring at her non-stop, asked her out, to which she said no, so he asked again. A couple of times.  


I told her I'd take over the section he was in so she wouldn't have to deal with him. He asked me if the waitress was single or not, I told him listen dude, she's pretty and cute, I get it. However, being friendly is part of our jobs, not a sign of interest. She's not interested, best move on buddy. He seemed to get it, paid for his meal and left.   


Yesterday the dude came in again. Same ordeal. Only now he sat at the bar, which is right next to the kitchen, so the girl HAD to pass him every now and then. He asked her out again, she turned him down again. Then he asked till what time she was working, she replied till closing time. Dude eventually paid and left.   


Guess who showed up after closing time and tried to get in? Yep, I was ready to punch a brother out, but luckily the waitress and locked the door, smart girl."

"Yes. My ex fiancé had hidden a serious drug addiction, had taken up burglary of our apt complex whilst recovering from surgery (from what I later found was an injury he self inflicted for pain pills). Came home from work and college one night to detectives arresting him, and my landlord informing me that we had been evicted weeks prior, and he kept removing the notices. I would hand him rent money, he would hand me a money order receipt, and I had absolutely no clue he had been cashing them out to himself all along and hiding all late notices. Like I said, truly a traumatic experience. I brought all of his stuff to his parents’ home, cashed the ring out, paid off the rental and all other fees he had left me with, and booked a ticket for Europe. Left all my stuff in storage, and at 24, was very much looking forward to a trip to Europe I had wanted my entire life, and with an excuse for a vacation few people could argue against. I was determined to enjoy myself and come back from the summer refreshed and repaired and ready to buck up and carry on in life.

His proposal, while shocking, was just another “FML” moment of a horrible year, and I was determined to continue on and make the most of it as planned. It was foolish to have tried to continue on backpacking with him but he HAD NEVER ONCE crossed that platonic line before. I had zero experience with him behaving in that way, and thought he would snap out of it. What proceeded was a few weeks of watching him become a heavy drinker, awkward situations trying to make friends (as I do easily and had never experienced jealousy as a problem with him), and the complete unraveling of what was previously a truly beautiful friendship. He was like a brother to me, more family than my own blood. It was devastating to lose that friendship, and I hurt for him, seeing him hurt in that way. I even mistakenly tried to reason with myself at one point that maybe he wasn’t wrong with the idea of us, but I absolutely 100% was not attracted to him. Had a few drunken wine nights even debating how relevant physical attraction was to partnership (answer: VERY, at least for me), and just kept hoping my friend would come back to planet earth along the way. The last night of drunken grabbing and literal physical attempts to hold me in place to “just see what a kiss would be like” was the last straw. 

I admit fault in my mindset there fully."

Project wise and negotiation wise it allows me to remain focused on the bigger picture for projects and cut bloat/enhance areas that might be problematic.

"There was a kid that my entire class used to bully, but myself and a few others were definitely the center of it.  Granted, he did plenty of shit that merited some jabs (verbal, not physical), and some shit that did merit a bit of physical (Like when he out of nowhere screamed in somebody's ear while they had their head down on the desk).

To set the scene, this was leading up to the Halo 2 release date.  Everyone was excited for it and talking about it.  But this kid, he got wayyyy too into it.  During class, he would just sprawl out on the floor and start army crawling under people's desks, and popping up and pretend to shoot people, and then would get legitimately mad when nobody would play along because we were trying to fucking learn.  So he got teased a lot to the point where the word ""Sasquatch"" was banned in the school.  If anyone was caught calling him (or anyone else) sasquatch, it was an automatic ISS (In school suspension) for the first 2 times, and OSS for the 3rd time on. 

The kid himself was like the personification of /b/ or /pol/, without doing it for comedic purposes. If you were to try to picture what the average user on those boards was like, it was this kid.  

Anyhow, senior year rolled around, and I hadn't had to deal with the kid the entire year other than passing him in the hallways where I typically just ignored him.  Over time I sort of felt bad because the more I thought about it all, the more I realized he very likely was well into the spectrum, but for whatever reason he just never got put in any of the special ed classrooms.  And no, it wasn't that he was bright.  He failed damn near every test, and all of the projects we had to do for the classes we had together always looked like a 5 year old made them.  I have no clue to this day why he wasn't in special ed, but regardless, I felt really bad about giving him so much shit because it was likely that he couldn't help it.

So one day while passing him in the halls I stopped him to apologize.  I said my piece, apologized, and told him I didn't expect him to forgive me or anything, but just tried to give him peace of mind that I really didn't have any ill-will towards him, and that he frankly was just annoying when he would go over the top with his antics.  I guess it wasn't necessarily 100% a full on apology, but rather a very honest, ""I'm sorry for how I acted, but man you have to tone that shit down"" type of deal.

This kid just stood there like a deer in the headlights, and kept looking around the corner as if somebody was going to pop out for a prank.  When I realized he wasn't going to say anything, I started to leave, but then I noticed he was just walking backwards staring at me the entire time.  He walked backwards down the entire fucking hallway staring at me all wide eyed like I was Boo from Mario.  

A couple months after graduation, I got a random message from him on Facebook telling me that he accepted my apology, and acknowledged he doesn't really know how to tone things down.  In summary, I pretty much said, ""Cool, I hope things get better for you now that high school was over"".  I never heard anything about or from him since.  He's not on any social media, and never went to college or anything from what I could tell leading up to graduation as he explicitly said multiple times that college is just high school that you pay for."

"A small cafe serving an endless supply of Italian pastries and coffee. There's a small elderly man who runs the joint by the name of Antonino. He's originally from Sicily, along with his wife who serves Chianti to a group of men seated at a corner table playing an Italian card game known as Briscola.

Antonino's brother runs a pizza place which is joined up to the cafe behind another door. You can smell the aroma of traditional pizza wafting through every now and again. On the TV there is soccer playing nonstop, I get to watch any league, any team, any game from history. I choose to watch the 1982 World Cup on repeat.

My deceased family members are there, too. My grandparents on my father's side sit with me and speak to me in their broken English about the good old days. We play some cards, I enjoy my pipe every now and then. 

Enrico Caruso and Andrea Bocelli play on a radio somewhere behind the counter, while Antonino hums along to the music and intermittently remarks about the game on the TV.

I phone my wife every day to make sure her and the kids are doing well. She gets to chat with my grandparents that she never not to meet and they share a joke over the phone.

Each night the cafe comes alive with revellers as a three piece band plays Mediterranean music. The mandolin player has the most affect on the crowd as he wows everyone with his astonishing talent. 

I step outside to enjoy the cool breeze and a quiet conversation with whomever so happens to be I proximity. We discuss anything from politics, sport, history, romance, food... This goes on until people begin to leave.

I reenter the cafe and help Antonino and his family clean up. In return, he pours me a glass of red wine and tells me he'll see me in the morning. I sit in the quiet of the cafe, looking forward to doing it all again tomorrow.

In reality, I like independent women. You are your own person and I am my own person. I don't have to be, nor do I want to be, your only form of entertainment.

It's way too much of a burden to place on one person. Every time I see an overly attached person, I think they must have some serious issues being alone. If you can't love yourself and find entertainment outside the relationship, you're going to have a really bad time in the dating/marriage game."

"&gt;LVs famously develop a 'patina' over time (discolor) and the brand has marketed this as a feature.

But it is though. the leather discolouration comes from the type of leather they use and isn't easily faked. it's one of the ways you can see that the bag is legitimate. I know plenty of people with LV bags and there are quite a few stores selling vintage LV bags. If they would fall apart the second you'd buy them there wouldn't be a lot of vintage/secondhand LV bags on the market in the first place.


I think fashion brands are irrelevant in this discussion because you can't really call an aesthetic ""top of the line"" it's a matter of taste.
Therefore I could say that prada makes the best luxury bags because instead of using smelly leather, they use nylon. It's irrelevant.

If you're into leather goods, look into leather brands. If you're into fashion, pick your poision, there is no top of the line there. 

To add to this, a lot of LV bags aren't even made out of leather. LV, especially the monogram print is known to be on canvas, which is actually really good quality, well made stuff. Then there's virgil becoming the new creative director and actually using a lot of different materials instead of leather for LV's luggage and bags, like iridescent and see through plastics.


And if you wanna have a discussion then i'd argue that Bottega Venetta is the undisputed king of leather goods because of their technique and craftmanship."
The same can be said for asking too much about your date but not talking about yourself at all.

"What has always annoyed me about the argument about “Columbus didn’t discover America/New World, the Vikings did” is that, yes while there is evidence of Nords being in the northern reaches of Canada, their settlements lasted only a few years before the abandoned them, so no foothold here, and I’ve never heard or read anything of them telling anyone else that “Hey, there’s a ton of land across the water where there could probably be lots of new stuff.” (Correct me if I’m wrong) 

Columbus sailed west, discovered the Caribbean, and went back to Europe and told them about it, allowing further exploration and settlement on the North and South American continents. Discovery is where you find something, and actively tell other people about it. So Columbus is far more a discoverer of the New World/North America than the Nords were."

"This sub is the reason why it's a terrible idea for Reddit  to include a news tab on their mobile app. 

EVERY SINGLE NEWS/POLITICS SUB is exactly like /r/news or /r/politics.

I kinda try to avoid watching at her place and when she texts me to come over and watch, I just don't respond. I've told her to just watch without me but she refuses. So what does she do? She just walks straight into my apt with her dog and starts a convo with me. I am clearly in the middle of an intense FIFA match and she's now in my apt watching me, waiting for the game to end to make me come over and watch this show with her. Now, I have to make sure my damn door is locked in case she tries to ambush me again. 

Another time is she was being annoying and begging to go out and get a drink. I finally caved and took her out with some of my friends. (She friends with them too). And she literally just followed me around the entire night and wouldn't leave me alone. God forbid I try to talk to another chick she just walks up and says ""Hey, who's your new friend?"".

"Job interviews go both ways, there are red flags employers look for in candidates, and red flags candidates should be looking for in the company. Some common mistakes to avoid as a job seeker:

* Not bothering to know what the company does, at all, whatsoever
* Jack of all trades, people who feel the need to say they can do x, y, and z on top of a,b, and c, when we are only hiring people who know about a, b, and/or maybe c - read the job description folks!
* Showing up late or more than 10 minutes early to the interview. Some offices don't have waiting areas and showing up too early shows a lack of awareness/respect for others' time, and can stress some hiring managers out. 
* Showing no enthusiasm for the job.
* Oversharing. Do not dive into your personal life and relationships, or that you were fired from your last job, and especially do not say why you were fired from said job. 9/10 it comes off as immature and tactless. If the interviewer asks why you're no longer with a company, and you were fired, you can say your contract ended, wasn't the best fit, focus on school / take care of family, no room for growth, career change, etc. "

"Heavy metal music.  The genre has such a tremendous amount of stigma surrounding it because of the reputation of death metal as evil and satanic (which is actually kind of funny, because it's actually *black* metal that's primarily satanic, though death metal isn't all daisies and roses either), that most people don't give it a serious try, even though black and death metal are only a small subsection of the entire genre.  I also believed the reputation of metal until it came up on Pandora and I found I really liked it.  I feel like a lot of people would find stuff there that they like if they only moved past the reputation surrounding the genre, and that extra traffic would help metal bands tremendously; metal's niche fan base doesn't generate nearly enough revenue for any but the most popular of bands to make a living, and a boost to that revenue might encourage even more artists to join in and expand the genre."

I learned more under him in 6 months than I did in 2 years of self-study.

The CEO, on the other hand, would constantly change my current task with new asks, would have me prioritize inane bullshit instead of actual value-add features, and pretty much just ignored the CTO's protestations that I should focus on actually doing what they hired me for, not miscellaneous nonsense. To be honest I'm not entirely sure the CEO understood what my job was supposed to be.

The CTO, seemingly having had enough of the CEO's bullshit, left ""to pursue other ventures"" (he owned a small business on the side). I bailed first chance I got after he left, as things only got worse. I have never since had a job that went south so fast.

"This wasn't me quitting, but it's a pretty great story of some coworkers that had enough of the shitty, mean owner of the restaurant.

I worked at a sushi restaurant that had a really high turnaround rate. The reason why is because one of the owners was a huge bitch who loved to yell at people. I saw people come and go, most usually lasted only a few days. There was a sushi chef there that had been there for a while. He was pretty cool and we got a long great when we worked together. His girlfriend also worked there as a cashier and a lot of times they were scheduled together.

One Saturday that I was supposed to be off, I get a call from Carol (the bitch boss) asking me if I could come in. Apparently Max and his girlfriend had had enough of her and they both just straight up left and walked out of the restaurant. The place was pretty small so usually it was just the cooks in the back, the sushi chef, and the cashier/delivery driver. So, when they left, they basically left the place empty aside from the cooks, who did not speak English that well.

I decided to take the shift for the extra money and when I got there Carol was already there behind the sushi prep area making orders. She usually didn't come in at all on weekends, but would still watch the security cameras occasionally from her laptop at home and if she saw you standing around doing nothing, she would call and yell at you. It turns out that was exactly what she did to Max and his girlfriend and they had finally had enough. Carol showed me the security footage of Max yelling at her over the phone, hanging up, then taking off his apron and both him and his girlfriend flipping of the security camera and walking out.

She was showing me because she couldn't believe how disrespectful they were and how they could just leave the restaurant like that when there were customers in it. Personally, I thought it was pretty badass they walked out together, I know I wanted to quit hundreds of times when I was there, but I was a broke college student that needed the money.

Last I heard of them was that they both got jobs at the sushi place that was competing with the restaurant they walked out on."
"When i was about 5 or 6 I slipped off a pool noodle in the deep end of an in ground pool. There wasn't anyone in the pool with me but my grandpa was watching from the side. I was apparently thrashing around like you'd expect a drowning child to do, and my grandpa couldn't get a hold of me. The solution he came up with was to yank me out of the pool by grabbing a fist full of my hair. Lmao I mean, it worked. 

I sat on the edge of the pool for a minute, crying and coughing. My grandpa made sure i was breathing and went back to his chair with his newspaper. I remember crying and then looking around and realizing that he wasn't freaking out, so I must be fine. So i got back in the pool. Lmao."

"You ever hear that if you turn the heat up gradually enough, a frog won't notice it's in boiling water until it's good and dead? (I don't know if that's true, scientifically. I don't hate frogs enough to find out.) Doesn't matter if it is or not, the idea gets referenced a lot because it illustrates a part of the human condition. Similarly to the frog, you didn't just hop into boiling water. More likely than not it started out with things so subtle you can't even point to the beginning of it. Things you thought were normal, then things you thought might be slightly off but he got irritated with you if you questioned it or tried to bring it up as an issue. This is just what normal couples do, you're just overreacting or imagining things, you're being irrational. (He might have gaslit you as well - did he ever say stuff like ""I pay for shit all the time, you just don't notice when I do"" or ""Grown adults pay for their own things, you're being immature""?) And people with severe control issues are very, very good at knowing how to make this seem convincing. So you think to yourself, well okay, it's not a big deal anyway. It was a tiny little thing, but he's right, that shouldn't have bothered me. And then once he manages to set the new normal just *slightly* to the left of where the old normal was, well, he decides to do it again, and things escalate step by step. This is a slow process and it takes months or years. 

(Not that I know anything about your situation, but I was in an abusive relationship, this is how it went for me. YMMV.)

No matter how it went for you, I do know that right now you're noticing the water and thinking ""How could I be so stupid? It's clearly boiling!"" It didn't start out that way though, and you're not a rube for not noticing it heat up. "

"I don't think it's the intelligence part. I'm a high functioning autist with very high IQ and these are a few things I've learned in trying to adapt. People don't get annoyed at intelligence. It's when you talk about something the other person doesn't care about and you don't listen to them along with being unable to read the room and know what types of things to talk about and in what way. Obviously adapting the language you use to your audience is a big thing too. Talking to a professor is different from talking to a stranger at a party and you have to adapt your language accordingly. If you want to impress people with your understanding of language it's generally better to reach for the most appropriate word instead of the longest or first one that comes to mind. I could be off, but it sounds like OP might be struggling with these kinds of issues and just understanding the unwritten rules of conversation that autistic people have trouble with."

"i worked with a guy who did the same. He also wouldn't use this exercise app because when I showed him how it worked, the model demonstrating how to do the move was a woman.

Her estrogen had obviously infected the whole app and exercises therein. No doubt if you did a pull up based on its guidance, you would start growing a uterus. "
"I think a lot of the hype was because when it came out, this type of bullying was never accurately represented in media. I was a young teen when the movie came out and it was just so different from everything else we had been presented that we all loved it, and we continue to love it for nostalgic reasons. 

Girl-vs-girl bullying was always portrayed in the same way: girls are best friends, Girl A's boyfriend flirts with/hits on/makes a move on Girl B. Girl B is suddenly totally ostracized by everyone for no real reason, everyone is over-the-top horrible to her (in ways that in real life admin would definitely *not* ignore) and then it all ends with some sweet justice and possibly apologies. There's probably a mom who campaigns to save her daughter, viciously fighting the negligent and apathetic school. 

Mean Girls didn't do that - while the movie is definitely exaggerated in some ways, the actual politics (for lack of a better word) between the girls is pretty spot on for what high school was actually like for a lot of us: there was always a justification, and no one was stupid enough to do things that would get them caught. No one was dumb enough to spray paint lockers, or make public Facebook groups/websites. Things were subtle, intentionally vague so that you could deny it later. There was always that plausible deniability, and also, the moral grey area. The typical movie up until this point painted the bully as Bad and the Victim as Good with no in between, but Mean Girls has all of the characters pitted as both bully and victim at different points - and that was much more realistic to my own high school experience. Not that we were ""pranking"" each other in the way that Cady &amp; Janis do to Regina, but there was a lot of back and forth with shitty things, it wasn't all one-sided. 

Likewise, this genre of film (girl-vs-girl bullying) was rarely humourous and often had a really satisfying conclusion where the bully gets expelled/ostracised/something and that rarely happened to us. While we may not all have had an emotional speech at our year-end dance, we never saw any repercussions for much of what we did, or what was done to us. It just...went away, much like the bullying in Mean Girls. Cady and Regina don't make up, they don't apologise to each other. Neither is punished significantly (not directly anyways, Regina getting hit by the bus can be seen as punishment but it's not brought about by any form of authority) and neither ""loses"" in the traditional sense - instead, the group fractures and they move on. That's pretty much spot on what happened to my group of ""frenemies"" in high school: there was a catalyst and then it was over, and we weren't the only group at my high school to act like that. 

Idk I feel like Mean Girls is so well-loved because, at the time, it felt like there was *finally* a movie that accurately represented high school - even if the characters weren't copies of people you knew, or the events weren't exactly the same as your own experience, the general vibe and the portrayal of high school and high school friendships were just...spot on for what it was like. And it was refreshing. 

TL;DR: Mean Girls felt much more like real life than any other movie about high school and it spoke to a lot of us, and now we all love it because of nostalgia."

"Holy shit this just reminded me. When I was like 19 I was over at my best friend's house and her mom runs into the living room while we're watching supernatural or some teenage girl shit and she's like ""I just read an article about how kids drink alcohol through their butts and it KILLS THEM! IF YOU DO THAT YOU COULD DIE!! Promise me you girls won't ever ever do that!!"", Keep in mind, she had NEVER brought up anything about partying or alcohol or ANYTHING like that to me so I started laughing because it was so out of the blue and she starts CRYING because she thought I had already been doing it because I was laughing. And then my friend started laughing and her mom got really fucking mad and left and went back to her room. Holy shit I had forgotten all about it until just now. My friend and I were fucking dweebs too, we didn't party or drink or anything even after we turned 21, I have no idea why her mom freaked out like that"

Basically, fucked up human beings who need to be monitored as they promote rape and violence against women since they are virgins and women won't have sex with them. They think it's because of how they look, but really it's just their *incredibly* shitty personalities. "

I'm a virgin too (although way younger than him and have already kissed) and to be honest if a girl friend, no matter how attractive, just went up and said something like that to me... Man I just wouldn't know how to react. I mean, I've spent these years with pretty much zero intimacy and then all of a sudden I'm jumping straight into sex? Obviously the first time will be FAR from perfect, that's completely logical. But if a guy isn't comfortable with touching and getting touched for example... how the hell is he and his partner going to enjoy sex, no matter how far from perfect it may be? Going slow and steady would seem to be the best option... Then again it might be just me.

Either way my point is that he might be feeling uncomfortable in some way about having sex right off the bat (like I am) and he may be afraid to express that, so he just goes with some generic excuse like ""it has to be perfect"", out of fear of being ridiculed. Then again I don't know him so I'm not sure how true this might be... it's my take on it."

The shitty entitled people all looked at each other and no one moved, so these people carrying babies and in wheelchairs had to uncomfortably squeeze through all of them.

Yeah but it’s illegal for civilians to lie to the cops, and it’s legal for cops lie to civilians 

Maybe there’s a distinction between street cops and cops in interrogations, who are allowed to do pretty much anything they want in states that haven’t addressed this problem, and probably at a federal level, too

Honestly, encountering such a dismissive attitude from someone in the legal system towards such an unjust problem in that system is pretty discouraging, and speaks to a broader lack of accountability in the American police system 

I don’t mean to come off as unappreciative of your service. But the US justice system has some serious issues (we incarcerate a higher percentage of our population than any country, we effectively have debtors prisons, minorities are murdered without consequences), and dismissing those concerns wont lead to any progress

"The short answer is that it is a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 et seq., or the equivalent laws under the EU competition commission or your local jurisdiction.

The long answer is that price fixing results in deadweight economic loss to society.  In an ideal free competitive market, the price of goods is set by competitive forces in the market, which tends to drive prices down to the marginal cost of the producers, which maximizes economic gain to society.  By fixing prices, competitors increase price and reduce output; this increases the competitors' economic profits, but also results in a deadweight loss that is not offset by gains to any market actor.  We want free competitive markets without price fixing, so we criminalize such conduct to de-incentivize it. "

I had a friend come out as gay a few years after high school so I ended up at gay bars on occasion because we all went with him so he didn't have to go by himself.  Not once was I ever hit on haha.

When I was in Highschool I was responsible for getting myself to school as everyone in my home left very early in the morning for work. 
My alarm didn’t go off this morning and I jumped up in a frenzy when I realized I was running quite late. I went straight to the bathroom and was brushing my teeth and I heard very clearly, “you’re going to be late.”
It came from the hallway and it sounded like a woman speaking very firmly like I was being scolded. The house was completely empty except for me. I was caught off guard, of course, and looked out into the hallway and nothing.  
I go back to what I was doing thinking I didn’t hear what I just heard. It didn’t make any sense so I tried to ignore it. Just as I felt calm again the stereo in my dad’s room turned on and started playing music at full volume.
I walked to his room and stood in the doorway looking around. Naturally I was pretty freaked out again, but told myself the stereo must have an alarm feature and it’s going off right now, but no.  When I turned off the stereo I see there is no alarm setting on the thing. The rest of my life in that house I never experienced anything strange.

This was over ten years ago, but I can still recall the sound and tone of the voice so clearly."

""Cancer"" is just shorthand for ""cells that grow out of control""; there are so many different types of cells that can grow out of control, and for so many different reasons, and in so many different places, that there's no way *any* single treatment other than reversing time could affect them all.

I have long believed that you should never say somebody has ""cancer"", but rather that they have ""a cancer"". It might help get rid of this myth."

"&gt;yet she tells my partner how he doesn't pay attention to her, make her feel special etc. 

I get this. My ex boyfriend towards the end of our relationship stopped doing anything to show he cared about me. He needed asking every single time to do chores we had long agreed to split. I would be going through a stressed busy patch at work with late finishes and he did nothing to take anything off my plate, I'd still come home and have to cook or do dishes. He never did nice things like making me a cup of tea or giving me a backrub. He would say no if I asked him to go out and do something with me and if he did say yes he would be grumpy and ruin it. I specifically told him what I needed from him in order to feel cared for and he would always say he would change them didn't. 

Long story short... of course I didn't want to fuck him! This isn't a withholding sex as currency thing, like ""I will only have sex once you do the dishes!"" It was a me being stressed and him doing nothing to ease that and then coming home and having to clean up and that putting me in a bad, resentful mood. It's me finding you way less attractive because you aren't showing me love. I'm not going to fuck you out of duty, to make the relationship better, when you are doing nothing on your end to make it better.

One month into community college and my grades are good. I also have a job interview on Wednesday so it’s working out for me so far. Classmate also got his shit together.

He’d sit and play games like chess or Professor Layton with me when I was caught up on work, and saw that I had a passion for math and science and worked to push me in to what I liked. He coached our basketball team and somehow managed to make everyone feel equally important among a group of girls.

We were in Arizona at the time. Flash forward to my senior year of high school. He’s living in Florida working at Disney World, I’m in Alabama. He finds out that I’m taking a trip to Disney and actively works with me to meet up with me.

He’s been actively involved in encouraging me ever since he was my teacher. My class was his first ever class, so maybe that’s why. I’ll never forget him and I’ll always be grateful.

"Scariest thing for me (and it wasn't too bad but freaked me out at the time) was when I used to live alone in a flat. Went for a pee and whilst standing doing my business I saw the reflection of someone walking behind me in the mirror. I checked every inch of that place, door still locked I was on the 1st floor so no entry via windows. Freaked me out for a while. Thankfully I had a dog at the time (Staffordshire bull terrier, no it wasn't his reflection he wasn't 5ft tall).  I made him follow me round the house checking rooms and he refused to go into the kitchen. So, like any real man I grabbed my keys and we both went out for a while. Figured if there was someone there I didn't want to be anywhere near the place. 

Went home a little while later everything exactly as I left it. Girlfriend at the time said I was probably just tired."

I live in Central Texas, nowhere near a natural habitat for either of these two critters. It's was about 12-14 inches across, claw to claw. "

"Agreed. I don't want my fruit mashed into the bottom of the cup in an old fashioned. So many places do that and I don't get it. It ends up being this pulpy orange and cherry mess that doesn't really taste good. 

A classic Old Fashioned is just simple syrup, bitters (or even better, muddle the sugar and bitters together) and liquor. Serve with a flag of orange and cherry. On rare occasion, muddle the orange peel in the bottom of the glass to get some of those oils into the drink but not the pulpy fruit mess. "

I then found out that Bumble is a thing and it's selling point is that ""women have to make the first move"" and they claim it's empowering for women. Why do you need Bumble to feel ""empowered""? You can send the first message on any chat window or ask someone you like out IRL.

"For those who can’t or won’t watch the video:

The Strid is a section of River Wharfe where the rover effectively “rotates” 90 degrees. So say a river has a lazy pace when it’s 40 ft wide and 4-6 ft deep. The bottom couple of feet might move a bit quicker than the surface, but not too much. 

Well, at the Strid the 40 ft wide river becomes 6 ft wide. The result of this narrowing is that the lower section of the water is moving at an incredible pace. And not only is it moving fast, it is moving through underground caves, around boulders and logs, and under overhanging banks. The power and speed of the river has carved an insane path through the ground that had never been able to be recorded. You would be lucky for your body to be found, if you fell in. 

This is also part of the reason why it is important to wear proper safety gear when rafting/kayaking/canoeing and knowing the whitewater float if you fall out. If your foot gets hooked on an underwater obstacle, the force of the river pushes you forward and under, drowning you. But proper safety gear and floating on your back with your feet at the surface facing downstream, is a big help."

It turned out to be from my favorite teacher, the poor woman who endured my bad puns and artistic liberties for most of high school.

But gifts aren't common in my family, and most of my family didn't make it to the graduation ceremony, let alone gifts. The small gift meant the world to me, and reminded me that I was worthy of doing awesome things.

"My circumstances for not starting school at 18 were completely different, but my husband and I started college around the same age. We both had to full-time work and full/part-time student in order to get our degrees.

It took me 7 years to get a bachelor's degree while everybody I used to know was already graduated and moving on with their lives. The whole time I was in school I felt bad that I was so far behind and my life wasn't starting.

But here I am now at 29, just finished my first year of actual work and I feel proud and achieved that I did it all on my own. I appreciated being in college a lot more and even made Dean's List a few times. I have always been a good student but sincerely believe I would not have done as well if I started school even just a couple years earlier.

I don't care anymore that it took me until I was 28 to graduate and start my career, I'm just glad I got here at all. As my husband (at 30) finishes his final year, we are now finally starting to save for a house and start a family of our own.

"Hottest *and driest.*

Fun fact though! There are various species of pupfish scattered throughout Death Valley, each species living in a single isolated spring. Some of them even live in seasonal springs that dry up every summer, so they have to live their whole life in one season and lay durable eggs that will last over the dry period and hatch only when there's water again.

About 10,000 years ago the region was covered by a massive lake and there was only one pupfish species. As it dried up, small populations of pupfish survived, stranded, in tiny pools of water, and drifted farther and farther apart from each other. I like to think of it like a galactic empire of fish that lost their FTL travel technology, so now all the fish colonies are stranded out in the vastness of space."

Notably, dropping down to the lowest common denominator isn't actually a bad thing so long as the upper levels aren't particularly affected. Some people are born less intelligent. They still deserve to be given enough of an education so people can't rip them off when they don't understand how numbers work. As far as I can tell, the problem here wasn't that the class exists, but that EmiAvenged was incorrectly assigned to it, likely due to prior coursework not being recognized.

"“If you come from poverty, you were surrounded by people who are constantly in need. They will expect your help. So do keep your private business to yourself”

This right here is just perfect. I too come from a family of poverty, but I am off on my own now and would say I am much better financially compared to the rest of my family and it sounds a bit selfish but I avoid telling my family how much money I have at all cost because they always ask being “curious” and seeing if I need help when in reality it’s the other way around them needing help. I have helped before (mistake) because they don’t understand that the help is suppose to be like a one time thing not all the time."

"The Breakfast Club and Red Dawn (original) are such products of their era that I honestly found them difficult to watch.

I lost interest in Red Dawn almost immediately, and started doing other stuff while I kept it on in the background. I finally switched it off around the time of ""AVENGE ME, SON!"" because the whole thing was so unashamedly riddled with Cold War propaganda and complete nonsense that I couldn't take it seriously.

The Breakfast Club deserves credit for everything it gets right, and in no way am I suggesting that it's on the same level as Red Dawn, but all those good bits are pieced together with some really dodgy stuff. Half the time the film doesn't seem to know whether it's an insightful drama about a bunch of teenage misfits, or a just a shit music video.

"My younger brother and I were playing on the snow hill behind our house. There were some tunnels dug in the hill that we were crawling through. Two older boys showed up and told us to get lost. We refused. Then, while my brother was crawling through a tunnel, one of the kids shoved his shovel through the tunnel roof, missing my little brother's head by just an inch or two. 

My poor brother, who was only 6 or 7 at the time got really scared. I got really angry. (I was only 10 or 11 while the other kids were a couple of years older.) I started yelling at them that they had almost hit him I. The head with a shovel. They thought it was funny. They then started pelting us with chuncks of snow. I picked up what I thought was a large block of snow and chucked it at one boy and nailed him square in the side of the head. Turned out that the majority of what I'd thrown was solid ice and it knocked him clean off his feet. After a little while he got up, rather shakily and he and his friend ran off. 

My little brother was cheering like we'd just won a battle. I felt like a hero."

"Imagine that you’ve been away from home on a really long work trip. You’ve been spending days in hotel rooms with no air conditioning and no working ice machines within a mile, living off convenience food and whatever you can grab from a run-down diner where you’re sure the locals are spiking your food. You miss your wife and kids and the dog and calling home just doesn’t fill the growing emptiness inside you as you realise that you’ll eventually die alone when your wife leaves because you’re on the road so often that you’ve not had a conversation in months that doesn’t revolve around housework. 

Then your trip ends and you’re heading home. You know that you’ve got a stack of bills waiting for you and you’ve got that appointment in a few days to check your cholesterol that you’re growing worried about and you need to fix the pipes that are slowly leaking under the sink, but the closer you get, the more you can feel the weight lifting from your shoulders because *you’ll be home soon*, and you can crack open a beer and sit in the yard and watch the sun go down while throwing a ball for the dog and everything will be right in the world. 

You realise, slowly, that you’ve become addicted to the sense of euphoria that arises from finally getting to taste the home comforts you’ve missed for so long.  You mention this one day in passing to a colleague, who simply replies, “Yeah, I always like coming home, too”

That familiar sense of relief in the face of the world being awful is what it is like to bite into a Gregg’s sausage roll.  But to some people it’s just a quick food mart which is kinda nice.  One isn’t lesser than the other; they’re just differing perspectives and experiences of the same thing.

"I was at work in a restaurant when a server was stacking glasses above her head.  The glasses were hot, as they were fresh out of the dish machine.  She dropped one as she was putting it up on the shelf and went to catch it. Before she could, it hit the metal table and shattered.  The bottom of the glass was essentially a giant razor shard that sliced her forearm open to her wrist, and cut across her wrist. 

The spray of blood hit the ten foot ceiling. 

I ran to her and held her arm above her head and used my hand as a tourniquet on her elbow.  The owner of the he restaurant grabbed some towels and applied pressure to her wrist.  I called 911 while holding her arm and had another staff member bring a chair for her to sit in.  

We waited with her until EMS showed up and began their care.   She was taken to the hospital and had to have a 4 hour surgery to reattach and repair the tendons and damage done by the cut.  It took her two years to gain full use of her hand again. 

The doctors said that the owners and my actions of getting the blood stopped (as much as we could) probably helped save her life, as she had hit an artery.

Even back then, a shitty teenage edgelord, I got really uncomfortable when a lot of the comments were talking about how they wanna harm, abuse and even kill children. 

To this day I still feel uncomfortable around kids due to misophonia, Autism and pedophobia in general. I do not like kids at all and am sure that I will never have my own kid (at least by will).

When my Grandfather passed away, my lousy piece of shit Father banned me from his funeral. It was a really rough time, and I had a really hard time expressing myself, and in fact I never really even had a good cry about it- I was just numb. One day, a few months later, I was at work and and this old couple came through my line. As I was ringing their groceries I heard the two of them talking to each other. The old man sounded just like my Grandfather. Gran had a unique accent, he was from Southern Mississippi, and his voice was deep and kind of gravelly. This mans voice sounded so much like his that I just stood there with tears rolling down my face. His wife gasped and reached across the counter, she grabbed my hand and asked me what was the matter, if there was something I needed. Of course, I blubbered my way through and explanation, apologizing profusely, when this man, this ABSOLUTE stranger, stepped behind my register and gave me the warmest hug I’ve ever gotten. He talked to me in his soothing voice and told me that everything was going to be ok. I finally managed to get myself under control and finished checking them out. And, I honestly felt a lot better. I also felt like a blubbering-asshole, but what can you do? I never saw them in the store again, but, I’ve always been so thankful for that moment of human kindness."

"I collect Studio Ghibli films, which I know isn't all that special, but there's one DVD I'm proud to own.

You see, when Disney bought Studio Ghibli, Disney re-released the movie My Neighbor Totoro with their own English voice actors. I had been watching that movie since I was a little kid, and I had come know the *original* English voice actors. The movie was really hard to watch with Disney's actors. So I scoured the internet for a copy of the movie with the original actors from when Fox released the movie. And I needed it to be a DVD, because I don't have a VHS player. Turns out that that was going to be way harder than I thought. I eventually found an unopened copy on ebay, but to outbid all of the others I had to end up paying $210 for the DVD. I just thanked my lucky starts that I had a well-paying full time job to allow me to make such a purchase. "

"I study PPE at Mansfield College, Oxford, which luckily has the highest state school admission rate of any OxBridge college (and some top Russell Group unis), so for the most part I don't feel too much out of my depth class-wise. I also get a grant from the college, which is nice.

That being said, my accent stands out (south-east of England, basically a watered-down Essex accent) and my excessive swearing and smoking is definitely a minority. It's a big culture shock wearing tuxedo's to formal events, as well as to my exams. 

I got in through hard work. For the most part, the national tests (GCSE and Alevel) are accessible to everyone as long as you work hard. The difference is the admissions test and interview, which most people will have no experience with unless they go to a private school. Honestly I got lucky with these, as many successful applicants are tutored, which I can't afford. 

Overall, I enjoy it and relatively fit in, although the number of people claiming to be working class when they're middle class is infuriating. Most people are semi down to earth, unfortunately with the exception of my fellow PPEists, but I knew what I was getting in to.

"When I was 18, I went to a friend's house for a Halloween party. Some of them were drinking. I was not; mainly because I didn't drink at the time but also because I had a horrible cold and felt like shit. (As an adult I would've stayed home, but in high school... I didn't get to hang out with friends that often. So I went.)

My drink got spiked. The hostess' boyfriend admitted to doing it years later, but wouldn't say if it was alcohol or roofies. After I started acting funny, he said it would be funny if his girlfriend and I changed shirts when we were outside. So we did. Some of the other guys then complained that the asshole got to see my boobs, so I flashed the three of them properly.

I freaked out right after that, ran to my car. and drove home (One of my actual friends at the party tried to catch me and help me but I was too fast; he drove behind me the whole way instead.) Nearly broke up with my boyfriend. I didn't go to another party in high school. I moved out of town, went to college, got a job, came to visit one weekend and a friend invited me to dinner at a bar.

I walk in, and a drunk kid shouts, effectively to the whole bar, ""Kaci! I haven't seen you in years. Yours are still the best tits I've ever seen!"" One of the kids that got properly flashed clearly hasn't forgotten. And the friend I went with hadn't either- and he wasn't even AT the party in high school.

"Here's one I posted a year ago: 


There was a super smart girl with a rich lawyer for a father. She attended a great high school. It was super competitive. She was in the running for valedictorian. She had articles in the local paper. Was offered a full ride from Harvard. Who could want more?

Her, apparently. She (at least how the media spun it) wanted to cement her position as Valedictorian, so she had her rich lawyer dad pull some strings to get her classified with a disability to get her out of gym class (only worth 3 credits) with the extra free time she had because she didn't take gym, she picked up an extra AP class (worth 5 credits). The other girl in the running for valedictorian didn't have a disability, so she had to take gym, so she didn't have the opportunity to pick up the other AP class. Since they both had straight A's when it came time to pick valedictorian, the ""disabled"" girl was technically ahead because of the 2 extra credits.

The principal, among many others, didn't think it was fair to the other girl. Principal decided the two would be co-valedictorians. Girl had a fit. Rich lawyer dad sued. School backed down and gave rich girl her title. During her valedictorian speech, the entire assembly stood up and turned their backs on her. That made the news. In the shit storm that ensued, it was found that some of the articles the girl wrote for the local paper (remember those from the first paragraph? Pay attention!) were straight-up plagiarized. I don't 100% recall the details, but I think they ended up finding some academic dishonesty in some of her school work as well. Word got out to Harvard who cancelled her scholarship and her acceptance.

TL;DR: Rich girl could have had everything if she just shared the spotlight. Got greedy, got caught, got her shit ruined.

Special note: last time I posted this story i got a reply from someone claiming to be in the same class as the girl mentioned. They said everyone no one showed up to the graduation ceremony because no one liked the girl.

The motive for the Vegas Shooting
"That one's a little overexaggerated.

Iran was under rule by assassination.  Mossadegh comes into power after an assassination promising that everyone will become millionaires.  The british discovered oil in Iran, the british built the infrastructure to pump the oil.  The british built the largest, most expensive oil refinery in the world.

Mossadegh said, ""hey, let's take this shit.""

Now as good a plan as that sounds, two problems arose.  Nobody in Iran knew how to run any of it.  But they had a solution to that.  Nobody in the world would work with Iran out of solidarity, except italian scalps.  The italians didn't have any foreign oil concerns to protect so they had no interest in solidarity with the rest of the oil industry.

But this didn't solve the other problem and it created a new problem.  How to get the italian scalps to iran, and how to get the oil out of iran.

Well, you ship it by water.

So what's the problem?  The british military.  Remember?  Those people you stole the biggest most expensive refinery in the world from?  The one they paid for?  The one you stole?  They have a navy.  A navy that can stop you from exporting oil from the refinery you stole from them.

Presumably mossadegh was banking on the US breaking the UK navy embargo.

The US didn't.

So suddenly mossadegh went from the guy who promised to make everyone billionaires to the guy who basically destroyed the entire country in the most predictable way possible.

This went on for about two years.

What happened with Mossadegh, the thomas jefferson of the middle east, is a lot like what's happened recently in Egypt.  Mossadegh, the thomas jefferson of the middle east was given iirc a year of emergency dictatorial power.

But after a year or two Iran was still in an economic crisis caused by Mossadegh.

Mossadegh had lost all support.  He lost the support of the Ayatollahs, including some nobody named ayatollah kohmeini, because it turned out Mossadegh was secular.  He lost the support of the Marxist Tudeh party because he wasn't a marxist and didn't support them in any way.  Mossadegh lost the support of the royalists, obviously, he lost the support of the bazaar, and he lost the support of his own pro-business party, and even lost the support of his own heir apparent who was actually there on the day they stole the biggest most expensive refinery in the world celebrating right next to Mossadegh.  And of course Mossadegh's party was losing parliament.

Side note, followers of the ayatollah kohmeini had assassinated mossadegh's predecessor.

So what does the Thomas Jefferson of the Middle East do faced with a lame duck Parliament that's about to turn against him?  Have the lame duck parliament vote to give him, the thomas jefferson of the middle east permanent dictatorial power, making him emperor for life Thomas Jefferson, and then he dismissed parliament.

The shah, then, exercising his constitutional authority, then dismisses Mossadegh.

Former Dictator Thomas Jefferson, now citizen Mossadegh then performs a coup d'etat.  Captures the head of the Shahs guards, and the Shah flees the country.

But, the thing is, nobody supports Mossadegh.  Nobody except, the military, because the Thomas Jefferson of the middle east replaced all the officers in the military with his personal allies in his path to become military dictator thomas jefferson.

Now enters the villain of our story.

The foreign devils the CIA.

First, the foreign devils of the CIA start a protest by the marxist tudeh party.

And here's the evil thing the foreign devils of the CIA did...  They started a fake marxist tudeh protest...  that honest members of the marxist tudeh party quickly joined, because they were basically mossadeghs jilted spouse.

Then there's the other dastardly thing the foreign devils of the CIA did.  They started another protest.  This one against Mossadegh and his former Tudeh supporters.

So the foreign devils of the CIA had basically sent two tweets saying ""fuck this Mossadegh dude"" but two real groups of Iranians who were genuinely angry with Mossadegh started protesting.

The military didn't quash the protests, and Mossadegh fled to his house, where he eventually was surrounded, where he then surrendered, and was then placed under house arrest.

And that's the story about how the evil foreign devils of the CIA started a coup that deposed the Thomas Jefferson of the Middle East for cheap oil.

Eventually the 60/40 pro british split of the profits from the oil were negotiated down to 50/50, which iirc is roughly what the former (assassinated) prime minister had negotiated."

I heard them muttering ""did he just quit?"" As I was walking out. 
Some of my crew members chose that moment to walk out, too. 
After that, the regional manager still begged me to come back, even if it was to work for one of her other stores. But I wasn't having that. "

"The funny thing is that sometime during one of the seasons right after season 20, that there was brief talk that Holidays of Future Passed was written in a way where it could've been a series finale. Not surprisingly, the producers didn't end the show after that episode (sigh). 

Though like you, I wish they'd ended the show with Behind the Laughter. Btw, the Simpsons trivia group I sometimes do trivia with, only does their trivia between seasons 1-11. Which is fine with me, since I finally lost interest sometime around season 15 or 16 I sometimes wish trivia would go to season 12-14 myself, since there are a few decent episodes after season 11 (i.e. Trilogy of Error, I Am Furious Yellow, Half Decent Proposal, etc)."

There was a spot that someone had stepped through the roof that had been patched incorrectly.  Two outlets had been wired incorrectly.  One of the windows had a minor crack where it meets the actual window frame portion.  A piece of the duct work for the air conditioning had come loose and needed reattaching.  All of the railing pieces on the deck had been split because they used too large of a nail with an air nailer.  There were other things but that is what I remember.

"That's pretty cool! You know in our lives we have a huge tree, and that tree grows leaves, and occasionally acorns. 

You know we have to appreciate those leaves, they're fun and can be helpful. But leaves are made to leave your life, and that's ok. Just don't hang on to them, because that will hurt you in the long run.

Now those acorns? They're something special. You want to hold on dearly to those, they'll help you grow a new tree and begin a new era in your life. 

Sometimes you get the acorn and leaf mixed up, it's tough and will hurt you if you do. But your tree is still growing and another acorn is just about ready to fall from the tree, and into your hand."

Her dad, who is a minister (pastor?), married them, while her sister, who is married to a minister, was her maid of honour. I was touched and humbled she asked me to be her only other bridesmaid!

They’ve been married 5 years, live in Montreal, are looking for a house, and are trying for a family. She’s great and we all absolutely love her. The same goes for her family - we think they kinda adore my bro too :)

"To all of the people who believe in cultural appropriation: are you fucking okay? What makes you feel like it's your place to tell people what they can and cannot take part in because of their skin color? It's ironically racist of you to assume that someone isn't part of a specific culture because of their appearance, and to tell them that they have no right to celebrate another culture. Are you really THAT close minded that you would enforce the idea that unless you are from a culture, you cannot celebrate what it has to offer? When people wear clothing inspired by a certain culture, they are celebrating and expressing their appreciation for that culture. You pushing your narrow-minded ideals are what is forcing the racial tension to widen.  I have so many mixed friends who have had such a hard time being able to embrace their culture because of people like you. News flash, you're not ""woke"", you are part of the problem."

The reason is, like someone else already said in this comment section, because the man of the house would typically be the one to decide the religion of the kids at the time the Prophet Muhammad was around I'm pretty sure. So the kids had to be Muslim, and the man couldn't teach his kids the religion of he himself wasn't Muslim. "

"When Yugoslavia fell and the civil war kicked off I was with my dad in town buying groceries. The crowds outside basically went berserk and started tearing the city apart. 

We went from a normal family in an industrialized country who went on vacations to the Adriatic every year, watched tv and just lived life to cowering in the basement for 4 years as shells and rockets demolished our suburb and all vital services ceased to exist. My mom was a chemist and my dad designed short range rockets. We lived in a communal housing block. 

We started starving slowly when it became too dangerous for the UN to distribute food parcels. I was a 7 year old stick figure in 1993. Most meals would consist of watered down milk or outright water with bread mixed in and some sugar. Sometimes boiled corn cobs.

We would have a couple hours of electricity per day, and when fighting died down for a couple days in the week or month I'd go to my room and watch worn out tapes of the classic 80's Ninja Turtles and Transformers. I must have seen some of those episodes 500 times by now."

"My cousin thought that ""Pedestrians always have the right of way"" was totally binding. As a result, he thought it was wise and prudent to hide behind a construction sign and then pop out into freeway speed traffic to collect that sweet, sweet settlement money. He broke his leg and ankle and got pretty thrashed when he got hit by a car. Solid idea #2 was to drag himself away as quickly as possible so that he could claim that the driver executed a ""hit and run"" and that they failed to assist an injured person. Instead he just got jammed with lots of hospital bills and ruined some poor lady's day.

Later, working under the assumption that he had been profiled and discriminated against instead of having misunderstood laws, he rode his bike into oncoming traffic and got crunched again. This time he didn't break anything - but his bike got pretzeled.  He also got a ticket for breaking some kind of law. He got ambulanced to a hospital where he jumped out of the back and ran upon arrival. He stole a wheelchair and returned to his home - a broken down van in the wal-mart parking lot. He then used the wheelchair to garner sympathy as a panhandler on the corner nearest his home. 

He is why insurance is expensive. He is why healthcare is expensive. He is why people profile the poor. But in his mind he's always the victim. It's tragic."

"I worked at a family owned winery/brewery for 2 years and I absolutely hated it. After 2 years of working, they finally gave me a raise of $0.25 an hour, bringing my pay to minimum wage. This was after an entire year of waiting for my first annual evaluation that they promised me every week for the entire year. They ran out of money because their family drank half of the alcohol after closing every saturday, so they fired half their staff to break even. I still visit sometimes and watch them do so much more work than necessary just because I like the pretzels. Terrible place with terrible management."
"Worked at a pizza chain in my college town as a delivery driver. There was a manager with a total aggro complex, and he thought it was the biggest deal in the world that he was a manager. He would always foist his responsibilities off on the workers, for things we hadn't been trained to do: drivers doing makeline, in-store employees being forced to do deliveries, etc. He also LOVED to berate and shame people,

I had been working there about four months, and I admittedly loved this job. It was summer, I only had one semester left, and I loved making deliveries and coming home with big cash tips. I was always happy to take other people's shifts, too. The GM had even praised me in front of the team once because I had a ""sunny disposition"" when I answered phones, so I felt like I was doing a good job. 

One week, I got a nasty stomach virus. I could barely hold the phone when I called the manager and told him that I couldn't make my shift that day and probably the next. I get hit with stomach viruses really hard and I knew I wouldn't be able to function for at least 36 hours, and I definitely did not want to be around food. He said no problem, feel better soon, ""I will get someone to cover your shifts."" He specifically said he would take care of it.

The next day I get FOUR calls from him, ringing then hanging up, ringing then hanging up. I answer a call when it finally rings more than once and he loses it, screaming at me that no one covered my shift and I ""am not allowed to take a vacation day"" whenever I felt like it. I tell him, I told you yesterday I'm sick, I'm throwing up, I can't stop hugging the toilet. He says he doesn't care and that if I don't show up in the next twenty minutes, I'm fired, and he wants a doctor's note. A doctor's visit for a fucking stomach virus? That was the last straw. I had my then-boyfriend drive me over to the store. I wobbled in, went to the office, threw up in the waste bin, and quit on the spot. When I showed up two weeks later to collect my final check, he ran into the freezer to hide from me. It felt good to see him scurry like the rat fucker he is."

"Lets all face it, the prequels were sub par at best. Lousy acting, overabundance of CGI, and just some down right cheesey moments. But you got to give them some credit for how massive a world they made. The CIS, the planets, the villians, there were some solid original concepts in every scene of those movies. The new Star Wars are just rehash after rehash of old worn out ideas, characters, and designs. And even the spin offs are directly tied into using the characters and scenarios from the OT. Theres nothing new that has stood out. No new cool aliens or machines or star fighters, just slightly touched up varients. Just lazy"

Taken to the the hospital, the student is curled up in the fetal position with agony, when the doctor asks “How are you doing?” The students feebly gasps, “I’m fine, thank you. And you?”"

" 1. GDP growth is improving but it's nowhere near 5%

 2. Unemployment in general is the lowest in history. It's a trend that's carried over from the Obama administration. Trump gets credit, but certainly not complete credit.

 5. Directly? Not much. Income tax wasn't actually decreased, it was just restructured. The child tax credit certainly helps and some other deductions, but it amounts to maybe each family that actually benefits from it getting a 1000 extra a year. If any financial benefits come out of the tax reform, it will be a possible slightly faster economic growth which in turn will hopefully increase wage growth. On the other hand, an increase in the national debt due to these tax cuts poses a serious threat to the economy.

 6. It was doing great. Then Trump started doing this trade war bullshit and now he's sidelined the rally and made the market incredibly volatile. This one in particular pisses me off because I trade.

 7. I'll give him this one. It isn't in the end zone yet, but Trump deserves some major credit. Meeting with the leader of North Korea is an incredible historical accomplishment.

 8. Kind of goes under 5.

 9. Not yet. Trump is complaining, and tbh they should pay more, but it hasn't happened yet.

 10. I'm gonna need a source on that. Not that I don't believe you, just that I haven't heard of it.

 11. Like 90% of his executive orders have been unconstitutional. Maybe 100% because executive orders themselves are arguably unconstitutional.

 12. It wasn't being infringed upon before. Attacked yes, but no laws were put in place that actually did anything.

 13. I'll give him this too.

 14. Not if he keeps up this trade war bullshit.

 15. Consumer confidence means nothing. Consumer confidence was at a high before the 2008 crash, the dot com bubble, and the Great Depression.

 16. Source.

Trump has done some things right, I'm not going to deny that. I don't have a burning hate of Trump like some people do. But he is not the ""best president in modern history"""

Next level unlocked. 
"Of course Neo is the One. The only One-like abilities Smith ever shows are those he got from Neo when some part of him imprinted on Smith, or from the Oracle when he infected her since she was part of the development of the Matrix. Your theory basically says that Smith is like the One, which he's meant to be, but that doesn't make him the One or make Neo not the One.

First, Morpheus' line about the One being able to ""change whatever he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us."" refers to the One before Neo, so Neo isn't obligated to show those powers (even though he does), especially since he's repeatedly shown to be different to his predecessors. Smith only rewrites the Matrix after taking over the Oracle so there's not even proof he could do it before gaining her power.

Second, Neo breaks plenty of rules with his bullet-stopping and flying and bringing Trinity back to life. This is defined by Morpheus in the sparring program, who uses gravity as an example of a rule and differentiates between bending rules (super jumps) and breaking them (flying). Also, Neo doesn't have any incentive to massively overhaul the Matrix even if he could, since it'd draw the attention of the agents who continue to be a threat to his allies.

Third, Smith is definitely the opposite of the One. He's the many. His main power is shown to be infecting others like a virus and multiplying. The One has a lot of roles, including speaking to the Architect, having an affinity for humanity, and being part of the reseeding for Zion and the next iteration of the Matrix. Smith does none of those things.

Finally, Smith calling the Oracle ""Mom"" isn't relevant to One status at all. It's just referring to her being a founding contributor to that version of the Matrix, which Smith was then created in. The Architect actually tells us this using a father/mother analogy. He's making a dig at her being responsible for the bad things he's doing and nothing more."

On a long term trend, the stock market has reached record highs during pretty much every presidency.  That's not unique to this president.

What is somewhat more unique is looking at a trend.  The DIJA, for example, peaked at about 26.6k at the beginning of this year and has been dropping.stagnant since It's at 25k right now).

So the stock market hit a record high shortly after Obama's economic policies ended towards the end of 2017, and has been pretty dismal ever since.

"It actually isn't, and if you find proof it is (talking about Christianity) your role is to be a person of love. If someone is committing a sin by being gay, you need to realise, as a good Christian, that you DO NOT HAVE RIGHT to judge, nor to forgive. Only God can do that, according to your own religion. Your duty is to respect life and creation. You don't have the right to hate sinners or anyone, according to your own Christianity. That overrides everything. You have no right to judge as a Christian and as a human too. And that is what I hate about people I share religion with... Nobody has right to gospel others because he feels better. Your own religious beliefs tells that we're all sinful and also equal. 
On the human side of things, for atheists and non Christians: When you come to have anxiety toward gay person, if that is NOT because he did you wrong or because he is violently trying to make you look bad just because you are heterosexual when you don't deny his right to be a fucking coffee pot or a chandelier or gay, just remember - if you are anxious to that person just because he or she is gay, those are humans with loving friends, families, partners, and emotions. Human beings. If you consider them broken for being gay, following that logic -  shouldn't you be more caring to them, as you would to someone autistic, or without legs. HATE DEFIES IT SELF! Hate is always an useless thing. Fuck hate. I am saying for decades now that human species need to learn just one thing to make life better: DIVERSITY! We wage wars among monotheistic religions over how is the name of God and the shape of the roof of temple devoted to him. We hate people for sticking dick to an ass willing to be dicked, or for not wanting to have anything to do with a dick. Seriously? Religion is not bad of you use it to learn from wisdom in it's tales. Can make one a better person. Accepting people without caring what do they fuck, as long as it is alive and not an animal and not a child, also makes you better."

"I'm not an Incel but if I was one I wouldn't want a prostitute (I am female so that might bias my answer). 

But I think there are more things you can get from sex than just the physical aspect of it. Some incels might only want to have sex with a partner because of the emotional connection and not just for the physical. There is also the joy of flirting, dating, and seducing process that is missing from just going to a prostitute. There is no art to it. They may want a woman to seduce and not merely a woman to sleep with.

They might also be concerned with STDs or developing unrequited feelings for the prostitute. Prostitutes also cannot realistically be the mother of their children.


I realize some of these answers don't apply to the stereotypical ""incel"" ( the ones who are extremely sexist) but mainly apply to incels who simply have trouble with social skills and want to be loved.

TL;DR They want more than ""just sex"". They want the entire sexual experience."

Then one day she was out with me and my dad, and every time my dad slammed on the brakes he’d shout ‘FUCKERS’. Yep. I don’t have to worry about him not being my real dad. "

If you go into a relationship thinking, 'Oh, he'd be so great if only...' or 'She'd be practically perfect if she'd just...', then you're probably going to end up disappointed and your partner is likely to resent you.

"It was the Friday before the week-long Mardi Gras break. A 12-year-old girl is picked up from school early that day because her family and friends were heading for a trip to Washington DC and NY. She's been hyped about it for a long time. 

However, that morning, everybody was still in a rush to pack, and unfortunately, the girl's mother forgot to pack her beloved stuffed bunny. When the girl found out, she was furious. She threw a tantrum. She begged her dad to drive home to pick up the bunny, but unfortunately, he can't. The traffic was super heavy, and they still have another person to pick up besides catching a flight. The girl screamed and cried all the way because her beloved bunny wasn't going to be with her. 

That girl was me. 

Looking back, I sincerely regret my behavior on that day. I did enjoy the trip to DC and NY, but it was really idiotic and selfish of me to act out on the day we left and give everyone a fucking headache. My parents and other adults took trouble to take time off work, buy flight tickets, book hotels, and rent a car for the trip. And I had to throw a tantrum just because my stuffed bunny wasn't going to be with me for the next 4-5 nights. "

"Some Americans love to drive on the left lane and wont move when there's a car behind them. 
When I drive almost everywhere in the world, unless there's some heavy traffic, people stick to the right lane (or left if you drive in the UK, Japan, Australia etc) and use the left lanes to pass. that allows people who want to drive faster to do so. if someone forgets to move back from the left lane and you find yourself behind them, you simply flash your high beams and they move back to the right lane, allowing you to pass.

It doesn't work quite the same way in America. Here people usually pick whatever lane they feel like and stay there, even if their speed is exactly the same as the car next to them. if you get stuck behind cars like that and you want to pass - good luck to you. if you flash your high beams, the blocking driver will probably get offended that you're trying to move them out of ""Their lane"" and won't let you pass, Even if they're on their phone and they notice you.

There's a pub in Glasgow (and Edinburgh) called [Lebowski's](http://www.lebowskis.co.uk/). Their entire cocktail menu is just different takes on a white russian. The best one is The Donny. You just replace the vodka with Disaronno. So good.

"The dating game.

Women just hold so much more power. Unless you're an insanely attractive guy, you *really* have to put yourself out there and fail a bunch before you succeed.

Even dating apps are completely different for men and women. My current roommate is female, and it's been interesting comparing our Tinder experiences. I'll send out messages to a bunch of different girls and *maybe* get a few replies that *maybe* one of which turns into an actual date. She logs in and literally has dozens of messages from guys that are down to meet with her at a moments notice. So she just picks one or two she likes and ghosts the rest. Because there will be a whole new crop of guys in a day or two. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with what she's doing. Just that I can't imagine getting on Tinder and having a bunch of women asking me when we can meet up. It sounds pretty awesome though."

"When I was about five, my dad was on the phone with a potential client. I kept bothering him and being annoying to the point of the client saying, “Forget it.” Dad became furious and was about to give me a spanking when there was a knock on the door leading to the garage. Dad opened the door, no one there. There is no door leading from the garage to the outside and garage door is closed. 

My dad turned back to give me a whoopin’ and there was another knock. I remember like it was yesterday my dad opening the door and yelling, “Grandpa, I’m trying to discipline my child here!” He died a few years before and I’m nearly positive has just been following me around ever since. "

"Hey, not for nothing, but we're all pretty much faking it. We all fear rejection and feel inadequate. Even the beautiful people and famous people. Why do you think celebrities generally work out so much, put on makeup, hire PR firms, etc.? It's not fun. They're terrified that they'll become old news and stop landing roles and getting to hang out at swanky parties. Those kids that get 4.0 gpa in school and participate in lots of extra curricular activities? They're terrified of failure and stress themselves out over not doing everything perfectly. It's a better problem to have than others, sure. However, the truth is still there that everyone is faking their way through life in academic pursuits, career, love, and so on.

Accept that, then realize that you can fake it too. People will buy it once you get better at it, then people will think you have confidence, even though you're faking it. Why? Because they're faking it, too."

"Someone who is frugal will spend money ungrudgingly, but choose the cheaper option. They spend altruistically, but cautiously. Someone who is frugal will live moderately, and their penny pinching won't negatively affect someone. They are willing to buy new things if the older version of what they are replacing is functionally useless. Someone who is frugal does not pride themselves on their meagerness. They are often saving money for a reason (i.e. they have not much to spend, they are saving for unavoidable home improvements, etc).


Whereas someone who is a cheapskate will spend money begrudgingly, and always choose the cheapest option. When they spend it's often hedonistically, and over-cautiously. Someone who is a cheapskate will live within the bare necessities of life, and their penny pinching negatively affects others. They are never willing to replace anything, if it bares some resemblance to its original self, then it's not only good, but good enough despite being functionally useless. A cheapskate prides themselves on their meagerness. They are not saving money for a reason, other than to say they are saving money.

"Oh my god I was coming here to comment that. Apple has some good products and I respect their contribution to the history of technology, but the cult following that some people have for Apple is ridiculous.

If you ever make a critique about any of Apple's design choices or comment on the fact that some of their products are overpriced as shit you will always hear the same ""buzzphrase"": ""you are paying for the Apple Experience"".

Heck, I know someone that always spends 4 months of salary to buy the new iPhone on release, and the only things she does with it are texting and Facebook. When asked about it she always says ""I NEED to have the new Apple products on release"". Of course people can spend their money in what they want but damn this sounds like a brainwashed person.

It’s usually not the head we are worried about. We do a full neuro exam as well.

Blood boils immediately . Don’t get me started on people who don’t eat the claws because they’re too lazy but try to cover by saying “I don’t really like claw meat”. Again, all I see is “you peasants can take the extra time/work to eat my claws. I’m on to find another big crab”. 🤬"

"The problem with Monopoly specifically is that it's not really a strategic game. The payoffs are so lopsided and you're only working off 2 resources that it's reasonably easy to determine what the optimal strategy is, at which point it's just a 2 hour coin flip. Settlers of Catan is a fantastic example of how to do die rolls in strategy correctly. While the extreme ends of variance can screw people over, most of the time it allows players to adapt to the situation and allows for more depth to strategy because it is interestly unsolvable."

Ever since then we have bonded like crazy, and this by far is the best relationship either has ever had.  And that trust has also worked its way in to the bedroom as well.  That too has worked out to being the best sex we have ever had, and we are in our 40s.

"People have body hair. Porn conditions us to not expect it, but those girls spend a lot of time and money on hair mitigation. My advice: get used to body hair, it's gonna come up eventually.

We all got it, it's part of the person you're slobbering all over, so just accept it.

Alternatively, ask your partner to work with you on grooming. This may end a casual relationship as it negates the ""no strings"" part of the arrangement. It also opens your grooming to discussion, so if you aren't willing to also modify grooming habits it could introduce contention into the relationship."

Something about Gatti traveling to South America to apologize to the UConn student union manager seems weird as hell to me. I can’t help but feel like the UConn employee did not want Gatti to visit him in South America. I think Gatti just got a vacation out of it.

""But he has paid a big price,"" Farley continued. ""And the court does believe that will serve as a deterrent to future offenses. I would say it's fair to assume that any future brushes with the law Mr. Gatti has will bring more unwanted publicity to him.""
It’s bizarre how the judge is going easy on Gatti for assault and battery. It feels like this lack of punishment and discipline may be a contributing factor to Gatti’s poor behavior. Of course there is also drug abuse involved in Gatti’s case. It feels as though the alcohol is taking responsibility here."

"From the way that one guy threw his arms up like “I’m not touching him! I’m not touching him!” they were probably all afraid the a-hole would try to claim that he was man-handled; therefore he is in the right and everyone else is in the wrong.

"Off topic a bit but I prefer the bullying stories where the bully meets swift karma.  

Greg was a bully in my Jr High.  Big kid, shot up early, reasonably bad home life by all indications.  Loved to pick on the nerds.  Had a posse of followers who reveled in his dominance over the nerd-class.  

After lunch, outdoor recess cancelled due to rain, 100 or so kids in a gym with basketballs etc.  Greg got into his act.  Can't remember the kid he kept pushing.  Kid told him to stop.  Greg pushed again.  Told him to stop again...Greg went to push again and I will never forget the sound of the kid's fist on Greg's jaw and Greg's melon bouncing off the gym floor.  One punch, out cold.

There was dead silence.  

Two things happened that day.  1) no one picked on that kid ever again. 

2)  Greg was never a bully to anyone ever again that I ever saw in the remaining 5 yrs we were in the same school.  

Lesson folks....stand up for yourself.  You might lose, but you'll gain self respect and the respect of your peers.  Should you knock King Kong on his ass...he never gets back up to the top of the heap.  It's a shot worth taking.  Don't allow yourself to become the victim.  What's the worst that happens?

The worker has to clean down the tables, sweep the floors, as well as do a million other tasks.

"Ghosting is when a person goes ghost. 

They disappear on you. They may not leave town, but without any apparent warning they just leave out your life. 

They don't even say why. They just dip. Clearly it means something, but they never tell you why. 

It's just suddenly they're not responding to your text messages, you don't see them at the gym anymore, they're just not there anymore. 

They more or less ignore you. But ignoring someone is a bit different than ghosting. Mainly because people can only really ghost you if your contact with them is limited. A coworker can't really ghost you. They're at your job. 

But someone you met at a bar who's number you did indeed get can ghost you. 

And ghosting is usually only possible by people you make a connection with. Not randoms. So things seem fine. You could be holding what you believe is a good conversation then out of nowhere they're gone."

Some also point out that the Pokémon immediately after Marowak by index in the game code is (one variety of) MissingNo., and that 'M evolves into Kangaskhan, suggesting that pehaps these particular glitches were created when moving data around to break up the evolutionary line. However, it is worth nothing that the [index order](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pokémon_by_index_number_%27Generation_I%28) is kind of a jumble, anyway; it goes Rhydon (the first Pokémon to be designed), Kangaskhan (a similar design), Nidoran♂, Clefairy, Spearow, Voltorb, Nidoking, Slowbro… Indeed, while a few (and I do mean *few*) evolutions are grouped together, Cubone and Marowak are not."

"Actually, enteric coated tabs do nothing to prevent stomach ulcers. The mechanism by which ibuprofen causes is stomach ulcers is through its action as a COX inhibitor, which inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, one subtype of which is the hormone involved in creating the mucosal lining of your stomach. This is an unavoidable side-effect and takes place after the drug is absorbed and distributed through the bloodstream. Many people are under the assumption that ibuprofen's effect on the mucosal stomach lining is through a direct physical action while the drug is within the lumen of the stomach -- when in actuality it is hormonal and occurs *after* drug absorption."

"It's like how lotteries are usually a poor tax. What rich person is buying up tons of lottery tickets? They're investing and making more money. The buyers of lottery tickets are predominantly poor and usually are state run.

Apparently dick size is directly correlated to not buying lottery tickets if you look at these responses. The point still stands, regardless of if smart people buy lottery tickets (they still do) the fact remains that poor people buy way more lottery tickets than the wealthy. Just because you can choose not to doesn't mean it isn't exploitative. You can choose not to get involved in a pyramid scheme doesn't mean the US didn't have to make it illegal. 

Often the lottery profits are used for state funding and you know what they often do with that extra income? It's the U.S. government what do you think happens. The businesses and wealthy get tax breaks to ""encourage business growth in the state."""

Don't tailgate me once I pass. And I may have to turn around if I pass the location. Give me space! If I come up behind you at a blocked intersection (traffic in all lanes and a median), and randomly shut my lights/sirens off, I'm not done. I'm waiting for a lane to clear for me to turn my lights/sirens on again.

Just move over to the right if safe to do so. We are trained to stay in the left most lane when responding code 3. If you cannot move anywhere, I will find a way around you, but if have the space please move and stop once your in the right lane. I'm not trying to race you. I'm trying to pass you. Our last resort is to pass on the right because all of the other drivers are trained to move to the right. If you side swipe us. We are at fault for passing on the right."

""I don't call out on you when they ask me to work lunch. And they pay me more than you.""
This went back and forth every five minutes for the next half hour before he eventually said that if I couldn't be more flexible, he wasn't going to need me. So I walked away from the oven, took off my apron, and threw it at his feet before walking out."

"I worked at Chuck E. Cheese's for 5 years. This is going to be a long comment.

I've seen a man smash a pregnant woman's face through a wall. He said she was on crack. For months after, we stacked booster seats in front of that wall to hide the hole.

I've seen entire families climb on top of tables and hurl chairs, pizza, wings, and cake at other families.

I've cleaned this [toliet](https://imgur.com/a/PhXeraB). I still don't know how someone did this with their ass.

They stopped serving alcohol a few months before I started working there. People brought their own instead. We also occasionally found weed and needles in the bathroom.

A little boy wandered behind me while I was standing at the cash register. It was super busy, so no one noticed him at first. Then I heard crying behind me, and heard him sob, ""I HAVE TO PEEEEEEEEEE!"" He pulled down his pants and pissed all over the floor directly next to me.

When I was in the suit (which is what we called the costume), a kid flying squirreled himself onto my back and would NOT get off. Visibility is very low in that thing. I ended up scraping him off on a table and running to the Chuck E. room.

Also in the suit once, a kid noticed that I had boobs, (the suit was sort of a fat suit but you could clock that the creature within was not a male) and kept grabbing and poking my boobs screaming ""CHUCK E HAS BOOBS!""

There was a shooting at a business that was nearby, and the news said that the shooter was still on the loose. We had to lock down the entire store. I was terrified. They found the guy had killed himself after killing his girlfriend (and at least one other woman) and had never left the original site of the shooting.

Now for my favorite insane story. I was working the prize counter. There was a raging sea of bodies filling the entire store. I hear screaming. These weren't the joyful screams of children. These were the terrified screams of adult women. I noticed people were pointing up... in the direction of the tubes. One of the tubes was clear but it wasn't clear anymore. It was filled with blood. There was a toddler inside scooping blood from his face and smearing it all over the inside of the tube. Like in a horror movie, hand print smears of blood. He was laughing. He had a nose bleed.

My GM was the best boss I ever had. He is now going through a mental health crisis and has attempted suicide. He was texting me and several other former workers beforehand. He is alive and getting help. I love him and I hope he is okay.

When my best friend died of a heroin overdose, another manager texted me all night, comforting me and telling me how the same thing happened to her in college and how she coped with it. She told me she would find someone to cover my shifts for the next week. I never told her how much her talking to me in that moment meant, and I never really got to. She died of a heart attack. When I went to her funeral, her family knew who I was.

Not everything was bad, though. I have some good memories.

I found this [racooon](https://imgur.com/a/WqI450Y) in the dumpster. I built it a staircase out of empty soda syrup boxes so it could get out.

If you've ever wondered what a pepperoni pizza looks like when you bake it in a pizza oven 6 times, it looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/60QHUGy).

I fell in love at Chuck E. Cheese's. I saw him for the first time while I was vacuuming at the end of the night. I was new at the time, and didn't know who he was, but he was so damn cute. Later that night, I was filling the salt and pepper shakers, and he came up to me and told me that I didn't need to do that because none of the managers would check if I had or not. I said thank you and filled them all anyway. We kissed for the first time in a McDonald's parking lot. We were together for 6 years. He is still my best friend, one of the most important people in my life, and has a beautiful son who he occasionally takes to Chuck E Cheese's.

I went on to work at a mental health and AODA treatment center. I now work at one of the largest non-profits in the country. The most pivotal moment of my life was deciding to work at Chuck E. Cheese's. I absolutely would not be the person I am now if I had not chosen that as my first job. I learned more about life and about myself working there than I would have had I done literally anything else.

I have more crazy stories, but I can't think of them all.  Five years is a long time. This was cathartic as hell. As all good Chuck E. employees say, I hope you have a magical day!"
"I lived near Lloydminster, Canada for awhile.  It's right on the border of two provinces with different time zones.  Also the city was split by the provincial border right down the main street so one half had an 18 drinking age, the other half 19.

So, almost every bar and liquor store was located on the side with the earlier time and the lower drinking age since they could stay open later and sell alcohol younger.  "
Bullseye. It was the episode they went on the moon and fry and leela ended on a space redneck farm.
Maybe. I think it’s more because people tend to believe warnings are meant for other people. The “I actually drive better drunk” type. 
From my understanding of the replication crisis: a seemingly good paper from a respected journal is also quite likely to be unreplicatable. At this point it seems like an individual published paper is weak evidence. 
"Look, I understand stress can make people act oddly. But giving thanks should be reflexive, and there was ample time after both flights where we were waiting for various things including paperwork to be filled out where not a single thanks was given.

That's more than a simple oversight. That's actively terrible service. 

Glad there are people like you around who would actually act like a human though, so thank you. "

"&gt;There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage."

"Me &amp; my gf were in England this year and a man approached us smelling pretty bad but also seemed like a nice person. He asked us for some change and I flat out told him no but i would buy him something to eat if he was hungry.   


He said yes, and since we were in front of a coffee shop i went over and bought him a sandwich. His friend was also over in the corner so i bought him one too. While waiting in line the guy behind the counter was shaking his head in shame and I should've taken note of that as a red flag because I got the impression he was there quite a lot of the time. But I didn't care and gave him and his friend food. He was very thankful and we thought that was the end of it.   


As we were walking away he came back and asked us for change anyway. I thought at this point ""but i just bought you a sandwich ""... 4 quid each too .."" but I wanted to be nice so I gave him some out of generosity.

As he walks away he drops the sandwich on the floor and I know he heard it hit the floor. I just look at him as he walks away and his friend comes over and takes it.

We both walk away and gf says im kind but im wondering if I actually did the right thing. "

"The gas pipeline construction industry has its own set of laws made specifically for it. The standard workweek is 6 ten-hour days. Depending on where in the country I was working (a typical job would last roughly three months, then I'd move on to wherever the company got a bid for more construction), I would usually be working 12-14ish-hour, 7-day weeks for about 10 months of the year. I eventually started doing payroll on some jobs instead of digging ditches from dark in the morning till dark at night. Some of the payroll jobs were not too bad; 7, 12-hour days. Every once in a while I'd even get a Sunday off. However, one job in Colorado saw me working an average of 7, 17-hour days per week. I often worked 20+ hours in a day over that four-month stretch, and a couple times worked 23 hours, laid my head on the desk for an hour, and then got back to work. I vowed I'd never do that much work again. The pay was pretty good for doing the payroll on that particular job, but not even nearly good enough for that much stressful toil. I went back to school and changed careers.

But, a tip for working with electricity. If you have to play around with high voltage, put one hand behind your back and don't touch anything with it. If you grab a live with with one hand, the current will flow down your arm, your side, leg, and to ground. And unless your are standing in a puddle, your shoes will prevent a direct path (although will still have capacitive coupling, so you will still get shocked). But if your other arm is grounded (touching pretty much anything, especially metal things) the current will flow through your chest, where your very electrically sensitive heart lives. This will cause a pretty severe case of the dead.

Also, if you see someone seized up on a live wire, which is caused by the electricity causing muscle contractions in the hand gripping the live wire, don't touch them. Find yourself a non conductive thing, like a bit of wood or a fiberglass tool handle, and bash them with it in such a way as to release their grip. If you don't have anything, try a kick or shove that will knock them over even if you also seize up (use momentum). If you try to grab them and pull them off, you will get shocked too."

"&gt; I feel that her religion has failed her.

Christianity has tried to have it's cake and eat it too on this issue.

Promoting virginity was not an issue when most people were married by 22.  I think the average is now 28 or so.  The reason for this delay is mostly higher education, a status symbol that America Christians chase more than any other group.  But the church in America has looked at these opposing goals and acted like there is no conflict.

So now, for 99% of parishes, when a teen is going to mass and events at church, the priest/pastor and his/her parents are doing everything they can to get them to have higher education.  At the same time, a chaste lifestyle is encouraged almost as strongly.  When this leads to inherent conflict, the church just responds ""Both!""

They have forgotten that they are dealing with humans.  Sinners.  There isn't ever going to be a society of *humans* that will make it to these 28 average marriage ages as college-educated virgins without some sort of pills or surgery en masse to suppress their sexuality.  So, in reality, the faithful Christians are split into two groups:

* Those who fail to keep their virginity, and then go through a process of shame and self-forgiveness.
* Those who keep their virginity, but develop bizarre sexual complications like an addiction to pornography and insanely skewed standards - **fyi according to the church's understanding of sin this is *worse* than losing your virginity but good luck ever hearing that from a pulpit**

Jesus said ""Marry if you lust.""  The church in America says ""Well...it would be really great if you could get a Master's degree.""  It is a textbook case of the plans of man super-ceding the laws of God, yet it has gone on for about 60 years now.

I have actually done a fair bit of study on this topic.  Modern Christians would be fascinated to see some newspaper clippings from past generations.  I have seen a column written by a priest in the 40s who encouraged teens to date around and go on as many first dates as possible and seeing multiple people at once was nbd.  Once a good pairing was found, engagement and marriage happened within two years (before staying chaste became unbearable for the couple.)  This was a good strategy, because it helped chaste Christians find another chaste Christian they are compatible with.  Nowadays the America Christian has turned this on it's head: ""relationships"" are the norm, so teens don't usually go on dates unless they know the person really well.  Hence the typical 28 yo Christian getting married has had two or three 3-year relationships that were, of course, sexual.

I am not sure when the church in America will come around on this issue, because the turn is quite radical.  Parents aren't going to want to hear their priest promoting family over education because they are obsessed with status.  But there is no other way."

Actually doctors don’t use a lot of topical antiseptics. In the emergency department if a dirty wound comes in it gets irrigated with normal saline or even just sterile water. Sterile dressing of course. Then depending of the anatomical location and/contaminants there might be a place for systemic antibiotics. So a shin wound with gravel would get irrigation and watch and wait. A cat bite on a hand would get irrigated and Amoxy-clav. But that’s in an environment where oral or IV antibiotics are readily available. My understanding is that antiseptics aren’t that effective and damage delicate tissues.

"Not inspecting your house every once in a while.

There are many areas in a house a lot of homeowners don't visit regularly. Basements, crawl spaces and attics come to mind.

If you have a basement or crawl space, check for water leaks and moisture. A small leak that goes unnoticed for a long time can cause major issues like rotting floor joists and subfloor which can be really expensive to fix. Check for any insect damage.

If you have heating/air ducts, check for leaks because you'll save money on your electric bill if you spend $10 on duct tape and prevent heating/cooling an area where it is doing absolutely no good.

Some houses have a dryer vent duct that pass through the basement or crawl space. These can become blocked with lint and you can burn out your dryer heating element. 

If you have an attic climb up there every couple of months and look for any signs of water damage. Patching a leak from a roof vent boot is a lot less expensive than having to replace rotting wood and damaged drywall ceilings. Rodents (rats and squirrels, especially) love attics. They also like to chew on electrical wires. Any evidence of rodent inhabitation should be dealt with promptly.

Basically, check infrequently visited parts of your home every few months and make sure everything is in good shape."

"America the land of freedom where you can be arrested for consuming alcohol on private property at the age of 20.

In most countries underage drinking isn't even illegal it's just illegal to sell to minors.

Even if you're caught in public it's usually just confiscation, at worst you're driven home and lectured."

"Yes. Essentially intoxicating by alcohol is by far the most common impairment so we are taught specifically how to recognize and test for alcohol. Drugs, however, each can provide different signs that are widely different than alcohol.

Anyways they say it’s one of the hardest certificates to get.

"Not a realtor but just finished buying a house. No offense to realtors, but take some time to consider several different home inspectors that your realtor DIDN’T recommend. We went with a guy that he recommended and, not knowing a whole lot of what he was telling us but trying our best to understand, we didn’t question much of what he said. 

Found out after the sale how many things he really skated by and didn’t elaborate on, or look at period, that ended up being issues for us. He wanted to basically grease the wheels for our decision. My mom is a realtor and was very surprised when we told her the entire inspection was about 2 hours. She told me the inspectors they see routinely do very thorough 3-5 hour inspections. 

We still love the house, do not regret buying one bit. Just some extra time and money in the long run because our inspector was buddies with the realtor!"

"Dated a guy for nearly 4 years. I was constantly trying to change his pathetic, childish ways. Mommy and Daddy are rich and mouth fed him with a silver spoon his entire life (not literally). Mommy came and cleaned his apartment and stocked with groceries (and said apartment is rent free because Mommy and Daddy own it)! He *refused* to learn to cook or clean or even grocery shop. I'm very health concious and not super tidy but pretty clean so it was very frustrating to go over and the fridge was full of junk food and the place was a mess until the once a week day that his mom was cleaning for him. I communicated again and again that I didn't want to be his moms replacement if we ever got married and was so turned off by his entire lifestyle and weak mannerisms that I just broke. Just fucking broke. Told him his parents (his mom mostly) made him into a pussy and a poor excuse for a man and I was ***done***. 

Pretty sure he's exactly the same now at 27 as he was a year ago at 26 which is the same as the person I started dating when he was 22. Refused to grow up. Afraid of everything (due to his bat shit crazy moms fears of everything and always needing to be rediculously prepared).

The bullet dodged is knowing when I have kids they'll grow up to be independent, mature adults who are capable and confident, rather than constantly paranoid and living on inheritence. I also have a wonderful ***MAN*** now who's the same age, but has his shit together. Good job, confident, handsome AF, and spotaneous and independent. "

How is their new partner supposed to feel all because you two feel the need to still talk to stroke your egos? Nothing is gained from continuing communication, you aren't friends, move on.

- delete them from everything, they're out of your life, so they have no need to see it. Vice Versa, no benefit from seeing their lives continuing on without you.

- embrace the sad, get it all out, ugly cry, black out the windows, stay in, whatever - get so sad and emo that you're sick of it and can't stand your sad self.

- change something: update some clothes, hairstyle, get in shape - something that makes you feel like you're doing yourself a favor and that the ex had no part of or knows about

"Not exactly “on the spot”, but it was with zero notice and really fucked over my manager. 

Used to be a supervisor at a CVS. I was working one Saturday, opening shift. The afternoon supervisor was in kind of a downward spiral and had been showing up late a lot, especially when I was working before him. I’d told my boss I was sick of dealing with it and next time he showed up late I was leaving and he (the boss) could deal with running the store. 

This particular Saturday, I’m sitting on the floor near the front of the store about 10 minutes before the other supe (let’s call him Ernie) is scheduled, finishing a planogram. All of a sudden, Ernie bursts in the front door yelling about something. I was still sitting down but told him to calm down, asked what was wrong. He ripped his shirt off, screamed some gibberish, and walked out. 

I got up and went to the office to call the manager. I told him what happened, manager said he was on the way. As I’m leaving the office, Ernie comes back in the store and runs over to the office door, still shirtless and still screaming. I told him to get out and that I’d called our manager. He cornered me against the door and kept yelling, and one of the cashiers came over and pulled him out the door. 

I went back to finish my planogram and get ready to leave. As I’m sitting on the floor finishing the bottom shelf, Ernie comes back in a third time, storms right over to where I’m sitting, and throws his shirt and keys at me (the keys actually hit me in the face and cut my cheek superficially) and screams that he quit. Manager showed up not long after that, I gave him my account of what happened, and left. 

The next day, I was working the closing shift. When I got there, my manager was in the office and asked to speak to me. He told me Ernie had told him I was taunting him, harassing him, and using racial slurs (Ernie and I are both white, and I don’t use racial slurs to begin with). I told him that was untrue and that everything that had happened was in front of the cameras, so he could check for himself. I also told him to talk to the cashier who had pulled Ernie away from me at the office door, because he’d been there for the whole thing. I then told manager that I wasn’t working with Ernie anymore because of the hostile environment. Manager immediately asked me what store I want to transfer to. I told him, “I’m not transferring, I’m telling you that I’m not comfortable working with him because he physically attacked me. It’s your responsibility to make this a safe place for your employees, not transfer anyone who complains.” He told me to think about it and left. 

As soon as he left, I emailed my old boss and asked if they were hiring/if I could come in for an interview. About ten minutes later, she called and goes, “Why the hell do you need an interview? Can you start tomorrow?” I told her yes, but that I’d need Tuesday morning off and could work any hours after that. She agreed and I finished my shift at CVS. 

Tuesday morning was our truck day, and THE ONLY reason I went in was because I was the opening supervisor and didn’t want to screw over my team by not showing up. Manager strolls in about 10am, and immediately hides in the office (thanks for the help with truck, you lazy fuck). I went into the office, asked him what he planned to do about Ernie, and he said, “I already told you I will transfer you to whatever store you want so you don’t have to work with him.” I asked if Ernie was going to face any sort of repercussions, and he said Ernie had been going through a rough time. I laughed and said, “Thanks, that’s all I needed. Here are my keys, I quit.” 

He got super flustered and was like “wait a minute I need you to think about this.” I told him I had. He then got angry and said “and how do you expect to get a job when I won’t give you a reference?” I smiled and said, “I actually started a new job yesterday, and my next shift with them is tonight. I’m making more money there and won’t be physically assaulted by a member of their staff.” As I turned to grab my purse and leave, he kind of sputtered, “but ... but it’s truck day!” I already had the door open and there were a couple agents standing in the photo lab (outside the office) and I just said, “then it sounds like you should probably get out of the office and actually do some work.” The photo tech burst out laughing and manager got mad at him too ( I heard he quit soon after but can’t confirm). 

I did send a text to all the other supes (except Ernie) apologizing for leaving them with no notice and explaining that if they had any questions about why I quit, they could call our regional manager, as I’d already sent him a detailed account of what happened. I got a call from the regional manager a week after I quit, asking if I would come back, and when I said no, he understood. They paid me for that entire week and paid out all my vacation time (which they didn’t have to because I had quit). 

That manager was put on leave a while after, for mostly unrelated issues, but I heard from his replacement that manager had gotten in a lot of trouble for leaving the company open to an EEOC complaint or a lawsuit.

10/10 would quit on truck day and make him actually get off his ass and do work again. "

This guy would start talking and not stop to the point where he had been warned several times, and eventually fired for it. Customers who clearly just want to leave, but he wouldn't get the hint and would ramble on and on. I didn't realize until later that I was actually hired as his replacement."

"I was born in 96' so the 2000s were my childhood - early adolescent years. 

Damn was it fun to run around my neighborhood after school with all of the other kids who lived there. Life was just a constant adventure.  Summer/Fall/Winter/Spring, it didn't matter, we were always running from one house to another, playing baseball in the Cul De Sac, exploring the woods in tree line behind our houses, biking down the hills on the roads that ran through the neighborhood, playing Xbox in someone's house one minute then playing touch or tackle football in the front yard the next. Summers were pretty much us meeting outside every single day at 10am and staying busy until it got dark by either swimming in someone's pool, running through sprinklers, having water gun fights, or a million other things we'd do. I remember when American Idiot came out we all sat in my friend's room and closed the door to listen to it because Billie Joe said ""Fuck!"".

It feels like most kids today don't have that type of childhood. They don't run around and hang out anymore. I'm not sure what the reason is, but I just feel like they're missing out on the best time of their life. I'd honestly give anything to go back and have one more day to run around and be free instead of having to spend the day at the office.  I get so nostalgic thinking about it that I almost choke up at the thought that I won't ever experience it again. I know there's other fun things I can do as an adult, but it will never compare.  I just remember the 00's as the best formative years I could've ever asked for, and I miss it. I think about it a lot.

"In my tiny home town in West Virginia when I was 21 the only real alcohol serving restaurant was an Applebee's that I used to serve at. My friend, a former cook there, and I used to go to and sit at the bar for $2 LIIT night. But because we knew the bartender from our time working there, she would give them to us in the larger glasses and put much more alcohol into them than normal. We'd go and spend about $10 each and just get hammered in an Applebees. I'm not proud, but I'd do it again."

"When I was around 16, me and 4 other guys saw what looked like a UFO in the sky with active camo on.  It was translucent, but distinct in shape as well.  We were all riding in a van together and it was around 4 pm and sunny and we were on the highway.  All of us saw it and were trying to figure out what it was.  Some trees along the highway then obscured our view from it and once we got past the trees it was gone.  Still have no idea what it could have been to this day.  All of us were sober. It wasn't a quick glimpse either, we probably had 15- 30 seconds to look at it.

It was kind of shaped like a stereotypical UFO but flying at around a 70 degree angle."
"These are honest answers to your questions. You won't like them because they show a side of the GOP you may not want to accept, but they're true

&gt;1)Why are we so against marijuana? 

Racism. Even though everyone does it, it's still associated with black people.    
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/?utm_term=.4298c0999980

The law is equal, but enforcement is not. White people get warnings, black people get prison


&gt;2)Why must we pull the rug out from under poor people when there is PLENTY of beuracratic bs to cut first?

Because the GOP does not support poor people. 

https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2018/4/1/1753726/-Horrible-GOP-tweet-tells-how-they-truly-feel

That's a GOP account that literally says ""Republicans hate poor people"".    
Yeah, it was retracted after an immense uproar, but it's pretty clear. 

You can find many other quotes against the poor out there.    
https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2013/05/22/gop-congressman-stephen-fincher-on-a-mission-from-god-starve-the-poor-while-personally-pocketing-millions-in-farm-subsidies/

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/republcan-congressman-mo-brooks-poor-people-no-healthcare-good-lives-subsidised-alabama-a7713371.html

Bureaucracy exists to PREVENT poor people from accessing benefits. 

&gt;3)Why are we standing idly by while nazis and pedos are running under our gop name?

Because they align with party values. The only problem the party has with them is optics. Not actions. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/us/roy-moore-alabama-supporters.html

""If Alabama voters do believe the allegations against Roy Moore, many think, reluctantly: Better an accused child molester than a Democrat""

&gt;4)Why is there still so much surveillance by the government?

Because it stifles opposition to the government. Look at China. 

&gt;5)Why is it that *every* time we have to side with big business on *every* issue?

Because the GOP is the party of Big Business. Period. Think about this for a second.    
You should only be asking Why if they DON'T side with big business. Because when they do side, it's *exactly what you expect*

I honestly do not understand your mindset here. You have a political party that has been siding with big business *your entire life* and yet somehow you're confused when they... Side with big business? 

Additional points: High level politicians ARE involved with big business, and stand to personally profit.    
Also, big business makes big campaign contributions. 

It's all about the money

&gt;6)Why are we so against contraceptives when we are against abortion?

Because it's not actually about abortion. At most, it's optics. Mostly it's about controlling women. Great example:

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-choice-leaders-in-colorado-still-angry-about-program_us_5a259edde4b0545e64bf9590

Colorado had a program for free IUDs. Ran 5 years. Abortion rate dropped a staggering 64% and a 54% drop in teen pregnancy. $65 million in savings... Estimated that every dollar spent on the program saved $5.85 in state spending. 

Republicans voted it down.    
It's easy to find countless quotes about how if women don't want to get pregnant, they shouldn't have sex. Which is why they're opposed to anything that allows women to have sex without getting pregnant. 

Also, how many times have republican legislators been against abortion, but would force their mistress to get one? It's surprisingly often

&gt;7)Why don't we come up with new ideas?

That's easy. It's in the dictionary. 
**Conservative:** holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation, typically in relation to politics

Opposition to new ideas is the WHOLE POINT of being conservative. 

&gt;8)Why are we acting like cops never make mistakes or that there are no bad cops?

Because they enforce the will of the state. They are actual power to wield. Also, optics again. Plus law enforcement overwhelmingly votes conservative

&gt;The main reason that I'm still a republican is that it is hard to protect against insane levels of bs rising up in the party when you have no way to influence it.

Hate to break it to you, but that BS has always been there. It's just that now, the corruption has reached the level when it can safely be shown "

"First, let me save you the trouble: User name checks out.

In my younger days, I had self-esteem problems, along with bouts of unemployment.  If you've ever been a man and unemployed, you realize that the first question EVERYONE asks you is, ""What do you do for a living?""  I couldn't handle the awkwardness of that in asking someone out.

Religious? Yep.  I'm Catholic.  I definitely wanted to find a Catholic woman, but I have asked out women who were not.  Did I want to marry a virgin?  Sure, but I'm not naive.  By the time I was in my twenties I realized that it might not be possible to find someone like that anymore.  

Even after I was steadily employed, I was following this stupid pattern of trying to become friends first and then asking the woman out on a date.  A woman did that with me once, and then I had an ""Aha!"" moment where I saw why that didn't work.

I'm probably about a 5, though my self-esteem issues have made me rate myself lower than that.  I've asked out women who were 9's or 10's but I've also asked out 5's.  I'm as much taken with beauty as the next guy, but if you have a nice smile and you seem like a fairly smart woman, I'll probably be interested.

In the early 2000's, I developed a full-blown anxiety disorder, which I didn't get help for until 2005.  I tried to engage with women in the early part of my recovery, but I came off as either awkward or creepy or both.  When I was doing a little better, I went out with a couple of women I met online.  The one was a one-time thing as we didn't hit it off in person the way we did online.  The other one was a long distance thing, and I think she was seeing someone else besides me because very shortly after we broke up, she got married.

I really haven't done much since then.    The older I get, the harder it is to find single women even remotely close to my age.  I often find myself attracted to twenty something women, but I think it's just a hormonal thing.  I realize how ridiculous it would be for me to date someone half my age.  I remember being 25, and I think if a woman in her fifties asked me out, I would have found it creepy.  I don't want to be creepy.

In recent years, I've more or less given up on finding someone.  I'm trying to be at peace with myself as a single man, as acceptance seems like a better path forward than perpetual frustration.

"90s, dude brought in an inexpensive consumer-model fax he'd bought at Futureshop or Best Buy, something like that - but he couldn't get the help he needed there so he came to us because we were a Canon dealership.

He was having trouble hooking the fax up to his computer.  (At the time, some of the fancy commercial units costing an order of magnitude more were just starting to have optional RS232 ports so you could fax from a PC with them, but this was literally the cheapest, most bare-bones fax that canon made at the time - a Faxphone 110.)

He got very upset when I told him that that model had no PC connectivity. ""

""But I bought this one specifically because it's computer-compatible."" ""It's not, though - did the salesman tell you it was?""  ""It must be!  Just look at it!  It's computer-compatible.""  ""What do you mean?""  ""Well, other faxes are black and white, but this one is computer-coloured.""  ""The fax standard is strictly black-and-white, even if you fax from a computer, it's going to be black and white.""  ""No, no - other faxes are black *or* white - but this one is computer-coloured.""

...yeah, he made his purchase based on the assumption that he'd be able to make it work with his computer, because it was *beige*.  Like computers."

"[Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) are an [ethnoreligious people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group). 

&gt;Jews (Hebrew: יְהוּדִים‬ ISO 259-3 Yehudim, Israeli pronunciation [jehuˈdim]) or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group[10] and a nation,[11][12][13] originating from the Israelites[14][15][16] and Hebrews[17][18] of the Ancient Near East. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated,[19] as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish people, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.

.

&gt;An ethnoreligious group (or ethno-religious group) is an ethnic group whose members are also unified by a common religious background. Ethnoreligious communities define their ethnic identity neither by ancestral heritage nor simply by religious affiliation but often through a combination of both. An ethnoreligious group has a shared history and a cultural tradition of its own. In many cases ethnoreligious groups are ethno-cultural groups with a traditional ethnic religion; in other cases ethnoreligious groups begin as communities united by a common faith which through endogamy developed cultural and ancestral ties.[1][2] Some ethnoreligious groups' identities are reinforced by the experience of living within a larger community as a distinct minority. Ethnoreligious groups can be tied to ethnic nationalism if the ethnoreligious group possesses a historical base in a specific region.[3] In many ethnoreligious groups emphasis is placed upon religious endogamy, and the concurrent discouragement of interfaith marriages or intercourse, as a means of preserving the stability and historical longevity of the community and culture."

Before my grandmother passed, she would mention rather frequently how her antique tea kettle and cups were going to my mother when she passed.

Fast forward to the day of her funeral and as we all head back to her house to be with my grandfather, we enter the kitchen and see the tea set is mysteriously gone. We soon found out that a woman whom I refuse to give the honorific title of aunt anymore, had absconded with the tea set.

I'm not sure when we transitioned to these huge goblets but it's a real shame. No one wants to drink the dregs of a warm martini 20 minutes after it was made.

How do you think people in the 50s used to drink a six martini lunch? The martinis were tiny, that's how. (I mean, six is still a lot, especially over even a long lunch in the middle of the day, but try that today and it'd kill you.)"

"My aunt also has a ""portal"" in her house. Worst part is that it's in her bedroom. She claims to have seen several figures walk across the foot of her bed over the years and walk right through the wall where there is a cross imbedded in it. The cross is about a foot off the floor and about 5"" x 3"", it is part of the gyproc and noticeable even after years of painting over. She would see animals and humans, sometimes in period clothing and sometimes dressed normally. We know this isn't bullshit either because we used to live in the downstairs portion of the house and were woken up several times but her screaming. She started leaving the bathroom lights on every night which is right across her room and she hasn't had what she reffers to as ""visitors"" in a while now. I have also experienced several paranormal things whilst living in that house like hearing footsteps when no-one is home, figures in photos I took and the most interactive one; I was at the top of the stairs leading to her upper portion of the house which is closed off by a door right the top, my aunt was at work and I heard my sister coming down the hall downstairs and stayed at the top holding the doorknob as to not make a sound when closing the door to try and scare my sister. The moment where she was about to come into view and I was about to scream out and scare her the doorknob turns twice and the door is pulled away from me. My immidiate reaction was to pull it back towards me with some force and the door slammed. My sister was now aware that I was there and I wasn't able to make her jump while coming up the stairs like I wanted. I opened the door slowly with my sister watching- nothing. We spent the rest of the day downstairs."

"I agree with LilRedheadStepSheep.

I have a friend who was raped while she repeatedly told her attacker/""friend,"" that she didn't want to have sex, that  she wanted him to stop etc. She doesn't believe she was raped because ""he wouldn't do that to her."" She didn't get physically violent with him because society teaches us unwarranted violence is immoral except in defence, but society also conditioned her to believe what was happening her was not bad enough to warrant defence; that because it was not a physically violent rape, that she had no right to use violence to prevent it happening.

In a different angle, I've had sex I do not want to have, because \_it isn't polite to make a fuss\_ . It was never rape because I never told the other person I didn't want sex, because \_it isn't polite to make a fuss\_. I'm not traumatised, just disappointed I had a lot of sexual encounters I had no interest in, because society told me my momentary disinterest in sex was not as important as the other individual's interest.

Some people don't understand this and say ""why didn't you say anything, or your friend do anything"" ; because society conditioned us to think where our opinion conflicted with a males' opinion, the males' automatically is more important. Obviously not all women think like this and men are also raised thinking they should put other's opinion's above their own, which causes them further issues when toxic masculinity tells them to protect themselves they should have just been more ""man-like"" and that it's their fault.

There's no easy fix but in the long term we need to make it so that all people feel that if either party is not interested in sex, then they have a right to say it, be valued and not be harassed for that choice.

Sorry. Rant over.

Edit: No fuck this. My entire thing is about not being shy to voice your opinion to keep yourself safe. So, not sorry!, but still, this post is now over."

"I have these neighbors not too far from me that have with three sons. All the most spoiled kids I've ever seen. They live in the biggest house in the area, own two teslas and a corvette, and their kids have had everything they wanted handed to them.

I had a cookout hosted at my house not too long ago and their family was invited to come. These are the most memorable moments where I realized ""holy shit you so do not live in the real world"".

* The middle of the three (probably 15ish) was wandering around in my house and asked if he could keep my TV. I was super confused and said ""...*What?* Like *have* it? ...No???"". He said that his dad could come and get them from me, and I explained to him that I owned and had payed for it and couldn't have it. He started crying (15 years old, just to remind you) and ran and got his dad and told him he wanted my TV. The DAD said that he couldn't have mine but right when they got home they'd BUY HIM ONE JUST LIKE IT! Absolutely bizarre.
* The youngest (About 10 y/o) doesn't really have a grip on understanding why his lifestyle is different from others, so he just talks about it a lot. He has a monthly allowance of $750 (what the hell is a 10 year old even doing with that money!?) and that last time his mom and dad got in a fight the dad bought the mom a corvette to make her happy again. (Hence the existence of the corvette. Most people in the neighborhood already knew this story, though.)
* The oldest was pretty introverted, probably around 17 years old. He did, however, manage to make everything he said a subtle reminder that the shit I own is not as cool as the shit he owns.

      ""What kind of car is that?""

      ""...It's a Honda Accord""

      ""You drive that?""

      ""Yup.""

      ""Huh. Have you seen our Tesla?""

* At one point they all asked their (drunken) dad if they could leave and he said that they could drive the tesla home. None of them have their licenses. They also crashed a BMW last year in what I assume was a similarly dumb decision.

"The Dumbledore example is interesting because it only came out when the author was asked about something related to it. It wasn't something she made a big deal about - she'd decided he was gay at some early point, and that adds a bit to your understanding of his character in a few places, but it wasn't something she thought needed to be made explicit anywhere in the books. She only brought it up in the context of the film writers wanting to include something that would have made him explicitly straight or bi-.

He's a character who happens to be gay, which is implied but it isn't relevant enough to the story for it to be worth mentioning explicitly."

"parents are not logical when there children are involved.

regardless of whether the schools would win or lose the lawsuits, too many suits were flooding in at fighting/settling them was too expensive so they said fuck it, no tolerance policy now stop sueing us.

"Seriously. Eugenics is not inherently evil. A lot of armchair ethics philosophers are only associating it with the brutal and questionably ethical methods tried during the early 20th century. (See: Slavery, Studding, Holocaust, Chemical Castration, etc)

In today's modern civil rights conscious world, Eugenics is going to become necessary. Selective breeding and breeding programs designed to give our future generations the best chance at succeeding in life and surviving our expansion into space and living in harsh environments we are going to encounter.

We need to be smarter, stronger, faster, longer living, healthier and less disease ridden. We need to design our future generations to reach maximum biological potential.

It's not about denying a disabled, diseased or mentally handicapped person from their right to ""breed"", it's about not bringing about that same suffering and burden to the next generations. That kind of thing puts a strain on healthy individuals and future resouces. Someone who cannot contribute to society in a positive or meaningful manner is, unfortunately, a burden on the rest.

At some point, we're going to have to stop this feel-good, joy-joy ""let the disabled, diseased and retarded fuck and have kids freely!"" attitude. That's just reckless and setting everyone else up for failure."

The 'grills' you date have some serious expectations.
"Years ago, as a teenager, I met this guy at the Gym and got to know him on an acquaintance basis, working up towards 'Gym Friend'. We shall call him 'Stu'. For years I would greet Stu and his buddy, spot them on Bench, chat about work, general small talk. Even when I worked at the same Gym as a Trainer for a few years, we kept up tabs, chatted, very nice guy. Saw him in the locker room a few times shirtless, good looking guy with abs, pretty standard for a regular Gym goer though.


Years go by, I've since left that job and Gym behind. I'm on r/all one night looking for some new Subreddits, and lo and behold, I see Stu. He looks super happy, like he just had a great day, so I get all excited, I think, ""Oh shit! It's Stu! I haven't seen him in YEARS! Let's see how he's doing!""

So I click the link.


So Stu was doing well, however, the better question was 'who' he was doing. Stu was in a 5 white guys on 1 black girl gangbang porn that I had stumbled upon. I was just beside myself, 'Stu!', I thought to myself, 'Nice going man! You look great!'


I then proceeded to spend the next hour or so dredging that particular porn site for all his videos. He happened to do a LOT, and I mean A LOT, of the 'faux incest step brother/step sister' stuff, and even fucked one of my preferred porn starlets!


So good on you Stu! I SINCERELY, SINCERELY hope you washed your hands regularly when we knew each other!

"This comment needs to be higher. I grew up in Baton Rouge and used to hunt in the Atchafalaya  National Wildlife Refuge. People in the area aren't scared of the swamp - you don't ever hear of anyone getting lost or going missing. This is because the people who do go into the swamp are prepared and have probably been fishing/hunting the area for hundreds of years and don't stay from what they know. I'd say it's no dangerous than any other vast wilderness in the U.S. 

Also, Cajun French is pretty rare thanks to various efforts in the early 20th century. However, their is a distinct accent and a lot of people who leave Houma, Morgan City, Thibodaux, etc. try to hide their accent. Just get them drunk and it'll come out."

"my lost control story was going down the Coquihalla Hwy (Highway in Canadian mountains with a speed limit of 120km/hr, most people go 140) just approaching Hope BC. I saw a sign that warned of ""loose rocks"" on the highway. I thought, ok, loose rocks. no big deal. but I did slow down. 

Suddenly I see more than just ""loose rocks"". The whole highway was covered in gravel and small rocks. Going downhill I hit this gravel and completely lost control sliding across the road. 

Three things saved my life. 
One - I was the only car on the road at the time because I did slide across the yellow line into opposing lane of traffic. If other cars were there i would be dead. 
Two - I slowed down. I have no idea why the sign didn't warn people to slow down, all it said was ""loose rocks"". Again, glad i was the only car on the road, because if there was a car behind me speeding, it could have been bad slowing down on a high speed highway full of gravel. 
Three - I did not panic. If I had done any sudden movements with the steering wheel it would have been fatal. I kept calm and was able to regain control but I really was worried I wasn't going to make it. afterwards I was very spooked.

"Ok, so while it IS possible to create air bubbles in your blood from a pressure differential through the vaginal wall, it’s extremely unlikely.  Even if you could create an embolism, chances are it wouldn’t be big enough to cause anything more than an extremely mild discomfort. Like, heartburn would be worse. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a doctor, but I did ask a doctor about this exact story a few years ago, he gave me a quick explanation and said that’s it’s most likely an urban legend or it’s one of those false cautionary tales to keep people from sticking bottles in vaginas. The open end of a beer bottle can cause a pressure differential and GET STUCK in there. The act of getting it stuck usually doesn’t cause much damage, but people panic because they don’t want to go to the ER and cause all sorts of damage trying to get it out on their own (I was an EMT, I worked at a hospital for a while. Yes, there is a special toolkit in the ER to remove things from vaginas and assholes, the toolkit gets used a LOT)."

But when I was working with this guy, he told me a story of how one of my buddies drew some inappropriate things on his bookbag.  He wasn't the type to draw on his bookbag so this thing stuck out like a sore thumb.  So he drew a large black box over top of it to cover it up.  He went on to tell me that he hated every second of high school because of stuff like that and he started talking about how he had considered suicide in high school and it sounded like that bookbag situation was part of that.  It really hit me hard, because I had been in situations like that and it hurt to know that my group of friends was the reason for someone else to think that way.  So I apologized to him and let him know that if had done anything like that to him to make him feel bad that I was sorry.  It was super awkward but he kind of nodded and after that we were a lot closer. He was one of my better work friends after that and it was never brought up again.

"It depends on what you do during the day, such as what your job is, I suppose. Although we shouldn't shampoo our hair nearly as much as we're told, as once per day is just too often -- our hair needs *some* oily texture to it, as most shampoos have some fairly harsh surfactants like Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate that just dry your hair out so much. They can also cause you to break out in acne if they get on your face/skin, as they're quite tough and comedogenic. I resort to using oil-based pomade because shampoo just strips off my hair's natural oils.

You really don't have to clean that often if you do it properly and if you're not in a dirty line of work. I personally suggest that people stick to non-scented soaps &amp; cleansers, and to shampoo 2 times a week (or less according to some people at /r/nopoo), and to use cologne/perfume for scent. A lot of people, men especially, think things like scented soaps &amp; deodorant/anti-antiperspirant are good substitutes for fragrances -- but they're really not. It's best to just use non-scented stuff, for the most part. It's also good to use cleansers that aren't harsh, and don't have astringents in them like alcohol or menthol.

On the other hand, I've known people who showered *twice* a day -- I think that's just ridiculous. Washing your skin that often dries it out and leaves it more susceptible to bacterial infections, from what I understand."

I was about nine years old, first time spending the night at my bio dad's house since we left him. A show I'd been waiting to premier was showing the pilot that night, and when the show came on, I realized it actually wasn't that good and went to tell my dad, who came in at a great time for me to do so. I ran over and started talking to him, and he looked down at me, very much drunk, and collapsed on top of me-- he didn't get off for a few hellish seconds that I couldn't breath through, and then told me to stop lying when I said I was in pain after he pried himself off of me and dragged me up with him. I cried so hard because I was in a lot of pain, and he refused to drive me to the hospital because he thought I was looking for attention, and after him telling me he wouldn't take a liar to the hospital and waste money, I told him to call my mom. Had to wait about two hours until my mom got there, being berated the whole time by my drunk dad and uncle. Mom drove me halfway home, promised to take me to the hospital in the morning, and I didn't sleep at all because of how much I hurt. I forget exactly what was broken, but they said I was ""lucky I wasn't paralyzed now"". Upon learning this, my dad scoffed and went, ""Great, how much is she going to cost me then?""."

I used to work in Northern Ontario during the summer months as a forest ranger (as there is not much you can do during the winter) and flew around to a few very remote locations.  Occassionally we had to make emergency landings.  That's not really a big deal because there's lakes everywhere and where you land isn't likely to kill you.  Especially in summer.  There's no poisonous snakes, we rarely saw wild animals because of all the noise we made, and other than the black flies the environment is somewhat tolerable.

I couldn't imagine making regular flights to the south pole because if you have to make an emergency landing somewhere, anywhere, how the heck do you survive that?  Everywhere you land is going to be desolate and cold enough to kill you.  You're hundreds, possibly thousands of miles from anything.  How are you going to last long enough to be rescued?  "

"Also, due to the emotional nature, and political discourse, surrounding gun deaths, it's important to point out that 12,979 is still an extremely small number when compared to our population size of 320,000,000. 

I'm not trying to diminish anyone's feelings about the shock and fear surrounding gun violence, but looking at many of the categories on that list you can easily see that the public discourse over gun violence may be a little overblown. It's totally understandable that you might have the misconception that gun violence would be the deadliest thing facing Americans today. However:

* 37,000 from car crashes
* 110,561 from Alzheimer's disease

Also I think Dudley in Phoenix was pretty good. You saw the very beginnings of his transformation after he felt his lowest after the Dementor attack. I subscribe to the theory that that’s when he began to try being better. He saw how cowardly he was as a bully.

I can’t remember him in HBP— that movie was all either incredible or forgettable scenes."

"So what happened was that the characters fucking developed. Before that point, the sequel trilogy was just the kids being told what to do by a variety of adults.

"I’ve always liked the Jar Jar theory, but the Dumbledore theory is way off mark. In the wizarding world the splitting of one’s soul is as to murder what murder is to punching someone. It’s utterly unthinkable to any but the most deprived and inhumane. Despite his flaws, Dumbledore is truly good, he always looks for the best in people. I find it saddening that so many people tend to view Dumbledore as some diabolical mastermind orchestrating events behind the scenes. If he were aware of the events in the chamber, you should damn well be sure that Dumbledore would have intervened himself, not merely acting through Fawkes. "

"It doesn't take eight minutes. Most electric kettles take about a minute to boil, and even old-fashioned stove top ones are quicker than eight minutes. I have heard however that UK mains electricity is stronger and better suited to boiling a kettle so maybe there's something in that. 

In reality there's nothing wrong with boiling water in the microwave. You get the exact same end product. But ""sticking the kettle on"" is such a huge part of the ritual of making tea that in its own right it's synonymous with making a hot drink, and we tend to get precious about our tea routines. 

Honestly I do think it's much more convenient than microwaving. You literally have to spend a couple of seconds at the tap (faucet) putting water in the kettle, then you put it down, press a button, and 60 seconds later have hot water. "

Sister had a vicious coke habit and decided to siphon money out of everyone's paychecks to stay afloat. Once they found out, employees tried getting corporate involved, but the institution just dragged ass leaving them without a solution for months. So they just started stalking everything. One got bought an $1000 engagement ring just selling bricks of tickets to customers. Another guy had his apartment decorated with all the high end prizes.

"I have a ghost cat story, seems like those are pretty common.

When I was a teenager, I lived with my grandma and her [old as dirt fluffy black cat](https://m.imgur.com/XkarYP6) This cat lived to be 28, I was actually surprised when he died because I was convinced he was like Thackery Binx or something. ^^^^^^only ^^^^^^half ^^^^^^joking 

Anyway, he had a daily routine that he stuck to even after falling off the mortal coil. Every morning at 6 sharp, I would get woken up by the feeling of a cat pawing my face because it was breakfast time and he didn't believe in weekends. Every day when I would get home from school, I'd feel a cat weaving around my legs. Laying in bed, weight on my feet. Not in bed by 9:30, scratching noises at the bedroom door. Fluffy black blurs waddling by in my peripheral vision. Creaky sounding elderly cat meows at the back door. You get the idea. 

I guess he was so set in his ways after 28 years of routine that he didn't want to have to change it after death. He stuck around as long as my grandma owned that house, he's probably still harassing the new people for breakfast every morning. "

Bye bye Lil' Sebastian 
"Bit late to the party but this one was just bizarre to be honest. Flashback to about 3 years ago, I was walking home. A bit of background, I live in the West of Scotland which is not exactly cryptid central, and the wildlife consists of pigeons and the occasional fox.

 I was walking along a main road in the afternoon, which is situated between a wooded area and houses, with cars frequent along the way. This isn't some countryside, unused road either, it's quite busy and in effect, I wasn't exactly on high alert for Nessie or Bigfoots alcoholic cousin. As I was walking, minding my own business, a noise suddenly stopped me in my tracks when a creature I can only describe as a robot vulture screamed from the woods.

 I was left standing completely bewildered, and more ""lmao wut"" than anything. I looked around to see if anyone else was walking along the street so I could make sure I wasn't going insane.
Nope, just the cars, me and the freaky screaming robobird in the woods that now sounded like it was running towards the edges of the forest, with my initial thoughts of ""large bird"" shifting to ""strange deer"". 
As I stood there, wondering, fearing; the noise of rustling bushes and galloping hooves got closer and closer to the edge of the woods with the same accompanying shrieking. Then, at some speed, what I can only describe as a big, grey, shaggy goat with large horns and really quite long legs, at least 6ft in total height, ran past a clearing opposite of me, in broad daylight. 

Now, I'm not exactly an avid springwatch viewer, but I don't think creatures of that description exactly cut about Glasgow and I don't know any Scottish mythical creatures matching that description. I stood there for another five minutes, hoping someone driving by also saw the Demon Goat of Glasgow, but I was alone. Alone with the knowledge that I now have the worst fucking cryptid story known to man."

I’m kind of the opposite. I don’t love myself enough so when someone does I’m wondering what’s wrong with them. Then I make a list of all the things I don’t like about them so that way I can convince myself to bounce out before they do. If someone makes me consistently happy I go into panic mode as soon as I realize it. The self destruction follows soon after. 
"That's...quite a large clot, yes. You definitely wanna let people know if that happens. The biggest I've ever seen is about a grapefruit/softball, and that one was just before a hemorrhage. At work, we weigh large clots like that to determine how much blood you've actually lost. Plus, you need to add that amount to your original blood loss during delivery. Anything above 500 milliliters is a hemorrhage for a vaginal delivery,  over 1000 ml for a C-section. "
"This happened to my dad 25 years ago, and he luckily survived. He was a salaried employee that had worked 60hrs in 5 days and had been working 10 hrs straight with no sleep. On his way to drop the machinary they used in those days to do that job, he crashed through a barricade on a bridge. His car was teetering on the edge when the  paramedics pulled him out. They said it was the weight of the machines in the trunk that kept the car from falling. My dad, as usual, went back to work the next day like nothing happened. He worked for that company for 20+ years, and put up with a ton of shit. When he got cancer, they actually did a lot of nice stuff for him, and us (his kids), when it was apparent he was terminal. It is insane to think this stuff still happens. Even working as a waitress 5 years ago,  it was nothing to work a double, and be expected to be back in 5 hours to open. Such bullshit."

"Were you dealing with real people or retail/service employees?  Most international visitors only interact with Americans who are in ""customer service mode.""

So the phone. Let's start with that. Having one is irrelevant. There are programs in north America that give homeless people phones so they can find work. Not where I got mine but it was dirt cheap. So saying I have one is dumb when you can get them for 20 bucks.

Service? Who said I have service? No one did besides you. I'm using WiFi hotspots that every restaurant and their mother gives out for free now.

Lastly let's take your phone and internet access away. All your money away. Then let's drop you in a city and tell you to find a job. Good fucking luck. Where are you going to apply for work? Wanted ads? Okay, well how you gonna contact them? Email? With what device? Calling? Again what device? If you're in a city and you do not have internet access, your chances of getting a job are nonexistent. 

This gets brought up frequently and is just as overwhelmingly stupid now as it was then. If you're going to accuse me of nonsense try thinking it through first. Am I frustrated? Yes. Because I get accused of this shit constantly and it has never made any sense whatsoever. The only way it could is if I'm using a new iPhone or some shit. I'm not.

"I HATED working for the CIA. Yes, that CIA. It had its ups and down, but my career goal at every performance review was, “To quit and move back home to Florida.” I lasted nine years, hating it all the way.

Then I came home from a two week vacation to find that I was being removed from the job I spent three years successfully fighting to make permanent. I was being yanked out of a successful position and thrust across town twenty miles away. I was going into mandatory night shift duty for a boss I wanted to shove in a volcano. 

And I was a single dad. 

With an infant. 

I could not do night shift. Period. For obvious reasons. 

Oh, and I found out on Friday. I was to move my shit across town for Monday. 

Instead, I never reported to the home office. I went to the head of HR for the CIA. I met with her and her deputy for almost two hours. I screamed, cussed, cried, and at the end of it all handed in my badge and walked out with a huge amount of severance because my boss fucked me twenty ways from Sunday. 

I sold my house that weekend, bought a new one at the beach in Florida, and called every job contact I had where I live meow. I was employed within a few weeks, own a beautiful home walking distance from the ocean, and work a way better job for more money and a tenth of the stress. 

The CIA was cool. I did good things for National Security and helped make the world a better place. 

And fuck ever going back. Fuck my manager who fucked me. Fuck his boss who let him. Fuck the corrupt “buddy system” promotion that held the good people back and jacked off the brown nosers.

If a door opens outward but has one of those retractable metal dampners at the top, zip ties, a belt, rope or packing tape/duct tape wrapped around them will keep it from opening.

Run, hide, fight, in that order. If you can get to an exit, run, even if it's a second story window. A broken ankle isn't bad in the scheme of things.

Hide if you can.

Fight if you must. Only if you must. Fight like a crazed motherfucker. Throw books and chairs and desks. Scream. Get others to fight.There's a video out there of an old lady who chased 2 armed men out of her house, with a broom, because she ran at them like a fucking banshee. The term for this is ""violence of action"" and it matters way more than anything else in a fight. Even more than what weapon you have or what training you have. There's a US Soldier out there who killed an insurgent with a damn unsharpened plastic spoon. The insurgent was better armed and better trained than any school shooter ever will be.

"I work at a hotel and every other Friday they buy the whole team a catered lunch “if” we meat bi-monthly goal from our guest satisfaction surveys. Which we do really well on, so we get a lot of lunches. Well the part that is messed up is that they have convinced most of the staff (some of which don’t even speak English) that they need to clock out and take their lunch break if they want to eat the work provided lunch. In the state that I live in though, the employer is required to give you a minimum of an unpaid, uninterrupted, 30-minute lunch break where you can choose to spend that time either on or off property however you see fit. So I started telling the housekeepers that technically they can go eat the work provided lunch “on-the-clock” and then go and clock out for 30-minutes and take their “real lunch”. It’s literally THE LAW. Management was not happy when they found out I was saying something to them but there was nothing they could do about it and they knew that. I just hate seeing people, especially people like that, get taken advantage of because they were never taught the labor laws. I’ve even talked to the Department of Labor and Wages to verify this and they told me I was correct. So after this started happening I felt pretty good, but guess what management did? They decided I needed a “random drug test” lol. Needless to say, the state I live in has legalized, recreational marijuana. So I might not have a job once the test comes back early next week.  "

"I’ll add to this, don’t be afraid to get dirty during your inspection. When we bought out house, the bathtub was filthy, and we were sort of repelled by it during the inspection. So we just sort of glanced at it, thought “I guess we’ll have to clean it,” then moved on without looking further. It wasn’t until after we bought it that we realized that the tub had a liner in it, and that water had gotten in between the liner and the tub itself. So instead of just needing to be cleaned, we needed a new liner installed altogether. That was a few hundred that we could have bargained off he sale price if we realized it before closing.

How a sauce made with tomatoes could taste like straight watery squash puzzled me.  Until I found out she used very few tomatoes, a shit ton of garden veggies and didn't let the sauce cook but for 45 minutes or until the veggies were tender. That is not how you cook spaghetti sauce!

"Here's my crash course on carrying a conversation:

General advice would be to just take a genuine interest in someone. The conversation will flow much easier if you can at least pretend you're interested. If you can't do that, then be curious enough to try to find something interesting about them.

I've found the acronym FORM helpful too.

F- Fun
O- Occupation
R- Relationships
M- Motivation (best with ppl you already know)

What do you do for fun? Really, how/when did you get into that?
What do you do for work? What got you interested in that?
Do you have family in the area? Kids?
What do you get really passionate about; excited or upset about?

The follow up questions could last all day for each topic. Notice these are questions about them. Everyone's favorite topic is themselves and that's something they actually know quite a bit about.

If you can't remember FORM, remember this...

Ohreallywhysthat?

Once you get someone going you can break this up a bunch of different ways to keep them talking (ie. Oh?; Oh! really?; Really? Why's that?; Why's that?)

It's a little weird if you're not used to it, but it actually works really well. And this way you aren't changing the topic abruptly just because you don't have any left to say about it.

Hopefully you won't have to carry all the weight in the conversation, and usually you don't have to fill too much time, but occasionally you're just stuck with someone who is even worse than you are at social interaction and for whatever reason silence isn't appreciated by society (unfortunately).

Anyway, I hope this is helpful for anyone as introverted as I am. It has got me through some long car rides."

"I grew up around angry people, I had anger issues as a younger person as a result.

I do not deal with people who yell.  Yes, scolding someone might be necessary, sometimes you need to be stern with your kids or whatever, and expressing frustration at something or venting may be needed.  But just yelling because you think raising your voice is the way to get your point across, just to have control over someone, i don’t deal with that ever.

The second you do it, I imagine someone scooping you up and throwing you in the garbage.  Because that’s what it is... trash.  Verbal abuse is the behavior of an ugly, incompetent person who needs to be thrown away, just like a dirty diaper.

I have a rule in my home.  If you yell, if you scream, I will not engage with you.  I will take you and put you outside, and lock the door.  Let’s see if you’re willing to show the whole neighborhood how you behave.

I *hate* yellers.  I see it as low as hitting someone.  You’re accomplishing the same thing by yelling. "

"not OP, but had a somewhat similar situation.

meet my wife when i was 19 and she was 17, both from xtian families and both virgins, and decided after we got serious to wait on sex. not necessarily with the intention of waiting until marriage but at least to hold off.

we dated for 5 years, then got married right after she finished college (i had finished a year before her), and we've been married 17 years now. weve known each other for more than half of our lives, and waiting to have sex until marriage was.......i don't know. i think it was a net positive, but at times it was a difficult thing to stick to.

the first time was a combination of awkward and tender. we both cried a bit after - happy tears. and then we've had the opportunity over the past 17 years to get _really good at sex_ through a lot of practice and a lot of positive feedback.

we're both glad we waited because we were able to give ourselves to each other in a way that we never did to anyone else, and even though i don't believe there's any ""shame"" or whatever in having sex outside/before marriage, i also think there's nothing wrong for two committed partners to want to make that gift to each other. though on the whole that does end up kind of fetishizing virginal-ness and that _is_ a problem.

so i think it's something that can work if you're doing it for reasons that you and your partner both agree on, but fetishizing virginness is a bad thing.

as to what i would tell my children - well we can't have children (a permanent medical choice we made because of a lot of health stuff). but if i did, i think i'd present it to the kid as an option and say that if you want to wait, that's your choice, and going to your marriage bed a virgin doesn't make you a failure or doom you to A LIFETIME OF BAD SEX or whatever. you don't have to be a god in bed in order to make a partner stay with you - it all depends on the partner. Not having sex is a choice you and your partner can make, and there are some wonderful rewards like potentially increased intimacy and closeness. it's also not easy and you might miss out on a lot of prime fucking years.

(though i didn't date much in high school and i probably _would_ have fucked anyone who would have let me....i just didnt' have that many opportunities, and on the few that I did have, I'm glad i didn't take them. and fwiw, on the subject of needing to get all your sex practice out of the way so you can enter marriage with a black belt in Fucking, i'd much rather have someone in my bed with a similar level of experience rather htan trying to please a Jedi Sex Master or wahtever.)

also wife and i are politically very similar and always have been, so that part of op's story i have no experience with."

He asked for it to go in a paper bag, put it in his trunk, and tried to eat it this morning and it was stale.

"My uncle is a genius. Has an IQ of 154. He had serious problems. He would always talk down and look down to everyone. He was the youngest of 6 kids, who were all smart, and as a child would throw fits at dinner saying how no one would listen to him. Obviously his siblings didn't give a shit and were busy chowing down. In the end, he never really adjusted to life or kept a job because he didn't respect his bosses. I guess it's not the end and he's still alive, but his personality and brains has kept him from really reaching his abilities. "
"About 4 or 5 years ago, one of my good friends family moved into a new house which was on a big plot of open land. He had acres of land, and the area was rumored to be an Indian Burial Ground.

Of course being 18, all of my friends didn’t believe that type of stuff and there were no issues.

Well after about a month of living there, my friend started telling us about weird dreams he had... whatever, he’s crazy we thought. So he invites us to stay the night, and about 4 of us go to party and sleep there so we didn’t have to drive drunk: we all had the same exact dream that night we stayed that he described a week earlier.

Well we start to tell others at school, and this one girl wants to come during the day to check out the new place. We start telling her in broad day light about the weird things going on that we experienced.

Well he has a glass lamp on the ceiling, and a glass table right below it. My friend who lived there joked and said “if there are ghosts here, that glass light will fall through this table and shatter that glass one day, I know it.” And the girl says “I’d like to see that” and as soon as she finished her statement, the light falls out of the ceiling, hits the glass table, shatters both pieces of glass and broken glass is everywhere. We were speechless. It was about 4 in the afternoon and hotter and sunnier then all hell. 

Wtf. "

"Lol my bad on this one.

I was at an Italian restaurant with my buddy before going to watch WWE in London. We were at a table for two and the server lit a romantic candle in the middle of us, we looked at each other for an awkward second and put it out. "
"I was the worst story. Rented an air bnb with 2 men. One was a complete stranger. (Huge event going on, 2 friends backed out, and wanted to recoup some of the lost money. Really cool dude). Anyways, I was on my period. There was no garbage can in the bathroom. It was an open living space and I didnt want to walk out carrying bloody tampons in front of 2 men, particularly one I didnt know. Soooo, I found a plastic garbage bag and for 4 days, I kept the used products tied up in the bag inside the vanity. I intended to throw it away before we left. Weeeeelp, I got our check out date wrong. Came home to the air bnb owner cleaning and telling us to get out. I was so flustered and thrown off by having to get out a day ahead of schedule that I didnt think of my bathroom secret until after we left. So, that poor, poor soul found 4 days of a stranger's used tampons and pads underneath her sink tied in a Walmart bag. If you're reading this blonde woman from Philly, I am so, so sorry. "

It is also entirely free to play - to the joy of kids, parents, and broke college students everywhere. Average game price nowadays is $60."

Mom's friend stayed in sister's room, friend and I slept on the couch, and sister slept on the futon. Woke up the next morning and my sister announced to my friend and I that she ""rolled off the futon in her sleep and [her] nipples started bleeding""

She doesn't remember this at all but my friend and I talk about it all the time"

"There's a documentary out there made by ex-anti-nuclear energy activists who converted. My main selling point I'm hoping you might be able to expound on. Basically, when the Manhattan Project was figuring out how to do what it eventually did, the scientists were looking into many ways in order to achieve nuclear energy. They had one method, but stressed there were other ways. The higher ups only cared that they had one that blew up, and that *that* method is the scary/dangerous method. Another method was developed that recycled spent fuel and is much safer? "

"Pay attention to the teachers in Arizona. Steve Yarbrough (state senator) makes $150,000 off of running private schools, and another $50,000 for owning the real estate that they use.

While this doesn't have to do with chalk, the people running things did NOT go to those schools. They have no interest in making the schools better. They DO have interest in making things worse.

The people who came from that schools and spent at minimum 4 years in college to teach at that school are there because they want to make life better for the kids. They're educated, and crazy considering they have to work with 4 years of college while getting paid half of what the trash man makes. That's more altruistic than I'll ever become.

Edit: I should probably mention, that as a state senator he gets to make the rules that allow him to do this. 

Edit2: For extended reading feel free to read about the major push for privatizing schools."

"When I first started drinking I never knew what to order so my sister told me to get her college friend’s favorite drink, which was Malibu and Sprite. As a lifelong sugar addict I loved it. 

One night I ordered it at a bar and the bartender chuckled to himself a bit so I asked him why, he said he just learned the name of that drink but didn’t want to offend me. I said to let me have it; it’s called a High Maintenance White Bitch.

"""Well"" alcohol is the stuff they have in the well. It means they have a lot of it on hand and it's cheap(er). It's usually another less popular brand that's ""comparable"" like Jack Daniel's being the brand, but the well would be some other whiskey that they can get two bottles of for the price of Jack and differs from bar to bar. People don't order things like a whiskey and Coke at a bar they're not familiar with if they like Jack and Coke because they will get well whiskey and it might not taste good to them."

"“Nightmare”? That’s a pretty strong description. 

The same experience on the other hand, you show up early and have a chance to relax and catch up on emails or call a friend or family while you wait. Have a coffee or a beer if you like. 

Then you board the plane and get to relax for a few hours, listen to music, sleep, watch a movie, lose yourself in deep thought, or read a book uninterrupted. You can stare out the window and marvel at mountains, cities, lakes and oceans. You get to travel thousands of kilometers effortlessly while all that you have to do is sit in a chair. It’s not like they’re asking you to climb Everest or anything.

Security and customs are a hassle, but hey... just accept it. I fly about 30-50 flights per year and it’s not that bad. People act like it’s a torture session.

"&gt; Im hungarian and still dont know a lot about our own language, especially with our stupid rules with words and sentences

This is so relatable as a Swede. The ""younger generation"" now (the 30year olds and younger) mostly prefer english over swedish in many cases since swedish makes less sense and is less fluid or complicated. ""Swenglish"" is becoming more and more of a thing. If you hear 2 young people conversate casually in swedish you'll probably here 3-5 english words with perfect pronounciation being used within that convo as if it was part of the swedish lol.

We start studying english at 3rd grade (8-9 y.o), sometimes earlier. And by then the Swedish-courses are spelling and shit so the interest naturally sways over to English very very early. Add that nothing imported is dubbed and its at best subtitled.
