Doggos is worse
"Because the current understanding is that the brain is actually functioning correctly, it is just mismatched with the body. Turns out that guys get distressed when having female physical features such as breasts and being treated like a woman all the time, and women get distressed when their voice starts to deepen and they start growing thick facial hair. Given that trans men are men and trans women are women, they're hardly exceptions to this.

But don't take my word for it, organizations such as WHO, the APA, and AMA all no longer consider it a mental illness despite having once doing so. Which also seems to better align with the evolving understanding that gender identity appears to be biologically innate, and currently uncertain factors can cause it to be different than the rest of the body.

If you're going to disagree with the experts, then you should really consider what your ulterior motive is and why you're so set on it being a certain way that you think your view is more correct than the health experts who actually study it."
Lol I found a nerd that started his sentence with TIL. 
Why notto?

"Of course, that's just feeding into more stereotypes.  Why is it his future wife/spouse/partner going shopping, and not him going shopping?"
"They were banned automatically, you didn't have to unsub to play along."
Ikr..it's much more difficult than getting a bunch of upvotes. It's like getting viral in the other direction
"I think they have the technology to do it, but it isn't legal yet."
Because being transgender isn't a problem. Not having access to gender affirming healthcare and being subject to transphobia is
Bruh in on mobile 
Because just try and fucking stop me. 
No need to be so hostile buddy
"Ale isn't beer , its like calling whiskey a type of vodka."
Because the work is simple enough to not be worth that much.  That's why.  If it was worth more it would pay more.
Do something extreme
What exactly then do they do?
"Not wanting to have sex, is not a sexuality."
You just keep believing that... 
"hEy dOnT mAkE fUn oF tHe pReSiDeNt, tAkE yOuR dOwNvOtE aNd lEaVe"
"If you just gave that money to amputees, that wouldn't be a lot.

Plus you can give money only usable on the park itself."
"How about STFU.  It's how everybody else feels about it.

You won your revolution and we don't care.  You're G to everybody that doesn't give a shit either way.

How about you make your sexuality yours and not make it all of our job to give a fuck about you, because you surely don't give a fuck about us beyond everybody knowing an alphabet soup of people that now exist to: 1. Be gay 2. Be a dick about being gay."
"Why don't you just buy pants with pockets. They are literally everywhere. You feed the beast when you chose pants without pockets because they have a better fade pattern than the ones with functional pockets. 

I know a group of girls who wear jeans with pockets they use and the only reason I don't think more girls wear jeans like that is that the body outline looks odd with your pockets full. No one that complains about the pocket situation has ever given me a good reason they don't buy pants with regular pockets even though they exist. "
20% of the original users fall in your explanaition. 80% are just trying to use it to â€˜fit inâ€™ or reap karma.
"Wouldn't want to offend the gentle folk of reddit now would we? They're a quiet bunch. A soft bunch. Like sheep grazing through the fields of the internet, shitting everywhere they go. No, let's leave them be."
"Even considering inventory and logistics of the company? It's not just who wants to work with who or who has time, it's also do we need this many people at certain times of the day. What are the projected sales during certain times of the week according to past sales records. It would not be an easy task for a human to optimize that manually. May as well toss all the variables into a bin and let a ML algorithm optimise them. Could you hire a statistician, sure. But you could also hire someone who can run scikit-learn for far cheaper.

I might not be an expert, but I have used ML algorithms in real world tasks before."

"Kind of. In those examples it refers to a general (sometimes unkown) group of people however, or how a task is preformed the same way for everyone involved thereafter."
"I just think that a literal 0% implies a bias in critics, even if he is a con artist, I donâ€™t think that it is possible for any movie to have an actual serious 0% score."
"&gt;Are there ""straight jokes""

Yes but most of them are more hateful than joking for some reason. You can easily find them by browsing twitter.

"You'd be surprised how much actually internalizing that might help. So many people take life far too seriously. You're an ape on a space rock living for 70 or so years until you die, have some fun."
I know it's hard to understand other people might have a different view than you.
Sam Raimi's Spider-man trilogy is full of funny extras. Horrible movies though.
What are you talking about? He had the ride of his life.
"Not really considering there's more 10s &amp; face cards in a shoe than anything else. That's why you're always supposed to assume the dealers face down card is a 10. Obviously that's not always the case but more often than not, it is. So what you're saying is that everyone that follows basic strategy is wrong &amp; that it doesn't matter how you play...In my experience, that's not true at all. But you are a professional card counter so I guess you'd know more than anybody &amp; everybody else that plays ðŸ˜‰"

"I hope one day you grow up, remember this moment, and feel shame. Way to be edgy; you must feel so cool. "
"As a straight guy the reason I fetishize bi girls, is because of the possibilities. Like I personally get to enjoy two girls who also enjoy each other. If I were to have a threesome with two straight girls, they may not enjoy each other or agree to the event. I would want all of us to enjoy each other, but I am not into dudes, so the best for that situation is to have two bi girls. Frankly to a lot of guys, girl on girl action is hot. It is why lesbian porn is so popular. But that said I am not going to go into public and ask bi people to have a threesome with me, It will be in the back of my mind, but I don't treat people differently compared to what I think.  People are people."
Like Donald J. Trump
Because it is simply a great word. Doggo.

"But people are othered because of how they experience attraction, and the nature of attraction experiences impacts everyone within that community. How you experience attraction comes under who you are."

"Gender and sex aren't the same thing. 99.9% of people will be one of two biological sexes. A subset of those people will have a gender identity which isn't 'traditionally' associated with their biological sex.

Big air quotes around 'traditional' because the man/woman binary gender construct isn't as prevalent everywhere as it is in the west.

See, for example, [Hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia\)) and [Fa'afafine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine)

Edit: I see the salty bigoted bois have arrived. That's cool, you can downvote entirely factual information if you don't like it I suppose. Just remember to clean up after you've dribbled everywhere."

"Rich people use legal methods to save and grow their money, more at 11. Itâ€™s not news, everyone tries to save their money. Most of us just have less of it. "
"&gt; Chinese freedom.

That's a good oxymoron."
"I want justice.

Lmao better than being allowed to exist freely with no concern that someone will murder me because of my sexuality and gender? Wow. Such special treatment. "
people upvoting a hopeful message? fucking jerks
Broken bones.
"Yes.

Which is why it's difficult for y'all to use our slang. You don't quite know what it means. A stud is a black butch lesbian. "
"Why do lesbians use dick shaped, and not vagina shaped toys to masturbate?"

Don't do it. I hope you feel better fren.
Relax brotha 
How much weight of muscle can a woman really carry around?
"&gt;Sounds like you're working pretty hard to rationalize the risks you're forcing upon everyone you're sharing the road with...

Im not trying to rationalize anything. Everything I stated ai believe 100%.

&gt;Any amount of alcohol is going to begin slowing your reflexes and impairing your judgement (""I can make the turn before that car gets here..."").

If one is driving buzzed up, doing risky things like ""I can make the turn before that car gets here"" or ""I can make this light if I speed up"" is absolutely retarded. 

Knowing if you get pulled over, you're probably gettting a DUI or at the very least a field soberity test, waste of yours and the cops time, and a lecture.

Knowing all that, one should actually pay more attention and drive BETTER while buzzed. It's simple risk/reward."

"Homosexuals are 2% of the population and 96% of the criminals committing these

I personally identify as a pansexual lamp shade. 
Africa by Toto and any other cover of it. It was bad when it came out and time has not made it any better. I don't care that Weezer covered it. They did a bad song no justice.

Haha bullshit
"There is an army of highly skilled and hardworking guys, the EXTREME majority of them are making less than beer money.

I used to watch Starcraft2 on twitch. There would be several guys at the top who obviously dedicated their lives to this game and also had the raw talent that no amount of hard work can substitute for, and interspersed would be a girl in silver league. Every single girl would have a face cam bigger than every single guy too. It's sickening to see that level of priviledge."
"Furry may have been my own bias, but glorifying being unhealthy in pornography seems immoral to me personally e.g. fat porn. "
Yes it is. You shouldn't be mooching from others to pay your bills. Get up and take literally any of the other jobs in this thread that aren't reliant on tips.
"Was there a line of traffic behind you? If it was just you two and he indicated he wanted to go faster why not just pull to the side a bit and let him? Then you can both drive the speed you want and everyone wins. 

Unless he was aggressive about it you are the asshole in this situation. Indicating you want to go faster than someone else does not make him an asshole though."
