"&gt; Doctors are complete idiots when it comes to computers

Used to work IT at a hospital. Can confirm. "

UNICORN ALERT"
"I once had a user drive a screw driver through the screen of his laptop in an attempt to get bumped up the list for a new one. I pulled his HDD out, slapped it into another PC of the same make/model and then waited three days to give it back to him. I told he was now at the end of the list and if anything happened to this asset, I would report that and the obviously intentional damage to the replaced laptop to HR."
"\*BLINK*

as an administrative assistant with better than 25 years' experience, i have to ask...

how... in the ever loving fuck... did this twit *fresh out of college* get hired as an admin TO A GODDAMN VP??

not only that, how the HELL do you manage to graduate college *in this day and age* without knowing how to send AN EMAIL?

yes macs are a different platform than PCs.  back in the day i was fluent in both.  but even though the OS's are different, the procedures are EXACTLY the same.

these are the people that simultaneously give my profession a bad name AND make me look like a goddamn goddess."
We had one throw a laptop into the ocean because it wasn’t fast enough or the beach signal wasn’t good enough
"That grad student is going to come into the lab someday screaming ""What the hell happened to my partition?  All my research was on that!!!"""
"If his brain is locked, he won't hear you."
"""Well yes I store my data in &lt;cryptic file format&gt; because it's the only one that works with &lt;discontinued program from 2005&gt; !"""
"&gt;  I went back and checked his password to expire and set the maximum pw age to 30 instead of 90.

unfortunately, in a month's time he will call back and yell at the next poor schmuck about his password needs to be reset.

but yeah, what an ass. (him, not you)

edit: clarification of who the 'ass' is"
“Your lack of planning is not my emergency.”
"Her browser was logged into her Google account.  I think she equated Gmail's web interface with email, and had no idea how to use an actual email client like Outlook or Thunderbird.

FWIW, she's no longer with the company.  The company graciously kept her around for about a month.  She had called in several other times about real rudimentary tasks, and not just with computers."
This comment made me shudder. I love when a user is put in their place.
Someone lied on their resume 
All the problem users are always 'competent' in IT.
"Some personal examples of doctors being morons:

Why can't I RDP in like before?

Why do we need to change our passwords? I've been using mine for over a decade!

Here is every server and tape backup we have ever used. (Sitting in an unlocked closet in the waiting room)

The antivirus was slowing my computer down so I uninstalled it. 

My printer won't print and I don't know why. (Printer is displaying ""paper jam"")

Can you pull my data off this hard drive? It keeps clicking and it has the only copy of every photo I've taken in it. 

"
"What's a strategy for pulling people away from the ""not working"" ticket mindset? Getting real tired of bouncing emails just to make a ticket."
Why spend his money when he can waste yours instead?
Every. Accounting. Software. Ever.
I still think it sucks that they don't just include a cable.
"I've been working hospital IT for several years.  I can almost guarantee nothing will happen to said doctor.  Hell, the tech will likely be told to just retire the laptop and reimage it for the doctors son.  He may even be tasked with setting up any extra software the soon might ""need"" before delivering it.

We have a Dr who just got his 6th laptop THIS YEAR!  He straight up doesn't know where some of them went.  Others he acknowledged that his family members are using."
"How can people lack such basic skills with a piece of equipment they use *basically every day?* You don't need to know how to memory dump or analyse a stuck thread, just learn the basic shit like opening Microsoft Word, or turning the computer on first. "
Holy shit 2011 was 7 years ago 
"unfortunately, despite being a man, yes"
"""A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part"".


Was just saying this at work a few days ago."
"Sounds like the most technically advanced item they should use is a spork or foon.

RwP"
"This actually pisses me off, I have legitimate technical qualifications yet it took me two years to find a job like that. And I had to work at Amazon in the meantime."
Begs the question why the department head doctor can't afford his son a new computer
"For sure, this; and we have a less than stellar HR department"
All reasonable cables should be included- totally agree here. 
"Simple; if you report 'thing is not working' I'm not working either. At least until they answer the inevitable followup questions. I don't care how high their priority is, if my end users don't give me the information I need until I ask, I will wait until they answer. I have the luxury of running my own support department though.

Back when I was in the trenches it was very difficult to get people to tell you what's wrong the first time around. I found that places that had a web form that specifically asked for error information and screenshots (and didn't let a user submit a ticket without those fields being filled out) were significantly better at serving up the right information."
"Classic case of PEBKAC, rather than anything else."
"""Your urgency is not my emergency"" is how I always heard it."
"&gt;Users

Well, I worked for the college repair shop and I have to say that it seems that 95+% of people are not even qualified to use a computer."
"Made me shudder too, because he didn't get what he wanted but he did get away with it to a tragic degree."
I belive it's Ctrl + Alt + &lt;arrow keys&gt; to rotate screen
"""printer not working every day"" -- in this sentence ""printer"" means ""the person who prints (for me)"" and the issue is that he is not working every day??"
"On the plus side, looks like you’ve a good CTO."
"Hey, I'm going through something similar with a client's machine right now! 

Somehow it got partitioned for two partitions: One for OS, one for data. 

The issue is that the OS partition was sized *just* large enough for the OS, causing huge amounts of slowdown as the client forgot about the data partition. 

Data partition is also full. 

Users gonna use."
"When I worked for a 3rd party contractor here in the UK who did AOL, BT and Freeserve tech support in the early 2000s we had something like this.

AOL stated as part of the contract they wanted an average call time of less than 10 minutes unless it was a senior tech calling the user back, pretty hard when most people who ring in take half this just to give account details. Anyone over 20 minutes was often called into extra training or manager one to ones. Fun place to work but brutal targets and managers if I'm honest and the staff was a mix of student, semi retired people and genuine IT techs starting their careers or guys with a lot of experience using the job as stop gap.

One guy who often sat near me on the same shifts would consistently get under 7 minutes every month which was pretty good as he was newish to IT and would need to follow screen prompts or ask senior techs a lot of questions. Every month the top 3 people would get a bonus or shopping vouchers. He started to become a top 3 guy after only a few months, this went on for about a year before he was found out.

It turned out this person was actually dropping calls at least 7 or 8 times a day. This was easily spotted once someone logged into the phone system as admin. Ironically this particular person has flagged to one of the shift managers his phone was dropping calls... which I still don't understand to this day why he reported this. The phone system was intelligent enough to spot user dropped calls or calls that had just been lost."
I'm sure this has happened for him before and it only took 2 minutes. I'm not familiar with this client so I didn't know their pw complexity reqs. I'm sure everyone else already knows about their pw's so he won't be much more troublesome than anyone else when he does callback in the future 
The laptops at the library I used to work at had WiFi switches. Fuck those. They were either on the front of the keyboard or the side and both were easy as hell to accidently hit. I couldnt even blame people when they came up asking if the wifi was working. Who thinks that button is a good idea??
"If you really want to have you mind blown. 2010 was 8 years ago. 

boom."
ERROR 404: BRAIN LOCKED. PLEASE TALK TO AN ADMIN THEN TRY AGAIN.
"Sounds like the all-too-common use of ""FruitPhone"" as a catch-all term for any and every smartphone. What burns me up is when you try to correct that behavior and they give you ""oh you know what I mean!"" and continue to do it. That's usually when I get obtuse and give them instructions that only work for FruitPhone and when they say it doesn't work I tell them ""well the instructions are totally different if it's not actually a FruitPhone *but you know what I mean*""."
"Even worse, remote user laptop on boot: 

**There are no logon servers available to service the logon request.**

You're bringing that damn thing onsite to re authenticate with the server, no work around."
Don't worry I once couldn't figure out why a computer was overheating till I took it apart again and saw that I didn't plug in the water pump...
"High school friend, he wasn't the best developer but even at early ages he was a hardware guru and a charismatic personality. I envy that he earns more than I do but heh, he deserves it.

I'm from a newly developing country. 95% of all projects I join are by personal reference."
Terrible metrics will say little and encourage terrible behaviour. 
"sounds like the executives feel like their above the help desk almost like you need a separate VIP help desk number that goes directly to a ""special help desk"" made up of ""available qualified help desk associates trained to assist in a highly efficient, discretionary, and scheduling aware manner"""
