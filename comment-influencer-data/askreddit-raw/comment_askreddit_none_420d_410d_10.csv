30,"My son inhaled meconium at birth and had to be resuscitated.  I didn't even get to hold him for hours after he was born and I couldn't even be in the same room with him because I was bleeding so badly I wasn't allowed to get out of the bed and he had to be taken elsewhere.

We both had to be transferred to another hospital, a better one.  It was an hour ambulance ride and we had to take separate ambulances.  After that it was another hour before I got to see him.  In all, six hours went by before I got to hold my son.

He ended up being fine.  He's healthy, happy, and meets all his milestones early.  He's two now and he's a joy to be around.  I'm so thankful for his doctors and nurses."

34,"Im an AEMT, but work in a retirement community (better pay in my area), and it's company policy that we not provide CPR, with or without a DNR order. I guess they opted out of CPR training for the whole facility, and it bothers me so much. I have all this training and I can't do anything, but stand and watch because I'm so restricted with what I can do.  In all honesty though, I'd rather save someone's life and do CPR per their wishes and lose my job, than live with the guilt that I stood there and did nothing if they want to be resuscitated. "

39,"Yep. As much as I find it cute that my name is the one my mom had in mind for her first baby since childhood, it's very strange to think that she was pregnant with another [Name] before me who didn't make it. "

41,"Rehabilitation sort of implies that the person is rehabilitated. If someone commits a violent crime, is ""rehabilitated"" and then commits the same crime after they are let out, maybe it's time to give up on rehabilitation for that individual.  Part of the point of prison is to keep people, who have proven themselves dangerous, away from society."
42,That's a very bold statement.
43,"Prisons do not need to be either rehabilitation or disablement.  They can, and do, serve multiple purposes.  Rehabilitation should always be a goal; however, society should not be made to suffer multiple failed attempts at rehabilitation.  

&gt; Think of it as a hospital, with infectious patients, you are there to isolate them from the general population while treating them but you are not supposed to keep them there forever.

With some diseases, yes, you do.  If a person has a fatal, communicable, disease they are quarantined and kept comfortable until they die.  Often studied as well, to help better understand that disease and maybe cure it in the future.  It's not a nice thing to do to someone who is there from no fault of their own; but, it is done.  The analogy also breaks down in that a violent criminal isn't without fault.  You don't contract murder/rape or the like.  Those happen because of choices.  It may be that the criminal was affected by a chemical imbalance, drugs or something else which created a temporary and treatable condition.  And this is why we have rehabilitation.  But, if someone shows a repeated pattern of making that set of choices, they need to be quarantined from society.  It should be done in a humane way; but, society should not be required to accept the consequences of a serial problem."

54,"Sometimes in life, even at work, we need to handle situations the best way we know how so that we can have a rest-of-the-day that is successful. If that means separating emotionally from a situation, I get it. 

Although if I think about applying this reminder to a particular nurse I dealt with when my mom died of an overdose, it‚Äôs more difficult to try to give the nurse the benefit of the doubt. My mom was treated like she was something other than a human being with feelings. Her drug abuse lifestyle was judged and the nurse let that judgment dictate how she treated my mom and her family. It lasted until the final call, ‚ÄúYeah, your mom just died. *click*‚Äù  It was a horrible experience. Heartbreaking to say the least. "
55,"Please consider quitting! My friend quit and has a neat app that shows him how much money he has saved. He's also more fit and can go out dancing all night. A lot of good changes in his life have come from quitting. But for him, quitting is a daily choice. "

60,"My uncle was diagnosed with stage 1 pancreatic cancer last Friday. The doctor said that life expectancy past 5 years is 8%. Fuck.

61,"Flinching.  It's been 25 years since my husband died from an ascending aortic aneurysm.   He was 43.  We didn't know beforehand that he had Marfan's syndrome. (His surgeon told me that a significant percentage of Marfan's patients aren't diagnosed until death.)  After his death, his siblings were tested.  Fortunately neither of them seemed to have it, and fortunately we had no children.  I wonder if standard medicine practices have gotten any better about catching unusual stuff like this quicker.  On the other hand, he would have hated living as a semi-invalid, and we did so many wonderful backpacking trips.  Really, it's a wonder he lived as long as he did.  

Any way, thank you for your work."

66,"I've mentioned this before... Weasleys' poverty does not make sense.

They have a house, *Arthur has a government job* and the spells make repairing broken items easy. Yet somehow they can't make ends meet - yet they have a large, mostly empty vault at Gringotts.

The only explanation I have come up with is that the Weasleys got robbed before the story starts. Apparently they needed lots of gold, perhaps for a new house. Arthur and Molly go to Gringotts, withdraw the gold and once outside they get imperiused and memory charmed.

The perpetrator is never caught.

----
Edit: I just realized there's another possibility.

Arthur spends all his time, energy and family money on buying useless muggle artefacts. He could keep Molly in line by periodically Confounding her when she starts to question about the family's financial status."
67,I'm so sorry you had to endure that. 
68,Hyrule
69,Yeah I agree. It was her only child and a ‚Äúmiracle baby‚Äù at that as my aunt was told she couldn‚Äôt conceive. The two of them were suuuper close.

70,"I think humor in times of death is a gift. It‚Äôs not for everybody, but, when you can have that outlook before you go, for those who are left behind and can look back and laugh in some way, it helps you heal. And remembering that person with laughs instead of tears for the most part is amazing. "
71,"That‚Äôs pretty dark. I mean even past kids age you might find someone else etc. Ok my dad won‚Äôt because as far as his concerned my mum was the love of his life. Idk, would just be weird if someone in their 30s had that mindset, you know?

77,"I‚Äôve been a PD for 5 1/2 years, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúa lot of them are horrible.‚Äù A lot of us get burned out, if you‚Äôve never done it you have no idea what the abuse from clients and their families can be like, not to mention condescending judges and arrogant prosecutors.

That said, I will agree that a lot of times private defense attorneys come in and make things worse than they have to be because they need to put on a show for the client who paid them $20,000 for a case everyone knows will end up with some kind of plea. 

Regardless of the type of law we‚Äôre talking about though, clients almost never have the knowledge to accurately assess the competence of their attorney‚Äôs work on their case. I think criminal cases in particular are kind of like baseball games, and managers. I think most baseball games are decided by the skill of the players, maybe 10-15 times a season a manager‚Äôs actions will have a direct impact on the outcome but it‚Äôs almost always the talent on the field. Same with a typical criminal case. Its outcome is going to be based, far more often than not, on facts that can‚Äôt be changed. "
78,"I wish people found it acceptable to be friends with others who DON'T share interests with them. It's enriching to know people with their separate hobbies and interests. The thing about college is that you're forced to interact with randos. I' wish there was a way to just sort of make yourself hang out with people. friendships could blossom.

Like I have few interests in common with most of my adult friends. But I love hearing from my shopaholic friend or my farmer friend, or my sjw friend, or the one who's into biking. I love science fiction and few of my friends share that interest. Although it's cool to have friends who do, of course. "

For her not to do them would be like him not going to work. To him, this errand would have been embarrassing for him, because it would indicate that he's at home doing his wife's job all the time.

For me, I'd be embarrassed not to do this. I go grocery shopping, I cook, I clean. I'd be embarrassed if I didn't contribute in those ways, because it's both me and my wife's job. 

But I'd say my dad came up in a weird generation where all these things changed pretty fast. So those guys I think have a little more of a tricky situation because among their peers maybe you look pathetic if you do it, maybe you look pathetic if you don't."

114,"Be patient. Sometimes ""the dog ate my homework"" means I had a horrible anxiety attack/I'm in a low mood swing or even I had to fight off suicidal thoughts all night and got nothing done. Trust me, kids know when and how they mess up. No kid with depression is going to feel good about getting nothing done,  and it's not on purpose. So maybe be understanding and give a kid another day to make something up, keep them after class and make sure they're getting the help they need even if they aren't asking for it. You might be the only teacher -or adult- to make a difference in a kids whole week but it's important that you do it. I also think it's important to remember that you can help people with mental illnesses without ever actually bringing up their feelings. You don't have to ask what's bothering them ever time, sometimes a friendly ""how ya doing today"" or ""hey really loved that last essay, keep it up"" is enough. "

116,"Ugh. That's why we don't have a clean your plate rule in our home. Kids have to try at least one bite of most things to get used to it but we don't make it a battle. We also always ask how much of each thing they want. It gives them some control that way.

My husband grew up in a strict ""you must clean your plate"" home. He still thinks that is why he struggles with weight. I grew up in a laid back ""you don't like it? This is what we are having. Go make yourself a sandwich"" which means it took me years to try new foods. I'm hoping our kids eat less but are more adventurous with food younger :P"

123,"Obligitory *not a landlord* but my husband used to do general handyman shit for a former landlord...in our rural trailer park...so with that said: there was this one couple who were always having the cops show up or ambulances when either of the adults would OD. so after a year or so of this and lots of missed rent our landlord had ebough and started an eviction process that (because of some legal stupidity and loopholes) took almost another entire year. Because this degenerate couple had kids so the landlord couldn't legally just throw them out until winter was over. 

Well during the winter since they knew they were getting totally evicted once the snow was gone, I guess they decided to just royally fuck shit up. 

They didn't take their trash outside for about 3 months. They hoarded it up into a small bedroom and made their kids sleep in the living room instead. Then when we went to see the damage when they finally left we saw that they had allowed or instructed thier kids to help them destroy that trailer 

Holes in walls. Trash everywhere. The toilet was clogged and then kicked off the wall so it was leaking everywhere. They unhooked the washer and turned it in too and soaked the floor so much that it had to be replaced. They used bb guns to shoot out every single window. The kids peeled most of the wallpaper off and drew all over with what I hope was paint and not blood or mud. The fridge was unplugged but still full of rotting food.

159,"I work in a creche (kids from age 0 to 3) and during the settling-in period one mother went to our employers to complain about a bunch of things:

1. The kids would play with water in the bathroom, even though the bathroom should only be used for washing your hands or going to the toilet. 
2. The kids drink out of eachothers cups, eat from eachothers plates and use their hands to eat, which was unacceptable for them.
3. Their child would be seperated from the other children, which is why he has no friends. (He is 1,6 years old)
4. Children in our group would cry too much, because we are incapable of childcaring. 

There have not been any consequences like disciplinary measures against us, because all of the above are a normal part of our daily Work:

1. Water is a great element to encourage playful learning and anxiety free contact with bathroom activities. 

2. Kids learn eating, drinking and sharing by doing these things on their own.

3. Seperation happened several times in front of the Patents because he hurt others. After a short time he was always able to return. Also: Kids do not have regular friends at that age.

4.I don't know If any of you have been around children, but they cry. A lot. And most of the times nothing can be done about it.

In the end we just learned that these parents have no clue how children or our facility operate. They believe parenting just means to protect your child from everything and to make it happy all the time. They never learned, that letting go and accepting negative feelings is a big part of the job too.

Now we try to explain everything we do. I guess these kinds of parents are often riddled with fear and guilt, maybe frustration over their own inability to satisfy their child. It's our job to show them, that it's okay to ask for Help.

She learned that if you are bigger than the other creature you can exhert violence on it to enforce your will. She learned that the greatest pain she's ever felt in her short life came from a person that promises to protect her.

I don't think it's a coincidence that my parents adjusted my behavior with violence and that when I entered school I tried to adjust other students behavior with violence. I also don't think it's a coincidence that people who were ""physically corrected"" as children tend to have extreme distrust of authority as adults.

Spanking damages children and only exists to facilitate lazy parenting.

If you can provide some compelling information that suggests that violent discipline is good for anybody other than lazy, angry parents then I'd be very interested to hear it."

The first guy wishes for a billion dollars

The second guy thinks, hmm I can do better than that, and wishes to get a billion dollars every year

The third guy thinks it over and makes his wish, ""I want my left arm to spin clockwise forever.""

For the second round of wishes, the first guy wishes for a hot wife, the second guy outdoes him and wishes for good looks and charisma to get any girl he wants, and the third guys makes his wish saying this time he wants his right arm to spin counter-clockwise forever. They all get their wishes, the two of them have banknotes and beautiful features or wives, and both of the third guy's arms are spinning nonstop.

Now it's the third and final round of wishes. The genie warns them all, ""Think carefully, this one's important."" The first guy wishes for good health for the rest of his life. poof, his wish is granted. The second guy says, ""I wish to never age another day in my life"" poof, his wish is granted. It's the third guy's turn for his last wish, he says, ""I want my head to bob up and down forever."" poof his head starts bobbing up and down non-stop. 

The three guys part ways. Two years later they all meet up again. The first guy says, ""It's been great, I invested most of my billion and I'll never have to work again. I've still got my hot wife here, and I haven't gotten so much as a cold."" The second guy says, ""Same, it's been great! I've got more money than any person in the world could dream of having, and I can get any girl I want all the time, your beautiful wife's great by the way! And I haven't aged so much as a day this whole time!"" Then they turn to the third guy. His left arm is still rotating clockwise, and his right arm is still rotating counter-clockwise. His head's still bobbing up and down. And he says, ""Guys, I think I fucked up."""

212,"Haha, it was more of an example. If you want to play around with game development I highly suggest just downloading an engine and start messing around, answering the questions that pop up in your head by googling.

Download Unity if you wanna learn programming, GameMaker if you are more interested in making something playable fast.

There's plenty of beginners series on YouTube, and quite a few books to read.

If you're feeling really serious and enjoy reading, [here's a study path tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miloyip/game-programmer/master/game-programmer.jpg)

Many programmers will disagree with me, but I highly suggest picking up C# if you want to learn programming, since Unity is perfect for learning the basics with fast visual results rather than ""pick your path"" text adventures in the console. If you want to learn about lower level stuffs after you are familiar with the basics of programming, you can get into C++ and Unreal.

236,"Do you have any source to back that up? I looked online but couldn't find any stats of that nature. It sounds a little misleading to me to be honest. The 1980s was a whole decade where we went from barely any understanding of the disease to a pretty good idea of what we were up against. It it also went from not too prevalent to a practical epidemic in that same time period so depending on what year you check the infection rates it would make perfect sense that a mostly desert landlocked state wouldn't have as many infection as, say, the coast states.

Even today there are only 20 something legal brothels in the entire state. Although I am not a statistician I am going to go out on a limb here and say that that the amount of sex going on in these brothels probably had barely any impact on the HIV infection rate of the general population. 

You might be thinking of a 1987 CDC study of HIV infection rates specifically in prostitutes. In this study it is true that infection rates for Nevada were lowest at 0 reported cases however it wasn't ""by far lowest"" since 3 other major cities all reported only 1 case of a positive HIV infection.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/03/27/aids-infection-found-in-11-of-us-prostitutes/ee479c20-cf9a-4f53-a14e-80b8e136e96e/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f79c9fa427b0
 
I would also like to point out that only in 1988 did Nevada require by law that prostitutes be tested for HIV and only in 1986 were they even required to wear condoms. This was after the initial major outbreaks. Throughout most of the decade it was presumed by most people that only homosexuals had a risk of getting the disease so before 1986 many prostitutes reported only requiring condoms in about half of their encounters. 

Lastly I just want to say that I do support the legalization of prostitution and that regulations in testing is a perfectly valid reason in support of it."

282,"SPOILERS

your son is the leader of a faction known as the Institute, the descendants of students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who survived the nuclear apocalypse by digging into their basement. 

They created humanoid robots called synths which are I distinguishable from human beings but in order to do that they needed a sample of human dna that was uncorrupted by the radiation of the nukes. The player character and the son were cryogenically frozen in a vault before the war and the game starts when the institute sends a mercanary to extract your son and he kills your spouse in the process and refreezes you.

Several more decades pass as you are trapped on ice and your son becomes the genetic father of all synthkind. He is now referred to as Father in game. Father grows old and wonders about you and orders you to be freed which starts the game for the player character.

You escape the vault and spend the game looking for any leads to finding your son. Along the way you learn about how synths are made to resemble actual people, kill them, then steal their identity to control society from the shadows. Along the way you meet and possibly join different factions who have different opinions on whether synths are people who need to be saved or just machines which either need to be used or destroyed.

Eventually you find a way to infiltrate the institute and rather than kill you on sight an old man comes up to you and tells you he is your son. It is possible to kill him before he is able to say any of this though and escape from the institute. You are still able to finish the game by following the quests given to you by the other factions, ultimately choosing one and destroying the morally opposite factions, including the institute.

Should you not kill your son he will explain to you that he and by extension you are the progenitors of all synths which are machines to be used in making the wasteland a better place. Their goal is to replace key leaders with synths to try and make peace between warring tribes of survivors.

Honestly every faction makes a pretty good arguement for why they're right, and each faction still has a lot of shady things they've done in the past and still do which makes siding with any of them an interesting moral dilemma."

Due to the nature of things, I can't go into too much detail, but he was falsely accused of sexual abuse from an employee who was trying to get out of being reprimanded for something she MAJORLY screwed up.  His boss jumped on it quickly and assumed the girl was telling the truth.  His overreaction was obvious pretty quickly, and the state's attorney dropped all charges.  The girl's boyfriend even came forward with proof that the allegations were made up.  Dad chose not to pursue anything against her because he is a very public figure and was afraid of the allegations, as false as they were, of hurting his reputation and relationships.  
  
In the end, Dad still lost his job.  He was three years away from retirement and is now looking for something.  The employer is afraid of the girl, so she's running around doing whatever she wants now and has caused all kinds of damage to the organization.  The town's rumor mill is still churning, and people say all kinds of things.  This whole thing has been incredibly stressful on him which has caused physical repercussions.  I'm struggling hard with not downright hating the girl and Dad's boss.  The board sees clearly what the boss screwed up with this, and I do think the boss's days are numbered, but that doesn't give Dad back his job or financial security.  My parents are now looking at moving to another town.  They ran a charitable organization on the side and were planning to transition it to someone else's holding.  They're afraid now that it's going to look like this is a result of the scandal.  It's pretty heartbreaking for the family.  "

450,It has. We used to like her more in high school because we could throw parties and she didn't care. Now that were older we realized she never was a responsible adult. My dad lives in San Diego now but I still see him more than my mom who lives in the same city. She cancels plans I make with her and avoids us. There's no real relationship now.

468,"My cousin started out, then somehow, magically caught the upwind and is now doing very well.

Was in trade school, ditched that to become a chef. Because the trade school wouldn't give him the necessary free time to play in his band. Finished culinary school but never took the exam, because it was on the same date where they'd booked a sound studio to record their first album. Ran around a couple of years working minimum wage as bouncer/barkeeper while trying to have the big breakthrough with his (somewhat mediocre) band. Finally, somehow he's become the nightshift manager at the bar, still trying to make it big with the band. But now he's got some cash to buy gear: lights and boxes and all that. He starts lending that gears to acquaintances for their stage.  


Today he owns a comany that rents lights and sound gear for concerts and is a known and active member of the cultural scene in his city. "

He still sent the money anyway.

And $2501 is the amount for grand theft, so these guys stayed one dollar shy of a felony."

475,"Friend bought a house with a detached garage unit a while back. 

Sellers were a couple about 30ish that had been gifted the house (which had belonged to a relative of the husband) and had two kids. They had a tenant in the unit so they had rental income. Building a new home in Las Vegas. 

Wife was heavily into LuLaRoe. we did some internet stalking and she did regular videos where she had TONS of merchandise behind her. 

I'm fairly certain but cant prove that they were cashing out the difference in house prices between their high COL area and the low COL area to sink into LuLaRoe. My friend said the husband looked dead inside. "

482,"I feel I should mention how much livestock have been inbred for 'production' traits to the neglect of their welfare.

Broiler chickens, for example, grow so fast that their bodies give out if they're kept any longer than their slaughter age. 

Many commercial turkey breeds cannot reproduce without artificial insemination. 

Pigs' immune systems and homeostasis mechanisms are such crap that they have to be kept in climate-controlled biosecure enclosures or they'll get deathly sick. 

Sheep, having been bred to never shed wool like their wild ancestors, go blind if not shorn regularly, and the wool grows so thick around their butts that they piss and shit all over themselves, attracting flies which eat and decay the flesh so badly that farmers have to preemptively cut the skin off to keep it from happening in some climates.

And dairy cattle, in addition to making so much milk that they get osteoporosis, have been bred to get rid of their mothering instinct so there's less stress when their children are separated from them at birth. We've bred an animal to *grieve less for its stolen children*, people."

I fade in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it‚Äôs futile. The song plays. I‚Äôm crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help me. I curl up on the floor. There‚Äôs nothing I can do now. And then it happens. The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it‚Äôs finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself.

504,"I met this guy at a conference, and from the beginning there was something about him I didn't like. He seemed friendly enough, and everyone else got along with him, so I thought I was just fooling myself. 

As the night went on my initial feelings went from, ""I don't like this guy"" to this ""this guy creeps me the fuck out"". I didn't even want to shake his hand. He offered to give my female friend a ride home, and I practically begged her to let me take her home even though it was a four hour round trip and I was staying an additional day at the conference. She declined, and I couldn't exactly say that there was something off about the guy that worried me. 

So my female friend left with the guy. As they are leaving, I didn't allow my wife (then girlfriend) to touch the guy. I didn't shake his hand. She got pretty upset with me, and everyone stared at me like I had an arm growing out of my forehead. Everyone liked him and thought he was nice and friendly. 

I begged my friend once again to no avail and just told her to call me once she got home safe. A couple hours later she calls me and I can sleep soundly. 

Fast forward not even a couple weeks and that guy gets busted for child porn on not only his home computer, but several of his work's computers. I felt sad, but vindicated. I'm still not sure what made me feel uneasy. My friends and wife said they wished I spoke up. What the hell was I going to say? ""Hey everyone, this guy you think is friendly creeps me the fuck out!"" I haven't stopped listening to my gut instincts since. "
505,This makes me so angry. I have a friend who takes 20 minutes to tell me a story that could easily be told in 5. By the end I don't even care anymore because I forget what the point of the story is and had to listen to every single extra detail she could think of.

592,"Back in my senior year of high school (about 5 years now) a friend of mine had told me about this bridge near our hometown called Satan's Bridge. It's notoriety started with a man who hung himself there and haunts the area. Apparently a lot of satanic sacrifices were also being done there. People found dead animal carcasses with pentagrams underneath the bridge. Along with that, their have been sightings of hooded figures roaming the woods there.

Anyway, many supernatural things occur their and my friend told me about what happened to some people who went to our school. It was three upperclassmen who decided go to the bridge to see what it was all about. Now the road the bridge is on is called Berry Hill Rd. and it is PITCH black. It's easy to lose your signal there and is an extremely wooded road. You have a breakdown their at night, good luck. The bridge itself is built over a fairly large river and has been heavily graffitied over the years.

Now apparently what happened was they decided to park their car on the bridge itself and got out to look around. One of them looked down to the river and could see a black shadowy figure walk along on the shore. He pointed it out and everyone could see it. They immediately got back in the car and drove away. Now apparently the guy in the passenger seen began acting funny and kept staring at the guy in the back seat through the rear-view mirror. The guy in back asked why he kept looking at him, and the passenger said their was a old lady sitting beside him staring at him. The driver and and back seat rider were both spooked like hell. At some point during the ride after that, the passenger tried to grab a knife that was in the center console, but luckily the driver grabbed it before he could get to it. He said he wanted to kill the lady and after that he was pretty quiet.

They drove to to a friend's house and shit got weirder. When they went upstairs, apparently everyone could see the lady in one of the windows staring at them. Not long after, the passenger from before began spazzing out and spoke in some other language for 10 minutes straight. It took everyone to hold him down, and when he came to he couldn't remember anything at all.

So fast forward to my friend currently telling me this story. We get the stupid idea to head over there to check it out. Around 1 am on a cold February night, we got there and parked right before the bridge. I brought my camera with me and we walked to it. Like I said before, the road is wooded. So it was pitch black when we got out, but as soon as we stepped onto the bridge, you could see everything, even the fog coming off of your breath if you exhaled hard enough. It was a full moon that night. I went ahead and started taking pictures with my flash on. At first it nothing was showing up. I took pictures constantly and then suddenly orbs began showing up. Some at first, then none at all, and then a lot. It was very inconsistent. At one point my friend said he didn't want to be there anymore and wanted head back. I said ""okay, just let me take one more."" Took a shot, lots of orbs. He said ""alright man, enough."" As soon as he said that I took another, nothing. Getting irritated, I immediately took another and then just stared into my camera's screen without saying anything.

I then looked at him and showed him what I caught: (https://imgur.com/F8v9MoE)

We sprinted back to the car and got the HELL out of there. I was constantly reminding myself not to look in the rear view mirror because of the story he told me. I've always been one to be more on the skeptical side even though I believe and have seen ghosts, because you can make yourself believe you saw something paranormal when in fact something logical happened. At first I though it could be fog from our breath since it was cold and we spoke right before the shot, but our breath never showed up in any of my other pictures before. On top of that, you had to exhale hard to see it well enough that night by eye and we couldn't make a cloud that freaking big.

The other thing... It was February and cold as hell. I was thinking that the orbs could be bugs, but no bugs are alive during that time of year in my hometown. The orbs were also inconsistent when showing up (average picture taking was something like 5 seconds).

Since then I haven't been to the bridge and never will. I know this sounds corny, but there is a lot of evil you can feel there..."
593,"This is getting buried and wayyy late to the party but this one is for you OP. Early 2000s, my sister told my brother and I to come in her room because she was seeing 'orbs'. She kept pointing them out but my brother and I could not see anything. She took a disposable picture and then went back to pointing out the orbs. A few minutes go by and all of a sudden she screams and runs out the room leaving my brother and I. Supposedly, she saw one of her stuffed animals head move. Got the picture developed and this is what we go back. https://imgur.com/WBNgS1w

If you haven't noticed, there aren't too many wolves, bear and wildcat around in the US anymore. Those were the main predators on species like deer. Without their natural predators, and with humans continually moving into their habitats, deer populations are starting to crash due to overpopulation. More and more deer are dying from starvation and malnutrition, the environment is getting damaged due to overbrowsing, and more and more people are getting killed due to deer/car collisions.

Humans \*have\* to replace other predators, or the ecosystem suffers. So, your saying that ""nobody has to hunt in this day and age"" betrays a lack of fundamental understanding of how ecosystems work.

It's not animal cruelty when a snake catches a mouse, anymore than it is animal cruelty when a wild wolf in a natural habitat dies of hunger. That's just how it's supposed to go sometimes. It is animal cruelty when you deny a wild animal its natural impulses because it seems cute to you."
637,"First, the *claim* is that there's more money spent on advertising than *research*, which is a different thing. But it does help to point out how misleading that claim is because:



1. Large pharma companies do less and less research these days, but the ""development"" part (aka clinical trials) is where the real cost is.





2. When you say ""advertising"" people think ""direct to consumer"" (eg tv ads, magazine ads, etc) when in reality the large majority of that money goes to doctor education (ie pharma reps), which is hugely necessary because if you're an oncologist and 20 new drugs came out last year it's going to be hard for you to keep up enough on your own to make informed decisions.

So we were friends there for like 2ish years, it fell apart, and we moved with about 5-6 people to a new server. It shrank down to 3 regulars, and he actually started only showing up once in awhile. One of our other regulars left, we got 2 more, he started showing up more, then the 2 new guys basically decided they hated me and convinced one of the original regulars I was garbage. They talked behind my back a lot and I only found out because my BF basically told them they were fucked and told me about what they were doing. So me, my BF, and the other original regular moved to discord. The other guy got busy with school and life, we still talk, but I ended up having a ton of one on one time with him (my BF) on discord. We started getting pretty intimate with our discussions, we talked about the fact there was some mutual attraction, but we didn't start dating right away because he was in a relationship. It was ""open"" but he didn't really feel like he was being validated. And I didn't/don't think I could handle a polyamorous relationship. I helped him process through that and then his breakup. He took a break from dating for awhile but we kept talking, and eventually it lead to talking about meeting parents, buying plane tickets, stuff like that.

But TL;DR yeah it took a very, very long time and it was basically all an accident. A really cool one! Plus he has a super hot accent (NZ). Internet dating is pretty awesome if you're into people from other countries ahah"

There were also some battery powered fake candles in the room but they were mostly for the atmosphere, they barely gave off any light at all.

There was a tape recorder in the room that had a cryptic guide on what the group was supposed to look for to solve certain puzzles in the right order. It wasn‚Äôt game breaking if the recording was lost, but it really held you back if it was, which is why we encouraged people to only hit play.

One group was convinced that the only way to solve a certain puzzle with mirrors was to use the batteries from the recorder to power one of the candles, which had died mid-game, and use it as a light to reveal hidden messages even though literally nothing in the room told them to do that.

Most of the time you can tell which ones are going to be a shitty marriage and by extension a shitty bachelor/bachelorette party if you see one or any of these signs:

1.	The party is revolved more around alcohol and getting fucked up rather than celebrating the marriage and the relationship
2.	The party has sexual aspects to it ex: strippers, provocative games, prostitutes 
3.	Drugs 
4.	If the group is willing to bringing/picking up unknown members of the opposite sex into the party ex: If the bachelorette group is into talking to random guys at the club or bar they‚Äôre at. A bachelor/bachelorette party is an event meant just for the bride/groom and not for other people in the group to get laid

757,"Damn, I also had a similar terror experience in London!

I also travel there frequently for work and obviously party meanwhile.

One night we went out with a couple of mates in Dalston (district in north London) and we went into a random club we thought looked cool.

We partied there until about 1AM and then figured we want to continue the party elsewhere. I don‚Äôt remember the name of the club.

When we were walking around Dalston at around 1:30AM, we heard lots of sirens and figured some shit is going down, but hey it‚Äôs London so nothing special, right?

Turns out there was an attack in one of the clubs there where someone threw a bunch of acid over people on the dancefloor and people were badly burned.

We saw the news first thing in the morning. It felt surreal that we picked a random club in Dalston to visit and the attack happened in another random club probably no more than 1km away. We might as well have picked that other club and decided to stay just a bit longer..

Funny thing is that we all worked and lived in central London at the time which is nowhere near Dalston. There was no special reason why we visited Dalston that night, we just randomly figured we would visit that part of London because we haven‚Äôt been there before."

762,"I agree--I'm old, and I've followed political satire for a while. While there's always been a certain amount of cheap jabs, there was always some sort of outlet for ""smart"" political satire--humor that goes beyond ""Clinton can't keep his dick in his pants"" or ""Bush is a dumbfuck.""

I don't see that much anymore. Today's political satire is little more then fanservice--low-hanging fruit that relies on hate. I'll even say that Jon Stewart turned roughly halfway through his term on TDS--the show had spot-on political satire for a while (their 2004 election coverage is some of the best modern satire out there) but by around 2012 I found his humor to be lazy and pedestrian at best. (I blame his attempt to be a ""legit"" newsmaker, trying to play both sides--basically ""Listen to what I have to say--but if you don't like it, it's just a joke!"" For the record, this is also how I think John Oliver operates, which is why I find him to be subpar.) And it doesn't help that the entertainment industry loathes the current president, so they often come across as either insincere or hypocritical unless they just go angry instead of thoughtful. (I won't lie, I can't but help to roll my eyes when I see variations of ""That big fat Cheeto has no right to make fun of someone's appearance!"")

The good news is we've seen this before. The satire around Nixon was also pretty bad, because people didn't want to make fun on Nixon, they wanted to vaporize him, to borrow Tom Lehrer's phrase. And things rebounded a few years later. Hopefully this will be what happens."

I guess they're only propaganda in the sense that they promote a very specific message, but then again, most movies do that in some form or another. And every film has some kind of worldview that they wish to convey to the viewers, explicitly or otherwise.

If Christian filmmakers could stick to their principles while also investing more time in script-writing and good acting I think Christian movies would be much more respected. Instead, they focus so much on the Christian message that every other aspect of the film comes out half-hearted, and that's just tragic, imo.

Honestly, that's what really surprised me about The Prince of Egypt. I think this is a really good example of Christian movie-making done right. Granted it wasn't entirely developed by Christians but still really well-acted, faithful to the original story, very well-written, and just an absolute joy to watch. Plus the music is just gold."

Their speech and slower motor skills, combined with slower learning speed, can deceive folks into assuming that they are incapable of, for example, having Reddit accounts for themselves. More of them could accomplish more if their parents and guardians gave them more typical treatment and expectations; instead, too many parents talk of their high-functioning kids and don't actually treat them that way (speaking for them, treating them like 10-year olds when they're 20, etc.).

And while first class, TSA precheck, and other things can help mitigate these issues, it's ultimately faster and easier to just pull up next to the plane, take off 10 minutes later, fly faster and higher than commercial airliners (without weather or traffic slowdowns), and be on your way less than 20 minutes after wheels down. Also, having a bigger plane isn't just for cabin space, but also for better range, speed, and cargo space. It's definitely for convenience's sake, but not (just) for personal comfort.

Baka Not Nice was a security guard for Drake back in 2014, and was arrested for kidnapping and sexual assault on a woman who claims he intended to turn her out (aka prostitution). the case went to trial and *somehow* got pleaded down to a simple battery charge, which he served IIRC a 6 month prison sentence. Back in 2017 Drake then signed him as an artist to OVO.

I don't know how much anyone here knows about human trafficking and forced prostitution but it's definitely not a one man operation, which leads me to believe that there's either others in Drake's camp that are in on the operation as well, or at the very least Drake and his team are willing to look the other way on whatever connections Baka has to that world.

Just imagine how easy it would be to run a human trafficking operation when you have literally the biggest star in the world (and one that resonates so close with the demographic they're after in the first place). And now consider how J Prince recently had to play mediator for the Pusha T/Drake beef on the claim that there was some profound career ending information out there that was at risk of coming to light (and how out of left field Pusha T's ""announcement"" of Drake's kid was, which shows that Pusha T definitely knows some serious information).

If you don't understand your cooker's maximum capacity, if you fail to check they're working properly, if you don't clean them out properly  - including the elements inside - you're asking for trouble.

1005,"Went on an outing with a guy who I knew somewhat in high school but was never properly friends with. We had run into each other on the bus about six months prior and he had physically grabbed me to make sure he got my number, which really should have been red flag number 1.

He kept asking me out to all these different events but refused to ever actually ask me out, which put me in the awkward situation of having to reject him prematurely, go out with him when I had zero interest and then reject him, or just keep declining. I declined the first 12 invites. Eventually though it got to a point where it was clear he was just going to keep asking every single week until I said yes.

Finally I relented, but immediately asked if he was fine with my friend joining as well as she was also interested in the play he invited me to. I figured this was a tactful way of making it clear to the dude that this was not a date, where he could still save face. He agreed and I figured that was that.

Fast forward to outting time. My friend and I arrive together, and I can see dude sitting down already with two open seats beside him. Homeboy turns around, makes eye contact with me, waves me over, and then as I'm walking towards him with my friend right beside me he gestures for someone else to take one of the seats next to him. 

My friend and I sit behind him instead, because homie you're not slick. He proceeds to pout and whine and try to guilt trip me into coming to sit with him while completely ignoring my friend. I'm getting anxious at this point so I'm basically just like, ""Nope sorry I'm not going to make my friend sit alone for this entire show"" (especially when you are actively the cause of this situation dude).

ALSO I'm sitting directly behind him and my friend is to my right. Instead of turning to his right, to include both of us, he literally turns his back completely to my friend to talk to me. I try to include her in conversation with me and him, and he cuts her off multiple times by just asking me a new question midway through one of her sentences and straight up just oozes resentment at her whenever she's talking. I should also mention that he speaks in this super slow enunciated way with weird inflection, sing-song like.

He also takes this time to repeatedly stare at my legs with intense scrutiny, slowly lift his (incredibly long and skinny) hand, and then strike at my knee/thigh and clutch it. This happened four times in the 10-15 minutes before the show despite me moving back further from him each time it happens. He also showed no respect for any of my personal space in general (ex. he saw a tattoo on my wrist and instead of pointing it out or just asking about it he grabbed my wrist and yanked me forward so hard I felt like I was receiving a Trumpian handshake). 

Show finally starts (thank god) but now I'm a bundle of anxiety and discomfort about this entire situation and how to leave it as quickly as possible as soon as the play is done. When the audience stands up to applaud I quickly whisper to my friend that we're leaving right away. She literally just gives me the biggest fear eyes and whispers ""thank god."" Later told me she had chills within minutes of meeting this dude and it's was one of the most uncomfortable/nerve-wracking situations she's been in.

We chat with dude for like five-ten minutes after the show, and then we make our goodbyes. Dude is not having it. More whining, more guilt tripping, more barely restrained anger at my friend. When I first said I had to go his face just dropped from having expressions to this completely flat angry look and then went back again within a few seconds, it was like watching a mask fall off.

As the final kicker, while I'm making my goodbyes I'm slowly backing away, until by the time I'm like ""so we're gonna go this way"" there's like four metres of space between us. Instead of taking the hint, he rushes forward to hug me, and while I'm doing a one-armed pat, he goes in for a full body, stroking my sides hug, complete with him audibly smelling my hair.

Yeah. I didn't see him again after that."

1055,"Prostitution is legal in Ontario. Believe me, prices are not going down to the point where it would be a problem. If men want a cheap prostitute, they go back to street prostitutes. If men want to go to a legit operation, they will pay.

That's what has been seen in Ontario. I remember reading a year or two ago that prices have gone up in most locations (especially tourist locations like Niagara Falls) because demand is high and some men are always willing to pay to get a little sucky sucky while not fearing for their safety.

Unethical LTP - There are prostitutes in Thailand that will give you the whole treatment for around $20 CAD. The sketchier places are even less. If you pay for legal Canadian prostitutes more than once, it might end up being more expensive than a trip to Thailand + Thai prostitutes.

**Edit**: I meant decriminalized, not legal."

1059,"Animal shelters will tell all kinds of lies to get the animal out the door. Guess it makes sense if you know the animals will be killed if not adopted. We were at the adoption shelter to get a dog. We chose a beagle. While they were filling out paperwork, a family comes in and I see the kids start crying. Then the parents hurried them to the car. I went outside to see what was up and the dad told me they had visited that dog the day before and the kids loved it. They had called the shelter 10 minutes ago and told them they were on the way to pick the beagle up. They shelter told them they would hold it. I left with my adorable shihtzu and they left with their beagle. The shelter also lied about the age of my shihtzu. "
1060,"I'm in my mid 30's(male) and I recently lost my dad to cancer. What little I remember from the day he died (I lost control, got insanely drink) is both crying into his shoulder while he laid there before they took him and stumbling down the stairs to my childhood bedroom and just curling up in the fetal position and bawling into the floor. I'm not an outwardly emotional person most of the time. Death of someone close to you can fuck you up. Before that night I could have never imagined reacting that way to anything, and I thought I had prepared myself reasonable well given that we knew it was coming. "
1061,That much water is still plenty to push the car off the road and into deeper water. If I couldn‚Äôt get the door open I‚Äôd be panicking too.
1062,"Serious conversation my wife had with me. My wife had a really bad pregnancy with our last child. Last 3 months bed rest and lots of pain. Wife was catherized during labor and the pee looked like the color of cherry kool-aid. She told me no matter what she wanted out baby to live. During the birth our baby came out blue, my wife not knowing what happened looked at me knew something was wrong and said go to our son, I hesitated and she said don't care about me go to our son. I did. Gave it some oxygen it perked up but you could see concern. They rushed him out. That was the longest time of my life. Writing it now I am on the verge of tears. Obgyn was working on my wife and a NICU team was working on my son. My son started in NICU about 12 days and my wife was in the hospitable over a week. I was a walking zombie. That was over  8 years ago. My son just turned 8 in April and my wife has never fully recovered from that pregnancy. "
1063,Yeah no shit

1076,Totally understandable.
1077,"My friend's teenage sister got mildly teased about having ""sideburns"" - i.e. the little wisp of hair that grows in front of your ear. It had never even occurred to me to notice whether or not other girls had those. I certainly have them and I'm pretty sure almost everyone does. Apparently some girls shave them?! Which just seems ridiculous to me. It's not like you're growing big bushy sideburns; it's just an extension of your head hair. "

1083,"Former church secretary here.

I was dumbfounded at how many people didn't understand that we *paid* for the paper and ink in the printer.  Specifically, their friends' donations paid for that stuff.

1087,"My mom is old school in the sense that being gay or lesbian is cool. She‚Äôs even understanding of being trans.

Bi isn‚Äôt real and they just need to pick a side. I tried in my early 20s but since I‚Äôm in a committed relationship with a man (I‚Äôm a woman) I was just ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù in her world. I‚Äôm still super bi...

My son will be 12 soon. He came out to me as bi two months ago. He‚Äôs been with his girlfriend since they were 9, and they‚Äôre actually pretty solid for tweens. He admitted to me last week his glad his male best friend is going to a different middle school and they only text now because he likes him too much and doesn‚Äôt want it to cause issues with his girlfriend. 

To be totally fair, he‚Äôs non gender conforming and I‚Äôve known since he was about 4 that he wasn‚Äôt straight. It‚Äôs that weird ‚Äúmom instinct.‚Äù So I just made sure to be open about my own sexuality and reinforce the whole ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù thing. 

He was still so hesitant to tell me. His voice was shaking and it took him about a year total to go from ‚Äúsome boys are cute‚Äù to ‚ÄúI would consider dating a guy if I didn‚Äôt have my girlfriend‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm attracted to my best friend and have thought about kissing him.‚Äù

I tried for years to get my chubby best friend to come with me (free bring-a-friend day once a month) and when she finally did, two bitches walking by decided to mock her heavy breathing when she was on the treadmill.

We went to a different room and got smirks and giggles when I was talking her through the rock climbing wall.  I heard ""She's gonna squash that other chick below her"" and ""That wall won't hold for long"", and worse.  Thankfully I don't think she heard it.

The locker room was... Bad.  Like Carrie bad.  Up to then she had begged me not to say anything about the cruelty, but I snapped and cussed them out, almost got in a fistfight.  My friend left in tears.

Since then I have taken more notice of heavyset people coming in and also getting made fun of.  I try to encourage them but they always leave after a week or two.

I've always been a tomboy, into video games, more typically male things. But I've always just seen myself as another flavor of women. I think that anybody that feels like they have to completely associate with societies stereotype of male and female to be considered as such to be kinda close minded. Everybody is different, has their own quirks, and identity. We have done a lot of work trying to remove these stereotypes and tags only for more to be created and make things more confusing. While, yes, the media likes to stick to these labels as a means for marketing and and audience, it certainly doesn't mean that people in general think this way.

When you were younger, you said that you wanted XYZ, but now you don't. What if in two months you don't want these pictures on the internet?

1151,"Two possibilities:

1. The parent is an ass/narcissist and honestly doesn't remember/if they do remember doesn't think they were wrong so they tell their child that they are wrong in remembering.

2. The parent remembers just fine but feels guilty about it. They don't know how to cope with the things the may have done in the past so they  push them to the back of their mind and hope no one remembers. When someone does remember they brush it off and say it never happened so that they don't have to relive the things they might have done and, by extension, the guilt that causes.

Both of my parents are now dead. My mom passed in 2000, and my dad 2008. I remember I was a hateful little shit to my parents when I was growing up. And I had two beautiful, loving, supportive parents who deserved just the opposite. When I turned 19, I hit a rough patch in my transitioning from child to adult, ended up in a psychiatric hospital for 3 months after experiencing a drug-induced psychosis that required another two years of care which was provided by my devoted parents. If it hadn't been for their loving care, I would have been a human wreck, one of those homeless people you see living under a underpass. I remember when I finally came out of it and was working my first full time job at an art gallery in the framing department. I bought a rather cheap print and framed it up nicely for my mom and presented it to her as a gift. On the butcher block backing paper of the frame I wrote ""Thank you for having never stopped loving me."" The look on her face said it all. Whenever I think of that moment, it always makes me cry. It's funny, I spent a couple of years in therapy and whenever I would cry tears involving my parents, it was never about anything lacking in the way of love shown to me, but in the way I lacked showing my appreciation for their love in return. My therapist always told me not to feel guilty; that parents knew this was part of the overall package, but I still think any parent wants to hear those three little words from their child and hearing those words makes it worth all the while.

1234,"So I am paraphrasing but this story was good enough to make it within one of the books so bear with me:

So, back when Walt ran Disneyland, it was its own true happy little kingdom.  They had rules but in itself there was a lot of people who were 'lifers' within the park system...literally started there and worked their entire life for Disney either within the park or as the dad did, made his way up the ladder and became one of the Imagineers.  One of the old salts was his first crew leader, this guy named Murphy a guy who had been there since the park opened and was a hilarious middle aged guy who really loved the park.  He showed him around, told him about the park, and made him feel welcome.  But then he said with a sorta mad laugh ""Since yer the new kid and June is just around the corner, yer gonna do the Grad.""  June was two months away so he asked what the Grad was, and Murphy just cackled maniacally and didn't say anything more.

As it goes, he eventually found out 'the Grad' was....Grad Night.

Now, Grad Night is a unique thing in So Cal but is not unusual in the overall sense.  Graduating seniors let loose after finishing finals and its a way for them to blow off steam before heading off into the real world or going to college.   Still celebrated all over the world.   Only in So Cal, if you were in the vicinity of Disneyland....odds are your Grad Night was going to be at the happiest place on earth. It wasn't just one high school usually, they would get maybe 10 to 20 high-schools to pal up the dough and essentially 'rent' Disneyland for the night.   Sounds like a sweet deal, all night fun in the safety of Disneyland, no ticket costs (back when Disneyland had tickets for the rides), and parents were not worried about Johnny getting his ass in a car crash.

The real truth was that Disneyland was going to basically close to the public, unleash about an average of 700 to a 1000 teenagers within its confines with pretty minimal adult supervision on a skeleton staff comprised of mostly first or second year teens themselves as the old salts would do this on a strictly volunteer basis with a bump in pay but essentially you were saying yes to an all night, batten down the hatches and hold on, teenage sheenanagon. (if thats isn't a word it should be).  The old guys who did it were either insane, desperate for dough, or hip to the fun and enjoyed what Murphy termed as 'the modern day Sodom and Gomorrah'.  And that year was no exception.

So, they are going to close the park from the general public at around 8 PM to be opened by 9 for Grad Night and Dad is ordered to show up at 7.   He makes his way over to Murphy who welcomes him and the team and says ""First order of business....grab a trash bag and start stoking the bushes.""  Turns out this is a regular thing for Grad Night Prep as one of the big rules is that there is to be NO ALCOHOL within Disneyland.  So, in terms of teenage thinking, the best thing to do is to a) ditch school b) stock up as much ill gotten hooch as you can c) Go to Disneyland early and start hiding the liquor wherever you can find a shady spot and D) Come back in at Grad Night and go nuts.

So the employees are finding shit everywhere.  And I mean everywhere.   Weighted coolers in the submarine lagoon with strings attached, bottles of whiskey in every bush, rum on the roofs, bottles put in every shadowed ride, enough sixers to fill a liquor store for a year, literal GALLONS of the stuff.  For 2 hours, they are fine toothing the damn place, often having to go back 3 to 4 times as bottles keep mysteriously appearing as the closing sounds are ringing and announcements to vacate are heard.  Every land has its own back-area and they are literally stocked to the gills with hidden contraband by the time they are ready. And even then, alcohol is going to get so that if they are not stinko by the beginning, they will be by the end.  This kinda bodes to the state it will be for the next 8 or so hours as it opens.

So the Dad is working Journey through Innerspace, this ride that simulates you shrinking down and provides a 'educational journey through the body'.  Translating that is basically 'Hey lets teach you about blood cells while making this look like a fun ride'.  This equals BORING.  He, the team, and Murphy are basically in no mans land as none of the teens touch the place with a ten foot cattle prod (Why would you when you got better stuff mere feet away?).  Dad asks why they are here and Murphy says ""Wait.""

This becomes apparent around hour 4.  Suddenly there is a line and its growing.  In fact, there is shortening lines for the more action oriented rides while others suddenly are becoming very popular.  This is due to 3 factors: 1) The alcohol has really kicked in and inhibitions are suddenly by the wayside.  2) Couples are finding themselves in positions to really get it on.  3) Slow, dark rides are are very, very open.

And Journey through Innerspace AKA ""Journey through Intercourse"" is looking very good.

So in Innerspace, the teams are setup to basically sit on stools to make sure that people are staying in cars and not falling off so they got about 4 or 5 guys with walkies keeping an eye out and radioing in.  The bonus here is that now the teams are basically trying to break up furiously horny people try to fuck as fast as they can.  Flashlights turn on and ""Hey quit that"" while angling down on BJ's, bare tits, and enough heavy petting 'to fill a zoo'.  It's pretty much a lost cause as far as it goes, so the team has stopped them from warning kids and letting them go to town and for all intents and purposes, enjoying the free shows.   The ride stops them anyway as the way its set up, they bust out from pitch black into the light and a lot of couples are hastily putting on clothes and buttoning up pants over boners rather quickly.

Not to say they are the only one.  The Skycabs are rocking back and forth from the inertia, Mr Toads Wild Ride is a lot wilder, The Haunted Mansion is getting a rather large pile of undergarments piling up on the various furniture and the Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse bedrooms are being used very un-Disney like (but very, very happy).

So this is rolling along at a merry pace and Dad says he saw more tits than he has ever seen in his life in one night.  Some kids are so snookered they are passing out and Murphy is just sending them through again and again....

By the end of the night, people are tuckering out and its slowly winding down as most kids are knocking out from sheer exhaustion.   Dad and Murphy are starting to rack the cars on the side track and cleaning them up when both catch sight of a couple coming into the turnstile.  Dad described them as a 'greaser type' and not worth the notice but the girl is a 'knockout...with enough on top to be very noticeable and she knows it'   They go up to Murphy and the guy is already tenting his jeans.

""Hey bud, how long is this ride?""  He looks at the girl and if you aren't picking up the vibe, you are deaf and dumb.

Murphy looks at the babe and side eyes him with a wink and says ""Long....about 45 minutes"".  The greaser grins and they quickly board, practically tear clothes off as they disappear inside.

Dad says something to the effect of ""Last time I checked this ride was 15 minutes tops.""

Murphy grins and taps on the control to apparently slow it down a little.  ""Yea, I know.  Get me my walkie talkie.""

So Dad hands him the walkie talkie and Murphy begins keying every ride in Tomorrowland.  ""Hey Joe, Micheal, bring a bunch and come over to Innerspace.  You got maybe about 5 minutes.  Yea I slowed it down.""

Laughter is bursting over the comms as people are acknowledging.  Meanwhile, the guys sitting down are wondering why the voice over are growling out their spiel at half speed and walking up to the front.  Murphy is laughing and tells one of sitters to let him know when they are at the near endpoint and 'not to bother them'.

People are busting down to the ride now...all in all he says about 30 to 40 employees.  Newbies are looking around but among the other old operators are a lot of shit eating grins.  Among them, surprisingly are a few of the Dixieland band....with instruments in tow.

Murphy gets a crackle from the sitter ""Yea they just passed and Holy Shit...Ill be right there.""   The crowd is assembled and await the guests of honor.

SLAM!  The cabin comes through from pitch black into harsh neons....and a crowd of onlookers.  The Dixielanders trumpet and cymbals crash, a few raise confiscated beers and everyone yells ""SURPRISE!"" to a completely buck naked couple fucking away, girls legs over the greasers shoulders and a big ""O"" of disbelief on his face.   Dad says the girl's eyes were closed and is pretty sure she was in the throws of one huge O of her own.   Complete hysterics from everyone.

The real funny thing was the guy seemed to be the one brutally embarrassed.  He said the girl stood up and dared them to take it all in loudly as she shook her ampleness to wolf whistles and applause from all the people then dressed and strutted off.  

I asked if he was worried if they were gonna get in trouble and he smiled and said ""Nah...what were they going to do?  Hi we were trying to have sex in your ride and these people busted us and made us put clothes on?"""

As a result, Kreia's finale was pretty much completely incoherent. If you play the PC version, however, there's a fix-mod known as The Sith Lords Content Restored Mod (TSLCRM) that puts most everything back together - at least as far as the modders were able.

This was a recurring problem with most of Obsidian's early games: KOTOR II, Neverwinter Nights 2, and New Vegas - all were rushed because the publishers demanded they be done on strict timeframes, and all suffered for it."

1249,"AT Thorpe Park there‚Äôs this giant swing ride called Rush, it‚Äôs basically a pair of 80 foot swinging arms with seats that swings straight up and out and then do the same the other way. At the height of one of its swings the part where the riders are seated is directly above one of the main paths through the park, and the route id take every day to get to the canteen for lunch. 

I‚Äôm 2008 I‚Äôd walked past it as I did every day when all of a sudden I heard a commotion behind me. I turned around to see a group of people huddled around this great big piece of metal that had fallen off the ride 80 feet straight through the holes in the safety net onto the path where a whole bunch of people had been standing taking photos and [videos](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tcSAoHLopgY) of the ride and watching their friends. It had fallen right where I‚Äôd been walking like 15 seconds earlier.

We also had a ride called Stealth which was a powered start coaster that went from 0-90 in about 2 seconds and then straight up 200ft, over the hill, and back down. It used to fail to make it over the hill and roll back down it backwards into the station. Luckily it had really good magnetic brakes to catch it when it did this.

We also had a ride called The Slammer that was essentially two huge square plates covered in seats at the ends of these long horizontal arms. The whole setup would lift into the air and then flip you around and around like someone with a pancake in a pan spinning their arm around like they‚Äôre trying to keep water in a bucket. Just after it opened it got stuck halfway through a cycle and left like a hundred people hanging upside down 60 feet in the air for an hour. People were passing out and being sick it was a shit show."

It's not caused by a virus or bacteria, but the creation of special-shaped proteins called 'prions'. When a mammal eats its own kind, these prions destroy the eater's brain and nerves.  Prions survive the cooking process, so fully-grilled human flesh is just as likely to cause brain damage as raw human flesh.

(That's what makes mad cow disease in beef so terrifying. Cow prions can also damage human brain cells, so eating even fully cooked, well-done mad-cow steak will rot out your brains until you die, with no antibiotic or cure because the destruction isn't caused by a living thing, just a protein.)"

I kept my distance from the car because there was something off about them. There was a woman who was using a very soft tone and a man closer to the window and it really scared me. The guy kept telling me to come closer to the car and to get in, and I didn't believe there were boys or a puppy. If I'd gotten close  enough he could have yanked me in.

She told me that anyone who ate deer in her clan usually gets a warning by getting sick, but if they continued eating deer they would die. This is because the deer woman would come for them, because they had done wrong. 

Then she went further down the road of making me not eat any jerky for a while by saying, every year a person in her clan is taken by the deer woman. ""This is at powwows of course, when everyone goes home. You'll hear the next day that someone turned up dead, or went missing never to be found."" Is what she told me in between moments of dizziness.

Still though, the photo was wicked creepy and it's too dangerous to joke about things like that. Some of the school still didn't go into school that day.

This wasn't the big incident, but I still find it funny - before midterms, someone decided to vape in front of the fire alarm to see if it would set off. It worked, and the alarm went off again during midterms week, (the day before an English teacher had burnt their toast) so no one was happy at all.

Real: Since God is (in) you, you are always watching you. 

Basically accepting God as part of yourself allows you to break down the false barriers of separation we build up through language, and makes one able to accept unity with everything (even ourselves with ourselves).

Granted, not all oil changes need to be done at 3,000 miles.  Because most people do a mixture of severe/normal driving, 5,000 is generally a good number.   It also depends on the oil you get.  Synthetic can last up and beyond 10,000 miles, but it's the filter you have to worry about then, I mostly don't go over 7,000 miles with synthetic.   But again it's dependent on the vehicle, oil and oil filter you get.  

Battery care is something a lot of people also neglect, make sure you don't have corrosion build up around the terminals, and if you do clean it off with a battery cleaner brush and before you do any work on the car, disconnect the negative terminal (both if you are cleaning the battery).    Also remember that if you have your car sitting for a while (week or longer without using it) that they battery still gets drained as long as it's connected, most batteries can handle that, but it depends on the climate you are in, never do that in the freezing cold.   

Make sure you put the proper fluids in the proper places, but the manual generally tells you that information.   

Also if you do not feel comfortable doing a certain thing, have a buddy or relative who does help you, or be prepared to pay the price of a mechanic and bring it to a reputable one.    "

To be true, we never once used it to insult a person, it was funnier when it was inanimate because obviously a chair can't be gay. Still, it's lowkey homophobia that can make actual gay people feel hostility even from people who aren't homophobic at all.

1541,"The 2nd amendment, [while a constitutional right](https://www.online-paralegal-programs.com/constitutional-rights/), is also what we call a personal liberty. As such, it is also qualified by not being allowed to violate the rights of another. Freedom of speech and freedom of religion, for example, are other personal liberties that--at times--are curbed to ensure the personal securities of others. For instance, you may face repercussions for verbally threatening another's life, despite your claims of freedom of speech; you similarly cannot cite your freedom of religion if you are suspected in engaging in (ostensibly) religious acts that might result in the harm of others or their property. Likewise, the right to bear arms does not go without some qualification to ensure that we are ultimately doing our best to protect people's right to not be killed, injured, or abused. And before you say that it's already illegal to kill someone, I'll point out that my prior examples go beyond that and already curb their relative rights on the basis of preventing the potential of harm. I'll also note that the 2nd amendment isn't even about using a firearm, but rather owning one. Therefore, it's not unconstitutional for states to pass certain provisions that help ensure that the owning of a gun will not likely infringe on others' personal security, while still upholding that basic right. Maybe you view it as inconvenient, but in a modern society that values the lives and peace of its citizens, we should be mature enough to recognize that we can't always have instant gratification and that some time/procedures are ultimately for the greater good. A large part of being a good citizen and patriot involves looking at what's good not just for ourselves, but for society."

1551,"Virtual photons are particles that carry momentum. Say you have two magnets placed north to north, you feel them repelling each other. A way of explaining this is to picture one magnet spitting out a photon which then hits the other magnet. The first magnet is pushed back as the photon is emitted and the second is given a push when the photon hits it.

A good analogy is to imagine two people on office chairs throwing a bowling ball between themselves. They end up rolling away from each other, the thrower pushing himself backward to conserve momentum (Newton's 3rd law) and the catcher will obviously roll in the direction the ball is travelling.

The reason the photons are 'virtual"" is because they are impossible to observe. This is because in intercepting a photon travelling between the magnets (by seeing it) you are blocking the process from occurring in the first place. This is clearly really weird, but that's quantum mechanics for you."

    bring water and rice to boil on high heat.  
    when it starts to boil, get a lid on that saucepan and leave it there. 
     turn the heat down to it's lowest setting. Leave the lid on.  
     I repeat, do not take the MF lid off for any reason.  leave that lid on the sauce pan.  no stirring, no peeking, leave that little fuck on the pan while it does its alchemy.
     After about 15 mins, turn the heat off the hob.

1560,"I'm gonna copy/paste a response of mine from an unrelated post.

 I used to work in a level 1 adult and pediatric trauma center. One day we got a whole family in from a rollover auto accident. One parent was decapitated at the scene and the other was intubated. One child was intubated and miraculously one was lucid. All 4 were john does. I was tasked with trying to ID these people. I went through their belongings. Nothing. I called the responding police - nothing. Apparently moms purse was burrito'd in the metal mess that used to be their van. Dad's wallet was MIA. All I had left was to talk to the kid. I asked him what mom and dad's names were and he gave their first names but not their last - paused and then asked ""are we still going to chuck-e-cheese?"". It was the kids birthday and they were on the way to his party. He kept asking if they were going - if he did anything wrong - when he got to see his parents - and I struggled to keep it together. I was as nice to him as possible for as long as I could be - then I went back to my desk, found the location of the accident, and reverse engineered which chuck-e-cheese they were going to. I called and asked if there was a party there - and if any family was waiting. They were. I had to calmly inform them that there had been an accident and ask for them to come to the hospital. I couldn't say what had happened. It was brutal. I think about that poor kid regularly. I was delivered his last shred of childhood innocence. I nearly break down every time I think about it. I've seen a lot of shit but that tore me up. Still does.

I took a pencil and the notepad, Becky starts weighing stuff and it's already not looking good. Two things weigh the same, the weights seem absurdly high. The screen flashes up a clue ""You are misreading the scales. Red is 5""

*Becky, can you check again. You said red was 8* She says no, it's not eight. It's not five. It's now seven. She will not let anybody else near the scale because now she's getting defensive about it. We go through all the numbers again. Yellow is 10.5? Blue is 12? Green is 4.5

The screen flashes up again. ""you are still misreading the scale. Red is 5"" Becky now insists that this is fake news. Ten minutes pass. The screen eventually tells us the answers to everything Red is 5, Yellow is 3, Green is 6, Blue is 1. Becky starts to sulk because we are not taking her ""fake news"" theory seriously.

1609,"I got into an argument with someone on reddit over this scenario. They felt that if someone was stealing their sandwich at work, they apparently deserved to die. Not really. Their argument was that a little food poisoning never killed anybody. Except it has and he has no idea what the person's allergic to. Sure, stealing sucks, but it doesn't excuse killing, maiming, or other forms of assault, at least not under the law."
1610,"Depends what animal you're speaking of. If you're talking about trophy hunting the large ammount of money that people spend on that help wildlife conservation.

If you're talking about the average hunting licence. The money fron that also goes into wildlife conservation, but the act of hunting provides a means of survival, and food. Sure you may not need that deer jerky while working a 9-5, but hey why not.

I don't get the phrasing that using a weapon against an unarmed animal is wrong. Would you rather I make an animal suffer by choking it to death? 

Last one on ""Just because money is involved it's okay to kill."" I don't get what you mean by that hopefully you'll tell me. Money doesn't have a whole lot to do with it. People hunt for reasons of Food, Challenge, and as a pass time. We're the apex predator after all."

1616,"&gt; The worst kind of people are those who think they‚Äôre owed something due to the celebrities fame!

Similarly, people who feel they are entitled to what the person does. One example is how everybody talks about George Martin and the next GOT book. Can you imagine if you had a bunch of people yell at you to go back to work every time you're doing something else, saying they hope you don't die before finishing that thing you're working on, and acting as if it was something you owe them?"

My father said I should get a sports bra after playing some soccer matches.

Jumped off a diving board in a two piece and apparently my top moved a bit (they were too small due to growth spurt).

I have never used tampons so I stayed outside at the pool when I was in my cycle. One guy in my class kept asking why I wasnt swimming (he forgot his swimwear so he was stuck outside too). Eventually told him I forgot my stuff too.

My school respected girls needing the bathroom so I never had a issue. It was embarrassing explaining to a couple male teachers though when asked why I needed the washroom.

Now I laugh at these things but yeah... teenage me was quite embarrassed XD"

1628,"8th grade. I was a bit of a fat kid, so I took up wrestling to get into shape. Had this one short little fucker that kept punching me in the ribs whenever he saw me inbetween classes or in PE. The only class we had together. His brother wrestled too and was stacked for an 8th grader.  Some people start puberty earlier. Anyway the little shit pushed me on the running track into the wet grass field. I fucking lost my shit. Grabbed him by the arm, swung him around in a circle and kicked him square in the balls. Twice. The gym teacher saw it all go down. Asked me why it happened. Told her that the kid was bullying me and I stood up for myself finally. She said good job. I've watched him bully you. The brother in wrestling with me confronted me,  he said its about time you kicked his ass.  He's a prick. Lol. I thought he was gonna kill me.  "
1629,"My parents are also immigrants and their only involvement with college was vaguely asking me to ""look for scholarships"" and giving me money to pay for it. To this day they have no idea of the applications process, or even how to begin to check grades/status/classes/anything. And they were considered helicopter parents in the 90s.

They also asked me to consider studying abroad, which I didn't want to do because from the info sessions for it it seemed incredibly overpriced. I figured I could get a job in another country after college and do it that way. That didn't happen due to many reasons...  My degree program only had an overpriced 2-week summer trip to Europe as their study abroad option anyway. "
1630,"I took a vacation right over the May 1 national enrollment deadline without internet. Parents couldn‚Äôt reach me. They called my office 6 times before my Director finally got involved.

Its really kinda fuckin beautiful to find someone you can just kinda sit next to late at night very tired and eat mcdonalds.

best day of my life and not sure i'll ever top it. and im ok with that."
1648,"Getting as much alcohol as we did.

We were 21 when we got married and all of our friends were similarly aged.

We paid for the whole wedding ourselves (aside from $2,000 from my dad) and I had initially purchased about 5 cases of beer, 3 cases of coolers, and a couple cases of assorted drinks.

Ten 24 packs of alcohol per drink roughly, for 100 guests. 

My Dad comes out to the garage where we were storing it and goes ‚ÄúYou need more than that.‚Äù

He sends a picture to my mom, and she goes ‚ÄúThey need more.‚Äù

So I go out and make a second trip. 

I come back, they‚Äôre still convinced I need more. ‚Äúpeople love to get drunk at weddings!!‚Äù

So I make a THIRD trip. 

We had each drink set to $3 (hoping to get some of the money back) for the guests. 

At the end of the night we had over 35 unopened cases of alcohol, which the beer stores would not allow us to return (despite being told at the time of purchase that we can return them).

I‚Äôm still $3,000 in debt because of the alcohol. 

"
1649,"I met someone on reddit years ago and hung out with him (in public) a couple of times in a friendly way, at which point he revealed that he expected me to have sex with him and that he had a number of frankly concerning sexual fetishes he expected me to entertain in the process. I am in an open relationship, and extremely kinky, but (a) I'm not particularly interested in men as a general rule, and (b) his fetishes involved actively harming him in a way that could not be safely controlled, so I told him that I didn't want any part of it and that we probably shouldn't see each other again. He threatened first to shoot me, then himself. 

I didn't respond, and he later managed to find my long-term girlfriend on social media and sent her an enormous letter (it took her something like 4-5 screenshots in tiny font to send me the whole thing) telling her that I had raped him and that he was going to ruin my life unless she broke up with me and/or convinced me to have sex with him. He also implied that he knew where she lived, and that I was abusing her as well but that she just didn't know it yet. I believe he may have posted about it elsewhere on the internet, but I have long since blocked him everywhere I could think of, so I don't know about anything else he might have done or said. 

He had put in writing to me after the second encounter that if I didn't have sex with him, he was going to tell everyone that I was a rapist. So I knew at least I had proof that he had threatened to make false accusations (our conversations were like 90% text and IM, so almost everything was written down), but I was still pretty freaked-out because he was unstable and had access to firearms. 

The end result was a pretty stressful couple of months -- she ended up making a 'just in case' report to the police, because he lived much closer to her than he did to me, and I kinda kept waiting to get blown up on twitter or something, but when no one responded to his messages, he apparently ran out of steam after a while and just dropped off the face of the earth. 

I think about it pretty regularly because I keep expecting to see his username show up in some thread, or some indicator that he's posting here under another name, but so far, nothing has happened, and it's been quite a few years. "

1659,I had one at an Aldi and there was at least 15 of us and we all just had to take turns and speak and basically give an elevator pitch and plead our case as to why they should hire us. We were all standing in a back room where there was heavy machinery and loud noises happening. I remember the first girl who tried to speak over the sound of clanging metal and you could see her spirit being crushed as we all knew how futile it was. You could tell the person supposedly hiring us was cold and indifferent and couldn't give a shit.

And ON THE AKC WEBSITE it essentially said that it‚Äôs a great way for people to get an affordable purebred dog. In other words, these puppy mill breeders give us a lot of profit bc they usually sell their dogs as ‚ÄúAKC‚Äù registered üôÉ. And AKC registration means nothing in regards to confirmation or health but your average person who doesn‚Äôt know a lot about dogs will pay extra for a ‚Äúregistered‚Äù dog "
1670,"Yes, but not *literally* as such.

It's an atavistic response, and not the sort of thing you should want to experience. It should be avoided, both by those provoking, and those experiencing.

The last time I had this happen was about fifteen years ago when I was physically struck by a flying object thrown by my lover in anger during an argument. I was already trying to remove myself from the situation (badly, or I'd have just gotten out faster) and the object bounced off the edge of the door I was leaving through and smashed me full in the face - right smack in the eyesocket of my left eye. 

I recoiled in pain, clasped my eye with one hand closed the door with my free hand, turned on my lover and between pain and anger... I straight-up *lost my shit* for several seconds. 

You know how onlookers standing around a fight remark about it ""being on now"", complete with those ""awwwws"" and ""oooohs""? Yeah, you do that to yourself mentally, too. There's a momentary mental (Motivational?) hill you climb while you're working yourself up, a climb made far shorter/easier by stressors like pain, anger and hunger. Once you're at the top? It's like a roller coaster at the top of the hill - there's only one way you'll see to go. (There are other ways to go. You won't see them. The beast in the heart of man is running the show at this point.)

Mentally, you 'shut down'. Your decision making switches flip closed, and you're ready to breathe fire and salt the earth. Higher thought is not in the present. There is only an enemy, violence to do, and nothing else. I would probably have let someone stab me if it meant I could strangle the life from their eyes with a rictus grin before I bled out. (I did see with a bit of a red tinge - possibly increased blood flow to the retinas or the surface of the eyeball tinting the light passed in and perceived, possibly the minor injury from the impact.)

In my case, I'd thrown six or eight straight punches before I finally got enough conscious control of myself to resume leaving the situation as I'd been trying to do in the first place. I wore a black eye and she wore a number of cranial bruises to a family function that year.

He tried to drive back to the base drunk but wrecked and abandoned his car at the accident and ran all the way (at least 2 miles) back to the house party. He says that he's called the cops to report his car as stolen and he's begging all of us to lie for him and say he's been there the whole time. Thankfully we didn't have to lie because a dozen eye witnesses gave the cops Dave's exact description and they didn't even ask about his ""stolen"" car.

Any time I post any sort of success or neat thing I may have done on Facebook (i.e. weight loss progress) my mom will post comments along the lines of ""I'm so proud of my son"" or ""I did a good job raising you"" instead of a simple *like* or ""good job"". She ALWAYS has to bring it back to being about her.

My mom-in-law will constantly compete with my wife and it's so frustrating. One time my wife decided to wear leggings/tights and a button down shirt to a bridal shower or something that they both were attending (that particular style was one of my favorites when my wife wore it) and right before they leave mom-in-law goes and changes her entire outfit to be similar to what my wife had on.

Like you said, it's a great story, and it's fine to assure others that they don't *need* to spend thousands of dollars *if they don't want to* (or can't), but I detect this smug attitude most of the time, like their kind of wedding was superior to the expensive ones because they ""focused on what really mattered."" There's no one right-size-fits-all way to get married, people!

You do you, let others do what they feel is right for them, don't shame people for spending a lot of money on what really is one of the most important events in their lives. Seriously, it's a rare opportunity to invite everyone who's ever loved you, to gather in one place to celebrate an important and happy milestone in your life, if you can and want to go big, you should do that!

Only reason i found out was because his other kid started coming around for money &amp; other stuff, laying on a thick story about how he wanted to catch up on old time, etc.


Plot twist: He wasn't actually my dad's son, the first ex had an affair &amp; the kid just happened to look similar enough to my dad that he bought into it.  He loaned the kid a shitload of money &amp; bought him a car out of sheer guilt, during a time when he kept promising &amp; reneging on helping me pay for college tuition.

After a few minutes he asks me if I have big nipples.  I am debating whether to tell him off, or grab out my ID and show him he's hitting on a minor, or what, when the stewardess makes him sit down.

Example:

In the books, Strider (Aragorn) lights a fire and the hobbits tell him to put it out because he'll give away their position.  In the movie, they reverse it.

A ranger would of course know this whereas stupid bumpkin hobbits who have never left their village would not.  So the movie makes 10√ó more sense.

And this happens repeatedly in the movie.  In the books, each character is a random character.  In the movie, they are fleshed out with excellent characterization using small detail changes like these."

My mom gave me the sex talk. It was the day after I got my first period and she said, ""you know you can get pregnant now, right? Okay have a good day at school!""

My dad acted like women were defiled by sex and never spoke of it, then never spoke to me for months after finding out I was sexually active.

She had sacrificed so much already, and was asked to give more and more for the broader agenda, when the whole point of rebelling against the Games was supposed to be about being able to be real people who live and care for one another and not symbols.  She and Peeta were basically made tributes all over again, this time by the supposed good side."

Now I understand it‚Äôs more like a bunch of mum capillaries and placenta capillaries interwoven but not joining. Nutrients, O2 and CO2 are exchanged, but blood is not. "

1732,"I went to a carnival this past Canada Day in a nice suburban neighbourhood.

About an hour before the fireworks were set to go off, a swarm of teens broke out into a mob around something, cameras-a-recording. I didn't know what was going on and wanted to go and see as I was curious.

What I didn't know is that it was a kid who got caught setting off fireworks in the crowd fighting the cops who tried to stop him. Moments after the mob started, 2 more cops show up and immediately release pepper spray.

Had my curiosity gotten the better of me, that would most definitely have been the end of my night."

1735,"I also (subconsciously) believed this for a long time and my parents are both good people and happily married. For me, I think, it was more related to media representation. The 90s and early 2000s weren't exactly a shining beacon of realistic gender dynamics. That and perhaps some bitterness towards never receiving positive male attention. "
1736,Maybe not better but more understandable.  Two years seems like you got lonely two months seems like you were waiting for the other person to get out of town so you could screw around.
1737,My ex gf and her best friend made a sex tape of them doing lesbian things. I thought it was hot but the video was in her friends phone and someone sent it out which is social suicide in rural Tennessee.

1739,"It's IMDB rating isn't real, though.

When ""The Dark Knight"" came out, the Batman fanboys tried to get it to #1 on IMDB. To do that, they downvoted the hell out of ""The Godfather"" with a bunch of 1-star reviews, hoping to push ""Dark Knight"" above it. That didn't work, though... they only got Dark Knight up to #3. They did manage to get The Godfather to drop out of the top spot, though. It fell to #2.

The winner in the war between Dark Knight fans and Godfather fans ended up being Shawshank, which stayed out of the mess, and accidentally stumbled into the #1 position by not getting downvoted by either side."

1745,"In response to your example, the only place I can find a discussion about fire on Weathertop is here:

&gt; Strider laid his hand on his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said. 'You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for both.¬†Sauron¬†can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these Riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in the wilderness.'

&gt;'Maybe,' muttered Sam. 'It is also as good a way of saying ""here we are"" as I can think of, bar shouting.'

In this case, Strider is right and Sam is wrong. In the film, the Ringwraiths don't know the party is on Weathertop until the Hobbits' fire gives them away. In the book they were already spotted while searching the top for signs of Gandalf. Strider even admits that he was anxious to find a sign and careless. But since they've been spotted and have nowhere to run, their best bet is to light a fire because the Riders fear it.

I don't disagree that some characters get more development in the films, but what you cited isn't a good example of Tolkien being bad at characterization."

1773,"I enjoyed it right up until they threw a very interesting character with a complicated set of motivations for his actions into a meat grinder and made a one-liner about it.... and the people that were supposed to be his friends just laughed it off.  

I mean, they did him so dirty, it was really off-putting.  He wasn't in league with bad guys, he just really, really didn't like druggies for a very real and emotionally complex reason.  Was he wrong?  Yeah, but not THAT wrong... not grind him up after beating him and joke about it wrong. He multiple times both saved the Kingsmen or allowed them to live when he easily could have killed them.

1775,"Not scary like some of these, but in 1982 I was flying from Germany to New Orleans with long layover at JFK. This was after a very long bus ride to  get to FRA. I never have been able to sleep sitting up so I had been awake forever. I was sitting at the boarding gate in a daze when I heard a call beginning flight boarding. Got in line, boarded, got in my seat, and a person came up and said I was in her seat.  She and I were bewildered and a stewardess came up to check our boarding passes. TLDR I almost flew to Sydney, Australia by accident."
1776,"I don't understand the whole hiring strippers for bachelor/bachelorette parties thing.  Like, it seems to imply that no commitment has been made yet and so both can do whatever they want.  I think that's stupid but fine, one last hoorah before married life.

But then everyone gets righteously pissed if they actually do anything with the strippers?  So why hire them in the first place?

This is why I honestly would reconsider my wedding if my wife had seriously wanted strippers.  Fortunately we think alike and both scoffed at the idea.  She had a night of drinks and movies with her girls and I rented out a theater to play video games and eat pizza with my guys.  Nobody got layed and we're happily married."

1794,"&gt; The US government would have to COMPENSATE him for the value of the contract.

But the compensation would be nowhere close to the money he makes selling weapons on the black market.

Also, it seems likely that the explanation he gives is biased. People have a tendency to whitewash their motives, and to live in denial. He tells himself that his actions are justified, because he loves his family and needs to provide for them.


But it's all vanity and ego. I mean...just look at his lifestyle.  He doesn't ""need"" the city contract. He just wants it.

We had just had period sex in the shower and when I got out I immediately grabbed a tampon. For some reason he stood there and watched me put it in. As I‚Äôm doing it, the look on his face was priceless. A combination of awe and fear. He says, ‚ÄúOh my god!!! Doesn‚Äôt that hurt?‚Äù Super concerned I was in pain.

1841,"Moved to SLC from Iowa about 6 months ago, and work in a predominantly LDS institution. I'm the only person at my workplace who uses the coffee machine. Whenever we get temporary help from other branches, and they use the coffee machine too, there's kind of a moment where we're like ""Oh, you're one of us"". Usually it comes out that that person drinks as well, and it feels like we've found another person in the minority. Like when 2 dogs realize there's another dog over there and stare at each other. 

No one's ever tried to convert me though. I do however get invited to institute events at the U, or YSA events or FHE, which I politely decline. It gets a little weird/annoying though when customers just walk up to me and ask where I went on my mission, or if I'm married or single (those are the only 2 options), or what ward I'm in.

SLC is a big town, full of liberal weirdos like me which is nice, but there is also a clear LDS chokehold on the town too. "

I remember once some customers were concerned that some fish were hurting each other and talking to him about it, he did not even tell them he didn‚Äôt work there. 
He once bought some books along for his visit for us to look at. He had basically filled exercise books with facts about the animals, it was very much like a child‚Äôs school project. When you spoke to him he seemed like a pretty normal nice guy, he also had a wife who would come in with him. All the staff really indulged him and tried to give him any freebies that they could.

1879,"I‚Äôm 20 and I think I‚Äôm in the same boat with the borderline personality and depressed mum. She was just so inconsistent, bitter, wanted to turn me against the popular girls at school, tear me down and make the absolute biggest deal out of nothing, etc. 

I do feel you when you say she doesn‚Äôt mean it, my mum was just brought up to react off the cuff of her emotions and believe every thought her brain makes for her. It makes me feel bad for coming here and trash talking her but honestly after years of nit picking abuse I don‚Äôt blame myself for wanting others to affirm that what I went through was wrong"
1880,"Rian Johnson should not get to direct an *entire trilogy.*  He took a story and told...none of it.  The entire movie was so disrupted by comedy that there was no way for it to retain any gravitas.  After Alderaan was blown up, did anyone chuck something into a Porg nest?  Nah, that was the end of the scene.  Han and Luke jibed and joked on the Falcon, but there was no out of place comedy.  [The Closer Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuuDTnMPMgc) has a video on it where they go into it at length.  "

1883,"I was in a meeting with several of my managers and people from other departments to discuss a procedure that I‚Äôm in charge of (as in I‚Äôm the only one in a team of 100 that knows how to do this). We were coming up with a new way to work this procedure, and I said that the new way would involve me learning new software, take up more time, and be added financial responsibility above my pay grade. My manager literally said ‚Äúoh well you‚Äôre only a librarian, you don‚Äôt do much anyway so you should look forward to this‚Äù. That killed my morale and once the rest of the team of librarians heard about it, they were pissed. "

You can also apply through FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) and take up to twelve weeks (unpaid) leave, but you have to apply for it and it‚Äôs a complete pain in the ass. "
1894,"Costco is one of the better paying retail operations around and they're continually mopping the floor with the competition. Just look at Sam's Club, for example.

Provide your employees with more (money, education, etc) and your business will thrive. "
1895,"I think it was steve jobs that pointed out that when companies become too obsessed with sales, they end up being run by salesmen and innovation dies. This is the natural progression for how big companies eventually become moribund and stagnate to death. "

1899,"The company my dad worked for got bought for billions and within the first year 90% of management quit due to the now seemingly intentional terrible working conditions, including my dad. Really makes you wonder what the point of spending all that money was just to force out the employees that actually knew the company."

1901,"I have a phobia of claymation. When I was five, my baby sitter forced me to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas despite the fact that I sobbed uncontrollably the entire movie. A few years later my mom forced me to watch Coraline. That fucked me up real well. I still to this day have a phobia of claymation. I literally can‚Äôt watch a claymation movie without having a panic attack. No matter what it‚Äôs about I will still pass the fuck out. "
1902,I go through a box of gloves pretty much every other shift. And all I do is some basic food prep.

1904,I taught in Japan and a Japanese  teacher who wasn't at my school and wasn't working when I was in Japan had been embezzling from the school office supply store when he was working there.  All of us were told that we weren't allowed to go out anymore except for school and groceries because it would look disrespectful.  Maybe not such a huge deal for the Japanese teachers who were from there and had families but for the foreign teachers it was pretty morale-killing.  We weren't even allowed to have the goodbye party that was always held for those who were leaving that year.
1905,Had sex with 3 different girls in a 24 hour period. 
1906,My college bar/restaurant had the rule if you were an employee off scheduled time you were not allowed to be served an alcoholic drink. It was the only bar in my town 
1907,"Easy.  They‚Äôll think people are so desperate for a job, that they wouldn‚Äôt dare report their workplace for breaking laws.  That, or management will think the people are too dumb to realize the law is being broken."

1910,"That and simply it's just looked down upon to miss any amount of work. For any reason. For example, I requested tomorrow off to be the plus one to a formal financial planning event with my father (Initially through my supervisor which was a mistake because he doesn't relay information well). But I haven't ""been there long enough to get vacation time"" so I put in to use my paid sick hours to take the day off. HR shot back and asked if I was actually planning on taking off for an actual doctors appointment. I told them there would probably be someone in the room with some type of doctorate, so yes? It still got approved, but the amount of hoops it took was too much."

1920,"I knew since about the 6th grade or so that I was heavy.  Struggled through middle school.  Joined football in High School, hit the gym, but just got heavier. 

Right before my senior year, I played Dance Dance Revolution 6 hours every day for 3 months and dropped almost 100 lbs.

Found out I killed my gallbladder doing it, needed emergency surgery during spring break.

Thought eating grains and low-fat dairy / meat was the way to keep the weight off, but it crept back on.  Gained the 100 lbs plus more over the next 7 years while trying every diet plan aside from Atkins/starvation.  South Beach, Medifast, Weight Watchers, calorie counting, etc.  pretty much gave up on myself.  And was really depressed about not being as active for my 2-year old son.  And that my heavy breathing was in the background of every movie moment I captured...

Started researching ketosis and intermittent fasting, and hesitated starting because of my misconceptions that all dietary fat is bad.  I was worried about my cholesterol and heart rate / blood pressure which I was already on meds for.  Spoke to a few people at work that had tried with success.

It‚Äôs been 6 months since I started.  90 lbs down.  Dr confirmed cholesterol and blood glucose is in normal range.  Heart rate and blood pressure has normalized and I‚Äôm off the medication completely.  My allergies (I had struggled with daily since I was in elementary school) have cleared up.  Energy is through the roof.  Actually able to understand what I‚Äôm putting on my body.  

Still more to go, but this is a life change."

1936,"Not experiencing this myself but my grandmother had gone through some pretty rapid decline due to dementia. 

It mostly started with her forgetting simple things and then being annoyed with herself. Started to get worse around Christmas Eve  when she left the turkey in the oven and swore to us that Christmas wasn‚Äôt for a few day so why would there be a turkey. 

On a particular lucid day she told us she was somewhat aware based on how we were treating her. We had to put her into a home since she couldn‚Äôt take care of herself anymore which she did not enjoy at all. 

She maintained a generally positive attitude until the end though.

1956,"I‚Äôm not an employee but I‚Äôve a story I did that I think could‚Äôve resulted in my death. The only local amusement park I have I went to a lot as a kid. A great ride I loved was you get in an old fashioned car, and you ride around a bit of the parks vegitation, so no one sees you but you still see some of the park, that‚Äôs all 6 year old me needed to be happy. So one day it‚Äôs me my older brother (like 8 at the time) and my cousin (like 7) we‚Äôre riding, and the car stops. We wait for a good 15 seconds and since the tracks were secluded people couldn‚Äôt see us. So the natural thing we did was- get out of the car. These didn‚Äôt have any seatbelts or large metal rails that came down to secure you, you‚Äôre just sitting in a slow moving car. But all 3 of us think it‚Äôs a good idea to get out and walk the rest of the tracks out. It was easy because we rode it so many times but at some point the ride started back up again, and as we exited where the cars come back, the girl running the ride asked us where the car was, she was completely baffled and she was just a teenager, and we just kinda said ‚Äúthe ride stopped we got out‚Äù but as we were telling her this a good 6 seconds after we exited where the car comes out, the car arrived, none of us heard that it was fairly close behind. This happened roughly 11 years ago, the ride is still up today, i‚Äôve never seen it stop like that again, and if we were a little slower/ waited a little longer I definitely think one of us could have gotten straight up run over, and at age 6 I think it could‚Äôve resulted in death.

There are pockets of the US, especially in New York, that have a large population of Guyanese people, but in most areas finding another Guyanese person is like finding a unicorn. We are on the northern coast of South America, neighboring the Caribbean. Guyana is one of the only countries in South America that doesn't speak Spanish - we speak an English dialect like patois. Most Guyanese people are of either black or Indian descent. I'm the latter, so my family has a ton of island culture, a ton of Indian culture, and now, a ton of American culture. It was confusing as a child, but awesome once I learned to embrace it! And it definitely helps that the media is now embracing island culture more than ever."

Six months later my mom was helping her mom clean up, and moved the porch chair out to vacuum.  There was a big empty bottle of sweet wine tucked back there.  Obviously he'd drunk the whole thing, and went out in a soft haze of alcohol and diabetic coma.  Not a bad way to go, really."

2063,"Be extra cautious when they don‚Äôt accept insurance. While dealing with insurance is a major PITA, insurance companies typically verify a persons license to practice (and that process verifies the previous education and relevant training, as well as passage of relevant exams). There are legit therapists who don‚Äôt take insurance, but if they do, it‚Äôs a good indicator that they have been well vetted and are legit.  Most certificates in the mental health world should be meaningless to consumers- its the licensure that counts. 

Adding: Was on a tablet before so didn't explain fully. I don't mean to suggest that not taking insurance is a bad thing. There are legit reasons for making that practice decision. Usually a provider then provides a ""superbill"" which allows a client/patient to file with their insurance for an out-of-network reimbursement (or they mail that superbill to insurance for the patient/client). Over the past 30 years, health insurance has become an untameable middleman who eats up all the profits, and lots of good providers don't want to deal with it anymore. My original point was to help point out one method of an informed customer doing diligence to add to the original sub-poster's comment. 

PLLC/LLC is a business decision, not a clinical one when it comes to licensed mental health practice in most of the US. If you are vetting a health care provider in the US, you need to make sure you understand what license they hold to practice so you can check to make sure they have no complaints or actions. Unfortunately, this is all incredibly complicated now. For example, if you see ""Dr. Sally"" who has a DSW, you have to make sure you check the social work board for that state, not the physician, psychologist, LPC or LMFT regulating body.  "

Immediately my hamster turns aggressive towards the mommy and the 5 pinky things so we had to separate that fucker. Then I guess mine got so stupid jealous over its own children that it refused to eat and ran around in circles until it IT TIRED ITSELF TO DEATH (theres a trend here!).

my hamster didn't have to even try to kill the babies, though. They just died one by one. The worst was when I went to the cage and saw that the mommy hamster was eating something pink... turns out it was chewing on the leg of ONE OF ITS OWN CHILDREN. Then the mommy hamster probably got some sort of hamster kuru and died as well. As for the other 4 babies:

One literally committed suicide by jumping off the cage (that was on top of a bookshelf) when my sister forgot to close the cage door

One ate too much and had so much crap stuffed in its cheeks I'm fairly certain it suffocated to death

One was found dead on the top of its hamster wheel. I have no idea how it got there.

The other... I think it lived a longer life than the others and I have no idea how it died but I'm fairly certain it was just as stupid and heartbreaking for 2nd grade me

so fuck hamsters

2148,"Here is the secret with your career: the stakes are exactly as high as you want them to be. You job is to figure out what you want. Nothing else. The mentality among many is to push as hard as you can and even if you fall short then you will still be relatively successful. This just burns you out. Once you realize the stakes are tied to how you define success, highschool and university are the two most freeing times in your life.   


Want to be a doctor? ok, what kind? pediatrician? cardiologist? what is it? Then once you get there, what do you want to be? Do you want to be the absolute top of the field, in the most expensive hospital in the country getting paid the most money possible, or is success getting a decent wage at a quiet local hospital with a great (or at least as good as can be) work environment and knowing you are helping people you might know well everyday?  


Want to go into business? ok what part? Do you like operations? want to run a factory one day? Do you like numbers? are you going to spend your days crunching data as an accountant? what about marketing? or maybe you have a great idea for a business and are going to be an entrepreneur.  
   
Law school: do you want to work at a big firm, or some quiet local practice? Do you even want to practice law? Maybe you want to get into corporate law and be on staff at large company. Maybe you want to just have the knowledge for a business venture.  


Guess what...all those different roles i just described need completely different education. If your going to be an entrepreneur you don't need to be in the top business school in the country and 100k + in debt. you need a cost effective school to teach you the fundamentals and a mentor and a few investors that if you network during school you could easily find.  


The reality is school gets you exactly one job in your life...your first. Even then it only really gets you in the door. Once you have that job, your schooling really doesn't come into play that much in future jobs...sure you might need a credential here and there, but your company will pay you to get them moving forward.   


Don't get me wrong, having that base level of knowledge is definitely something you will need to be successful, but beyond that its more about experience than whether you graduated with an 90% or a 95% average.  


TL;DR figuring out your career doesn't just mean what you want to do in life, but what success looks like in that career. Figure out what success looks like to you, then don't waste time trying to way over shoot that by getting into the top schools if you don't need it.

2156,"The criteria is what society makes of it, really. There are expectations for the sexes to act a certain way, like certain things, etc. Gender identity is basically how strongly you resonate with society's masculine or feminine expectations. Some people, like myself, simply don't work that way. In my case, I'm a guy, but I'm not very masculine. I tend to prefer feminine things, but I'm not trans and I tend to be very lazy with my outward appearance (jeans and a t-shirt all day every day). And while there are some predominantly masculine things I'm into (working on cars, riding motorcycles), my attitude and demeanor don't really match up to that. A lot of people have assumed I'm gay because of how I act, but that's not really the case, either. I do like women, but any woman who expects me to act alpha male will be severely disappointed.

In short, it's very difficult for me to act the way societal norms insist that I should. It's actually really stressful for me. So I gave up a long time ago and decided to just act naturally. Turns out that I tend to be very ambiguous when I don't actually think about what I'm doing. That tends to make me fairly non-binary. 

I'm sorry this isn't a very good or definitive explanation. But I hope it helps you better understand why some people don't identify specifically as either gender."

2191,"And for anyone dealing with dysgraphia or dyspraxia (a related developmental disorder which causes problems with both fine and gross motor control, movement and coordination), two of the best ways I found to combat it on my own time were tetris and knitting - I couldn't use most controllers, as there was just too much going on for me to be able to play games well with them, so I stuck to slower-paced PC games for the most part, but tetris, in that it's short, repetitive and requires reasonably accurate movement - don't rotate the shape too much or move it too far - meant I could build my coordination and control without getting frustrated. Knitting - specifically, manipulating physical objects in a way that requires fine control, but is forgiving if you slip up - was far more calming and productive than any of the tasks the educational therapist tried me on. You want circular needles around the size of a pencil, and reasonably chunky wool, and some time. 

Not only is my handwriting legible now, I can create complex lacework while watching the TV. When I was about 12, my teacher told me to drop out of school, because with handwriting and clumsiness like mine, I wasn't worth educating.

The song was inspired by and dedicated to the memory of Katie Flynn, a 7 year old girl who was killed in a drunk driving accident on Long Island back in 2005. Her and her family were in a limousine on their way home from a wedding when a man named Martin Heidgen, who had gotten drunk before getting behind the wheel of his truck, wound up speeding down the wrong side of the Meadowbrook Parkway. He crashed head-on into the limousine and Katie Flynn was decapitated in the accident. After the rest of the family escaped from the wreck the only thing that the mother had left to hold on to was her daughters head.

Katie served as the flower girl in the wedding that day, and as she was getting into the limo on their way home she had told her father that ‚Äúthis is the best day of my life.‚Äù

Martin survived."

But then the 1950s come around and science is smarter than millions of years of mammal evolution and creates a formula close to human breast milk, coupled with a Puritan religious morality so that men and women did not see a bare breast.

Again, formula is fantastic for supplementation. I gave my kid formula when my wife was home (I am a man, cannot breast feed) and baby and I traveled, plus Supplement with breast milk her first two weeks. But nothing is a true replacement for breast milk for babies, when it‚Äôs possible.

You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement.

2369,"Just read through this, and as someone who has argued for the strong possibility of the transgender phenomenon being explainable by genetics, it‚Äôs tough for me to imagine what the experience must be like for trans people out in the dating world - your responses to the comments in this thread were perfect in helping me understand.  My 2 cents - I think the reservation of cis people toward trans people will go away eventually, maybe as soon as one generation from now, as we are right now in a sort of growing/learning period as a society in the normalization of LGBTQ+, in general.  Just know that, by going through this period yourself, especially when you engage in such constructive conversations like you had in this thread, you are making the world a better place for the LGBTQ+ future."

2371,"Former medic in a Level 1 trauma center- An 18 year old young man who tried to kill himself 4 days before graduating high school... he used a shotgun in the mouth and when he reached down to pull the trigger, it forced his head to tilt back slightly- the shot removed his entire face leaving only the cranium - he survived (he was intubated directly into his exposed trachea) - I heard a few year later he had regained a small amount of hearing on one side -

2381,"I took my 9 year old son to the Broadway show Shrek for his birthday. We had up front seats and was seated as the theater was filling up. He was in awe and amazement looking around at the stage and orchestra. The seats were the fold up kind, so when you stood up or when no one was seated the seat was folded up.

A woman with two smaller children and a nanny came to the row. The nanny and the children sat in front of us and the mother was seated next to my son. He had his hand on seat balancing himself as he looked around. I guess when she went to sit down, my son‚Äôs hand touched her butt. She screamed and starting yelling how he grabbed her ass. She continued screaming and making a scene. I moved my son to my seat and told him not to worry about it. She continued to rant about the awful experience.

I tried to let it go but seeing she was not letting it go and acting like an elite bitch. I calmly turned to her and said let it go or you will have me to deal with, and that was probably the most felt up you had in years!

She called the usher over to move us but everyone around us said she was the problem and the usher offered to move her to the top balcony.

My son laughed and said nothing like a show before the show!"

I had a buddy I met in high school, and up until recently we used to play GTA:Online together. He was a bit of a stoner but a genuinely good, kind-hearted guy.

One night at like 2:00am, he calls me. He's ugly crying and blabbering on. He doesn't do this often. This was *bad.* So while still half-asleep, I'm trying to figure out what's going on. He says he heard *Cats in the Cradle* over the radio and he started thinking about what he was doing in life, an the effect he was having on others. 

He said he couldn't drive cause he was crying so hard. I ask him were he was so I could pick him up. If he was stoned (50/50 chance) he shouldn't of been driving anyways. He replied something to the effect of ""Sandy shores... near the mod shop."" So now I'm extra confused because nowhere in the Niagara Region is a place called Sandy Shore.

...then finally I figured it out.

He wasn't driving, he was playing GTA:Online. This motherfucker was crying because he had heard the song on the radio in GTA, linked himself as the father in the song and his GTA:Online character as the son.

He rambled on about how he created this muderous mute psychopath that wants nothing except money and cars and people to kill. **And he felt guilty about it.**

I hung up and went the fuck to sleep. I told him he's no longer allowed to smoke weed when gaming, and I still tell this story to any new member of our GTA Crew."

My uncle had a story about being out hunting and hearing them behind the trees. At first he thought he was just sauced (Uncle was a drinker) - but he started hearing them to tell him to run. Then he heard the bear. He ran, and he listened. The voices in the trees guided him to an old trappers cabin and he held up for the night. Heard the whispers until he fell asleep. When he woke up, no whispers. No bear. So, he went back to hunting.

*ETA -

We were NEVER allowed to talk about Stick Indians while camping, as it would attract their attention."

2426,"This was back when i was in university, probably in 2005. I used to play a lot of video games (well, i still do). 

So i had been watching trailers of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory for sometime now and really, really wanted to play that game. However, the place i used to live in, the games never came on the shelves on release date, always about 2-3 weeks or even a month later. I had visited my local store a couple of times and they always told me that they weren't sure when it was going to be delivered to them.

So that added up to my anxiousness to play the game. So one night, i get to sleep, and some kind of weird dream started. All of it is pretty vague, but i had been walking somewhere and i see an opening in a wall or somewhere and as i enter, i see some shelves lol and then there's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory there, i feel happy and at once the dream ends.

I woke up fairly early, it was an off day so i had no classes that day. I thought that the dream was weird as it felt a bit too real, you know sometimes you dream about something, you wake up, and throughout the day you feel something's in the air, there's some weird feeling you get of all the events and pieces falling in all the right places, it's something unseen, you just feel it in the air and all the events that happen on that particular day seem to align themselves to that feeling.

So the same day in the afternoon i decided to go to the store, just for curiosity's sake as to why i had this dream lol, and as i enter the store, to my great surprise, there i saw a huge Splinter Cell Chaos Theory poster on the store's wall, since i was a regular customer, the shopkeeper immediately picked up a copy and gave it to me with a huge grin on his face saying,""Here's your Splinter Cell :D"" lol.

I bought the game and as i'm on the way back home, i asked myself...

""Did my dream just come true?"""

2443,"People feel so fucking entitled to knowing others personal business sometimes, it's amazing.

The only way to handle this imo is to ask a similarly rude and personal question back or say something totally outrageously personal in answer that they wouldn't want to hear.

If they have the nerve to be offended: ""I'm sorry, I thought we would both be asking outrageously personal questions to total strangers, I see you don't like it either.""

They were sooo pumped on the phone to her but she was not into it (complications/ technology ect) and asked what the alternate prize was, which ended up being unlimited free virgin flights for a year. It got to the point where Richard Branson even had dinner with her to try and convince her to take the space prize (which she didn‚Äôt). 

Her and her boyfriend both quit their jobs and flew around the world but got pretty tired 8 months in. They just kept going back to the places they liked best eg. They went to NY like 15 times. In the end they gave a bunch of flights to family and friends, but yeah totally worth it and changed the course of both their lives, especially work wise."

2461,"That's like teaching abstinence and hoping it keeps your kid out of trouble. 

As a parent you have every opportunity to teach your kid every last detail. You can take the easy way though and just say ""NO FREEWAY"" but it's hugely your fault when your kid decides not to listen and goes on the freeway anyways, without instruction, and gets hurt. 

You could have just taken the time to teach how to do it safely in case they decide to disobey anyways. Parents have this sick fucked up idea that their children are not autonomous and should in an ideal world blindly follow all orders. 

A good parent needs to understand their kid might not always listen when you tell them not to do something, and it's your responsibility to prepare them whether you think they're going to disobey or not. "
2462,"Clinton wasn't impeached for getting a blow job, he was impeached for lying under oath (perjury) about getting a blow job in the oval office.

Trump has a republican controlled congress and senate that don't want to piss off his supports for fear of their own political goals and future. Also, they need actual proof before he can be impeached, google search results wont be enough of a reason...

2466,"Fun fact. LFGTE (Land Fill Gas To Energy) plants are no longer profitable since natural gas is now so cheap. So there's a big push to convert all those energy GENERATION plants into gas ""conversion"" plants, where they take crappy landfill methane, clean it up, and stick it into the natural gas pipeline.

2480,"Celiac disease/gluten intolerance.  

There are many *temporary* reasons gluten might affect a person's digestive system, but people who have developed an inability to process it *or* an allergy to it are an extreme minority.  Most people seeking gluten-free alternatives on a lifestyle basis or who have been told they should, have been misadvised or have self-diagnosed, or are attempting to follow the latest in a series of unaccredited beach diets.  Remember the only difference between a guru and your new age cousin who just got into buddhism is that one of them is protected by a team of lawyers; the advice is the same.  Pick a number, roll a hundred-sided die twice.  If you didn't get your number both times, you don't have celiac.

2503,"Probably something to do with informed consent. (**EDIT:** autonomy is the phrase I was looking for, although informed consent is also relevant. Thanks u/funny_stuff .) Might be using the wrong phrasing there. No one is legally obligated to accept medical treatment of any kind. If they want to do a juice cleanse to cure their metastatic cancer, we can‚Äôt stop them. All those scummy snake oil salesmen have to say is the magic phrase, ‚ÄúThese statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. The Efficacy of this treatment is not scientifically supported.‚Äù

People who believe pomegranate juice can cure cancer won‚Äôt worry about what ‚ÄúBig Pharma‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Man‚Äù have to say. They just want some magic beans, and when you‚Äôre scared and hopeless, it‚Äôs easy to fall for a pitch from a sleazy ‚Äúdoctor of alternative medicine‚Äù from Dr Oz‚Äôs University for Herbalism and Car Engine Repair.

I‚Äôve seen it, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking, but all you can do is try to convince the patient otherwise. They will make their own choices in the end. And that‚Äôs the defense that morally bankrupt snake oil salesmen use.

2529,"Consumption of animal products.

I get shat on by society for choosing to be vegan despite the fact that:

 - farmed animals contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than all the cars on the planet

 - eating meat increases the risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes

 - farmland in developing countries is used to grow food to feed animals for consumption in the west, whilst many developing nations are left hungry

 - cattle farming destroys huge swathes of rainforest each day. Which, rather than being merely a sad aesthetic loss, is actually depriving the world of it's ability to turn carbon dioxide into oxygen

 - animals are routinely mistreated. Even in the production of dairy and eggs. Whether it's male chicks being churned in what are essentially animal shredding machines, or just gassed to death. Or maybe young calves being forcibly seperated from their mothers to maximise dairy yields. Or cows who have been milked so much that their udders are irritated and inflamed and leaking pus.

 - people who bring these facts to light are treated as radical. It's not radical. It's just the truth. I fucking LOVE the taste of bacon, but I also love not having cancer, having a self-sustaining ecosystem, breathing oxygen, and not causing pain and suffering to other living beings. No doubt I'd fucking love the moreish qualities of a heroin addiction, but I'm probably gonna steer clear."

He bitched and complained and moaned for years about how they were taking too much of his paycheck (it was assessed at the top of the housing market when he was making a ton in construction). Finally my mom is tired about hearing it and our whole family basically forced him to go to court.

... It was a super simple proces, compared to what he was making it seem. He filled out some forms, showed some pay stubs, etc. Had to wait a bit for a court date. He was eligible for reassessment not only cause his job/financial situation had changed, but the ex had also gotten remarried in that period of time. The judge even yelled at my brothers ex cause she didn't want to get a job which was basically the highlight of my brother's year.

2549,"Someone once said, i don't remember who, that technology peaked with the Ford Model T.

The reasoning was that this was the last time any idiot could look at the engine, figure out what was going on in there and fix it themselves if something was wrong. E.g, the optimal quality of technology is the one you can understand, and even modify, yourself.

While the Model T is way outside what we want to drive around in, the idea has merit: if you open the hood of a car from the early nineties, it is actually possible to understand what you are looking at, and at least attempt to work with it. Not so with a modern car; you need a specialist to change a lightbulb now.

I don't like that. I don't want computer monitors or virtual buttons; i want a physical, hard-wired dial that tells me what is actually going on, and physical buttons that goes *click* and *changes state* when i touch them, so i won't have to look at them to know what they could easily have told my fingertips.

Cars today is over-engineered to a point where everything has become *less useful*. 

The very worst example of this is modern stovetops: to put on a kettle of water, you now need to push three different *virtual* buttons, then the third one 5-6 more times to set the heat, and you have to *look at the damn thing* while doing this. If you go sit down, you need to go all the way back if you want to check the state of your input.

My grandmother's 50's stove had a physical dial on the front. You turned it *once*' got physical feedback right away that told you its state without having to *see it*, and, if you went somewhere else, you could just glance at it to see how it was turned in case you wanted to check. No need to get up.

Technology for technology's sake, it is not: we get this crap because it is cheaper to produce than the corresponding, old-fashioned hardware. And it's usability just sucks."

One night she asked if she could leave early to get out of the closing clean up. Manager told her no she couldn't, cause with everyone doing their part it would be done faster, and we could all leave sooner. Well this made her mad. So she reported the next day that he raped her that night. He was put on the sex offender list, after going to trial, and everyone made her feel guilty because she bragged about her lie. It was too late though, when she came forward and admitted it. The guy had lost his apartment, and was having to stay in an expensive motel. Dude was married, but his wife knew better, so that was good. Luckily the boss man let him keep his job, when everyone came to his defense. She was fired though. So I guess that's a small victory."
2552,"It's a very similar power dynamic to sports.  The coach holds your future in his hands.  Whether or not he plays you or put you in a positions where you can excel can make or break you.  The big difference is that in sports it usually doesn't get much worse than mild physical and emotional abuse primarily because male coaches aren't sexually attracted to their players.

Theatre/film is the same dynamic where casting agents/directors/producers/other industry insiders are the gateway to your success.  The big difference is that theatre is a mixed gender environment and has a higher number of same-sex oriented individuals involved.  This leads to a lot higher chance of sexual abuse and misconduct.  Add to that that in film/theatre participants are often acting out romantic or sexual scenes, there is often nudity, and excessive physical contact as part of the job.  It's a situation that is nearly custom made for abusers, especially in a high school environment where the victims are young, impressionable, and inexperienced."

2554,"I've talked to 1 teenage girl that wasn't while I was working in a restaurant or related to. It went well. Teenagers aren't tricky, just show interest in what they're interested in and they'll talk non-stop. It wasn't awkward, she seemed down-to-earth, but she wasn't around her teen-squad, so that could be why. Also, it wasn't like I stalked her down at the mall or wherever the kids hang out these days - she is the daughter of some friends of my brother, who were over for a party. So, a more normalized social setting.

I hate the female friend because she was just a straight up BITCH but the guy who is gay...honestly, it doesn't make ANYTHING he did to me right, but he was obviously going through some things. His family was extremely conservative, and he was the black sheep of his family. As goofy as he was, being his friend, I did see a lot of depression in him, looking back. He seems happier now and it looks like his family is still a part of his life. I'm glad for that, but I still would have no interest in rekindling the friendship.

2630,"I used to own a place, bailed out when the industry became saturated and we had to compete with people that I swear were just money laundering fronts (endless cash to invest in the rooms and insufficient sales to recoup their investment). 

While there are endless stories of stupidity and entertainment, one thing happened over and over. There was a painting with a small turn switch on it to turn on a light inside the painting. It was just like the turn switch you see on ordinary table lamps. Apparently no one today knows how to work one or what one is. They would just spin the switch as fast as they could rapidly turning the light on and off. I constantly sent a clue ‚ÄúClick, not click click click click click click‚Äù. 

The other one that made me laugh was I had an old Mac Plus that I programmed for a clue. They had to find the floppy disk, put it in, turn on the computer, and enter information on the screen. Teens just stared at it. They had no idea how to even turn it on. It was like watching Scotty in Star Trek IV trying to use the 1984 era computer. Also once they did get it powered on they were amazingly impatient on it booting. It took about a minute to load the program. Within 5 seconds they would flip the power switch back off and on again thinking it was hung. That would inevitably lead to them flipping the switch rapidly on and off (what is it with people not knowing how a power switch works!)

The most infuriating incident was a ceramic owl that had to be removed from a locked case and then placed in a specific shelf space to unlock a cabinet. This one group solves the puzzle to get to the owl, one of them grabs the owl and says ‚ÄúI wonder if this opens‚Äù and promptly twists as hard as she can shattering the owl. &lt;sigh&gt; What exactly leads a person to think a ceramic statue opens when they just spent the entire game finding items that had to be placed in their spots on the shelves and their is a clear place for the owl. 

And then there were the regular cheaters that forced things open often breaking them. One guy yanked a door hard enough to break the frame instead of unlocking it. Another bent the hinges on a gate so he could lift the gate off instead of removing the padlock (little kids used to crawl under the gate. That I allowed since it was at least reasonable for them to do it). But the most obvious cheater was a kid that entered a room, bee lined for a bookcase, and without having seen any clues, grabbed the one correct book out of several hundred that had a key inside and proudly exclaimed he found a key. That kid was clearly tipped off by a previous player. "

Similarly, the idea of being a ""redditor"" is really not attractive to me. I read reddit, but it isn't part of my identity.

I also once had a parent yell at me for 20 minutes because I wouldn‚Äôt tell her why her kid wasn‚Äôt getting financial aid and that she should get to know everything that‚Äôs going on because she‚Äôs the one who pays for it. I almost told her ‚ÄúWell maybe you should stop doing that‚Äù It‚Äôs ridiculous how many parents do everything for their kid but even worse is how many kids take that for granted.

Both Jews and Muslims bury their dead in similar ways in order to ensure the b ody returns to the earth quickly. Muslims often use sheets to wrap their dead in and bury them (from what I understand) Jews often use plain wooden boxes, at least in more orthodox cemetaries. 

Both my grandparents were buried in plain pine wood boxes, to aid in that. 

The first time I went to a funeral for a close college friend, I was stunned at the sheer... Extravagance. I don't want to say waste because it was done as per their religion, and it was an open casket, so I can understand wanting to show they cared for him and he was being taken care of even after dying, but still it seemed quite wasteful to bury your dead in boxes that specifically prevent them from returning to the earth in a timely manner.

For circumcision as a preventative measure for UTIs, the estimate is that [you'd need to perform 111 circumcisions in order to prevent a single case of urinary tract infection.](https://adc.bmj.com/content/90/8/853) Considering that UTIs are very treatable with antibiotics and that circumcision is relatively expensive -- the average cost is [upwards of $300](http://health.costhelper.com/circumcision.html) -- that means a cost of more than $33,000 to prevent one case of UTI.

MIL also invited 6 extra people day of because they wound up coming in a day earlier than they had planned. We ran out of space and everyone was cramped and miserable. Complete waste of $1500 and countless hours organizing.

Inviting a bunch of cousins I never see at the expense of some friends due to limited space. I didn't want to but got talked into it. The cousins left before dinner was over and the friends feel slighted to this day.

That all went fine for about 5 years. My mom and step-mom would even bowl together. Kim eventually developed heart problems, was on a donor list, but never made it. The day she died, she received a phone call. When the nurse found her, she was already gone, with the phone off her ear. We never found out exactly what was said, but the call was from her best friend, Kristen. Thru 20 years of detective work, my brother and I found out that Kristen was sleeping with my dad and was pregnant with his child and she had called Kim to confess to her before she passed. Kim died from the shock of hearing this. The baby was born almost 9 months to the day from when she died. "
2840,"Eh, I think there are still some grey areas.  Like how many drinks can one have before their verbal consent isn't actually consent?  Its easy to say if you are stone sober or if you are passed out drunk.  But there is a lot of middle ground there.  Especially if you don't know the person well and how they react to alcohol.

2850,"I think the issue is that the films are not the books. Having read the book, I watched the film and asked what the hell was going on. And then I relaxed and enjoyed a new film that wasn't HTTYD but was a different story altogether and it was alright. 

The films are very much their own beast, that are alright in their own right, but tell quite a different story. And it's largely because it had to be more visual and more action-based. It would be a tough film to make, I think, if it was done from the books, and it wouldn't necessarily a better one. 

But I feel like the movies lost a bit of depth of character that the books had because of that. I feel almost like the story the books stands out in my mind better than the story the movies told. "

2922,"Death star was actually for fighting the Yuzan Vong, not fighting rebels. A relativistic kinetic kill vehicle wouldnt have worked for what they *actually* needed the death star for.

Basically, there was an alien race from another galaxy called the Yuzan Vong, that used bio-machines to devour entire galaxies one by one. The Vong existed outside of the force (So the Jedi would have been totally ineffective against them. And, since the Jedi would never agree to what *really* needed to be done, they had to be gotten rid of in order to fully prepare for the vong.) and they used their biomechanical ships to infect entire planets, turning the planets themselves into biomechanical ship yards to create MORE biomachine ships to infect MORE planets, and on and on until everything is Vong. Now, a weapon that can destroy planets really isnt very practical for fighting a ragtag group of rebels with no central location on any one planet to attack, but you know what a weapon like that **IS** good for? Destroying planets that get infected by the Vong before they can produce more bio-ships. 

Now, even with a whole fleet of death stars, you still need an ARMY to fight the Vong. And a BIG army. And a big army where soldiers can be replaced quickly if they die. Almost like a... clone army. Or maybe a driod army? Or both. Both sounds good.

Tl;DR: Palpatine was trying to save the galaxy all along and Luke and the rebelling doomed everyone. Google ""Yuzan Vong"" if you wanna know the details."

It was bad, I found bags of rotting, melting veggies on two separate occasions. She would leave her dirty laundry and half eaten food everywhere, and she would walk around naked because 2 of us 3 roommates were girls so she thought it was fine. 

We all confronted her about it, and she would feel terrible and try to fix herself for a week before reverting back. After being given too many chances to count, she started lashing out at me and the other roommate, calling us unappreciative of her efforts. Her boyfriend was depressed and desperate so he gave up trying to talk to her.

After the lease ended, I started renting my own one-bedroom. Last I heard, she was still piggybacking on my other roommate and the boyfriend. Other roommate is waiting for their current lease to end so she can find a one-bedroom like I did."

In addition to that, there are tangible benefits to parental leave, including but not limited to: improvements in pre/post-natal care, a decrease in infant mortality, an increase in employment/wages in the labor market, and perhaps most importantly, increases in fertility rates.

IF IT'S A COVER FOR SOMETHING NAUGHTY, WHY WOULD THEY CALL IT SOMETHING AS UNBELIEVABLE AS A ""TUPPERWARE PARTY""?!

--
 NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE YOU WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO A PARTY FOR TUPPERWARE.

--
If I asked my friend to hang out and they said ""nah can't, going to a tupperware party tonight"" I'd say ""LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT I KNOW THERE AINT NO PARTIES FOR NO GOD DAMN PLASTIC CONTAINERS, WHO ARE YOU FUCKING""

He told me when they opened up this one guy's place, who just took off and left everything, he had a lot of neat stuff, including a huge VHS porn collection (this was years ago). There was a sheriff deputy present for whenever they do an eviction, and they can leave as soon as the first item is set down on the curb.

3192,"Colleague of mine was an English tutor for a small group of kids for a few months last year. It's free tutoring, state funded. One student (girl 13yrs) never brought her books, never new what her homework was or dates for tests and check-ups. In addition, she never paid attention. No surprise she didn't really improve. One day the mother stormed into the classroom and demanded an explanation. The tutor told her to wait outside, mother stayed. Afterwards, tutor explained and described the girl's behavior and organisational issues.  The mother blamed the girl's regular teacher and the tutor. She then demanded from the tutor to contact the girl's English teacher every week to find out all dates, homeworks etc. which the girl already gets 2 times in writing at that age. She also demanded that the teacher and the tutor should  meet weekly and in their free time to disuss all issues. From a tutor that has lots of other students (ca 60-80) a week and is free. The requests were politely denied. Didn't stop her from waiting in front of the classroom every week to share her concerns and complain or insult the tutor. One day the tutor was really in a hurry to catch a (long distance) train and told the mother  politely. This was when I really had enough. I told my colleague to just go and let me handle it. I unpolitely told the mother to piss off and leave my colleague alone for good. During the moment of her perplexed silence I gave her the number of my supervisor, my full name and told her to call and complain about me and that I couldn't wait. To my surprise, she never called and never returned.
Tl;dr mother ""stalked"" my colleague, a free state funded tutor and blamed her for her daughter's failure. Wanted tutor and girl's teacher to spend several hours of their free time to help daughter organize her schoolstuff. "

3204,"&gt;Some believe he was a prophet, some believe he was just a wise teacher, some think he wasn't real at all.

What the heck. I hardheartedly disagree with your sentiment. I grew up in a modern Orthodox community. I went to a Conservative Jewish day school, where I spent 7 years taking Rabbinical classes. My friends are reform. My point is, I have been pretty immersed in my religion and feel qualified to discuss it.

I don't know a single Jewish person who believes Jesus was a prophet. That is completely heretical and goes against the words of the *Tannaim,* the rabbis that compiled the Mishnah, the second holiest book in all of Judaism. After the Bar Khokba revolt failed in 135 CE, which was started by a false prophet to expel Romans from Judea, the Tannaim banned all new prophets. This was for 2 reasons, the first was that there were way too many people claiming to be prophets. This lead to a lot of cult like communities and the tragic Revolt. The second reason was the Tannaim wanted to eliminate all opposition to their spiritual authority.

Any Jewish person that believes Jesus is a prophet would be considered ignorant or heretical. Some people may have heard of the Jews for Jesus group and might be wondering about them. They are not Jewish. It is a Christian group that tries to convert Jews.

I will confess, I have not met a single Jewish person, be it Ultra Orthodox Rabbi, or a non-religious Jewish person that does not believe that Jesus was a real person.

The Jews look at him as a historically significant philosopher, and generally applaud his moral teachings"

3294,"as a 17 yr old with divorced + remarried parents, I‚Äôm willing to bet that throwing them away was a knee-jerk panic response. unless it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve gone through, you would have no clue the kind of emotional strain an uncaring/jealous stepmother can put on someone at that age. I‚Äôm not saying I would have straight up thrown them away, but for a 16 year old who has no clue what to do and who is desperately trying to avoid conflict with his stepmom, this comment‚Äôs a little harsh."

Later, at dinner she complained I was ""No fun, and being mean to her."". 

I said: ""No, you're just feeling guilty because you know I was right and you shouldn't have ate those.""

She then complained I was being an even meaner and that she doesn't like me any more. Sucked at the time and it was also kind of cute because she loves her grandma and you could tell she felt bad about disobeying her.

3296,"Autism Speaks. They've fooled millions upon millions upon fucking *millions* of autism families and autistic people with their bullshit and backtracking. With this, they fool autism families into having their friends and family donate money to it.

And where does it go? Well, half of it goes to catering. The other half...it doesn't even go to help autism families and/or autistic individuals.

&gt; I know they use most of their resources to convince people that the world would be a better place without us, and actually using the money to fund research that can make our extinction possible. Disguised as ‚Äúresearch‚Äù about babies and siblings, the investments seek to find a genetic marker that will allow parents to terminate an unwanted pregnancy (1)(2)

That's not to mention that they used to be *extremely* anti-vax before they backtracked on that right quick. And they are for the murdering of autistic people if it gets to be too ""stressful"" for their families.

It was built up like the parent was going to buy them all their favorite stuff, a boatload of tokens, etc. The parent instead took them to a nearby sushi place that shared a parking lot with the promised restaurant. 

The kid looked around confused, and the parent said, ""I lied.""

I don't know what the point of that was, but he did it three times. He would let me up just long enough to catch a tiny breath, then shove me under again. I was fighting with everything I had &amp; finally I managed to kick him in the balls. I'd never heard a grown up swear so much in real life. I managed to get to the wall and crawl out of the pool.

3405,"So, the girl I‚Äôm talking about is Emma Watson. I was working as a bartender at a hotel in a national park in Canada a couple years ago. She was staying there by herself to attend some private meditation/yoga retreat. I met her when she came in to the bar late one night when it was super dead, and we chatted for a bit just casually. I‚Äôm only a year older than her so I kind of grew up having this enormous crush on her.

I‚Äôd never met any sort of celebrity before this, so I wasn‚Äôt really sure how to act other than to just try and treat her like any other guest. My goal was just to not embarrass myself. Before she left, I made what I thought was a complete zero chance hail mary move by offering to show her around the park a bit the next day and go for a hike or whatever. I figured the worst thing that could happen is I‚Äôd have a story for the rest of my life about how Hermione once shot me down.

To my complete and utter shock, she said sure, and we ended up getting along pretty amazingly and spent the next two days together before she got busy with her retreat thing. We did everything together - went for a hike, spent some time on the lake, ate some food, and just had a lot of interesting conversation. That was the part that threw me the most; you kind of expect people like that to be different in real life than they come across in the media, but she really is just a helplessly, effortlessly charismatic person. Very quiet at first, but once she‚Äôs a little more comfortable and has her guard down there‚Äôs this mischievous, goofy sense of humour that comes out.

The evening of the second night, she invited me up to her suite for a drink. After about an hour of chatting, completely out of the blue, she asked me directly if I wanted to have sex with her. I kind of froze, for obvious reasons, and she basically said ‚Äúpeople can be kind of intimidated or not know how to act around me sometimes, so there are times I have to be a little more forward than usual. And you‚Äôre a nice guy‚Äù. And then it happened. All I can say is that I‚Äôm definitely *heavily* biased, but it was just as incredible as you imagine it would be. Next morning she began her retreat thing, and I never saw or talked to her again after that. She‚Äôs unbelievably down to earth and really, really funny. It was basically the greatest two days of my life."
3406,"For everyone in this thread who didn't read the article freaking out. 

*The park closure was ‚Äúurgent‚Äù because park rangers did not want climbers to be crushed by falling rocks, not because they feared an imminent volcano super-eruption.*

*As we have reported previously, the likelihood of a large scale, globally disruptive super-eruption‚Äôs occurring at Yellowstone Park in our lifetimes is exceedingly low, and that event would be presaged by warning signs that the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and other entities are constantly monitoring.*

*Yellowstone‚Äôs magma chamber, most geologists agree, currently does not contain the volume of magma needed for such a large-scale eruption, and the process of replenishing that chamber occurs on slow timescales. The USGS consider the risk of a caldera-forming apocalypse at Yellowstone in the next couple of thousand years to be ‚Äúexceedingly low.‚Äù*

*In short, if a volcanic super-eruption at Yellowstone Park were imminent, the signs would be much clearer than a 100-foot crack in a rock wall.*"

He told me he was going to use all his points that day which prompted me to ask the question ""oh are we booking anyone else on this flight?"" to which he responded ""Oh yes darling! We are booking the whole family"" Cool, how generous. He then tells me that he is getting married to his girlfriend and flying the entire family out for the celebration. My heart melts. 

Then he tells me that it is a celebration of love and life and that he was recently diagnosed with a terminal cancer and is too old and too impatient to spend his days in the hospital so he is locking down his lady and getting all his kids and grand kids together for one last hoo-ra of his life. I was silent in heartbreak. He then said to me that ""life is too short for being sad for someone who has lived long and fulfilling life"" like he did. 

I hope he had a hell of a send-off!

So even though you should be able to buy a house now (have a nice down payment saved and everything) you need to wait for all the shit from when things were desperate to clear.  So you waste money on renting  (and thus not building equity) YEARS beyond when you should need to.

Also, it pisses me off when fictional ""poor"" people turn down a job that is ""beneath"" them.  When you are at the real bottom, there is no ""beneath"" you."

3436,"There was this horrible thing that happened in China where a bunch of girls started having their periods at 4-6. One of them went into menopause at 21.

The cause was reported to be bovine growth hormone in tainted formula. It was reported to have killed 6 and gave 300,000 kidney stones. Now they're saying that the formula wasn't the cause, and they don't know what is - but it's definitely interesting. I think the food we eat has definitely changed a lot, and that we can't really say for sure the effects many unknown substances we touch/breathe/ingest these days have on our hormone levels - they're sensitive.

Do Inuit Count? I'm from the Northern Canada (Nunavut), there are shadow figures called 'Tarrainak' or the Shadow people. It is believed that you can see them from the corner of your eyesight, when you see a Tarrainak, you would take another look or you swore you saw something in a form of shadow or a haze. I have heard that they are rather creepy and they give you the feeling of being watched or a slight anxious of some is following you.

Another legend is called 'Ijjirait', translated 'people who hide'. Ijjirait are entities that you would see in the barren arctic in the far hills. The Ijjirait have the power to shapeshift into other creatures or people, really similar to the Navajo legend 'Skinwalker' although never harming Inuit. It is believed that the entities observes Inuit and follow them but I have never heard Ijjirait harming Inuit. 

An Inuk Elder explained that the Ijjirait can live human lives or imitating humans, or even marry other human beings, while pretending to be Inuit.

Camping in the arctic is creepy and you would have that expectation that you would encounter entities especially how the arctic is so vast and empty."

3451,"Well there are obvious class divides within the wizarding world  (think the Weasleys vs. the Malfoys), which must be based on some competitive advantage when it comes to resources. If wizards were capable of magicking clothing and food out of thin air, then Ron wouldn't be subjected to wearing the worn out robes of his older brother, or left to stare longingly at the snacks Harry bought at their first encounter. 


Professions are limited to basic entrepreneurship  (Diagon Alley being the miniscule centre of trade), administrative work, athletics, journalism and academia. Apart from the production of magical ingredients , there is never any mention of wizard industrial farming or mass production. These items cannot be created via magic (otherwise the wizarding world would be a classless utopia), so where are the wizards getting these resources from? 
I wager that the labour of humans without magical capabilities (i.e. muggles) is being exploited without any trade of equal value from the wizard community. The family of Harry's father amassed their magical currency by selling ""Skell-e-gro"" to humans in the middle ages, so there must be some kind of transfer rate.

Labour, infrastructure and human misery (i.e. limited access to magical remedies) is being systemically exploited by a superior race of humans. "

3490,"A colleague I had the intense hots for called me into the storeroom one day, to ""check"" something. When I walked in, he closed the door and I basically jumped him. This was after weeks of mounting sexual tension. He was a really tall dude with a magnificent beard and he braced himself against the wall while me made out furiously. I tugged at his pants frantically to get to his cock and his belt wouldn't cooperate. He reached down and undid it and I went down on my knees immediately, yanked down his jeans and proceeded to blow him. I only got to taste him for a few seconds because he then bent down, pulled me back onto my feet and panted in a low growl ""You drive me crazy."" Those words made me even wetter and hornier. He turned me around, bent me over, flipped up my skirt and shoved his cock inside me and fucked me really hard, while fondling my breast and tweaking my nipples, not gently mind you. Best of all were the sounds he was making and the feel of his cock pulsing as he came. 

The other time we were outside smoking and I was wearing a long floaty skirt. He leaned against an SUV where we were out of sight and put his hand into the slit of my skirt. His moan when he felt that I wasn't wearing underwear made him go hard instantly. He pulled me to him, my back to his chest and groaned ""I want to fuck you so badly."" He had to settle for fingering me and biting my neck while I ground my ass against him. He almost came in his pants. 

Then the last one that really sticks out in my memory and it's actually what I said that made him go crazy - we ran an errand for work and we were in a work truck, he had parked in a secluded spot and he shoved his hand down my jeans. He started to finger me and watching me intently while he kept going and made me cum. I tugged at his jeans and told him ""open it!"" He wasted no time in unzipping his pants, my command for him to undo his pants was the trigger. I leant down and gave him a furious blowjob, to which he responded ""Shiiiiiiiiiiit"" in a groan and then blew his load down my throat. 

God, I miss that dude."

That was incredibly awkward for everyone involved. Somehow his girlfriend found out, showed up and threw a HUGE fit. We bailed. Never saw or talked to him again."

So breed does matter. Don't get a sheepdog if you're a couch potato. Don't get a terrier if you're going to have the animal off leash a lot. Don't get a greyhound if you want to go on full day hikes.

3559,"While this is true, and I love when people get shelter dogs, it's not a perfect fit for everyone. 

If you are looking for certain things in your dog, maybe smaller size, hypoallergenic, level of energy/activity, buying a specific breed is advantageous. 

The problem is with breeders who keep pushing these traits to the extreme. It's not always the case however. When I got my Boston Terrier, i wanted a dog that wasn't too big, had short hair, and Boston's have a reputation of a great disposition. Many Boston breeders have pushed the breed into health issues, but the one I went to had a different approach. She didn't breed only black and white, maintaining the perfect coloration pattern and size that the AKC requires for bostons. She bred her healthiest dogs. They were bigger than typical Bostons, it didn't matter if they were brindle or brown or blue or that they had the tuxedo coloration pattern. Absolutely no line breeding or inbreeding.

As a result she's contributing to making sure the breed doesn't go the route of the pug. That's the type of breeder that we need. "

3564,"In *Ohio, its completely optional to take the classes too. You can skip the drivers education if you wait until your 18. If you want your license at 16, you just have to go to classes for a total of 6 days (I think it's 6 days), and then like 15 hours or so of actual driving. It's completely stupid. I know kids who get their license at 18 that just practice for one day. No other driving experience. At my highschool, we had a girl that failed 3 TIMES. The 4 try, she passed and the next day, went 40 in the school parking lot and hit another students car who was backing out. The dude backing out was deemed responsible because he was backing out of the space. She ended up getting a new car after suing him for neck injuries and then proceeded to crash that car into a light pole, also in the highschool parking lot.... If that tells you anything, it should tell you the land of the free is also the land of the stupid...

Edit: * those laws are for Ohio, not all the US. "

If it's a guy sleeping with his attractive female teacher, a lot of people don't seem to think it's wrong and pat the guy on the back.

The problem with S3 is that the writers were clearly told to wrap it up. Nothing new there, of course - but they had the audacity to pretend that this was their plan all along (going so far as to publicly tell fans that they should have known this was the last series, based on some vague ""everything ends"" quotes made in the first series), then wrote a nonsensical finale in which most of the characters were completely wasted/overlooked - and a 'meaningful sacrifice' was made, which made absolutely no sense.

Worked my ass off to get into medical school. I sort of knew it wasn‚Äôt what I really wanted to do, but the atmosphere of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so smart‚Äù in combination with mental health issues helped me to keep that feeling buried. Completed 2.25 years before my brain caught up with what my body was trying to tell me. I hadn‚Äôt had my period for 7+ months. I had become a recluse and bitter about the world and the future. It took me failing Step 1 twice and a forced leave of absence for me to stop and accept that I couldn‚Äôt do it. I couldn‚Äôt make it through medical school. 

Thankfully during that leave of absence I finally sought psychiatric help. I ended up staying with my grandma who is simply my guardian angel and she gave me the comfort and freedom to make my own decisions. We ended up going to therapy together to discuss the trauma I had been through from my mother and the fact that I had panic attacks, mood swings, and (going back through old records) the fact that I was diagnosed with a personality disorder. 

The hardest decision I have ever had to make was admitting that I could not complete medical school, but now (about 1 month after my withdrawal) I moved across the country to move in with my, at that time, long-distance boyfriend, found my first big girl job, and actually have the freedom and desire to pursue things I like to do like hiking, playing music again, calligraphy, etc.

(For reference, asking one of my guy friends in the middle of a small get together how he'd feel about another guy offering him a blowjob and then confessing, ""Oh, well, I'm bi so I guess it's different for me!"" out of fucking nowhere was behavior he didn't understand was bad.  I had to explain to him that if he had known that before, he should have told me in instead of hitting on one of my friends in front of me during a party and then telling everyone casually.  He went from wanting monogamy to, ""I don't believe in monogamy anymore"" and openly telling me how much he'd love to fuck other women that he found attractive whenever he saw them.)"

For some classes of drugs, there can be a DOZEN similar alternatives on the market. Which is ""best"" varies patient to patient based on side effects - and also considers factors like cost.

Would you rather be on a fifty year old drug that you have to take four times a day and gives you an upset stomach, and costs $4 a month - or would you rather be on a newer drug that's more effective, you only have to take once a day, doesn't cause upset stomachs, but costs $350 a month (with insurance)?

Different people answer that question differently.

Edit: my grandmother saw a commercial for overactive bladder medication. She had never discussed this with her doctor before because she assumed it was a ""woman's issue"" / ""part of getting old"" (she's in her 80s). Because of the commercial, she brought it up with her doctor. Instead of giving her the expensive drug from the commercial, she got one which was ""good enough"" that had been out for 50 years and was completely free with her insurance. So, commercials can also encourage people to talk to their doctor about things they didn't even realize were problems. "

While loading, he realized that none of the eight people in the vehicle had eaten in the last 6 hours of driving and everyone had subsided off various snacks that we brought along. Being the quick thinker that he was, my dad dashed into the gas station and quickly got food for everyone. When he came back, we were greeted with four packs of sushi (one pack=two people), a jumbo Doritos bag, water bottles for everyone, and a box of cashews for himself (he was vegan at the time). All of us ate our fill and drove on. \*Flash forward two hours later.\* My stomach doesn't feel so good, and my head is also starting to hurt. I tell my dad to pull over. Immediately after I get out I projectile vomit all over the shrubbery as my family watches in horror. Diarrhea also bombards me as it slowly creeps out of my pants. I'm in the middle of nowhere and my jeans are covered with runny feces. The rest of my family lays me face down on one of the bunks while my dad turns around the RV. Everyone slowly starts to realize their fates as the RV heads home. I passed out on the bunk for the rest of the night, but accounts from my dad and sister (the only people who survived the attack) told me that it was filled with my dad pulling over and allowing the family member to throw up or spew their diarrhea on the roadside. Now, whenever we go on road trips, we always make sure to bring along our own meals. We also don't invite our family along. "

I moved across the country just before my senior year of high school, leaving behind my best, and if I'm being honest with myself, only real friend I had. I thought that once I'd moved, we'd talk less and less until eventually we became former friends leading massively different lives, but that hasn't really been the case. Nearly four years later, we talk on discord at least twice a week for a couple hours or more. The key to maintaining a long-distance friendship is frequent communication and finding activities you can still do at such a distance. For example, we frequently play online co-op games and listen to music so that we can still share experiences. Our friendship hasn't faded in the slightest since I've moved; in fact, it's grown stronger, if anything. Your friends will still be your friends even with distance, I promise."

3895,"Obligatory, this occurred between 2009-15
Both my parents developed an opiate addiction through grinding and snorting my dad's oxycontin, which was prescribed for his injured back. 
Sometimes I'd find them passed out in bed with a pill grinder and a pen tube on their bedside table. I never brought it up with them for years. Then, one day I was just going through some of my stuff and found out that my grandfather's (deceased) ring was missing. Had no idea where it went. Ask my parents, and neither of them had a clue. The next day, one of my good friends who worked at a local convenience store told me that my dad had come into the store kind of delirious and tried to pawn off a ring to them for cash. 
I confronted my dad about stealing my ring, and he denied it until I brought up my friend's account. Said he needed the money for bills. And that's when I said ""No, you were going to use that money to buy pills, weren't you?"". The look on his face is something I will never forget. It twisted into something raw and hungry, and filled with rage. In that moment, he ceased being my dad and was an addict. It hurt to be looked at with such unabated hatred. He snarled a ""Fuck you"" at me and went downstairs. Moved out later that year, took me a good long while to readjust.

Happy ending, though, my parents split up and they got clean. Don't really talk to them much nowadays."

Don't get me wrong, I think women should have some self defence training. But anyone that has been in a real world fight knows that raw strength beats technique. I am a small man (5'7"") with a fair bit martial arts knowledge and there's no denying that a 6'2"" man that's a bit husky would absolutely destroy me in a fight no matter his level of training. In the same way, I could overpower almost any woman in a fight no matter how much Krav Maga she knows.

Women need to be taught the way things are, not the way we want things to be. They should be able to resist as much as possible if a man attacks them, but the main strategy needs to be *run*. It sucks but everyday, non-pro-athelete women should never, ever be told that their training can make them dangerous enough to reliably win a fight against a man."

Worse yet, I was with my grandmother at the time she and I got the call from my uncle. I got called out in front of everyone for it at the wake.

3952,"During college, while I was in a long term relationship, a really attractive girl at a party, who was the ex of a guy who lived in my freshman year dorm and happened to be in one of my classes but we didn't really talk, grabbed my arm, pulled me really close to her face, gave me *the* eyes, and said ""You're in my history class, right?"" Which seemed odd since I never spoke in that class, so it seemed curious that she would notice me unless I had caught her eye previously. So realizing she was drunk and flirting with me, I answered her question then said ""Hey, you're (blank)'s ex right?"" and that ended the interaction pretty quick after that. Caught her giving me the eyes in class a few time after that, but the situation ended well as my girlfriend arrived to the party shortly after that.

She even says *explicitly* to Monica ""No, we broke up"" when Monica asks her what happened. Rachel clearly took that as a break up. 

Then she asks him later if she can be his girlfriend again.

Journalism. Journalism in 2018 is hard to define. It seems that a huge portion of journalists, with formal educations, basically spend their days finding something mildly interesting on the internet and writing wildly exaggerated articles about it. I think the problem is that there are simply too many journalists in the US right now, so it's a hyper competitive and unrewarding field. Their success is measured by how many 'clicks' their articles get, so everything *has* to be over the top and extreme to attract readers. Of course, this also means that journalists will make far fetched and bold claims/accusations in their headlines, then play it down in the actual article to closer reflect reality. Every single event is also piggybacked to support/oppose some other issue.

There is so much meaningless noise surrounding every event that it drowns out the factual information. But until people stop believing headlines at face value, this is how it's going to be."

The reason is that most burglaries aren't like this one, that also includes at least one other crime and two witnesses, along with other potential evidence.

Evidence, outside of a list of items stolen that are usually unlikely to be unique enough to successfully track, is thin on the ground or nonexistent. 1/10 isn't that bad considering. "

4067,"For the Havard Paper;

The study‚Äôs findings include:

Countries with legalized prostitution are associated with higher human trafficking inflows than countries where prostitution is prohibited. The scale effect of legalizing prostitution, i.e. expansion of the market, outweighs the substitution effect, where legal sex workers are favored over illegal workers. On average, countries with legalized prostitution report a greater incidence of human trafficking inflows.

For the Gothenberg paper; 

7. Discussion and conclusion
Acknowledging that trafficking for sexual exploitation is an economic activity driven by profit motives and that state action or inaction is decisive for structuring profit possibilities, we develop theoretical predictions. Most importantly, we propose that slacker prostitution laws make it more profitable to traffic persons to a country and that the amount of trafficking will rise accordingly. Using cross country data we find clear support for our theoretical predictions: trafficking of persons for commercial sexual exploitation is least prevalent in countries where prostitution is illegal, most prevalent in countries where prostitution is legalized, and in between in those countries where prostitution is legal but procuring illegal. We then proceed to look at case studies of countries that have changed prostitution laws in order to shed light on the possible causal mechanisms. More specifically, we look at Sweden and Norway, which have both introduced harsher laws, and, as
predicted, trafficking seems to have been reduced in these countries. This study thus suggests that harsher prostitution legislation may reduce the amount of trafficking to a country. 

For the LSE paper;

Our quantitative empirical analysis for a cross-section of up to 150 countries shows that the scale effect dominates the substitution effect. On average, countries with legalized prostitution experience a larger degree of reported human trafficking inflows. We have corroborated this quantitative evidence with three brief case studies of Sweden, Denmark and Germany. Consistent with the results from our quantitative analysis, the legalization of prostitution has led to substantial scale effects in these cases. 


All the papers come to the conclusion that ""Countries with legalized prostitution are associated with higher human trafficking inflows than countries where prostitution is prohibited"" they do also suggest more research needs to be done. But until more research is done on the effects of legalisation. Its silly to change anything based on speculation."

We can't even treat workers fairly. Imagine a rideshare equivalent of hookers. How do you regulate that? Who's responsible for the damages to the bodies? (std, harm, etc.) Our corporate overlords would use the workers into the ground, then fire them when the liability got too high. Now you have people who's only life skill is selling their body, so they inevitably just go to underground prostitution again because no company will hire them. 

I like sex as much as the next person, but you've gotta remember that that hooker is a human and treating them like a commodity isn't good. "

4112,"It is regrettable that Lee chose the side he did, and it was, in fact, the biggest mistake he ever made in his life. Looking at it through the lenses of context at that point in history, it isn‚Äôt hard to imagine that men like him abhorred the idea and institution of slavery but still maintained that blacks were better off in America than in Africa. Abolition was a relatively new concept that had developed barely a decade before leading up to the war. There was always opposition to slavery since the founding of the country, but the abolitionist movement really began to take shape in the early 1850s as a serious force (see John Brown and also the Republican Party). It hadn‚Äôt quite caught on with the majority of the country, especially in the south - Lee‚Äôs Home. 

I think it‚Äôs important not to judge people from yesteryear based on today‚Äôs values/morals. Abraham Lincoln ultimately gave his life to free the slaves and save the union but he also held some views towards blacks that would be considered racist by today‚Äôs standards. 

Lee did what he thought was right. It was the wrong choice in the end, but we can still find admirable qualities in men whom made regrettable decisions. "

We are really close and I‚Äôm really happy that I can talk to him like that. 

I also have an older sister who doesn‚Äôt exactly avoid the topic but is kind of a bitch to me sometimes and doesn‚Äôt talk to me if I‚Äôm not around. I don‚Äôt like spending too much time with her because it‚Äôs always awkward (I‚Äôve spent the last two weeks with her in her house for research) and I‚Äôm really sad with how our relationship came out once she left home. 

If you want a relationship with your brother that you can look back on and go ‚ÄúI fucking love that kid‚Äù, just spend time with him, be open and make sure to talk to him as much as you can. My younger brother was always more of the jock type, but we‚Äôve always played video games together, starting with the Xbox playing halo and COD. 

Find something that you relate to him with and make sure to make lasting memories with him. I have plenty of memories with my brother from when we were kids, but none with my sister and that really breaks my heart because she is a cool person that gives me beers even when I don‚Äôt ask, but she is unapproachable to me due to our differing tastes.

4211,"In America, police pre-2012 would probably just lecture you on obeying your parents and take their word over yours no matter the situation, and probably make the situation worse with your parents and make them more aggressive. Thankfully CPS services and law enforcement have started to take children's accusations more seriously, and youth in this situation have a way out. "
4212,"I'm not a teen, but work with teens, and I agree. I have found that a lot of teens I personally work with don't know a lot about actual policies (as in, they don't read the bills, they don't know Supreme Court cases, they rarely know anyone who represents them at a state legislature or local level, etc). They know *news* about politics, and they know the biggest names, and they know big stories...so while I think some of the support, for either side, is genuine, a lot of it seems like kind of surface-level reactions. I think it's a good starting point--at least they're *aware* of what's going on, even if they don't have the history and nuance to their arguments, but we also just found out that our school system is eliminating Government classes from high school curriculum and rolling them into American History classes (which absolutely never make it all the way through to close-to-present day already), so I'm really frustrated by the lack of importance placed on teaching kids these things..."
4213,"There is a bible passage for this exact concept: 
1 The words of the Preacher,[a] the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
2 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher,
    vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
3 What does man gain by all the toil
    at which he toils under the sun?
4 A generation goes, and a generation comes,
    but the earth remains forever.
5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down,
    and hastens[c] to the place where it rises.
6 The wind blows to the south
    and goes around to the north;
around and around goes the wind,
    and on its circuits the wind returns.
7 All streams run to the sea,
    but the sea is not full;
to the place where the streams flow,
    there they flow again.
8 All things are full of weariness;
    a man cannot utter it;
the eye is not satisfied with seeing,
    nor the ear filled with hearing.
9 What has been is what will be,
    and what has been done is what will be done,
    and there is nothing new under the sun.
10 Is there a thing of which it is said,
    ‚ÄúSee, this is new‚Äù?
It has been already
    in the ages before us.
11 There is no remembrance of former things,
    nor will there be any remembrance
of later things yet to be
    among those who come after.

4214,"Not a landlord but I had A job in which I had to enter a lot of ""empty"" apartments and houses. 

There was one where you could see from the water damage that there was a weed farm. Also the left over jugs with weed growing water or something, they had weed logo's on them. 

Also wires from the from the streetlights to the house for tapping electricity. 

The funny part was that the dude was moved by the corporation that owned the house so they just called the police and they arrested him because surprise surprise he had a weed farm in his new house. 

On another occasion  I came in to inspect an empty apartment and the heater was on. Odd I thought. I looked further and there was a couch and a table with a phone on it. So somebody is living here. Which in my part of the world means I am trespassing. I get out of their and call the boss. While I am on the phone this GIANT angry looking man comes past me and goes in the apartment. 

He apparently copied his key and kept on living there, just without paying rent. He knew nobody would move in there after him because the building was scheduled for demolition a few months later. He was removed forcefully by the police. "

And I looked her dead in the face and said ""We didn't celebrate Christmas at _______(the local orphanage)"" She insisted on giving me a $20 tip.

The other one was while I was grocery shopping and the cashier was being trained by this super loud and bitchy manager who was openly super loud and bitchy to her employees every time I saw her. She wanted to show the new cashier ""how it was done"" and tried to guilt me into donating extra money to St. Jude's children hospital. I cut her off half way through and said no thanks I don't like kids, grabbed my bags and walked away.  It shut her up really fast. "
4221,"I have no experience with raiserbynarcissists, but I do with depression (and the sub), and I disagree with you. Most of the ""helpful"" things to do are pretty obvious, so unless someone is asking about them in particular, what is there to say? It is just going down a check list and in my experience it is like:

* Have you tried medication? - Yeah, it didn't work or had shitty side effects.
* Have you tried a therapist? - Yeah, a few, it didn't help.
* Have you tried eating better and exercising? - Yeah, it isn't a cure-all or No, I can barely get out of bed
* Have you tried talking to someone in your life? - Yeah, made things real awkward, or Yeah, they told me to smile more.

People feel hopeless not only because of depression but because the shit that is supposed to help end it often has effectiveness that varies wildly person by person. 

In your fellintoalake scenario, sometimes no one can see you and you are wearing fucking cement shoes, so none of the common wisdom really means all that much. Sometimes just being able to talk about it (though perhaps not under water, as you do need to hold your breath and all) and hear from others is helpful as it gives you insight into what you are feeling at a time when you may have no idea.

Also in my experience, people on the sub are very supportive when someone mentions things they are trying to do to better their situation. It never struck me as a toxic place where people buy into the crab-in-a-bucket mentality besides the occasional troll."

4246,"During my senior year of high school, my friend‚Äôs home life started to fall apart. His dad was a massive alcoholic who had lost most of their money day trading. His mom started to use the kids as weapons against their dad, leading to a Cold War type situation in the House. 



None of the kids wanted to take sides, but eventually each one was pulled into one scheme or another. They‚Äôd hide things, sneak things to secret storage units, go to events with one parent over the other etc. 



The most ridiculous situation came when their mother asked my friends little brother to steal the key to the mailbox and secretly get it copied at the hardware store. She claimed that the father was stealing her mail in order to make her miss important correspondences and look like an unfit mother for court proceedings. This was obviously crazy talk, but the brother had the key made regardless. 




A few months later, the mom asked my friends brother to copy the key again. Apparently the lock had been changed. She claimed that the father had bugged the house, was monitoring everyone‚Äôs texts, and was basically employing their little sister as a spy to have a full grasp on everything happening in the house. That‚Äôs how he knew the key was copied. More crazy talk. 




Well all this kept happening for a long time. We left for college and eventually came back the next summer. Due to other family drama it wound up that for about two weeks, my friend and his brother were living at home by themselves. Obviously they turned the house into a den of underage drinking and weed smoking. Soon someone had the idea to go looking for some of the bongs and weed paraphernalia that had been confiscated by the parents over the years.  



So we went into the fathers room. We found the bongs, but we also found so much more. He had an entire dresser full of unopened mail. He had stacks of printed out text conversations from every member of the family. He had surveillance equipment. He also had a bunch of weed and a double side dildo, but that part isn‚Äôt important. Turns out the mom wasn‚Äôt crazy "

4250,"I was reading on another thread earlier that this is actually a common - weird, but common - documented psychological phenomenon called [Genetic Sexual Attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sexual_attraction). 

When two people from the same family first meet as adults (whether or not they know they're related), their brain's wires can get crossed and they can feel overwhelmingly sexually attracted to their long-lost relative. When the feeling happens to be mutual (which it isn't always, there're many more cases where separated family members meet for the first time and do not fuck than there are cases where separated family members end up fucking), situations like this happen.

It seems like this is because people are generally more attracted to people who look like themselves, and people you're related to often look a *lot* like yourself. 

Still don't date your cousins, incest is bad and I'm not advocating for it etc., this is just one possible explanation for this type of incestuous relationship. Brains are weird."

Guarantee you they're all harping on spending and abortion in their campaign materials back in the home districts though. 

Democrats are the same way with minority constituents and poverty. Every major urban slum in America is run by Democrats and most of them have been for solid decades.

4293,Very true. One of their wedding gifts was a $1.6M apartment in New York City
4294,"Not exactly **won** but I think it still fits really well:
When a couple of years ago my phone provider started working together with another company and they merged, there was one day where the service was really buggy, I assume it's the day they transferred everything. I only noticed it because I tried to add some credit to my card and book a 150mb internet package for something like 3$ (I was quite young back then and internet was expensive). It took the whole day to add the amount to my card. (Card completely empty) Which was especially shit because I just happened to have a (small) plane ride over my foot and I needed to call my parents to take me to the hospital but without credit on my sim that wasn't too easy. Late at night I finally got the message that the ""Flatrate"" with 150mb was booked and the money was on my card. I was happy and didn't think about it further.

Couple of days later, I've noticed in the app, that the tracked usage of data wasn't changing, I basically got FREE unlimited High-speed data. I was worried that this would change the next month, but the error on their side just kept going.
I got (sometime back in 2014 or something) a data plan with Unlimited high-speed for 3$ a month. It was faster than our WiFi back then and I easily had 150+ GB of traffic (tracked in android)  each month without it slowing down or paying anything more. I had fun with that for roughly 1.5 Years. But somehow I forgot to add money to my sim and the ""Flatrate"" couldn't be booked automatically again which stopped the whole bug. Sadly. It still bugs me to this day that I just didn't setup some automatic account refill or something and didn't appreciate it. 

So yeah, there it went, my ""lifetime supply"" of unlimited data for really cheap.

It was pretty much confirmed in The Clone Wars that Jango was just a Bounty Hunter who wore Mandalorian armor and had no real connection to the Mandalorian people's. 
     
Since Boba Fett was a clone this would also mean that he is not.

When you look at the stated history of the Star Wars universe, you will see that this is a pattern. One side takes power. Light or Dark, doesn't matter. It doesn't bring peace but rather ushers in a new age of protracted warfare. The side in power eventually becomes weak and corrupt, falling to the might of the other side.

4351,"""How much for your women"""
4352,"I understand what you're saying, and I think to some extent that it's true. Feminists do generally (and understandably) focus on issues that effect women, but it's certainly not within the conceptual bounds of the movement to 'put men down in order to raise women up'.


I think a lot of men see feminism as an attack on their ego or their self, because it forces them to re-assess their biases and change their behaviours. I have to say though, as a middle aged white man myself, the ""dismissals of problems that white men face"" is often legitimate. I don't know how many times I've heard another guy say something like ""We can't even make rape jokes anymore, those feminists take all the fun away"", and then use that as evidence that ""white men have problems too"" because suddenly they're the ones being restricted. Similarly, I've heard many guys speak about the #metoo movement as an ""attack on men"" and how these women are just ""looking for something to complain about / acting the victim"". So in that respect, you can understand why feminists might be disinclined to take some mens rights movements seriously, because the things they often complain about are more accurately described as 'equality' and not 'white men problems'. **Equality will feel like oppression for the person who the inequality currently favours.**


That being said, there are a huge number of legitimate mens rights issues that can and should be addressed by legitimate mens rights movements. The legal system is inherently biased against men in a lot of ways, men successfully commit suicide more often (although try less frequently than women), men are more likely to be homeless, men are targeted for violence more often than women (although they are largely targeted by men), domestic violence against men is often not taken as seriously as domestic violence against women (although far more women are killed each year through domestic violence than men), etc. All of these issues are legitimate, and the existence of mens rights issues does not invalidate the existence of womens rights issues, where the opposite is also true."

4369,"Pride parades from the very beginning were about a rejection of acceptance by middle class tastes. Gay people were marginalized, discriminated against, and physically abused while attempting to campaign for mainstream acceptance. Just cross dressing in public was literally something you could be arrested for in the late 60s. 

The botched police raid of the stonewall bar and subsequent riots were a turning point where gay people began to organize en masse, and early gay pride parades were literal civil disobedience where people who had been imprisoned and abused for dressing in drag or homosexual acts walked the streets and did these things openly. The thought was that attempting to be polite about being gay, hiding from the public only allowed people to ignore the abuses that were going on. 

This transgressive element of the gay community has stayed a large part of it's culture in the US, especially around pride parades, and even as middle-class button-down gayness becomes acceptable there will always be an element that is happy to offend the public sensibility. It's a celebration of that initial act of disobedience which brought about so much positive change for gay people, and as a celebration of open sexual disobedience it's probably always going to be a little over the top."

4506,"Thank you for your in-depth reply. Can I ask?

You yourself say you don't notice the tiredness until it's over because of focus and stress. However, research does show clearly that most people do slow down and make more errors when tired or thirsty etc.. I am sure this greatly depends on the person, but realistically this would be happening with at least some surgeons. Why not, during such a loooooooong stretch, *make* time for everyone to have a pee and a sip? 


Obviously not while a patient is bleeding out. But during many of these loooooong operations, I imagine that people are mostly stable and thus maybe fare better by a team that can drink and pee in between? No?

4507,"Don't work for 911, but rather the non emergency line for the police. We get a lot of mentally ill people calling it and we usually recognize our regulars.

This one guy calls in and the call start out normally with him wanting to report something. He starts going on about how he's helping his neighbour paint etc, and I don't really think much about it, except that he's talking alot, and giving me way too specific details. Sure enough, after about 10 minutes the call derails into him being certain that his neighbour have copied his key and gone in to his apartment doing small things to terrorise him. Like painting his bathtub, putting glue on receipts, opening and then closing his mail. Crazy stuff. So I write a report, mainly so that the next operator quicker can understand that he's not well. I don't think more about it.

Fast forward a week and I'm working the night shift. This guy calls in again and now he's in a full blown psychosis. He's convinced that the neighbours are painting his knives, putting stuff on his clothes so he gets a rash, putting poison in his food and his meds. He's so frantic that I'm genuinely worried about him and his wellbeing. He lives alone, his son has been placed into foster care (he had a pretty long history of crimes and drugs) and he wasn't close to his family. I tried to convince the guy to go to the hospital, which he refused. He tells me he haven't slept for three days, and haven't eaten in two, because he's afraid the neighbour will trash the place if he sleeps/leave to get food.

I start calling our dispatcher to see if we can send a car. They can't. Basically, in order to place someone under forced psychiatric care they need to be a clear danger to themselves or others. And the dispatcher did not agree with my assessment of him being a danger to himself. I called social services, to see if they could do anything, to no avail. After trying to get this kid help for about an hour, I finally called an ambulance for him. That dispatcher was freaking awesome, so professional and completely shared my worries. And in the end, we had to send a patrol car over to assist the ambulance, since the kid had a history of being violent toward EMTs.

Sorry for wall of text. But it really stuck with me, that call. I've never in my life called an ambulance. But my gut feeling about this kid needing help wouldn't go away, so I'm glad that I did!"

I find it to be a really weird practice myself. I believe it is religiously and culturally driven. I surmise there's a kind of a ""dad was circumcised, I was circumcised, I guess that's the way it's done, so I'll circumcise my son too!"" momentum to it."

Which I was fine with, just something I thought we could have taken care of when the bill came, I was actually going to pay for the date anyway. He would not look at me in the eyes throughout the entire date, and barely spoke, which left me struggling to fill the silence with anything I could think of, and when I asked him his thoughts on the subject, I would just get a nod in agreement. When our food came, he scarfed his down in a matter of minutes, than complained to me that I took too long to eat and told me to ""hurry up already"". When we were finishing, I offered for us to go out drinking with some of my friends who were nearby, and he explained that he would rather just go back to his place (about an hour away). I told him I had work the next day and didn't really want to have to travel back late at night, but he kept insisting on us going back to his place. He was incredibly blunt and rude, and eventually I had to text my roommate to call me with an ""emergency"" to rescue me. The guy just gave me really weird vibes.

4527,"Eric Holder, Obama's attorney general that he appointed in 2009, made the argument after the financial crisis that the guilty financial institutions were ""too big to jail"". So there were no criminal prosecutions against the Wall Street companies that caused the whole crisis. The argument was that corporate instability or collapse could have unforeseen consequences on the economy. Now, the companies did get hit with huge fines (I think over a hundred billion dollars were paid back) but the whole thing was swept under the rug. We may never know exactly how these companies defrauded so many or did so much harm. To me, it is going to go down in history as Obama's biggest failure, and I voted for him. It was a huge disappointment to see the architects of the great recession get away with it, even more so now that Obama gets paid bank to give speeches to Goldman Sachs. "

4571,"Officially, a single disgruntled worker associated with the US bioweapons working group mailed Anthrax from a post-office distributing mail from Trenton, NJ. 

A buddy of mine was at another postal facility in Hamilton, NJ, when the anthrax attacks occurred, walked into the building and went to do some business, only to find a single mildly retarded woman opening a pile of distressed packages with a set of kitchen gloves and a spackling mask. 

When it dawned on him what she was doing , or what her co-workers had asked her to do, he just left the building. 

That's always stuck with me, because we'd like to think ""we have the best people"" working on problems, and in reality, nobody wanted an answer there. 

They were focused on 9/11 and not focused on that, so the way he mentioned it, they literally left it to a mildly retarded woman for several days to ""find the Anthrax"". 

He said he chatted with the woman for about 30 minutes while he was doing his paperwork he discovered that she didn't know the names of the towns around Hamilton, and had to be dropped off at work by her parents, he only stopped talking to her, when he realized what was **really** going on, and he still feels shitty about that nearly 20 years later.

To this day, he jokes about the fact that when he went to the doctor he says the doctor told him ""you better have a good story, I've seen 200 people this week and nobody has received Cipro"". According to my buddy during the entire anthrax scare he was the only patient of his doctor that received a prescription."

We were all so excited. Two months before Christmas, my sister and Jim broke up. My sister came to me sobbing saying that she was pregnant...and the child wasn't Jim's. Turns out she slept with Jim's friend and the child was his. Jim was so wonderful to my sister. He helped her pay for college, helped her buy a car, gave her anything she ever needed, ect...he truly did love her and anyone looking at the two of them together could tell. She is now raising the child with the love of her life's best friend and Jim wants nothing to do with her.

He was found hanging by a noose in the cold storage room by my auntie, the next morning. I feel so bad about what I said. I know it's not my fault, but it just makes you think of what the last words you might say to someone really are.

4580,"Jay stood 6 foot 6 as a freshman in high school, and probably weighed 290 at least; as his plucky friend, I would accompany him on many a misadventure.  Central to Jay's personality is his Mormon upbringing, and his almost Tarrare-like teenage appetite.  Enter the Food Court Challenge.

Our closest shopping mall was about 25 minutes away, and a trip there felt like visiting Oz.  Radio Shack!  Walden Books!  And of course, the food court: Sbarro's, Olga's (are there Olga's elsewhere in the United States?  Or is this a Michigan-only chain), Cinnabon, dubious Chinese, Arby's, One Potato Two, and a deli of some sort.  Jay had money to burn and I sensed entertainment to be had.  After we cruised through MC Sporting Goods trying to find a pair of roller blades for Jay (it was the early 90's), we headed for the food court.

Hey, I said.  Have you ever completed the food court challenge?

Of course not, he replied, because that is not a thing, or is at least a thing you just made up.

It is the latter, but I bet you cannot complete it: Eat an entree from every restaurant here within 30 minutes.  Your reward will be my admiration.

I will do this thing, he said.

In the end, I think it was the Chinese food which hamstrung Jay.  That day I learned just how strongly tile walls amplify the sound of a man vomiting his life away.

JWs use a practice called disfellowshipping to keep their members in line. If anyone breaks one of their rules, commits a ‚Äúserious‚Äù sin, decide they no longer believe, or disagree that their leaders, the governing body (literally 8 men in New York), are not spokesmen of Jehovah God, then your family and friends are ordered to shun you.

Combine this with the fact that Witnesses are discouraged from having friendships with non-Witnesses... This can be very devastating. Imagine losing all your family and friends in one moment. They will not speak to you. You are literally treated like you‚Äôre dead. This sort of behavior is in violation of basic human rights and has led to countless suicides.

Witnesses cannot have blood transfusions and thousands have died because of this doctrine. If you are a Witness and are hospitalized with a chance of receiving a blood transfusion, there will literally be a hospital liaison committee sent by the group to make sure you don‚Äôt break this teaching. Having a blood transfusion can lead to being disfellowshipped.

Leah Remini, the actress who has done an award winning series on the cult of Scientology, is going to do a special on JWs because the groups are very similar. Keep an eye out for it in the next year or two.

4614,"[George Remus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Remus) was a criminal defense lawyer in the days of prohibition. He was one of the first lawyers to try a ‚Äútemporary insanity‚Äù plea for murder. (It didn‚Äôt work)

But he defended all these moron clients who were getting rich. He figured he was smart, he knew he law, if these morons could do it, he could do it better. 

Remus memorized the prohibition laws and found loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmacies to sell liquor to himself for ‚Äúmedicinal purposes‚Äù. Then he‚Äôd have his own guys steal his own liquor so that he could sell it illegally. 

He ended up purchasing a lot of America‚Äôs largest distilleries and became known as the ‚ÄúKing of Bootleggers‚Äù.  He got super rich and threw crazy lavish parties giving guests diamonds and cars as door prizes.

Finally he gets in trouble, but only gets a slap on the wrist and has to serve 2 years. In prison, he befriends an undercover prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge (who was there to get more dirt on him). Remus tells Dodge that he put his wife in control of the whole operation and all his money.

What does Dodge do with this info? Why, he goes and fucks Remus‚Äô wife.  Then the two of them liquidate all of Remus‚Äô money and assets. By the time Remus gets out of prison, he‚Äôs absolutely broke. He files for divorce. 

On the way to court for the divorce, Remus spots his wife. He runs the car off the road, gets out and shoots his wife dead in front of everybody.

He goes to trial for murder, defends himself (he‚Äôs a criminal lawyer after all) and claims temporary insanity. And this time it works and he leaves a free man.

Tell me that‚Äôs not a Hollywood movie script that writes itself."

Although their 1700 text messages described hooking up multiple times, she only got charged with those two encounters. She called him her Baby Boo.

She was my 7th grade best friend that turned on me and made middle school miserable. I knew she was crazy and manipulative but when she got charged that pretty much proved it.

SpaceX might be pumping out rockets, but they aren't going to invest a dime into other subjects, especially raw research, because research doesn't turn a profit. (Also who is one of the main funding sources for private corporations? NASA)

A bunch of friends and I did an escape room at New York Comic Con last year, and it was spectacular, despite being basically a giant advertisement for Amazon. Basically there was an Alexa in each room, and you had to have her do things like turn on/off lights, do complicated math, relay messages to other ""operatives"", etc. 

There was one room that involved finding symbols to plug into a long-division equation, and it ended up being something like (2467+1)/7.  The spokeswoman in our group started to ask Alexa for the answer, but (and I know this is what she was thinking, because I was running on the same track) deciding that Alexa might get confused, broke the problem down into steps. The first being ""Alexa, what's 2467 plus one?""

As soon as the words left her mouth, she realized just how dumb that was, and her face just went blank with shock, in a perfect ""did I actually just say that?!"" expression.

4777,"Hate to say it, but my friend was the bully. His victim was another friend of mine (let's call him Tucker). Tucker was, at the time, still in the closet. 

Because we lived in the sticks, Tucker knew that he couldn't come out and instead dressed all emo and was super depressed which made him an easy target for bullies. I could tell something was up with Tucker and he wasn't the person he pretended to be. Away from school he was SUPER energetic and funny and didn't seem to be ""actually"" emo or goth. Years later, he would tell me that he only acted that way because he needed to be something other than what he really was. When I visited his house his room was filled with swords and knives and other sorts of objects of maiming. I never suspected him to do anything to others...no, it was clear he was self-harming. I tried to help but there wasn't much I could do

The bully, let's call him Zach, bullied Tucker relentlessly. It didn't seem like anything too major, he'd call Tucker by the wrong name (Things like Fucker), make fun of the clothes the kid wore, ask him stupid ass questions over and over again and generally do things that made the Tucker seem stupid or pretentious. Real baseline bully shit. No one major incident but instead 1000 smaller ones over the course of years. 

One Friday we had a free last period in the gym, and we were all sitting around shooting the shit. Zach notices Tucker sitting nearby and starts throwing paper balls at him. When Tucker would turn around to see what hit him, everyone would pretend that they were holding a conversation and didn't know what was happening. Eventually, Zach said something like ""Quit staring at me bro I don't swing that way."" Remember, Tucker was gay but nobody knew that at the time. 

Either way, I guess that was the tipping point. Tucker took out a pair of headphones from his backpack and started slowly walking towards Zach. Zach didn't know what was happening, so he kinda just stood there like a deer in headlights.  Tucker used the headphones like a garrote, strangling Zach until they snapped over. Everyone just kinda stared in disbelief. The release bell to go home rang. 

Most people got up and left but Zach and Tucker just stood there staring at each other with Zach spewing words of apology. ""I didn't mean anything by it, dude. Sorry dude. I didn't mean to upset you that much man, my bad."" 

At this point, I had left the gym because I didn't want to get caught up in what was happening and I had to catch my friend Jeff who was giving me a ride home. I have no idea what happened, but I hopped in Jeff's SUV and we were debating whether to listen to John Mayer's new album (barf) or RHCP's Stadium Arcadium. Suddenly we heard a knock on the back passenger window and heard Zach yelling ""Dudes open up, DUDES YOU GOTTA OPEN UP""

I turned and looked into the distance and saw Tucker full-on sprinting towards the vehicle. We unlocked the door and Zach hopped in, slammed the door and then locked the door again. Tucker reached the vehicle and started slamming his fist into the glass, attempting to break it. Zach, the petulant child that he truly was, immediately went back into bully mode and flipped Tucker off from the safety of the car. Jeff proceeded to lay the hammer down and get us out of dodge, because he was afraid Tucker was going to damage his mom's SUV. As we were leaving, I saw Tucker stand in the parking lot, now punching a telephone pole.

The weekend went by and we arrived back at school the following Monday. Somehow, the teacher's never caught wind of what happened, so there was no discipline issued. All the kids started treating Tucker with respect...more out of fear than anything else.

Years later, I'm still friends with Tucker. He's came out, received counseling He told me once that if he had gotten his hands on Zach he would have killed him. Something just flipped in his brain and it was the only option left to him. Needless to say...the bullies left him alone after that incident. "

I am very close to someone who is currently in rehab - it boggles my mind how almost villainized he is by friends, family, and coworkers when he says he doesn't want a drink.  People REALLY can't wrap their heads around the idea that someone may not think having a beer is a good thing.

So the school probably called up dad and told him either sign up for the programs or give your kid some damn lunch money. "

I always meet with my brides and grooms and try to get their expectations for the family photos. We always shoot with a list. Sometimes after talking about it we do trim the list down quite a bit or combine into larger groups if there is a large family.

The worst experience I had with the black shape was actually at night, not during the day. I tended to spend all my waking hours downstairs on our couch playing on my laptop, and I typically went to bed late, so it was near midnight when I would finally go upstairs to sleep.

Well, I went up one night to go get ready for bed, and for some reason I just did not want to open my bedroom door. I could see the light was on, I could hear my sister in the room next door, it should have been fine, but every ounce of me was just telling me that opening my bedroom door was a bad idea.

I went in anyways, because what else was I gonna do, sleep downstairs? I was tired, fuck the stupid scary feeling. I finally pushed the door open and froze.

The black silhouette was just standing in the middle of my room. There was nothing on the floor or anything, and the room was super brightly lit, so this thing was clear as day. I'd never seen it that brazenly out in the open before, and when it started walking towards me I slammed the door shut and ran into my sisters room, probably about the most scared I've ever been in my life. She normally would have kicked me out or griped at me for barging in, we were teenage siblings of course she would, but she let me stay in her room for a while to calm down without really questioning me on it. She mentioned at some point she'd been hearing footsteps in my room for a while, and had assumed I was already in there, pacing around for some reason.

4930,"A multiplayer (competitive, co-op or competitive co-op) strategy meets hack-and-slash with RPG elements where you could control troupe movements on a massive scale, and then also go down into a Dynasty Warriors type fight, or even lead your troupes from the ground as an officer, switching to different characters as they're killed or needed in different areas. Switching to lead roles would rally troupes if you're doing really well, helping surge lines where you're weak or falling back, and likewise doing poorly would lead to your troops losing courage/muster and potentially losing that particular fight/area/battle.

Realistic attack scenario regarding life would be a necessity also (IE if it takes you two hits to kill a bad guy, it takes two hits to kill whoever you are controlling in that moment). The ability to change the storyline by creating pacts, truces, agreements, or even interactions/relationships love/marriage would have to be included (with the storyline of love effecting how subordinates react to you (trust/distrust), and a Respect Meter you have to pay attention to before, during, after and between battles, with all your actions and in-battle leadership effecting your ability to lead those below you, and whether they will listen to your commands strictly. 

  
Throw in an intriguing and well written storyline (that you could still skip if you wanted to) where you take over an entire planet or continent thrown in, with political intrigue, and various motives to do so. Different storylines for each playable character, and motivations for what they're doing obviously ups the replay value. The usual tropes of course would be involved, poor kid who rises up for (insert Honor, Revenge, Glory, Love, etc., here), the rich madman/woman who is a power hungry egomaniac but also (insert Kindhearted and doing it for the people, thinks they're in the right, but wrong, etc. here).  But along with those tropes some fresh blood too. The ""Philosopher King"" who wants to unite the world in harmony, The ""Wrong Place at the Wrong Time"" General who got sucked into a world of politics he wanted no part of but now has a taste for it"", The Battle Hardened Priest/Cult Leader who is actually insane from seeing so many of his followers and leaders killed, The Child Monarch who really doesn't understand why things are happening, but is being lead by their ""counselors"", etc., etc.

What's great is this could work in sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction, etc., and it could be an amazing game. I've thought about this for a long time,  doubt we'll ever see something like it though.

Edit: Online and solo modes within a persistent world would also be a must, for both pick-up-and-play battle matches, or more in-depth alliances and battles."

I put my knife down, took off my cut glove and told her she should do it if I'm always wrong. She proceeded to try, and fail miserably. I pulled out the cut chart and showed her that her cuts were way too big. She still yelled at me saying not to question her.

First there were catalogs for porn and sex toys. They had dog eared pages, and items circled like a wish list. Most of the stuff circled was swinging movies and stuff like that.

Then I found letters in the envelope. There were maybe a dozen or so letters from different women, attached with Polaroids of themselves naked or scantily clad. All the letters were addressed to my parents, thanking them for a good time, and asking when they can do it again. At first I thought it must be some kind of junk mail that would come into their PO Box. Then I realized all the return addresses were from cities we used to live in.

I work for a company that ran a ""...for a year"" promotion, and we decided that a reasonable person might use our product once a week. 

So they won coupons for 52 bags of our product. 

Considering that:

- Most people wouldn't consume our product more than 1-2 times a week
- One unit of product typically isn't consumed in a day

It was a fair payout. 

And it cost us next to fucking nothing. Massively successful promotion. Cost us the price of 9 cases of product. Winner wasn't ""shorted.""

To suggest 1 bottle of beer per month is an insult. In fact, few reasonable people consider that to be, well, reasonable. There are laws that govern these type of promotions (which is why we run all our promotions through an agency), and this seems to me to be actually probably illegal. 

You can't promise the public ""a new car!"" not specify the fact that it's a toy car, and then run a promotion that's so grand that one can reasonably expect a new car.

""The so-called ‚Äòpsychotically depressed‚Äô person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‚Äòhopelessness‚Äô or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‚ÄòDon‚Äòt!‚Äô and ‚ÄòHang on!‚Äô, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."""

He'd do that basically every time, something didn't went as he wanted it to.
Always wondered where a child would learn this kind of behavior, but after a round of Yahtzee with his mum, there were no questions left.
As you can imagine, spoiled brat wasn't a fan of losing. Even more, spoiled brats goal when playing Yahtzee, always was to roll a double with sixes.
So far, so unrealistic. When spoiled brat enthusiastically shook the dices, in his last attempt to get a boxcar, you could already see a glimpse of pure madness in his eyes. You knew he desperately wanted the dices to bend to his will, and if they won't, somebody's going to get hurt. 
The dices fall and dare to disappoint.
Me and my coworkers look at each other, knowing we'd now see another performance of the well known play.
He's screaming, jumping up, runs into the kitchen, buries his face in his hands and starts to moan and cry, proving a talent for acting, that wouldn't even have landed him a role as a tree in a Kindergartens play.
As I'm nearest by, I know it's now my turn to navigate him through the stormy sea of emotions, with just the right amount of strictness, intransigence and leniency, in hope to get him to calm down.
But suddenly, there comes my alleged savior, my life buoy, his mom enters the room.
Released I think to myself ""ok, this little fucktard is your fucking problem now, see how will handle this, I'm out."" 
And then, I overhear a real gem of parenting: ""Noooo sweetie, don't cry."" (Just to mention it again, and I can't point it out enough, he wasn't actually crying, just horribly acting).  ""It's fine, you'll win sweetie, don't worry, come back and we'll see if you'll get your boxcar."" 
My coworkers and I look at each other, stunned wether this woman has ever even heard of the theory of education or fair play or anything like that.
They go back to the table, but she doesn't, like expected, give him another try, no, she skips that useless part and directly starts to REARRANGE THE FUCKING DICES, turning all the sixes up, and cheers with just the same amount of talent in acting we witnessed in her son many times before ""Yeeeeaaaaaaaah, you got it, we just didn't watch right, you had a boxcar all along!!!!"" 
Again, me and my coworkers look at each other, knowing that someone should teach that woman a lesson, but also knowing, that that is not our job, nor are we allowed to, so in pure despair we just accept, that most of our work and effort in educating that child, is in vain as long as master-mummy is still in charge.
Unnecessary to mention, every time we  told Master-mummy that her son has again crushed a door (11 in one year btw), or his radio, or beaten another kid, or one of the coworkers, or took a shit in the sink, she would just not believe it and be like ""nooooo, my little angle is always so sweet and lovely, he would never do anything like that""

TL;DR : spoiled brat throws fake temper because of not winning Yahtzee, master mummy rearranges the dices "

Once you let go and come to terms with the fact that your anger won't change what happened and that its only hurting you, you've achieved forgiveness.

I didn't like working w/ her at first because when you work in a soul-crushing job, people that enjoy it are annoying. (To this day, she says that if the money was right, she would have worked there the rest of her life. She loved it.)

I was interested in some physical features, and we spent a lot of time working together and over time, I started to appreciate her dedication... kind of. I never grew to care that much, but it was cool seeing someone care. 

About 6 months in, I was driving to work and saw a lady pass out while driving a slam into a fence. I stopped and helped her, and while I was helping, my now wife was driving by (Her day off) and wanted to make sure I wasn't involved. It was the first time I had ever seen her outside of work and in normal clothes. That was when my crush got going. A couple of months later, she asked me to a movie and it was the last first date I ever had. A few months after that, I got a new job (That I ended up hating) and left, she got a CNA license and we both left the restaurant. 

She and I got married, I started working in IT, and when she had our oldest, we figured the finances were good (but tight), so she stayed home. With being a CNA where we live, over half her check would have gone to day care anyways. Had #2 last year. "

Both just crying while my sister kept repeating ""I don't like this, why did you choose this one?"". I just kept saying ""I don't know, I'm sorry!"".

I wasnt going fast enough so she said she was going to the car to wait for me. On her way out, she swung her arm down (think like throwing something underhanded) and slapped me in the face. I was probably 7 or 8.

The rest was just general emotional abuse. She'd mock me and my brother after mentally tearing us down until we cried. Told us we were the reason our dad was leaving her. Told me that we'd never get along so we can just wait until I'm 18 and never see each other again. Any shortcomings my brother or myself had was loudly announced to her friends on the phone and/or posted on Facebook.

5392,"A few stories that are all supernatural in nature, but first a small bit of context.  The house I grew up in was located in a small town of about 700 people and as time passed I noticed that almost everyone avoided it.  I never gave that much thought until some kid let slip up that supposedly a coven of witches had practiced there and had sacrificed two kids.  Creepy.

There were several occurrences that raised my suspicions that there might have been some truth to that story.  For one, being naturally curious I would regularly explore the house and ended up stumbling upon a loose board in the attic.  Upon further inspection I found a large snake skin that had to be 7 ft long and 3 inches wide.  The more I paid attention to these occurrences the more they amped up in severity.

One night my buddy and I were sleeping in the living room and woke up to loud beeping.  We had left the cordless off the hook and upon inspection of the screen it was dialing 666666... repeatedly.  In shock I took out the battery and it kept dialing!  We ended up breaking the phone to stop it and when we woke up the next day the sofa had been slid away from the wall a good foot.

Unfortunately it got even worse from this point on, culminating in a door nearly shaking off of its hinges on my back porch while I was filling my dog‚Äôs food bowl.  Thinking it must be my dad pranking me I quickly opened it up after the shaking stopped and no one was there.  We ended up calling in a fiercely religious man to bless the house and he got 5 feet into the house before giving us the ‚Äúnope‚Äù face and leaving.  My entire childhood I was terrified of the paranormal and that house.  I had mini prayers that I taped above my windows and doors and slept next to a bible.

Edit: Now come to think of it I do recall a glowing red orb floating around in the laundry room one night.  I never went back to that house when I moved out and felt like a huge weight was lifted off of my chest."

She was a wonderful person (her *begging* the Doctor to save just one person from Pompeii just kills me every time) who found an amazingly perfect friend who took her on wondrous adventures and all she ever wanted was to just keep adventuring and seeing all that she could see with her bestie. Then, through a complete accident, she's forced into a state of ""Forget about all of these wonderful things that happened to you forever or *die*."" I ugly cried when he told her family that ""For one shining moment, she was the most important woman in the whole wide universe."" It also choked me up when she almost started to remember during ""End of Time"" and he pointed out that he'd put precautions in place because she was his best friend.

I'm glad that she got a happy ending, and the doctor borrowing a dollar from her dead father to buy her a winning lottery ticket for her wedding was possibly the sweetest thing I've ever seen, but I'll always be sad that Donna can never return, or know about any of it."

And they were both whispering to each other, then the guy started to get closer to me, at this moment I used my blanket to protect me and started telling them to go away. After awhile the whispering stopped, I spied under the blanket and they were gone.

I asked him how he would feel if I loosened the bolts holding his wheels on and he didn't see any comparison.

I found the wheel behind the building after probably an hour of searching everywhere.

I went out for lunch one day and passed by his car. Popped the hood and disconnected his battery.

For background, my dad has long hair and a bushy beard, both of which are going grayish-white. He lives in WV where people are very friendly and talkative, like saying hi when they pass you in a grocery store aisle if it's not crowded.

So he was at the little town grocery store and passed a woman who had her little girl in the cart. The kid was in a fussy mood and having a fit about something. The mom had noticed my dad, and said quietly to the girl, ""hey that's Santa Claus, and if you don't start acting right, he's not going to bring you any presents this year!"" He overheard this, and the girl looked at him, and he looked right at her and gave her the ""no"" index finger gesture. She looked really shocked and sat up really straight and quiet. The mom gave my dad a wave and went on about her shopping."

I got yelled at for not knowing what aisle something was located in... The kicker is, I was a customer myself. I didn't work there.

Was just browsing the LEGO section at my local WalMart, it was a rather quiet day so the store was actually pretty empty, when a man and a woman stopped and asked me where something (Forgot) was, I thought for a moment and told them what aisle it was most likely in.

Then another woman stepped up and asked me where something was. I didn't know exactly, but I told her the general area where I thought it was.

Then ANOTHER woman asked me where something was, and I had no idea. I told her straight up I had no clue. She went from pleasant (Kinda) to instantly ENRAGED and started yelling that as an employee I should know where everything was!!! I was like ""uhh... I'm not an employee..."" but she kept ranting that it's my job and she was gonna talk to my manager for not knowing where stuff is and walked off, completely ignoring my protests that I wasn't an employee.

I still have no clue to this day why she thought I was an employee. My only guess is she heard me answer the other 3 peoples questions and assume I guess? I was wearing blue jeans, and a green T-shirt. So nothing about my apparel would have said ""Hey, I'm an employee""."

But one thing that stands out is an old family friend who approached me at the funeral and simply asked what had happened (my mother had died of a heart attack, and he was curious). He talked about his own heart issues, and we just kinda chatted for a couple of minutes. It was a bit of a trip because I'd always revered this guy, but we'd never had any real reason to talk. For me, I guess it was sort of being acknowledged as an adult for the first time. 

Perhaps weirdly, it's one of my favorite memories of that otherwise sad time. 

**TL;DR** If you're wondering what you should say to a person who has lost a loved one, just treat them normally. Chances are they're feeling like their lives have been turned upside down, so treating them any differently is probably the last thing they need. Just talk, and you'll probably find your condolences will come sincerely and naturally.

5536,Personally it's not a constant fear of being raped but knowing how quickly a guy can be to harass you when you're alone.

5537,"My first year of Economics in University.  It was my first ""holy FUCK!"" revelation.

In high school, I got good grades, didn't apply myself, was just pretty good at math and didn't really ever have trouble.  Because I found math easy, I went to post-secondary for Economics and Math.

My Microeconomic Theory class had 240 students in it.  I worked about as hard on that class as I did in high school - the basic assignments I did reasonably well, but the final exam and paper I had to do, I got a D+ on.

I instantly got this huge wash of nausea when I realized how fucked I'd be if I kept this up.  Class average was a B, so I'm probably in the bottom 15-20% of the class.  This is ONE course section out of 3, so about 600+ students, at one University, in Canada, and the Economics program wasn't anything special at this school.

If even 1/3 of the class graduated, the AMOUNT of students getting that Economics degree that I'd be competing against for a job is DISGUSTING when you expand the sample size to all Economics programs across all Universities in North America.

I NOPED out of that program, and rethought what I really wanted to be doing.

Coasting only gets you so far - and if you keep it up, there's a really good chance later on that'll it hit you like a ton of bricks that you're really not happy with yourself."

5540,"Carl is the guy who has been there since Viet Nam ended; for a modern version, he's a Gulf War I vet. He has faded blue tattoos up his arms, but nobody asks what they mean, because they only ever see them by accident, when he rolls his sleeves up in the bathroom to wash his hands. Suffice to say, rumors abound. 

Nobody can say for sure what he does, but he's been there as long as anybody can remember. He dresses practically, yet appropriate enough for him to be called into boardroom meetings on the off chance that there are questions that need answered. He's been with the company longer than anyone, so if anyone knows, Carl will. 

He's a family man, in the tradition of his generation: wife, two kids, white picket fence and a dog. He brings cookies to work every so often, homemade, from his wife, and they taste of childhood memories, of summers long past. Those few, those lucky few who have been to his house tell that it's a modest but impeccable home, and they speak of the pride Carl has in his fiscally modest yet emotionally rich existence. 

Carl has two sons, and he'll tell you of anecdotes that he's gleaned from fatherhood, his long yet successful marriage, his military service, and his time with the company (despite nobody knowing what he actually does). Each tale has a grain of wisdom that appears when you need it most, and when you take his advice, your life goes for the better.

5551,"I did a speech in college about dog breeds. If you look at, for example, a German Shepherd dog in the early 1900s compared to today, you can see the differences in the spine (more slouched) and its hips are dysmorphic.

It's the same with Bulldogs, like you said. Females are unable to give birth naturally because the skulls are too large for the birth canal. They can't even mate naturally. To top it off, the life expectancy of a bulldog is around six years. Six years! If that isn't a hint that maybe this breed shouldn't exist, then I don't know what is.

The more the dog breed resembles a wolf, the healthier the dog will be. Today though, they say that a well-mixed mutt is going to be the healthiest dog you'll find."

Everyone including myself was pretty shocked. I won the lottery out of all my siblings because i have the best parents and most opertunity. Im glad i was given up but the question of why never goes away. I asked about my bio dad and im 99% sure she doesnt even know who he is so i stopped asking and i dont talk to her anymore.

My ex abused me all through our marriage. I don't think he's ever abused his new wife. Why the difference? He likes her. 

It's very painful to admit to yourself, but finally I admitted to myself that he simply never loved me. Not at all. I had to keep reminding myself of that many times, thru tears.

But now, many years latter, and no longer having the repeated damage in my life of him talking to me on the phone and reminding me how much he despises me, it all makes sense to me. Every time I remember a bad time with him, I can now cover it with, ""Well of course he was awful to me - he didn't like me!""

Now it all makes sense and I don't feel crazy anymore.  He basically wanted someone to clean and fix up his house, cook his dinner, watch the kids, give him sex,  and then go away. He didn't want to have a relationship with me, but that's the hard part of any marriage,  the relationship part. "

Really good stuff too. The only problem is that the owner is a total wackadoodle. I think he went to Woodstock, and never quite made it home... 

So I buy like four jars of apple and pumpkin butter, because I fucking love that shit, and a couple of apples, and a jug of cider because my girlfriend wanted it. It ends up being like $27 or something. So I give the guy two $20s, and he gives me two $5s. So I'm like 

""Not quite.. I gave you $40 right? "" 

He agreed to that, and gave me another $5. 

""Uhhh, nope... "" 

And this goes on and on for a while until I pulled out a pen and a sheet of his receipt paper and did the math on paper in front of him and got my correct change. 

This was also incredibly awkward, because I'm trying to make a good impression on my girlfriend and her mom... So do I let it slide and look like a little bitch? Or do I press the issue and look like a tight wad??

I always commented to other coworkers that it was hands down the ugliest baby I had ever seen. I wasn't trying to be mean either. To this day, the ugliest baby I have ever seen. And I remember commenting something wasn't right in their situation but I also wasn't sure what it was.

One day, she disappeared. We tried calling her several times but the line had been disconnected. Just gone. About 3 days later, the owner of the restaurant we worked in said that CDFS came in to talk with her. Said that the woman and her husband were on the run because of child abuse and neglect and CDFS came to my boss trying to find information on them. Said this was the 3rd case against them (we had no idea she even had other children since she never mentioned them).

But the real weird kicker was that the reason the guy was so much older than her was because he was her father. They had entered a sexual relationship when she turned 18 and had been together for nearly 10 years at this point. They were having incest babies (PROBABLY the reason the baby was so ugly) and had the first 2 already taken away for neglect and abuse. They were apparently always on the run. A concerned neighbor (who knew nothing about their past) reported them to CDFS because they realized the baby was being neglected. 

Not sure if they ever found them or not but, man, was the whole situation unsettling."

5711,"Hey thanks! I don't mind elaborating at all. Since this is a relatively new development in my life, I get quite a bit of catharsis from telling strangers on the internet about it! 

Starting at puberty and up until a year ago I'd been experiencing mild-to-moderate joint pain as well as nausea and fatigue that no amount of medications, general doctors and blood tests could figure out. Then at one point, the pain suddenly got so bad that I could barely walk unaided which prompted me to take myself through an emergency room.

At that point I thought it was all no big deal, probably an ankle sprain or fracture that never healed properly. Up until then, doctors had been telling me that all this (then, manageable) pain and fatigue was from stress and depression. The staff at the ER did not share my views and did, in fact, freak out about my symptoms.

About four or five rapid referrals, several enthusiastic med students, a cardiac ultrasound, five x-rays, a bunch of blood tests and another emergency room visit later, I was formally diagnosed with an inheritable gene disorder that prevents me from forming collagen properly. It's called ehlers-danlos, it hurts a lot, but I am extremely lucky in that I only have the mildest form of it, hypermobile type. So instead of organ ruptures and prolapses, I only have to deal with joint instability, constant subluxations and dislocations, amongst other less painful but equally troublesome features.

Also that ""ankle fracture or sprain"" was actually the result of a third degree ligament rupture that should have required hospitalization but I somehow managed to walk off.

All of this to say that I am pretty tough but I cry a lot. Thank you for reading my sob story!"

One morning he was sitting on the couch in his robe (he usually had a very strict morning routine he followed so him just sitting on the couch was unusual) and was complaining of a migraine. Within minutes the pain was spreading down his body and he thought he was having a stroke, so my mom rushed him to the hospital. He was seen immediately and it was determined that he was having a brain aneurysm, so he was life flighted to a larger hospital. Upon arrival at the larger hospital, he had another brain aneurysm burst. And then a third a few days later. Doctors never expected him to survive the first 2, let alone a third. He had a 3 month stay in the hospital and was in a medically induced coma for a good chunk of his stay. 

He made a full recovery, but forgets things a lot and seems to have lost his will to live and continues making self destructive decisions. He has to get an angiogram every 6 months or so and doctors say he is still at risk. Unfortunately it's probably just a matter of time before he has another. "

Has your heart started racing though your legs refuse to? Have you ever felt time slow as the creature crosses the room in the darkness of a blink?

Have you shuddered with fear when it places one clawed hand atop your head and another under your chin so it can tilt you, exposing your neck? Have you squirmed as its rough, dry tongue slides down your cheek, over your jaw, to your throat in a slithering search that's seeking your artery? Have you felt its hot breath release in a hiss against your skin when it probes your pulse - the flow that leads to your brain? Has its tongue rested there, throbbing slightly as if savoring the moment? Have you ever then experienced a sinking, sucking blackness as you discover that not all vampires feed on blood - some feed on memories?

Maybe not. But let me rephrase the question:

5739,"I made this comment elsewhere, so I'll just copy-paste it here:

My house was built in the 1850s. It scared the piss out of me and my brother so many times as children. Not so much anymore though. But there was one time in my early teens when I was just about to fall asleep. My cat was in his usual spot (right beside my pillow, on the side of my bed opposite the wall), and I was facing him and my door. My door has this sweet spot where it is only open partway, but won't move unless pushed by someone with enough strength (so, not my cat). This way, my cat could come and go as he wished, and I also simply liked having a door not quite open but not totally closed back then.

I'm not quite near sleep, but I'm close enough that I'm comfy and don't want to move for anything. But then I hear an odd squeaking. It's nothing I've ever heard before, and it sounded close. I listen closely, but can't decipher what it is, and the sound never faltered. So, I decide to open my eyes. Immediately I notice my door is gently rocking back and forth, maybe a few inches in each direction. I kind of sit up a bit, and notice even George is staring at my door. He didn't seem alarmed, but he was definitely paying attention. I sat up a little more, and watched it for a moment. It stopped. We always have a fan set up in the hallway as background noise, so I wondered if something was set up differently tonight and making an odd air current (we keep windows closed, so it wasn't affected by that). I lie back down and close my eyes. It only takes a few seconds, but the squeaking starts up again. I open my eyes, and once more the door is moving. George is watching. But then the door stops. I was much more into spirits back then, so I whispered ""please stop"", stared at it for a moment more, then rolled over to have my back to it and closed my eyes. By this time, George had lost interest in the door.

A couple minutes pass by. I believe I'm in the clear. Nope - it starts up again. I start to feel like I'm dealing with some annoying pet, or a stubborn child. This time, I get up and open the door all the way. I say ""please, stop moving the door"" while standing beside it for a moment. I get back in bed, and it never happens again. Ever.

While I still believe in the paranormal, I'm a skeptical person. And I'm not jumping around insisting this was a ghost or something. But despite that, air currents doesn't seem right. My door is heavy, and without any windows open to let in the wind, the fan could never make suction strong enough to move it. And fans have never done that before or since. But I can't say it was 100% paranormal. I don't even know if I could believe it was. But it still freaks me out."

5741,"The Supreme Court and the judiciary has the power to block a presidential order, if and only if someone brings it to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court will only block an order if it's expressly unconstitutional.  As in, it may be harmful to the country, but it's allowable as long as it's constitutional.

The main body that can limit the president is Congress.  Congress may overrule and impeach the president at any time they wish, for any reason that they wish.  Congress has not done so.  At this point, it's safe to assume that Congress has not done so because they like the president.

This brings us to the last option: an election.  At election time, the American people may vote some of it's government into power.  This doesn't merely include voting, it also includes campaigning.

However, campaigning has been made more difficult of late because of the large amount of disinformation sown within the United States.  There is a large minority of Americans who are not aware of the significance of Donald Trump's actions.  These people may be sufficient to keep the president in power.  The only way to break the hold of propaganda on these people is to shatter the illusion, by proving to them that they've been lied to.

If you can figure out how to prove to them that they've been lied to, you could become a very important person in American history."
5742,"""Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief. We was comin‚Äô back from the island of Tinian to Leyte. We‚Äôd just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vess getel went down in 12 minutes.
Didn‚Äôt see the first shark for about a half-hour. Tiger. 13-footer. You have know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin‚Äô from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn‚Äôt know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn‚Äôt even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin‚Äô by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin‚Äô and hollerin‚Äô and sometimes that shark he go away‚Ä¶ but sometimes he wouldn‚Äôt go away.
Sometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he‚Äôs got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll‚Äôs eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn‚Äôt even seem to be livin‚Äô‚Ä¶ ‚Äôtil he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then‚Ä¶ ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin‚Äô. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin‚Äô and your hollerin‚Äô those sharks come in and‚Ä¶ they rip you to pieces.
You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don‚Äôt know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour. Thursday mornin‚Äô, Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson‚Äôs mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he‚Äôd been bitten in half below the waist.
At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol‚Äô fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin‚Äô for my turn. I‚Äôll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.‚Äù

Maybe since you have ones that last so long, see if you can journal/log their typical progress and symptoms?

5816,"Not to mention that for hunting regular game animals (especially deer), hunters are integral to keeping the population at manageable levels. Deer don't have too many natural predators left, as all their predators (wolves, mountain lions, etc) have been driven out for being too dangerous to humans. With no natural predators to keep them in check, deer populations naturally explode, rapidly rising until the ecosystem can no longer sustain a population of that size, resulting in a massive die-off as much of the population starves to death.  Meanwhile, the underbrush is stripped, the plant population is stressed by the overeating (making it susceptible to disease and insects), and deer-car collisions increase. The effects of such a drastic population change (both the rising and the die-off) ripple outwards and affect the whole ecosystem, often negatively. 


But hunting prevents that from happening. The DNR doesn't hand out unlimited hunting licenses- the number of licenses issued each year is carefully calculated to keep the deer population in check without depleting it, with the money collected from them used to fund further conservation efforts. Hunting isn't just ""shooting an unarmed animal,"" it's humans playing a natural roll in the ecosystem- the roll of a limited number of predators, keeping the prey population for outstripping the available resources.

Yes, the occasional binge drinking episode doesn't mean you're a hardcore alcoholic, but if you're regularly binge drinking, then that's one of the first warning signs of alcoholism. Alcoholism is part genetics and part bad habits, so as long as you're not regularly binge drinking then you should be fine. But if you binge drink every time you get drunk, even if you don't get drunk that often, that's still a warning sign. That doesn't mean you'll definitely develop alcoholism, it just means that you should start being a little more careful. "

5990,"I fully understand being sympathetic to the Iraqi people and opposing the American intervention, but Saddam is personally responsible for the deaths of millions of people.

While life might have been decent for most of the Iraqi populace, don‚Äôt forget the brutal invasion and pillaging of Kuwait in 1991, or the hundreds of metric tons of Sarin gas Iraqi units fired against Iranian targets, including civilian population centers, in the Iran-Iraq War (not to mention the death toll from conventional Scud attacks and Grad bombardment) Or his genocide of Kurds in Northern Iraq which lasted nearly a decade and claimed tens of thousands of victims, often specifically targeting civilian families in deliberate acts of ethnic cleansing.

TL;DR just because America creates a narrative about a character as propaganda to further their own interests, it doesn‚Äôt mean the original person is a saintly victim of western imperialism.

6005,"It was back in college. I was sharing this 2 bedroom apartment near campus with another guy. He was a pretty chill dude, studied a lot and didn't party a whole lot, but when he did he was pretty lightweight.  


  One Friday night some of the other bros came over and passed a joint around at one point. I just took a single puff because that stuff makes me go to sleep really fast. Roomie takes more than a couple and then drinks a beer on top of that, and he is pretty trashed really quickly. The other guys take off after a while.   

Now I am already feeling the effects of the hit so I decided to crash. It was late spring and pretty hot so I just stripped naked and climbed into bed.   

Sometime way early in the morning I kind of half wake up to things. One is that my morning wood is there is super hard. Then  I feel this kind of wet sensation on the end of it. I groggily open my eyes and to my shock I see my roomie sitting next to the bed. He was very lightly holding the end of my cock in his fingertips while he was kissing and licking the head of it.    

Naturally I freak out since I am straight and up until that moment I thought the roomie was too. I said something like ""hey WTF!"" Dude looked so scared at that point, he bolted straight out of the room.   

So finally I put on some pajama bottoms and a t shirt and stumble out into the kitchen so I can deal with what just happened. Roomie is making coffee and when he sees me he looks really sheepish and immediatley starts apologizing and saying that he is still kind of fucked up from the night before and didn't know what he doing. He said he smoked some  more after I went to sleep and then he went into my room and saw my hardness and for some reason just wanted to see what it would feel like to have it near his lips and he didn't think I would wake up because I am usually dead to the world when I sleep after partying. So I am standing there listening to all this, and I am starting to respond that none of what he said made any of this cool, when my roommate started giggling and laughing uncontrollably. I asked what the fuck was so funny and he started pointing at me as he could not stop laughing long enough to talk,  

I looked down and noticed there was a tent in my pajamas. My morning wood was still there. "

6026,"I worked with a guy at a temp job in a warehouse  we called him Captain America. he was about 5,4 110 pounds soaking wet. He was also apparently the most accomplished soldier in American history. He was a navy seal, army ranger, and a marine sniper. He was also apparently part of some black ops team so secret he couldn‚Äôt tell us the name of it. All At the age of 25. He had killed hundreds with everything from a sniper rifle to a napkin and been personally thanked by president Obama. But by far his most ridiculous lie was about a secret ammunition dump in Alabama. 

About a week before we were set to get laid off he announces that he wouldn‚Äôt be seeing us anymore. At this point I couldn‚Äôt wait to hear what bullshit he was gonna spout. President Obama had contacted him and decided to bring him out of retirement to guard a secret ammunition dump in Alabama. He couldn‚Äôt tell us anything more because we didn‚Äôt have clearance. Fast forward two weeks and we‚Äôre coming back from being laid off for a week and who do we see but captain America himself. Of course we ask him why he wasn‚Äôt guarding the secret ammo dump against the Russians or Iranians or whoever he made up was try to get to it. This is what he said. 

When he got there he saw how shoddy the security system was so he took it upon himself to upgrade it. In a week He designed and installed a brand new system complete with laser turrets, force fields, and a cloaking device that covers the base. The president was so impressed that he was relieved of duty and sent back home. To ‚Äúawait further instructions‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt like sitting at home and receiving a paycheck for his guard duties so he decided to come back to work. He also sold his security system to the us government for an undisclosed amount. 

He got really pissed at us because we were all laughing at him by the end. Of course no one believed him but he swore up and down in a week he invented force fields and cloaking devices for the us government. "

6042,"I think about this sometimes, as my parents once had to make a similar decision. My sister was diagnosed with brain cancer when she was one year old. Much of the next year was spent in and out of the hospital with my parents doing everything they could to care for my sister but also not neglect my brothers.

At one point, the neurosurgeon told my parents there was an experimental procedure they could try. He estimated a 40% chance of success. Best case scenario, it would extend my sister's life by six months, though during those months she would almost certainly be full-time hospitalized, still very ill, and basically not able to have a meaningful life.

My parents wrestled with the decision, but they ultimately decided not to have the procedure done and just make the best of whatever time my sister had left. But that's not an easy decision to have to make and I certainly don't envy anyone who's faced with it.

The ultimate kick in the pants of this all, though? My sister died in 1988 but the particular type of cancer she had is now fully treatable if caught early enough. In almost all cases, the tumor can be removed and the child goes on to live a full life."

I saw a last name that looked familiar in the Peds ED (it was my best friend's last name).  The next morning I got a page from our secretary that my friend had called looking for me.  His 18 month old daughter had fallen in their pool.

The next 24 hours were tumultuous and somewhat of a blur.  I recall telling him there was no chance she would recover.  He said he knew, but did not know how his wife would take it.

Later that day, they decided to withdraw care.  There were about 8 of us in that ICU room.  The mother was holding her daughter when they disconnected the ventilator.  We were all crying except her.  She was so stoic, just holding her and telling her how much she loved her as she died."

6055,"Part of it is simpler than you think. To test if medication destroys mucosal membranes (like humans have in the intestines, the eye, the vagina,..) we need some tissue that is similar. Rabbits procreate fast, and have an two eyes that have a nice size for testing. If you want to know if a certain component does damage the mucosal layer, you have to test it first on a mucosal layer, why not take something that has a reasonable size and is easily available. If the eye of the rabbit gets red it might be a sign that it is bad^* for the membrane. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø *(no shit sherlock)  
I have to add, this so called [Draize test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draize_test) is nowadays uncommon in the EU and the USA, because there are tests that are good substitutes (HET-[CAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorioallantoic_membrane)) and less controversial.

The pregnancy test is something different. The method of inserting urine of a (possibly) pregnant woman an animal works with different species, like mice, [rabbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_test) or frogs. Mucosal layer is good in absorbing stuff, the eye is an easy place to apply anything. During pregnancy, humans have the hCG hormone in urine. Turns out that many animals have similar hormones than humans, that even do similar stuff, all thanks to evolution (nature is king in reusing stuff and keeping working stuff). Mice and rabbits react to hCG with enlarged ovary size. If you kill the animal and look at the ovary, you can tell if the woman is pregnant.  
Edit: Frogs start laying eggs under influence of hCG and were a practical (reusable) alternative to other animals and where widely used [(Hogben test)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2054942/). After even better tests where developed, this frog, [Xenopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenopus) tropicals was already established as a model organism in biomedical science.

Ofc it doesn't ALWAYS work like that in the heat of the moment, however, most of the time it's pretty amazing. Turning what happens (to you) into an experience where everything can make you grow.

For example: Broken leg? Well, time to start reading a book, or painting a picture, or writing or learning or watching that movie you wanted to see half a year ago but couldn't fine the patience for, or whatever it is that you can make out of your situation.

Also a experience to see how much not being able to walk can impact your life - gives you some (!) insight on people that aren't mobile. Many experiences can give you a new perspective that might make you understand others on a deeper level - if you pay attention."

6079,I have the same question. I have a history of mental illness and have never been given a drug that would cause death in any kind of overdose that was less than several months' worth of meds.

6082,"I worked as a fake review writer for a while (I hate it too but I needed the money. They gave me $1 a pop and I could crank out tons of them per hour from home). 

A tip to finding fake reviews is that they often come with a story and/or are told in first person, and they tend to be needlessly long because there's often a minimum character count for whoever is writing the fake reviews.

Made-up examples:

""I bought this because my patio needed a little extra light. I used it for the first time last night and I really can't believe how much light comes from this little lamp! It felt great to finally read outside in the evenings."" (likely fake)

""Doesn't take up much space and it's bright enough to read at night."" (likely real)"

We do talk about you. If you're an asshole. If you've done something stupid or unique. Yep I'm gonna talk about your ass. I don't tell people your name and address. But I will talk about this patient I had that got a box of roseart crayons up his or her ass.

I don't do it in front of other patients. I don't do it at the nurses station if others can hear me. But yeah sometimes the only way to deal with the stress is to commiserate with your fellow coworkers. And let's be honest. The stuff people do to themselves is fucking interesting. And no amount of the church of hipaa will be stopping providers from swapping stories. There's a right way and a wrong way to do it. "

While it‚Äôs true that the U.S. has a large number of lawsuits crowding its courts each year, it barely cracks the Top 5 of most litigious countries in the world. In his book, ‚ÄúExploring Global Landscapes of Litigation,‚Äù Christian Wollschlager notes that the litigation rates per 1,000 people shows that European nations top the list of the world‚Äôs most litigious countries.

Here is a list of the top 5 most litigious countries by capita: 

    Germany: 123.2/1,000
    Sweden: 111.2/1,000
    Israel: 96.8/1,000
    Austria: 95.9/1,000
    U.S.: 74.5/1,000

Myself, I don't really give a shit what kids are doing as long as it's not distracting the rest of the class. I try to make my lessons interesting but if the kid doesn't want to pay attention, that's more their problem than mine. Education is a two way street, and I have a lot of other kids who do actively want to learn. 

So basically, as long as a kid isn't distracting other kids in the class, and isn't disrupting my teaching style, I'm not gonna try too hard to stop them. I simply don't have the time to. 

That's assuming it's normal conversation topics. If it's something mean or otherwise indicating a problem, I'll address it, either immediately or while the rest of the class is working on something. "

""Ew, what kind of sea creature is that?"" you say.

That's not a sea creature. That's a fucking _rock formation._ Nobody knows how they form (although there are some theories). Typically, rock formations in caves are things like stalagmites (spikes on the floor), stalactites (spikes on the ceiling), or soda straws (thin beams), since they're formed over millions of years when water drips from the ceiling.

6166,"As a nudist: 

Being nude around loads of other random people is healthy.

It gives you a better body image. All your insecurities go away when you see a bunch of fat, old, hairy people who are naked and don't give a shit. Anything you're insecure about is nothing compared to someone else on the beach.

It gives you better confidence, you see that you're average, or maybe even above average. And being naked is freeing, and exhilarating for people who are not used to it. It can be a big boost.

And it makes us all more relaxed. You ever see women changing at the beach while holding a towel around themselves? The panic and stress that maybe someone will see a buttcheek! Fuck it. If you want to change just do it. You'll be done before anyone even notices, compared to the towel lady who spends five minutes and drops her towel twice...

I get the idea that nudity can be special. But nudity in itself is nothing. Nudity in a sexual situation can be very special. But seeing women nude at the beach or sauna does nothing for me. It's just not a sexual situation."

He started out playing CoD black ops zombies, I found him and became friends and played with him daily. Well he did a huge run and posted it on machinima replay and blew up over night. We still talked and played a bunch after that, and right when portal 2 came out he went for the world record on a certain map (both of our favorites) and live streamed the entire thing. I remember this because I was in his Xbox live party playing on release night while he did that, I ended up beating solo before he finished the record (level 151 for those wondering, he would pause and sleep and start the next day). Some big names came in and out of the party, it was a good time.


After that he blew up to the point he had famous friends to game with and we slowly stopped talking, after the next few months I noticed a change in his content to where I thought he changed way beyond the person I knew and I unsubscribed and stopped caring. Well a little while back I went to look him up to see how he was doing and I found out he died while apparently trying to beat a train across the tracks, he had 2 sons. R.I.P Yoteslaya. "

6277,"We organised our photographer a year in advance, they gave us a free pre-order wedding photo shoot, paid a $500 deposit and was happy.

Then came the pre wedding photoshoot, the pictures were terrible, we looked horrible and my wife felt horrible, I showed the pictures to a few friends and they all said how bad they looked (I hate photos of myself, I thought it might just be that).

So 1 month out from the wedding I told my fiance that we are going to replace the photographer, she was hesitant, we'd lose our deposit, but I said it's better to lose $500 on bad pre wedding photos than spend $4000 on horrible wedding day photos.

So I emailed the photographer and said nicely that we'd not need their service (at the time my mother-in-law had accidentally put the idea in my head that if we were didn't handle the bad photographer well, they'd bad mouth us in the photographer community and we get no one). They then told me the pre wedding photoshoot was only complementary if we used their services on the day, so on top of losing the deposit, we'd have to pay $375 for the terrible photos.

I regret doing that, but a month out, fear of the power of some shadowy photographer guild, and just general stress led me to pay them.

We found another photographer, noticed their website didn't have 1 or 2 photos from events instead they had entire events showcased (and the photos were good).  Visited them and without any time for a demo we chose them, they gave us a $500 last minute discount, but I think they were actually just being nice about how bad the other photographers were.  Ended up costing about the same but the photos were just flat out awesome, it was a stressful 4 week wait for the photos but we got 500+ photos over the whole day, from preparation to first dance every photo was great, and some of the photos came out so awesome I actually like how I look in them.

Plus having some good photos of our family on the day was worth it, my parents and my wife's parents have some awesome candid looking shots, and the little video they put together (just a photo slide show) actually tells the story of our day."

(always ask the where before the what, so at the very least you know where to go to find out the what). A rather sleepy-sounding man tells me ""... I think I broke my car."" I offer to send a tow truck out to give him a hand. ""I don't think that's going to help.."" Okay buddy, your car is busted, why is that not going to help, huh? ""There was a bus.."" Sudden record-scratch noise in my head. ""Were you hit by a bus, sir?"" ""yes.."" I dispatch ALL THE THINGS. A sheriffs deputy and a trooper are creeped out when they get on the scene, because.. they see wreckage, but no dude. What the fuck, how am I supposedly talking with this man.. turns out he was in a ditch, and according to one of the troopers, his still intact seat with him in it was the largest piece of the car they recovered. The last plot twist? Aside from a broken arm, and clearly having his wits rattled all to hell (can't blame him there), he was fine. He even came into the dispatch center after he got out of the ER and high fived me. It was awesome. "

She said she didn't know why she walked into my room, she just had a feeling that she needed to.

She was also born on my grandfather's birthday, the same year that he passed away. I had asked him what he wanted for his birthday, and he told me to have the baby on his birthday (early May). I wasn't due until almost the end of June, so I jokingly said I'd see what I could do. He passed away later that month, and I was just kinda numb for the rest of my pregnancy. When I went into labor, they said it was too early, but she was determined to make her appearance. I didn't know what day it was, let alone the date. She was born on his birthday, 70 minutes after he was born. It would have been his 70th birthday.

Maybe it‚Äôs not appropriate, but maybe it is for this Reddit question; I don‚Äôt know for sure. I‚Äôm Hawaiian. Living on the island of Kaua‚Äôi. I‚Äôve met people on here who‚Äôve said ‚ÄúHawaiians are nAtIvE aMeRiCaN cUz AmErIcA cOnTrOlS hAwAiI.‚Äù Sure buddy. Anyway, there‚Äôs a lot of supernatural and myth here in Hawaii that I thought I might share a bit of. At least the most prevalent kind that I‚Äôve heard of.

Night Marchers. Ghostly ancient Hawaiian warriors. You‚Äôll hear drums and see torches when they‚Äôre near. You can‚Äôt look at them and you should lie on the ground in respect; they‚Äôll kill you otherwise. You still can die even if you follow the recommendations. You‚Äôre most likely to live if you‚Äôre of Hawaiian descent (if a ghost warrior is a relative, he can call upon the Night Marchers to spare a descendant‚Äôs life) and/or show absolute respect.

Mermaid of Wailua River. She‚Äôs very much like a siren of sorts. Wailua river is the biggest (in terms of width) on Kaua‚Äôi. She swims in that river and does what one would expect a siren to do.

White man of Waimea canyon. Basically a small powder-white creature that, at night, stalks people. The only story I‚Äôve heard of it involved the creature jumping on a guy‚Äôs back and attacking him.

Some sort of night creature I forgot the name of. I think it was a sort of one eyed beast, but I‚Äôm not sure. Mythology story of it involved a hunter who stayed out too late so he decided to camp. He sets up a fire and sees the creature across from him. The monster just watches him from across the campfire. This particular monster doesn‚Äôt like light. The hunter had to sit there and keep the flame lit until morning. When the sun began to rise, the monster left.

General ghosts of people that haunt Heiaus and gravesites. Heiaus are sacred ancient Hawaiian lands that people cannot tread upon. This is a real rule here. Legends ranging from bad luck, being haunted and more can happen if one treads on sacred land. Especially without respect and Hawaiian descent. My uncle once parked by a river and a hotel with a courtyard that was built upon an ancient gravesite. On that courtyard was a tree. My uncle said he saw people in that tree staring back at him.

Anyway those are just stories at the top of my head. There is a TON of Hawaiian mythology and I‚Äôm glad I was able to share some of that... even if this wasn‚Äôt exactly a Native American story."

6515,"I was abused by my babysitter and her kids when I was 7. One day after school, i decided not to go back to my babysitter's house because i just didn't want to deal with them anymore. I planned to wait for my mom to come home from work at the playground near my school. But that will be about 6-7 more hours more. 

One of my classmate's mom saw me and asked what I was doing there. I told her I was waiting for my mom. She told me to come over to her house to wait instead. I agreed and followed her home. She asked if I have any keys to my home or if I knew my mom's number, I didn't. I actually had fun there playing with my classmate, ate good food and watched TV. 

So about a few hours in, the babysitters neighbors were all looking for me. And unfortunately, the house I was in was in the same apartment building and they found me. They tried to lure me out but I hid in the kitchen. They told me my mom was waiting downstairs so I went but she wasn't there. They lied so I would come out. My mom called the babysitter to talk to me and she basically yelled at me over the phone, asking me what I was thinking running away.

I eventually told her I was being abused and she stopped sending me there. My classmate's mom volunteered to babysit me and that's how I got one of the best babysitter.

I guess kids don't usually tell what's happening to them until they are asked. My mom asked why I didn't tell her what's happening, I told her that I was afraid if I'm the one who will get in trouble instead because the evil babysitter was a manipulative bitch. "

6603,"I always felt like the ugliest girl of my group of friends for as long as I can remember, mostly because I've always struggled with my weight.
 I got my first boyfriend and I truly felt like I loved him. This was during the myspace era and I was receiving anonymous hate messages on what would be the equivalent of ask.fm or curiouscat today. 
I was so self conscious of myself because they spoke directly about how ridiculous I looked in certain clothes because of my size, etc. 
One day my boyfriend wanted me to do something for him on his page and he shared his login info with me. I did what he asked me to and I realized he had the same app of anonymous questions so I checked to see if he received as much hate as I did. He didn't, but I could see what he asked.
 It turns out he was the one that left me all of those hateful, hurtful comments. Since then, I've always been so self conscious about people's actual opinions of me. I definitely haven't been the same and it feels silly to let it affect me still, but I'm for sure still salty about it lol :("

I sent them the check which they sent me a receipt for but then never cashed the check, so I was up ~$3k in the end. It's been 19 years.

6630,"Didn't really grow up in a cult but I grew up in a Pentecostal church, while the the church wasn't bad and was pretty tame considering some, because they didn't care that I, a women wore pants to their church. But my mother on the other hand, oh boy.  I'm pretty sure I became a tomboy was because she constantly pushed for me to become girly.  

My mother didn't think everything was the devil like some, like Pokemon for example she thought others were. For example, vampires and witches and books on that subject, even if it was written by a Christian author I wasn't allowed to read.  

I remember that one sim game that gave the choice of having your character become a witch was banned because their was a small possibility that I could play as one.  Also I wasn't allowed to read certain books and such,  however many people who came from religious families can relate to that but what takes the topping from the cake is how insane with her religion she was. 


You see, I was born out of adultery, scandalous I know.  Because I was born from adultery,  I was a natural born liar.  Yes, you read that right.  When I was a child I was never believed,  now when I was a child I was scared of going to hell for lying so I didn't really lie, and if I did I always ended telling the truth in fear of being burned alive.


However if something happened, and I told the truth well I couldn't be trusted because  since I was born out of adultery I had the natural talents to lie because a child born out of sin or some crap.   Like maybe I accidentally spilled some ice cream, and I admitted to it.  Nope wasn't an accident, I spilled it on purpose and I was a liar and must be spanked, she must spank the devil out of me. Saw someone doing something, I'm lying and trying to frame someone must be spanked.


Well as you can see she wasn't the best person to be rearing a child,  now since my mother never or rarely believed me some teachers saw this as an advantage to abuse me, make up some story about me and get spanked, even if another kid or teacher spoke of for me. Well, they still the possibility I could do it so I must be spanked.   Ironically this ended up making me a liar, and a good one.  I don't remember what happened, but I remember one time I lied to my parents and finally not getting spanked, I felt relief. So I just started lying and became good at it.


Now my mother didn't believe in witchcraft, I remember one time I looked at book that told your horoscope and while it was fun to look at it, my mother decided that I must be punished and the book must be burned.  I also hated going to church every Sunday, while my other relatives stayed home and didn't have to go.   I was tired of being punished for being born and even questioning the bible. In the end it just made me bitter towards religion almost in general.

6666,"Extreme religious environment.

I was raised here in the states so Im pretty much fine but most of my family on my dads side is from Chechnya (the mostly Muslim part of Russia were the government is murdering gay people). Most of my relatives are pretty ultra religious because growing up in the 90s in Chechnya in the midst of two violent wars and rapid rise in Wahhabism (extreme version of Islam) a lot of it past down to them.

I spend every summer in Chechnya with my relatives and its really creepy sometimes. I am a Muslim but I consider myself to be pretty, not non-religious (I pray 5 times a day, fast during Ramadan, etc.) but reasonable, as in I have no issue with other people not being Muslim and such.

But these guys, my cousins who I am extremely close to, spend every summer with just hanging out and having a good time, they are much more extreme. Whats creepy about it is how casual and unexpected it is. Like well be having a good time joking around, playing sports, just living life. They seem completely normal and fun loving but you stop and ask them about gays, non-Muslims, women, etc and suddenly they sound like your stereotypical ISIS member and talk about how they believe gays are an abomination and they'd kill their own brother if they knew he was gay, how non-believers are going to hell, how women who disobey their husbands deserve a beating etc. I literally heard one of my cousins justify the Charlie Hebdo shooting on the basis that drawing the prophet is banned in the Quran.

Its just so odd to me that fun loving teenaged cousins of mine who love fun and joking around, seem completely normal, at the flip of a dime can go cold and talk about their support of killing whatever group of people they don't like.

Again, I am a Muslim and I believe religion isn't a bad thing, but when used to justify hatred its really disturbing the type of stuff that comes from it.

6675,"One of my friends is very bright, to the point where companies like Tesla, SpaceX, NASA, etc. are desperate to get their hands on him. When he interviews for a job, he KNOWS he's qualified, and that he is right for the job. The companies aren't interviewing him, he's interviewing THEM. He doesn't feel stressed, or like he's gotta be perfect or say exactly the right thing. He's more interested in the company, what the work life balance is right, is the job right for him? That mindset transfers over to flirting.

So many guys go to the bars to get laid, to try to ""get it in"" with hot chicks, trying to say the right words and not mess it up with a cute girl. They're trying too hard, they just... care too much. The most ""successful"" guys at the bar are out to have fun, don't put women on a pedestal and instead, are just interested in who they're talking to and getting to know them. If it's not right / doesn't work out / she's not interested, that's fine. It just comes naturally once you take that pressure off yourself. This is what self confidence is like. It's knowing you're a catch and interviewing for what's best for you, not trying to land a job you feel unqualified for or aren't really interested in.

So you're nerdy and love video games? Great! If she's not interested in that, find a girl who is! I promise they exist! Quit trying to force yourself to be ""interesting"" for someone who isn't interested. Just move on and find people who are.

I understand it's hard when you're shy or not confident, but that's the problem that needs tackling. There's no magic words or ways to flirt that can fix that - that comes naturally once you're comfortable with yourself."

Anyway, this guy always hid from any kind of participation.  If we were cleaning the barracks, he was in the bathroom stall for the entirety.  He hated being touched, and squirmed around when we did hand-to-hand combative training.  No one liked him, but we really couldn't put our collective finger on it....he was just kind of creepy in general. He made everyone uneasy and we all just let him hide so we didn't have to interact with him.

Fast forward a month into training, and the entire company of 200 Soldiers is sitting on bleachers getting a safety training for the firing range when all of a sudden five military police flank the stands and the drill sergeant barks out ""Private Porkie, front and center!""

Porkie waddles down the steps and the MPs cuff him in front of all of us.

He didn't seem to regret his actions until he realized they would *actually affect him*. He tried to get at least 2 other people to commit perjury so he could get away with what he did. He didn't care about the guy that died, he only cared about himself. It's kinda like drunk driving - you get in the car drunk, you're responsible for anything that happens after. Sure, you may not intend to plow into another car and kill people, but that's something that is more likely to happen if you drive drunk than if you drive sober. Sure, he didn't intend to kill anyone when he threw that broom, but he threw a fiery broom onto an extremely flammable thing (a couch) that was right up to a wooden house with people inside it.

6718,"Dont put too much stock into that victim stigmatizing bullshit. Victims of abuse are indeed statistically more likely to become criminals and/or abusive later in life, but the rate is overstated and oversensationalized and ignores the complexity of the full picture in each of those cases. You must also consider that most of the victims who go down the bad path themselves are coming from broken homes, most of them are growing up in low income, high crime areas, most dont have a stable father figure, dont have a healthy support system, etc. People raised in those types of circumstances even without being abused end up statistically more likely to become criminals or abusive as well.

Entertainment media likes to run wild with the idea that abuse is like some magical vampirism disease that gets passed from predator to victim if the victim survives, regardless of all the other factors in that person's life and upbringing, and unfortunately the general population is all too eager to eat that bullshit up. 

So you end up with good people who suffered some abuse feeling *guilty* about what happened to them or being stigmatized by others for no goddamn good reason."

The fireman were able to put out the flames quickly and the damage was mostly contained to the living room. I should say we lived on a rural farm at the time and no neighbors for miles. When I calmed down I asked the fireman how they knew had somebody driven by and called?They stated they had recieved a phone call from a number that had not registered and the male stated my address and that there was a fire and to come quickly. Remember this was before cell phones were common place.So the next day I went to fire dept to thank them and they played the recording of the phone call it was my Father in Laws voice I am absolutely positive and my Husband also said it was his Fathers voice.

6804,"The situation with the Haitian indemnity is quite a complex one that isn't entirely as simple as ""France made them pay"".  The leadership of Haiti felt the country needed to return to an export economy to restore its former glory. Before the revolution Haiti had been the most profitable square kilometres on the planet earth. Either coffee, sugar or indigo could be grown almost everywhere in the republic, and exported at massive profit. Paying the indemnity to France would allow them to trade again on the world stage.

Unfortunately the leadership of Haiti hadn't realised how far their society had changed. Deforestation for small farms had made growing coffee harder. No-one wanted to work on the plantations. Refineries and sugar presses cost money they couldn't afford. The Haitian people regarded the work as that of oppression, no matter what promises were made by the leadership. When they got the right to trade with the rest of the world the returns were lacking, and the debt far more oppressive than they had thought it would be. 

Yet the threat of external force was not particularly motivating. Haiti was unified politically, had a strong army, a vast experience of guerilla warfare and pitched battle, and knew that yellow fever would kill at least a third and usually more of any army that stepped foot on the island. Neither the French nor the British had been able to take Haiti. 

I don't say that to justify the decision, or suggest it was in any way deserved. It is heartlessly cruel act of colonialism. At the same time however it is a complicated situation with many factors that led to the acceptance of the indemnity in order to be recognised as a nation state. "

My husband and I are not poly or in an open relationship, but we are/we're swingers. We have a sort of, I dunno, disconnect perhaps, between sex between us and sex with others. Between the two of us sex is both fun and also a kind of bonding thing in our relationship, making us feel closer. It's intimate and special. When we swing the sex is just a fun activity between a bunch of like minded adults, no different to playing board games or something. 

From a relationship perspective a poly friend once explained it to me like this:

There are a lot of kinds of love, romantic, filial, sibling, even friendship is a kind of love, and for most of those you can feel that love for multiple people, for me I'm also capable of feeling romantic love for multiple people. "

She's a cartoon of a middle-eastern woman, middle-eastern women are known for having hour-glass figures. She also has a big nose and enormous eyes, thick eyebrows and thick black hair, which are all features stereotypically associated with middle-eastern women.  

I think it's great that Disney has some diversity in its depictions of women. So does my partner, who is middle-eastern and has all the stereotypical middle-eastern characteristics I listed above. Princess Jasmin was literally the only positive female middle-eastern character she encountered in film while growing up.  

If there are people out there that are upset by a cartoon depiction of an exaggerated hourglass figure, then that's unfortunate, but maybe they should look at doing something about their own bodies rather than expecting cartoon depictions of middle-eastern women to conform with their body-type."

The last time I spoke with them was before my deployment (eight years now), found out some unsettling facts, did NOT want them to be a part of the life of the wife I had chosen.  It's one thing to mess me up, but stay away from her. And now that I'm a father.... Looking back, it sucks that things worked out this way. My wife has a wonderful relationship with her father. I didn't realize things were supposed to work that way. But distancing myself from them was the best possible decision I could have made.  
I know this doesnt answer your question, but you have to ask yourself if reconciliation is possible, and if the influence of the people (who happen to be genetically responsible for you and provided whatever level of care you received during childhood) is a good thing NOT ONLY for you, but your spouse and any hypothetical offspring thereafter.  Realize the responsibility of that dynamic is on you, and I'm sure you can come to the right decision. Also, therapy is always an option, if the finances are there for it.

6851,"No. This isnt typical. I'm defending my dissertation next month. you need to surround yourself with people who are going to nurture you interests and groom you to be successful. Really think about this opportunity as an apprenticeship (you are helping them while they are training you). You NEED to be challenged, but  if they cross the bullying line you need to recognize it.

I have a really great postdoc lined up because I recognized people in and outside the department who wanted to support me like this. Most research demands interprofessional work so don't feel like you're stuck with the same people you came in with. Good luck!"
6852,"I think the big thing is to watch for signs that they‚Äôre trying to deescalate what they perceive as you being flirty. 

Example: guy I hung out with def was crushing on me, but hadn‚Äôt said anything of the sort yet so I couldn‚Äôt tactfully reject him. We went out to see a movie and right before I had messaged him about him paying for me and how it made me uncomfortable, and he had said he just liked to be nice to his friends and I had emphasized that I always like to keep things even between FRIENDS and didn‚Äôt like feeling indebted to FRIENDS - so that was sign #1 that I was just being friendly and trying to deescalate. At dinner I ordered one of the most expensive meals so he wouldn‚Äôt offer to pay and I made sure to tell the waitress separate cheques as soon as she asked - sign #2. As we went to the movies he made a comment about how he was going to pick me up and carry me because I was little/in his way and I said I didn‚Äôt want that to happen and it would probs hurt - sign #3. At the movies he asked if I wanted the armrest between us up and I said no - sign #4. Then he put his hand on the armrest in that classic face up gesture where if I put my arm there he could easily hold my hand, so I sat with my legs and arms crossed for the duration of the movie - sign #5.

Despite this, he still leaned in and asked if I wanted to cuddle midway through the movie and I had to reject him verbally. So just look for signs dude. If someone keeps shutting down your advances, you‚Äôre better off assuming they‚Äôre not interested, because they probably aren‚Äôt. You might hear of rare cases where the girl was interested and it was just miscommunication and the guy missed his chance because he didn‚Äôt keep pursuing her, but those are RARE. The majority of the time, people are straightforward, and if they‚Äôre receptive to your advances you‚Äôll be able to tell because they‚Äôll go along with them or initiate some themselves."
6853,"My parents splurged in a beautiful, unique, incredibly tiny and and in my opinion, a very genetically modified teacup poodle, shipped from South Korea to the states at a total cost of approx 30,000 USD. They took care of it like a princess, even made home-cooked meals for the dog and purchased a brand new car that could fit one of those puppy playgrounds in the back seat. The puppy was super tiny and really fragile, and tragically, it lived for only two years, since my parents live in Florida and the humidity quickly gave the dog severe respiratory problems. My parents still have the now, super impractical van (considering there's only the two of them) and an unimaginably lavish dog playground installed in place of the back rows."

Most people in my industry pay people $8-10 an hour to stand in a hot booth during a show.  This is sitting or standing at a supermarket in the air conditioner and greet people and offer samples.

I have had 3 no-shows, 1 person ask for a raise before day 1, one want 50 cents a mile reimbursement for driving... it's crazy.

I need someone to stand there and sample hot sauce or bbq sauce for 4 hours, paying $12/hr.

I was pretty young then, but when she first started dating the guy I just didn't like him the few times I met him. He's loud and charismatic and takes to immediately ribbing all the family he can. He's apparently fairly successful and travels a lot for work and my aunt is totally smitten. They date for a short while, get married, move in together yadda yadda.

Then they start falling behind in the house payment, the car payment, the utilities, etc. He says business isn't going as well so he transfers everything he can in to her name and she starts working more to try and catch up. Of course, he handles the finances.

Then one day he leaves for a business trip after she's gone to work for the day and just...never comes back. Turns out he'd been stealing money from work and funneling her money in to a secret account. He'd taken it all and skipped town, leaving her buried under piles of debt from unpaid bills. She didn't even know the extent of it until he'd been ""missing"" for a few days and she got the official notice from the bank that they were foreclosing on her house. 

He wasn't a good businessman, but he was one hell of a successful con artist."

People also have a bad look at comparison cost.

However, that does not mean they won't still come back to you (in person) and say that you owe them money.  Works better if this was a final paycheck that they screwed up and you don't care about the company, just don't respond to their requests.  If you are still employed, you'll likely still have to pay it back, often times by shorting future checks.  Of course, if it was an 'honest error' on their part, standard values would want somebody to settle in a fair manner."
7013,"My aunt is the person that puts a ticket in a raffle and wins every time.

About 20 years ago, she entered a raffle at a car dealership's grand opening and won a car with ""lifetime service\*"". A Land Rover Freelander.

Apparently, winning a car generates significant taxes, and registering/insuring isn't too cheap either. It ended up costing her quite a bit to actually receive the car. They offered a cash equivalent, but it was way less than the value of the car, her car sucked (remember the Dodge Colt?), and the Freelander was brand new, so she of course wanted the car.

Then it turned out that ""lifetime service\*"" meant ""lifetime of the vehicle"", which they estimated to be 2 years or 20k miles, whichever came first. It only covered ""routine service"", which was brakes/fluid/tires at pre-decided intervals.

So, her ""free lifetime service"" was actually a few oil changes and a set of tires/brakes.

When the 2 years were up, she traded it in, which basically just paid back the taxes/registration/insurance cost. 

TL;DR: ""Free car with lifetime service"" realistically worked out like a free 2 year lease with maintenance package. "

7025,"Suppose you make a mistake, ignore it, make decisions on that basis, and then form an opinion or view of everything around you comprised of one or many of these little mistakes, which eke into every action you perform.

When someone is called out on one of these old axioms, they defend their position because, to have that happen would change their entire structure of perception, meaning it would bring all those actions performed (on the back of the mistake) forward to be re-evaluated, and then everything after it too. That's a lot of work to have to do, and generally, the older you are the more mistakes you've made and the more 'paperwork' there is, so most just hunker-down and turn a blind-eye.

In short, some people (not just the old) build their walls, their towers and castles, and refuse to knock a single brick down, for fear the whole thing will collapse (and it has every chance of that happening). Having that happen is difficult and painful, and not many people are humble, observational and courageous enough to self-evaluate and acknowledge failings; they miss the point that failure leads to success, *if you are honest with themselves*.

I was on a call very close to my home (less than 5km, on the one road that everyone in that area has to use to get in/out of town). The call was for a motorcyclist who'd lost control and hit a bridge abutment, so he was unquestionably dead.

We had the road closed for a while, so the police could do their investigation. This, as I said, was the only road in and out of the area. so people on either side of the closure had two options - either sit and wait or turn around. Somebody stuck on the out-of-town side of the roadblock went to the guy's house and told his wife, ""Hey, there's a bad wreck down the road and it looks like $husband's bike.""

Naturally she tear-asses down to the scene as we're helping body removal pick up the deceased. I was 350 meters on the other side of the scene, and heard her like she was standing right next to me.

The headline is trying to give the impression of a little 2 year old sitting at a table in a court room all by himself. But, the kids (in the stories I read) were represented by lawyers. Having a lawyer with you in court isn't being alone! It's being accompanied by legal counsel! ""Oh, but by 'alone' we meant 'without their parents'."" No. What you meant was ""We're going to plant a false idea in the reader's head"" because if you meant without their parents you could say ""Toddlers appear in immigration court without their parents.""

For lung cancer, non-smokers have about a 1% risk in their lifetime, passive smokers (people exposed to secondhand smoke) is 1.3%, and smokers are around 30% (would likely be higher if other stuff didn't kill them first). 

If you're a female, your risk is lower (~0.9% for a non-smoker, ~1.1% for a passive smoker).  

It is unlikely you're at any higher risk for anything else if you're no longer being exposed to second-hand smoke on a regular basis. Take care of yourself and stay away from smokers and you shouldn't have an issue. 

Statistically you'll die of heart disease. You're more likely to die from breast [female] or prostate [male] cancer, or colon cancer [for either sex], than you are to die from lung cancer, as long as you don't smoke.

7044,"For transparency, I have my MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. Most licensed folks who are practicing talk therapy in the US are at the masters-level (MA, MS, MSW, etc.). Maybe I'm misinterpreting your comment, but it takes much more than an MA to become a fully licensed therapist in most states. This is the process in my state to become a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (which is an MA):

-Earn a bachelor's degree (four years)

-Earn a master's degree (two-three years)

-Complete 1,000 hours of supervised training during masters program (part time over one year, included above)

-Complete 2,000 hours of post-masters supervised work (one year)

-Take and pass the National Counseling Examination (NCE) and apply for provisional licensure (LMHC-A)

-Complete 1,000 hours supervised work with the LMHCA (half year, although the 3,000 total hours cannot be earned in less than two years)

-Take and pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Examination

-Apply for full licensure (LMHC)

It's not the case that you can become licensed with only a master's degree. From starting a bachelor's degree to receiving full licensure can be about 10 years.

7081,"Anesthesiologist here

The time I remember the most was really heartbreaking. 

We had taken an older man into the operating room for a ""quick look"" laparoscopy. You basically insert a small camera into the peritoneal cavity (the abdomen) and look around and  the bowels and the liver and so on. This gentleman had bad heart disease and had survived multiple surgeries and procedures. He had probably been in the hospital for a month or more. 

We suspected ischemic bowel, essentially a lack of blood flow to part of the intestines. If it's a small part you can cut out that part and put things back together. That's what we were hoping for. 
When we inserted the trocar and the laparoscope, we found the whole bowel was dead. It had suffered a major lack of blood flow to the point it was unrecoverable. The only way to fix this would be to cut out his entire bowel, a big and risky operation. Even if he survived all this, which is unlikely, he would have had to live the remainder of his days without being able to eat at all, and those days would be painful and be in the hospital. 

Anyway the surgeon asked me to come with him to talk to the family. I left an assistant in the operating room. His two sons were in their 20s. One of the sons was a medical student. When we told them the situation, their faces fell. Tearfully they asked us if it were true, if there was anything else we could do. We were fully honest, telling them that on our experience any further treatment would only prolong suffering and their dad would never leave this hospital anyway. 

As a physician, the job can be tough, in a technical and physical way when doing hard cases, working long hours, but nothing prepares you to deliver this kind of news, and making these decisions. These families and patients stay with you. 
It is critical, however, to have these conversations both for the family and your own empathy and humanity. "

They *technically* laid X miles of fiber, but didn't connect it to actual conduits or houses because that is the expensive part. It's hard to dig under houses and concrete.

So yes, they essentially stole taxpayer money, and are now playing a game of hot potato to see who is going to be the one that finally finishes the job and connects their big empty network to the houses.

Its the age we live in unfortunately, a bunch of people doing the bare minimum to ""technically"" get the job done. This is the plague that has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars and the fiber network is a side effect.

7327,"I know there are loads of comments responding but I wanted to share a memory of why maybe it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds. My parents divorced when I was 3. One of my only memories of my dad when he lived with us was me racing out of my bedroom to stand on the balcony overlooking the front door and yelling ‚Äúbye daddy‚Äù when he left for work. For me, this was a really nice memory of a moment we shared when he still lived with us (please also keep in mind‚ÄîI knew even from a young age the divorce was a good idea and wasn‚Äôt wishing it hadn‚Äôt happened. I just liked that it was a memory of the time i lived with him all the time). One father‚Äôs day I drew him a card and it had me waving goodbye while he said he had to go to work.

To him, this seemed like a slight, like I was passive aggressively pointing out he was always working and never around (and there is truth to this). He died when I was 23. He brought this card up semi regularly until he died. We had a bit of a strained relationship, but he brought it up because it was hurtful.

To me, this was a memory of a good moment we shared. I tried to explain that, but he never got it or believed me. Maybe his own self consciousness got in the way. Your post was a reminder of the guilt and unhappy feelings I harbor about that stupid card and about how he thought we saw him.

My point is that maybe what your child likes is the time you spend together buying stuff for them. Or maybe they like that they can hold onto that stuff and it reminds them of you. They‚Äôre children‚Äînot articulate, not emotionally intelligent, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the words meant to them what they mean to you.

For example, my fiance is a Starbucks manager. His store is really close to our apartment, so I stop by quite a bit. There's a middle aged dude who spends several hours every morning there, reading the paper. He's a creepy old man. As soon as I walk in the door, he starts leering at me with the weirdest smile and does not take my eyes off me. I'll be reading my book, working on my I-pad, and every time I look up he's there, watching. 

One time I walked passed him and accidentally dropped my phone by his table. I bet over to grab it, and he literally leaned in so that he could get closer &amp; get a better look at my ass. It was disgusting. I noticed he did stuff like this to other females too. He refused to leave young females alone. 

Eventually, he was reported, and my fiance had to speak with him. Basically told him he needed to stop, or he wasn't going to be welcomed back into the store. This guy didn't understand that he was doing anything wrong. According to my fiance, he kept on saying that he was just a ""harmless old man"".

Edit: Alright, it‚Äôs maybe not the most exciting but here it is. I was living on the rez and I was wayyyyyy out in the middle of nowhere, even in rez standards. It was nighttime and I was watching the full moon outside, I remember it was so beautifully bright that I could see almost everything. 

It wasn‚Äôt uncommon to hear coyotes around here, though you saw them less than you heard them. In spite of this, I saw a few coyotes trotting off a little ways in an opening bathed in the full moon. I remember thinking that they must be up to no good, because coyote is rarely up to any good. Oddly, I didn‚Äôt hear them, even though coyotes are louder and more talkative when traveling at night. 

Well, I was gazing out the window near our front door, when I heard my mother calling me from outside. I specifically remember that she said I had left my backpack in the car and needed to get it to do my homework. I thought nothing of it and began to put on my shoes. 

Suddenly, every hair on my body stood straight up. The air seemed wrong. It was at this time that my mother walked in from the kitchen and said that dinner was almost ready and I needed to wash up. She saw my shoes on, and immediately sensed something wasn‚Äôt right. She asked if somebody was outside. I said she was. 

Of course, no she wasn‚Äôt. She had been in the kitchen the whole time. I took a last look out the window facing the open field, and I saw a coyote waiting in the light of the full moon. It then stood up on its hind legs like a person and walked into the woods.

She stormed off crying and went inside the house, but luckily none of the parents saw the fight happen so I got on with my life. 
About 30 minutes later, I heard my aunt yell her name, followed by all the adults coming outside and asking where she was. She clearly wasn‚Äôt outside playing with us, but I was the only one who saw her go in the house. Since I didn‚Äôt want them to know I was mean to her, I said nothing and just shrugged. 
Well, 20 minutes later, no one could find her anywhere. I knew she was inside, but they had searched every room calling her name, so the adults thought she was outside somewhere. Cue chaos. For the next half hour or so, the adults knocked on every neighbors door, called the police, shined flashlights into the sewers, and panicked. Meanwhile, I sneakily ran around the house because I knew she was in there. Eventually, I found her in my grandmas bed. She had crawled under the decorative pillows on the bed to cry and had fallen asleep. Since she was covered in pillows, she couldn‚Äôt hear them call her name, and no one could tell she was buried in them. I acted like a hero until she told them WHY she crawled under there.

I finally ask one of the other boys to button him up, which he does, and I felt like a jerk/moron/inept because me helping a child get dressed means I‚Äôm a pervert.

We guard you while you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call. We are cooks and taxi drivers and we know everything about you. We process your insurance claims and credit card charges. We control every part of your life.

We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't. And we're just learning this fact. So don't fuck with us.‚Äù"

The tighter circle, the more light thats blocked that *isn't* coming in a straight line. 




Akin to a drawing a circle with watercolor VS a pen.

I honestly find it intriguing because a lot of men on Reddit complain about how men aren't allowed to express their emotions (and thus a lot of them end up suicidal or worse) but they also seem to hate the idea of having to listen to someone vent?




So they hate the fact that women like to express their frustration, anger and sadness with no practical ends but... They also hate that men can't talk about their frustration, anger and sadness without feeling weak or receiving no sympathy or being told to ""Man up and fix your issues""

7595,When I turned 17 due to some unfortunate circumstances I inherited part of a trust fund that gave me an outrageous income for someone that age.  I started building a ridiculous Jeep CJ-8.  As I was doing most of the work myself I needed something to drive in the interim that could double as a daily driver as well.  A brand new Porsche 928 S4 fit the bill.  By the time I started college that fall I realized what a douchebag I was because the Porsche wasn't suitable for New England winters and the Jeep would have to be shipped because it had a useful range of around 120 miles per tank.  Learned an expensive lesson about depreciation when I sold the Porsche to buy a reasonable car and an even more expensive lesson about  what money pits custom cars are.

Changing the electoral system is often an ""unpopular"" thing to do. Unless the system distorts results in the most unsatisfactory way possible (like... say trump would have won with 40% of the popular vote), changing the electoral system is not ""popular"" from the get go.

Scholars say it's often ignorance that fuels the unpopularity. Basically, if you're not sure of *where* you're going, you're not moving. Change is scary.

Then, electoral reforms have been tried in Ontario and BC. Both the ""juries"" came with new system that took a more proportional approach. It failed when it came to the referendum, but informed citizens (not scholars) made the decision to change the system.

Finally, what some professors said verbally (not in the research) was that the ""jury"", composed of more than 100 people, would've been better off with having the final word, rather than in a referendum, since you can't inform millions of people as much as the jury was.

On top of the fact that there's not that much info on autism in women, because for a long time women were expected to be dependent housewives.

7625,"The movie could have been 100% better and they cut a lot of things out for the sake of time that would have filled in some of the character gaps.  While it should have been in the movie the book ""The Crucible"", which covers the time between movies, helps fill in these gaps and makes the movie a little better. 

But, after rumors of a sequel since 2002 or 2003, when the Whitmore having mental issues plot point was first presented, I started bracing myself for a sequel to absolutely suck.  

So it actually surpassed my expectations even though it could have been far better, if that makes sense.

They shouldn't have cut as much of the character stories out (the movie was 30 minutes shorter than the first and I think that made a huge difference) and they didnt bring back David Arnold for the score, which also really hurt the feeling of the movie.  

As for why I took 2 weeks off, I understand this makes me really weird but, the movie has been a huge influence on my life.  

One of the biggest ways that happened was it was a huge inspiration for me to take the leap and join the Military when I graduated in 2001, and I ended up being scheduled to report to basic training on September 12th, 2001.  

So the fact that the movie was the inspiration for me joining, and I just happened to leave after a major attack in our country, kind of cemented the whole ""serving your country"" mentality I had and made me have an even weirder connection with the movie.

So the summer Resurgence came out, when I realized I had 3 weeks of PTO saved up, I decided to take 2 weeks just so I could see the movie at my leisure during the matinee prices.  I even took the Friday it was released off so I could see the first 2 showings on Thursday night.. 8pm and 1130pm.  I had 2 groups of friends join me at that different screenings.

You need to act and you need to learn take criticism.  You need to get involved in your local acting community but you don't need to spend $60,000 (or $30,000 or $15,000) on an education for acting unless you want to be a teacher.

7699,"In a way, I felt like I mattered more. Sort of a ""big fish in a small pond"" kind of deal. I was so much more involved in extracurriculars than I am now. I played a varsity sport, was in two musical groups, and was in two other academic teams (think speech team, mock trial, mathletes kind of thing). I had more of an identity. In college and beyond, you're kind of dumped into the ""real world"" where there are thousands of people like you out there, and it's easier to lose a sense of purpose and belonging in the anonymity of the masses. 

Also, everyone knew everyone. Yeah, there's a few people you might not like so much, but you get to see your friends every day. You knew where to find people. That might be a bad thing if you're deliberately trying to avoid someone, but I personally was on pretty good terms with everyone at my school.

Unlike most redditors, I had a great experience in high school, and I know a lot of my classmates did as well. I guess I'm one of those rare nerds who shamelessly peaked there. "

7703,"I was the loud neighbor once, even though I wasn't.

It started a couple months after we moved into our upstairs apartment. My wife and I were *being married* one day and heard a weird bump from downstairs. We didn't think much about it, but woke up the next day to find a note on our door telling us that our bed was too squeaky and they asked us to *move it*.

For background, we were in subsidized housing at the time, and couldn't *afford* a new bed. The one we had was a cheap platform and it was *all* we had. Our daughter was in the other bedroom, which was too small for us to use. We decided that the only appropriate thing to do would be to provide them with some ear protection, since we couldn't exactly go out and buy a new bed, or move it. We bought them a pack of ear plugs. They weren't amused.

I would not say that my wife and I are sex crazed maniacs, but we have a healthy *married life,* and we didn't stop having sex just because of this one time.

The worst thing that happened was when we were *just about done doing married stuff* when someone from downstairs starts ***pounding*** the ceiling. Mood is killed, moment is ruined. I throw some stuff on and rush downstairs to confront the neighbors directly. The wife opens the door, sees me, and slams it on my foot (because I wasn't going to let them just keep pounding on our ceiling and refuse to talk to us). She bolts out of her apartment and bangs on our Manager's door.

Starts telling the Manager we're having sex *all the time* and that we'd be up at 1AM doing it. My wife and I aren't that athletic and we were always asleep by 10. Manager says the obvious, that she can't mandate our sex life and that downstairs neighbors need to stop banging on the ceiling. The wife was complaining that she couldn't ""study in her bedroom because of all the SEX that was happening upstairs."" I asked if she'd *really* prefer that we move our bed to the other room and start having sex above her children's room. She realized how stupid that was. Manager asked why she couldn't study in other rooms of their apartment. Neighbor was offended by the ear plugs because she ""needs to hear her kids"" but if she was studying *in her bedroom* how was she watching her kids? How could ear plugs (or *just music on her laptop*) not take care of that issue?

Her husband was okay. He realized how big of a dick he was for cockblocking me mid-coitus. After the manager basically told them they had no right to complain about *normal apartment sounds* from our apartment, they suddenly stopped hearing it. Nothing changed. It was months before we got a new bed (because my wife was now self-conscious about the downstairs neighbors listening in on our sex), but they never had a single problem again. We asked them once and they said that they ""hadn't heard anything.""

TL;DR - I was super fat and my downstairs neighbors thought me taking a piss in the middle of the night was passionate lovemaking because my bed squeaked when I got into and out of it.

EDIT: To clear up some things.

* The units were built in the 70s. The walls were thin and the floors were squeaky
* When I suggested we ""move the bed to the other room and have sex above the kids room"" that was a hyperbole. As I explained already, we weren't doing it all the time. They were obsessed with the *idea* that the squeaking they heard was from our bed and that it was from us having sex.
* While my sex life isn't any of your business, we weren't always in the bed. The loud stuff happened in our living room, and they never once complained about the noise from that.
* The downstairs neighbor had a key to our apartment, she was a ""key keeper"" for the complex. Because of this hostility I told our manager to take our key back from her, because we couldn't trust them.
* Manager offered to relocate one of us. I told her that if anyone moved, it wouldn't be us, because we had done nothing wrong according to our contract and tenant handbook. 
* More than once, they did bang on our floor when we *weren't* having sex, but we didn't realize why they were doing it until the time they killed our mood."

It's true that the defense mechanisms don't help, but even if you're a confident short guy you're still somewhat crippled. It would be *that* much of a deal if it wasn't something that seemed so universal around men.

I'd say the ""short guy"" seems like the ""fat girl"" of men. Like some guys like small tits and some love big tits. Some guys like blonde hair and some like red hair. Some girls love beards and some love clean shaven. Some girls like muscles and some girls like dad bods. *Few* guys like fat girls and *few girls* like short men. Sure, a cool fat girl can still get a good guy and same with men, but it's still a feature that is pretty universally frowned upon.

I say this as a pretty short guy. I'm not unconfident in my height, but I *have* noticed the amount of nays I get *because* of it. Every single girlfriend I've had have at some point thrown in the ""you're not usually my type"" at some point in the relationship, and when I ask ""height"" was always the first thing they mention.

EDIT: OH, and it doesn't help that the stereotypical ""manly man"" will usually be crippled by his height. The strong one, the one who can win fights for you, the one who can lift you up everywhere. A short guy can train, sure, but if we do so we're by default *compensating* and if we don't, our mass alone puts us at a serious advantage against bigger men."

In the end, it's about knowing how strong your work ethic is but also knowing that time and life doesn't have to be spent on JUST work.

I personally would choose the quiet route because it's a good slow ease into the field. Because it will already be very difficult once you get an official full-time job. Internship vs full-time job.

I hope my questions can help you figure out what you are looking for. "

No kidding. They see some wild stuff, and the best ones get in on a level that nobody else can.

I did some time as a reporter, worst I ever saw was people's houses destroyed after a storm when I went to take pictures and interview them. Other people on my beat had investigated trailer fires (arson) that left two children burned alive, covered active shooters, sex traffickers (and their victims), watched as the town's largest industries collapsed, tracked meth and heroin use among the homeless population, and so much more.

I don't think people take into account the fact that journalists are the ones who are sitting down with victims of horrible abuse, or are following a kid as he saves up the money for basketball shoes, the first he's ever been able to afford, and is cut from tryouts in the second round. Journalists are civil servants too, and though they might not be pulling bullets from people's chests or carrying people from burning buildings, they see their fair share of humanity's worst, and it weighs on them. Ask your local journalist what they've seen - or better yet, ask them how you can read about it."

Such aliens might be so much more advanced that it would be impossible for us to rationalise their behaviour. They might even be incapable of explaining their behaviour and motivations to us in a way that we would be able to understand.

Think about how ants perceive us. These are creatures with some degree of consciousness which build complex societies of their own. However, we routinely destroy their societies because their existence hinders our own plans. For example, if we wanted to build a new road, but found that an ant colony was in the way, most of us wouldn‚Äôt think twice about wiping it out. 

The ants won‚Äôt understand *why* we do this, and we couldn't explain our behaviour to them (in a way which they would understand) even if we wanted to.

7833,"You would have to be *very* lucky.

Bear attacks happen *very* fast.  For such a large animal, they are incredibly quick, especially when they are in ""attack mode"".  And when they are charging, they are bounding up and down, and will probably not even give you an open shot of their neck.  Because you will probably be panicking, and in the act of shitting your pants, it seems very unlikely you will even *hit* the bear in the head.  Even if you did, they have incredibly thick skulls and a hand gun bullet might not even penetrate.  You would have to hit it in the eye, and good luck getting a shot like that on a moving target (you wont have time to aim) while your underpants are filling up.

*Maaaybe* if you have horse-shoes in your ass, and you manage to get it right in the eye, it might kill it instantly.  More than likely you'll just hit it in the shoulder or manage a torso shot, which will do absolutely nothing to stop the coming mauling, which you've all but ensured by startling and angering the bear.

Or, by some miracle you manage to get it in the neck with a fatal shot where the bear will bleed out.... All it needs is 2 seconds to kill you dead, and you better be sure it will follow through with that before it weakens and dies.  "

I remember people coming through our muster station asking if there was a chaplain, seeing the lifeboats hanging low and the inflatable rafts deployed from their canisters, also hanging, and tied to the lifeboats next to them to be towed once in the water. It was insanely hot in there, and extremely crowded. I remember one of the compounding factors was that since it happened at 3 AM, the captain was asleep in his cabin. Whichever junior officer was in charge initially turned the burning side into the wind, because he was an idiot. By the time the captain got on the bridge and took over, it was almost out of control. Excellent firefighting by the crew saved a lot of lives that day. Start of the fire was believed to be a cigarette thrown off the top deck that got blown back onto a balcony (or perhaps a Molotov cocktail), and the balcony furniture was covered with a highly flammable stain. There also weren't smoke detectors installed on the balconies. Because of this, they changed the SOLAS regulations to ban that kind of balcony furniture, and also require smoke detectors on the balconies. Fortunately, we were on the opposite side, but the fire was on our deck among many others."

I decided to use the bathroom. I opened the door and thought someone was murdered in there. [Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/QPT9NOl) 

Turns out the dog went into the bathroom and shut the door behind himself so he was locked in. The poor guy apparently freaked out and tried to break through a tiny window to get out. He made it through at least one pane of glass. 

Surprisingly he was ok! While I was panicking, my friend grabbed the dog and took him outside to assess the damage. She hosed the blood off and found only a few small cuts. Crazy how much blood came from the wounds he had. 

Opening that door and seeing all the blood was definitely scary."

When VW bought Bentley, we suddenly had access to VW testing facilities, and in particular interest to us was the hot climate facility in the Middle East.
Several prototype continentals and two mulsannes were sent there, and left to bake for a month or two.
Then they were brought indoors and torn apart. One of my parts was on a critical list, so I got shipped out there to have a look.
Holy shit it was hot. Humans aren‚Äôt supposed to live in that heat, and nor are cars. My plastic part had gone plastickier in the heat, and I was looking at a material change to solve it.

Interesting though, were the cars that were used  to move people and gear to and from the facility, day in and day out for years, were Skodas. Octavias I think. There was only indoor parking for two, and the other two lived their lives in the heat.

Second anecdote. The whole of VW group have a weekly update announcement  on progress of the co, new vehicles, new adverts etc. Normally a senior manager stands up and presents, and it takes 20 mins or so.
Each week though, they have a table of new-vehicle quality assessment measurements taken from cars exiting the production lines. 

Skoda normally take either first or second place, with Audi often appearing, Bentley occasionally, Seat occasionally, VW sometimes. So yeah, Skoda is an enigma.

We're bombarded by all the bad news - global warming, children in Somalia undergoing FGM, migrants drowning, half the world is on fire - but good news doesn't have the same automatic process of reaching us. If we put in the effort, there is a lot of good in this world to be found and it's worth it to be able to see it.  

Because otherwise ... if there were no good here or anywhere, why should any of us care about global warming? Why should we care about making the world a better place? There needs to be something worth protecting, and I think there is."

Every fourth employee you pass or talk to clearly thinks you're trying to steal something and either follows you while ""doing something else"" or gives you the side-eye while talking on their radio. Just before the exit you notice the person you're escorting isn't behind you anymore and you forget what they look like.

Upon finding his estranged (or ex-wife) she stated he should be a full code because ""He hadn't suffered enough"".

Even just the continual threat of being beaten over a period of many years, without ever actually being beaten, does of course do tremendous psychological harm. It is also completely unnecessary.

It's bizarre that it's culturally accepted in otherwise civilised countries. Imagine a woman living with husband who beats her up for not cleaning well enough, or just for talking back at him. Replace that woman with a helpless child, who had no choice in which adults to be hitched with, and lacks the full cognitive ability, or the agency to remove themselves from the situation, and it's suddenly okay? Dogs and criminals can't be subjected to arbitrary physical punishment, but kids can. Bizarre. "

That being said, I have had suicidal thoughts and other mental health issues, and have had SO's with them too. I hope I was never abusive, but I wasn't always the best girlfriend. I also have experienced abuse from suicidal SO's. This is what I think you should ask yourself. 

Do you tell your significant other about your suicidal thoughts in order to try to get help for yourself, or to try to change *their* behavior? Are you receptive to helping your SO with emotional/mental struggles when they have them, or do you turn the conversation to your problems when their struggles come up? Do you want what's best for both you and your SO, or do you mainly want them to help or ""fix"" you?

It is absolutely not abusive to need time by yourself during/after an argument. It's often healthy to talk through issues at a later time, taking time for yourself can help you tackle the disagreement with a level head.

Talk you your SO, ask if they have any concerns about your behavior. If they do, listen and consider them. Being wary of potentially abusive behavior in yourself and being willing to change your behavior are great steps to take, I'm sure you'll be fine. "

8221,"As someone who has worked in childcare for the past ten years, I have many. These are the worst of the worst.

1. I worked in our 3k-4k program for a summer and then left. I loved the work, and seeing the kids who I had taken care of as babies again was an emotional experience to say the least. If it hadn't been for one kid, I definitely would have stayed.

His mother was completely insane. She was so high strung. I don't think I ever saw her when she didn't seem like she was three seconds from a breakdown. And I saw her every morning and every evening. So breakdowns must have been frequent.

We'll call her son Eli. Eli was a very smart, very sweet boy. He had some anger issues, but when he would start showing signs of a breakdown, he and I would break off from the group, we would count down from ten, take three deep breaths, talk about why he was mad, and then I would set him up with a special coloring book I had bought for him. It worked like a charm every time, and I really felt like I was making a difference for this kid.

Anyway, one day, Eli fell and scraped his knee. I had seen worse on the baby side of the daycare, and thought absolutely nothing of it. Our policy is that we have to tell parents about everything, even if it doesn't leave a mark, and they have to sign an incident report. I've done a thousand of these and have received responses such as ""Nice one."" ""Well, that'll match his/her other ones."" ""Why do I have to sign this if there isn't even a mark?"" I was expecting something similar from mom.

3pm came (his pick up was 7pm, so this was really unexpected) and mom came bursting through the door with a wild look in her eyes. ""HURRY UP ELI YOUR SISTER GOT HURT! WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW!"" Eli was racing to get his stuff on, while mom kept repeating that his sister had gotten hurt.

I told her that I needed her to sign something for me. She started screaming about how her daughter needs to go to the hospital, and she'll sign whatever it is tomorrow, all as she was dragging a half-ready Eli to the door.

""Well,"" I began, already seeing exactly where this is going ""Eli actually got a scrape today. Incident reports have to be signed on the same -""

She cut me off, whipping around and glaring daggers at me. ""OH! HOW FUCKING WONDERFUL!"" she shouted, in full hearing range of a dozen or so small children. ""FIRST MY DAUGHTER IS HURT AND NOW ELI! WHY CAN'T YOU IDIOTS DO YOUR JOB AND KEEP THEM SAFE?"" She snatched the paper out of my hand, signed, and demanded Eli show her the scrape.

And oh my god, when he peeled the bandaid off his knee, she acted as though he were missing a limb. There were tears. There was screaming. Holy shit. I have never seen someone react like that to *anything*.

Through tears, she glared at me, and spat in the most venomous tone, ""I **have** to go to work! I **have** to leave him here with *you* I don't ask for much. Just keep him safe. This had better never happen again. I want a call from your supervisor TONIGHT!""

My supervisor did not call her that night, because it was just a scrape.

The next day, I asked Eli what had happened to his sister. He said she had fallen off a swing. There were no marks. No bruises. But mom had made just as big of a scene as she had at daycare.

She emailed my boss that same day, claiming that she had had to take Eli to the hospital, and she expected compensation. My boss told her that she would compensate if she could provide a bill from last night's trip. We never heard anything else about it.

She did call state on us though.

2. I wound up being berated outside my classroom for the better part of five minutes, because this parent had had to sign 3 incident reports that week. Usually I would agree that that is a lot. But her daughter was barely one year old, and trying to walk. She tumbled down a lot, as every other kid did. She spoke to my boss who told her exactly that.

3. This mom was well known with the teachers. She had really strict rules about her kids. For example, the youngest (not even 1 yet) wasn't allowed to sleep more than 2 hours at a time. She claimed he didn't sleep at night if he took too long of naps. We had to tell her every single day that we legally cannot wake up sleeping babies.

But this is about the oldest. He had a small cough. Nothing that seemed bad. Actually, I thought it sounded more like allergies than anything. He had had it for about a week, but the flowers were just starting to bloom, and my own allergies had flared up at about the same time. 

For months we had been sending out reminders to parents that we were having a field trip day coming up. The kids were going to visit the firehouse, and my god, they were all so excited.

Well, the day of the feild trip, mom decided her son was just too sick to go. So she asked if he could stay behind with me and the babies. Our boss said yes.

I felt so bad for this kid. He sat in the room with me, I made up a few cool games, put on some music, and let him have it with the art supplies, but I could see how much this bothered him. 

When the rest of the kids came back cheerfully screaming about how cool the trucks were, and how they got to take pictures with a fire jacket and hat on, he burst into tears.

I heard from his teacher that he spent the rest of the day crying on and off.

It was so sad. I felt so bad for him."

8242,"Explained how I got the pictures in a different comment.

 As for the guy, I hacked his Facebook but didn't do the typical teenager ""hey everyone, I'm gay!"" type of hacking. I messaged people privately, I told a friend of his (a friend that was sort of a friend but not too close) that he has always wondered what it was like to kill people. And asked if he ever had that curiosity too. I even overheard their conversations on the bus sometimes and would reference it in the conversations I would have with his friend when I'd talk to him online to make it realistic. Then I told that guy that I had a ""kill list just for fun."" Again, I made it realistic by having people that he hated on that list. 

About a week later I heard his name being called in the announcements saying that he needs to go to guidance office immediately. I knew what it was about right away. I asked to go the bathroom to walk by the guidance office and I saw two cops waiting there and he was gone for two weeks but I never wanted to find out why or act too nosy because I didn't want to be suspected. Plus, I wasn't in his circle of friends to have someone give me the details about what happened. All I know, is that he was called to the guidance office, there were two cops there, and he was gone for two weeks.

I also messaged this girl in one of his classes saying that he had a bit of a crush but then confessed to her that he wanted to rape her and if she would be down for that. She said ""no"" so then he was saying things like ""that's what I love when girls say.....'no...'"" And she blocked him after saying ""stop it, you're scaring me.""

Also, the girl never told teachers or guidance counselors or adults or anything about him wanting to rape her. Which to be honest, it's better. She must've obviously gossiped about it to her friends that this guy is psycho and wants to rape girls. That, I find to be worst- a scandal blows over and people forget about it for the most part. But reputations and thoughts that people have about you under the surface is long-term damage. "

My grandma is a little naive and didn't understand what was meant by ""special"" brownies and ate a huge piece before my more experienced grandpa could stop her. She ended up staying up all night crying and screaming. She said she felt like she was dying, and that her soul was leaving her body and was so terrified. My grandpa just held her all night to comfort her,  while my stupid uncle laughed at her and tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal.

8281,"There's a [great article by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/business/complex-car-software-becomes-the-weak-spot-under-the-hood.html) that looks at the complexity of modern cars, and compares the investigation of car accidents to aviation accidents:

&gt; One model that N.H.T.S.A. has studied is the one now used by the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial aircraft. The F.A.A. dispatches representatives to plane manufacturers to directly oversee the software design process for the critical systems that control flying.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThey go in periodically, and say, ‚ÄòShow me what you‚Äôre doing and convince me that you‚Äôre doing a good job ‚Äî or else I‚Äôm not signing off, and it‚Äôs not going in an airplane,‚Äô ‚Äù Mr. Koopman of Carnegie Mellon said. ‚ÄúCan you tailor this so that it works for the car business? That‚Äôs a question I don‚Äôt have an answer for. But it‚Äôs clearly an option.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; If it were to carry out those inspections, N.H.T.S.A. would need skilled people. The agency estimates that it has 0.3 staff members for every 100 fatalities in automobile crashes; the F.A.A. has at its disposal over 10,000 staff members for every 100 fatalities on commercial aircraft, according to N.H.T.S.A."

My partner is an amazing dad and my son is so lucky to have him, but dad isn't great with consistency or the less glamorous roles of parenting. But that doesn't mean that what I do is less important. It takes a team. 

And I think, because I don't view it negatively, that my son doesn't either. He knows it can't always be dinosaur hunting in the park and McDonald for dinner. He sees how we balance things, and even police's his dad sometimes if things get too wild."

8307,"The original Death Star was highly mobile and capable of FTL travel, so this would only work if it was in orbit or semi-stationary.  The DS2  although under construction was shielded from Endor which would protect it from such attacks.

8312,"There is a theory that the Raddus collided with the Supremacy before fully entering hyperspace, but while travelling close to the speed of light. In episode 4, Han says that the only thing they have to worry about for hyperspace jumps are massive objects, which cast a large mass shadow into hyperspace, which the Supremacy may not have and the other destroyers certainly didn't. This would also explain why it was only a move of desperation, as predicting where the ship would have to be to collide at high speed but before entering hyperspace could be difficult.

On another note, how could Holdo make a jump with no fuel left? Or was the jump made with hypermatter different from the sublight fuel?"

* People buying up certain products to sell online 
* People abandoning carts in the middle of an aisle to talk to people
* People trying to get you to pay for their groceries because they're too cheap to buy the memborship
* Shouting match over a Costco Cash card (Yes I saw this)
* Attempt Physical Assault over a Costco Cash card (He tried to slap the cart guy)

Most companies (if they have brains, anyway) preach safe practices in design, building, maintenence, etc. But taking the time to be safer - even if that's sending your engineers home because they've worked 14 12-hour days in a row and hace been surviving on coffee and instant ramen - costs money.

Clients (governments, banks, Donald Trump, etc.) aren't typically willing to accept that the cost of doing business includes letting your employees have human needs. They're also often stunningly ignorant about regulation and best practice. So, when it comes down to it, no matter how sincere your employer/manager is about safety, cost and schedule will overrule it every time.

And they will hold your job over your head to make sure they get their way.

So if you ever see a story about how many young engineers leave the industry, and wonder why well paying, interesting jobs are unfillable, there's a good chunk of your answer."

She was in Target in Summerlin (nice part of Vegas) with her 6 year old boy. As they were walking around getting their items, a girl about 10yrs old approaches her son and starts talking to him.  My friend didn't think anything of it at first and moved on, but this girl kept following them through the store. At one point the mom grabbed her son's hand to pulled him along and the little got obviously annoyed. So around the next aisle my friend found an employee and told them of this girl's suspicious behavior. The staff immediately jumped on it and radioed each other. All eyes on this little girl. Every store associate on the alert. 

So the Mom finally picked up her kid and put him in the cart. She was too stressed about this odd girl following her son around. When the girl realized she couldn't get near him anymore she walked out the front of the store. At the curb there was a car with it's engine running and a 30-something man in it. He was berating and yelling at the girl and she dropped her head and started crying and got into the car.

8415,I think a screaming   child would have been harmful for whole tribes at one point in history.
8416,"I was talking about why they have come up with this monster spirit story. There is no Walking Sam that makes children on the Rez kill themselves. The very real societal problems on the Rez cause children to kill themselves. When I say externalize, I mean people are projecting their fear of this happening and hanging it on some kind of outside force, in this case, an evil spirit. Somebody made it up and it has circulated because it's more comforting for people to believe in an evil spirit that would influence a child to commit suicide, rather than confronting the society they are a part of as being responsible. 

A child killing themselves seems inexplicable, because we think of children as happy and carefree, and suicide as something deeply troubled and depressed adults under great pressure do. Unfortunately, that is because we still have a poor relationship with mental illness in America. We don't like to think of it as something anyone may suffer from, even without a ""reason"". We also don't grasp that depression is a rooted in a problem in the brain that no amount of logic can overcome; people suffering depression don't NEED a reason to feel sad, they simply do feel that way, overwhelmingly. People don't see children as having a reason to be sad, but that pain and misery can drive them to suicide. The Rez have many factors to contribute to the problem; poverty, geographical isolation, high rates of addiction and alcoholism, broken homes, unstable living situations, lack of health services and resources, and being a part of a historically oppressed minority.

There is a sense in which Walking Sam is real, and that is as an idea. Like all pieces of culture, religion and folklore, Walking Sam is an idea. And ideas, like DNA, are naturally adapted to spread. Ideas that are helpful, like a scientific worldview that yields beneficial technologies, tend to survive because they are valued and passed on. An idea like Walking Sam is comforting, even though the idea of a spirit that drives children to suicide is horrifying. As I said, it externalizes the problem of child suicide on the Rez by placing the blame for it on an outside force, this malevolent spirit. As part of a culture that has a plethora of such entities in it's folklore, that can make the problem seem more managable to a religious person. Spirits can be warded off or appeased in their cultural understanding, so perhaps they can influence events somehow. 

Even if they are not believers in such traditional religious means, it helps normalize the tragedy of child suicide because it becomes Walking Sam's fault, not the community as a whole's fault. Little Joey killed himself because Walking Sam cursed him, not because we ignored his father's drinking and frequent absences, and his mother's neglect and abuse when she did pay attention to him. We all saw that, but for various social reasons, we didn't intervene or say anything. We saw Little Joey withdraw and become antisocial, but we didn't reach out because we didn't take it seriously because he's just a boy, kids go through phases. We all could have done more but we didn't and we have to live with that but by God we don't want to. We want no part of that blame. So we comfort Joey's grieving mother and later on when we're standing around at the wake someone will darkly mention Walking Sam and everyone will look around solemnly like ""Don't say such foolish things."" while everyone's eyes desperately seek out the corners as everyone shares a silent thought ""Yeah, that's a silly thing to believe, but what if it were true, even a teensy little bit? Then maybe it's not really our fault, and we weren't in control of whether Joey would kill himself?"" It's an out, an escape hatch for the blame we all bear."

8429,"I also feel like quick saving and loading mixed with fairly long levels really discourages experimental gameplay. 

MGS V had it right where they made every level fully replayable and relatively short while designing the game around having no intention of the first run being perfect.

Believe it or not though this is a problem with high difficulty in every game. It's why I play Uncharted and most single player games on easy. It's also why I don't get a competitive rank in Dota and stick with lower skilled players.

The higher the difficulty in a game the more you limit your options. Increasing difficulty forces you to find an optimal playstyle instead of being open and doing what you want. Unless a game is immensely intricately designed this means that as you increase the difficulty of the game the less open and fun it is. 

For stealth games designed around a sandbox and having interesting interactions a lower difficulty usually means more fun. MGS V solved this really well by just having one difficulty level and allowing the player to choose how difficult they make their game by the strategy they use."
8430,"I think I can understand the people saying they'd be put off by finding out they slept with a trans person after the fact. 


I'm not sure I agree with the people saying that it would be dishonest of the trans woman to not disclose this beforehand though. I think maybe for many trans women having lived as a man in the past is something they try to distance themselves from and understandably might be a very personal fact they don't want to talk about or have to be reminded of. 


I mean- there might be many other things about a woman someone might be very put off by if they knew. Maybe she's a stripper or a prostitute, she's slept with many people in the past, or she's currently sleeping with other people or in an open relationship. But for these examples I think less people would be inclined to call her dishonest or lying for not saying so."

Have you ever claimed a social security benefit? Have you ever borrowed money off someone? If so, did you keep records of how you spent that money? Did you forego cigarettes/alcohol/whatever your particular vice is until you paid back your creditor?

Additionally, for someone receiving child support, what counts as acceptable spend? Where do you draw the line? Are clothes OK? Toys? Additional luxury food items? Even if it's spent on alcohol or some other so-called vice, what does it matter if it's all added to the same pot?

The second a government gets this involved in how people spend benefits, the easier it becomes to deprive huge masses of people based on arbitrary value distinctions. It's not right.

While many people genuinely can't afford it- particularly people with huge student loans but no high paying job (dropouts or non-economically-useful major), or minimum wage makers, a very, very large number of people who complain about never being able to retire are people that absolutely could.

I've known way too many people who complain about not being able to retire but frequently do heavy social spending (restaurants/bars) and aren't contributing to 401ks/IRAs.

So if you don't want to be cursing your younger self when you're older, don't make big life decisions anytime soon.

**DO NOT walk through a marching band during the parade** or if you see them rehearsing somewhere. *Walk around.* I know it sounds obvious but you'd be amazed at how many people walk right through a band even when they're in the middle of playing and marching in a parade. I've seen a woman walk right into the middle of a band during a parade to get a picture - one of the staff even walked up to her and asked her politely to move out of the band and she told him to get out of her way. 

**For members of the band:**

* Two Fingers from the bridge of your nose to the brim of your shako, helmet, etc. And if you tilt it back - especially with Shakos - you'll look like an idiot.
* Everyone Counts. *Everyone.*
* Listen Back, not Forward (unless you're really, really far off the the side of the field - like past the 25 - or at the farthest point back in a form, in which case follow the DM/Conductor)
* We know what you do on the Band Bus. No, you're not being subtle. 
* Clap and cheer for every other band even if they're your mortal enemies. Also, don't be a bunch of assholes if you win or lose a competition. Save it for when you're back home.
* We can tell when you're not playing.
* We can tell when you don't know your drill sets
* We can tell when you haven't practiced
* Your shins *should* hurt. That's how you know your toes are up high enough. 
* Your lower back *should NOT* hurt. That's how you know you have bad marching posture. 
* The only people NOT allowed to complain about being tired from carrying their instrument is the Pit/Front Ensemble &amp; the Clarinets.
* If you're in your ""right"" spot but the rest of the form is somewhere else then you're wrong. 
* Being 15 minutes early is being On Time.

**EDIT: Some more rules that other people mentioned which I forgot about.**

* ALWAYS help the Pit
* If you're behind someone and they can't see you, it's you're responsibility in that moment to get out of the way so there's not a collision at that moment. The staff probably saw the issue and will correct it. If not, just raise your hand and say that you're running into each other during that set - it might be an issue with the drill or the form having shifted over the season.
* DO NOT touch other people's Instruments/Flags/Equipment/etc.

If you want to bring a gun into public then all of these things are required in most states.

For simply buying a gun? Paperwork and background checks are required (excluding private sales in most states) and waiting periods are useless unless it‚Äôs a first gun for someone. I understand the case for preventing suicide here but what if it‚Äôs someone with a violent stalker that needs immediate protection but has to wait 10 days or whatever? There are cases for both sides there. Plus how would the store prove it‚Äôs that persons first/not first gun? "

I am now really high and even if I ran back to class, at this point I would be late to the midterm and not allowed into the class.

8873,"That is happening where I'm at right now.  I got promoted a few months ago and some of my coworkers were (and continue to be) extremely bitter about it.  A few weeks ago it comes to light that they are not, and have not been for 2 years, doing a large portion of their job, which I was doing, under the assumption they were too.

Fast forward to our boss and our CEO telling me to take the reigns and put in a series of checks to make sure people are doing this portion of their job.  Co-workers now basically see me as the enemy, since it's somehow my fault they weren't using this system properly and I was.  Instead of asking me for help and guidance, they instead try to figure things out for themselves for about 5 minutes, then give up.

Case in point, I was asked to give a deadline for something last Friday that our CFO asked for.  I set the deadline on Tuesday, giving 4 days to do the work (only takes around 90 minutes).  I offered help on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, noting that I wasn't in most of Friday and wouldn't be able to help after around 1:00.  I get no responses to anything.  Friday rolls around, I've completed my portion of the work and again ask if anyone needs help to deaf ears.  I get an email Friday at 4:30 in a panic, with both my boss and CEO copied on it, saying that the system isn't working and I never explained how to do it properly (keep in mind, I'm talking about basics here).  I write back that my event actually just ended and I'll be back at the office in 10 minutes and will show them how to do it.  I return back to the office and the entire team is gone, no one responded to my note.  I write a follow up note asking if the tasks were done and get no response.  Monday morning rolls around and I check and see that literally nothing was done.  I spend 2-3 hrs Monday morning doing all of it so that our Finance team isn't put behind schedule because of us.  I am then met with pissed off people because I needlessly did their jobs for them, and it's my fault for leaving on Friday (didn't leave, was at a work event) without offering help.

Sometimes I don't understand people.  All they had to do was take one of my many, many offers to help, and it would have been fine, but instead they tried to do it last minute, when they knew I wasn't around.  The other part is, there are a dozen other people here who could have helped them, and instead of asking, they just told me it wasn't working once, then left."

One day we found a notebook of hers with people's names and the different ways they could be manipulated, the types of manipulation they're most susceptible to, their sore spots, their spots of pride and what different things she could get out of them (money, influence, favours, etc). It had her friends and coworkers past and present, our family and many pages devoted to me in it (her main use for me was as an ally against our estranged brother in all cases of future inheritance).

I haven't been in contact with her for 13 months and I'm terrified of her and the fact that she knows where I live.

My brother is no longer estranged though, which is nice. Turns out she'd essentially engineered all the drama that led to him leaving us seven years ago."

Most kids who are molested/abused/raped were molested/abused/raped by someone they know. Statistically speaking, your kid is more likely to be accidentally shot by a cop than to be kidnapped and raped by a stranger. They‚Äôre definitely not safer if you‚Äôre locking them in with their abuser. 

The solution is for people to stop being shitty parents. You have to engage with your kids every single day from the very moment they‚Äôre born. Talk to them. Play with them. Read to them. Don‚Äôt avoid a topic just because it‚Äôs uncomfortable to talk about. Ask about their friends and what they did each day. You know, be a good parent. 

If your kids are being raised by the tv and internet and you have zero idea what they‚Äôre watching or doing online, you‚Äôre a shitty parent. Yes, you‚Äôre kids will get mad and even resentful that you‚Äôre being so ‚Äúnosy‚Äù. Tough shit. You substantially decrease the risk of them being harmed just by knowing what‚Äôs going on in their lives. 

Here‚Äôs something else that makes you a shitty parent: trying to get some outside entity to do your fucking job for you. Which is what you‚Äôre proposing. You want some kind of nanny state solution where the government prevents kids from getting in danger so you don‚Äôt have to have a few hard conversations with your kids. It‚Äôs bullshit. It‚Äôs not the government‚Äôs job to shut down all streaming sites. It‚Äôs the parents job to talk to their kids about the dangers involved, monitor their activity, and maintain an open dialog about it so the kid feels safe and comfortable bringing up any problems they encounter. 

It‚Äôs impossible to eliminate all risk, no matter who‚Äôs managing the risk. However, there‚Äôs a point where it up to the parents *alone* to protect their kids. 

So, *we* don‚Äôt do shit. Each of us, individually, has to be the parent our children need us to be. "

Month one:

We've moved to our new home today. It's cozy. We're still frantically painting the master bedroom and half of our stuff is in boxes but it's coming along nicely.

As we've been so busy setting up our abode we've not had the time to make much in the way of ""real food"" and thus have resorted to bags of chips and Pringles far too often. I think the neighborhood understands this as we received a box of Redhots in the mail today. Lots of sugar but tasty none the less. We assume that it's a gift from the neighbours or the like. What a thoughtful community.

Month 2

We've once again recieved a box of Redhots. Odd for them to send a second. They must have thought that we were moving in this month and the previous box was meant to go help the previous owner in their month of packing. Well free Redhots are free Redhots.

Month 3

Yet another box of them came in the mail. I should find out who in the neighborhood organizes who sends these boxes out and help them fix their error.

Month 4

Can't find the origin of the Redhots. As delicious as they are this is starting to get a bit much. We have quite the amount stored up now.

Month 5

Did you realize you can replace any ingredients with Redhots while cooking? Tonight we had spaghetti with Redhots in place of meatballs. Yesterday Redhots fajitas. I think it's starting to get to my wife.

Month 6

ANOTHER package arrived and the other half recieved it. I got home from work to get screaming at me my prank has gone on long enough. She refuses to believe that I also know nothing of the origins of these packages. Perhaps mischievous spirits that just like screwing with people?

Month 7

Yup. Again this month

Month 8

My wife had to be committed. She started ranting about the mysterious meat products non stop. She had been talking to herself about them, screaming at people as loud as possible. If you ask her a question she will only answer with that dreaded word.

Month 14

So... Many...

Month 17

I've started a shrine to the deity of the Redhots in my late wife's studio in the house. The walls are now plastered with the packaging and still more packaging remains. Perhaps making a robe for my daily worshipping of the monthly gift of my great god of spicy cinamonyb goodness?

We just call it riisipuuro, which translates to rice porridge. It's eaten especially during Christmas time but other times as well, just not as often I guess.

A guest was also killed by a train because he jumped the fence to retrieve a lost hat. 

As for non-lethal, an employee jumped off the tracks onto the ground one day, and completely busted both of his legs on impact. Also, while doing a safety ride on a smaller coaster in the morning, a giant metal hook was hanging down right at head-level. Thankfully I ducked in time, and frantically motioned the crew not to load the guests as soon as I arrived back. On the same ride, also during a morning safety ride, a water ride above had broken and was pouring a waterfall above our track. Spent the whole day soaked.

9046,"I like the STAR method for interviews. It helps you have an answer for most, if not any, of those awkward questions you may be asked.

The STAR method includes:

Situation - Think of a situation in which you've had to do something, faced a challenge, etc.

Task - What was your task in this situation? What were you trying to do, accomplish, achieve? Sometimes ""Target"" is used here instead of Task. What was the Target you set for yourself in the Situation?

Action - What did you do to accomplish your Task or reach your Target? Why did you choose this Action?

Result - What was the end result? Did you meet your objectives? What did you learn?

You can think of a single situation and think of several responses by utilizing the STAR method prior to your interview. Think of answers for the ""Explain a time where..."" questions and others. Even if you are asked something you haven't practiced, you can still use the STAR method to think of a response on the fly while still giving a well structured response.

Because most of the heart muscle had died, he was only pumping out approx 10% of the blood that gets into the heart; normal people pump out about 60%.

He was doing ok, but then his heart starting beating really fast (which is bad, because there's not enough time for blood to fill the chambers of the heart). And then it got worse because his heart stopped beating and they couldn't shock/medicate him out of it. They tried to do another procedure called ECMO where they take blood out, put oxygen in/take carbon dioxide out, and then put the blood back in the body. But that didn't work either.

9105,"College professor here. The hype around terrible professors who can't be fired due to tenure is largely a myth. Maybe it happens at some of the largest research universities for ones who bring in huge grants, but community colleges and second tier and below state universities put a lot of priority on teaching because the majority of their operating budgets now come from tuition (a few decades ago, it used to be state taxes). 

That being said, the professors you want to watch out for are the adjuncts. The dirty little secret in the profession is that most college courses these days are taught by what we call ""contingent"" faculty. These are mostly people who teach part time for a pittance, and to make ends meet, they often end up teaching way too many courses spread around as many schools as they can (for example, an adjunct at my institution would have to teach around three times the number of courses I teach to make what I make as a full time professor). That means that even the awesome teachers in this situation are likely to be burnt out and not doing their best work. Even worse, when we pay such a low wage (and don't give benefits, don't have offices for them, etc), departments can't afford to be choosy. I've seen some amazing adjunct teachers, but some of the worst college teachers I've ever seen were adjuncts as well. Just poorly trained, haven't kept up with professional development, don't care about students, etc. 

My advice is, at least for your undergraduate work, unless you're attending a top tier university where you may not have much of a choice, pick professors who are tenured or on the tenure track (with titles like assistant or associate professor, NOT lecturer or instructor). You'll find much more consistent positive results that way. Otherwise, you're tossing the dice. "

9107,"May my obese self offer some insight here?

I feel like the reason skinny shaming is ""acceptable"" and fat shaming is seen as evil is because of the work involved in becoming an ideal weight. 

For example, a skinny person may have their body issues and struggles trivialized because apparently all they need to do is eat! They must have it made! Pizza and cheesecake all day! Except anyone who looks at it deeper will know most of the time that's not all there is to it.

Whereas someone very heavy, has to eat way less and for faster results, work out. Stuff that is usually not fun at all to most people. So it's like they're saying ""Dude, we have to work way harder than you, let us have this, shut up and eat your cake, Twiggy Bones.""

It's just lack of empathy imo. It's like when someone beautiful or rich is struggling with life problems and someone says ""What do YOU have to be upset about?""

I'm jealous of skinny women of course, but there's no reason for me to call her ugly and convince her shes undesirable. For all I know, she could be telling herself that every day behind closed doors. "

For people who aren't familiar with it, it's basically--very broadly--a fascination with giants/being small. Think along the lines of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.

I had an obsession with episodes of shows that involved people getting shrunk, or giant people. I'd watch them over and over again; I wasn't subtle about it at all. I'd be VERY surprised if they never made a connection. I recall one time we went to Disney World when I was 9 or 10 years old, and Honey We Shrunk Ourselves was on the hotel TV, and they insisted we switch it to something different without telling me why, even though I wanted them to stay on it. Stuff like that has me convinced they knew."

Just a friendly advice,  if your daughter has a tablet / phone ask her to take a short video of her self brushing her teeths so you can make sure she's doing. She'll commit to it for a while but probably after that she'll start showing you older videos she took to try and fool you that's when you confess that your father used to beat with a pair a jumper cables when you skipped brushing your teeth,  she'll never skip brushing her teeth again.

9191,"As an adult with children, I don‚Äôt think it is. I think that when kids are old enough to be able to ask why a rule is in place, they deserve a legitimate answer. They might not accept the answer or believe that it‚Äôs a good reason, but whether it comes down to a lengthy explanation or ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù, the message is ultimately the same: ‚ÄúThis is the rule, and if you don‚Äôt follow it, there will be consequences.‚Äù

In my experience, they‚Äôre more likely to follow the rule when they understand that there‚Äôs a reason for the rule, even if they don‚Äôt agree with it. If they think it‚Äôs just an arbitrary exercise of power, they‚Äôll be less inclined to comply with it.

My vision exploded with rainbow rivers everywhere, and suddenly everything was amazing.  My mind was wandering into the cosmos, and all of my thoughts became connected, like, my brain was telling me everything in the universe was connected with each other in some way.  I opened my eyes.  The half-smoked cigarette in my ash tray looked really stretched out.  My cat was lying next to me, and she looked like a snake she was so stretchy.

The weed gave me munchies, so I was snacking on gummy sharks that I purchased beforehand.  They felt amazing in my mouth, like they were swimming around and I didn't want to swallow them because it was so awesome.


At my peak, I heard what sounded like an alien language when I was lying down with my eyes closed.  The creators of the universe were signaling to me, making me aware of their presence, and they were benevolent.

All in all, I laid in my bed with my eyes closed for about seven hours and just let my mind take me where I was supposed to go. It was an incredible experience that I would definitely do again.

A good case scenario here is legal fees + the cost of a reasonable assumption of how many packs of biscuits you'd buy in a lifetime. Usually lifetime supply contests have a limit (like 1/week) or something so that'd be pretty easy to estimate. Let's say mom's 30 at the time. )$3 box of biscuits * 52 weeks)*50 years = $7,800.

9336,"&gt; Honestly, given how selective the democrats are in their 'support' of minorities, i feel its entirely fair.
&gt; 
&gt; They claim to stand up for us all, but then when it comes to issues like the increase in hate crimes committed against Native Americans, like me, they remain silent.

I'll be frank and say that I was unaware of this statistic, but I have seen democrats give support to Native American groups.  On the top of my head, it was largely democrats that supported the Native American protests of the keystone pipeline.  Indeed, a democratic elector caste the first ever electoral college vote for a Native American, Spotted Eagle.  

&gt;They have also begun pushing, in some states, for Native American Reservations to have to pay taxes, and Republicans have been the only ones to look at this and say 'what the actual fuck'.

I don't think this is discriminatory against Native Americans at all.  I'll admit I'm not sure how taxes work within reservations but I don't think its discriminatory or unfair to require them to pay federal taxes when they receive federal benefits.

&gt;I dislike Democrats, not because of their policy ideas, but because they lie through their teeth about 'standing up for the little guy', when really they are just trying to make their own lives easier.

&gt;Ever notice how in California, so many of their laws have exceptions made for acting legislators and other government leaders? For example their gun laws, which ban so many guns, do not apply to law makers.

First time I'm hearing about this too.  But I do know that it goes the other way too.  Republicans in some states advocate to allow guns everywhere, including bars and churches.  But guns are still banned within the legislature, and even banned at Mike Pence's recent address to the NRA. 

&gt;Also, Snopes is not my idea of a reliable source of True/False verdicts, as they typically lean left, heavily.

Saying my source is biased is not the same thing as providing evidence that he said it.  Your free to actually support your allegations with evidence.

""Taxes should be low"" sure, great. They should be as low as the max benefit allows. It doesn't make sense to have everyone at a 70% tax rate. There's just not enough necessary spending to justify that nod could the economy support it. 
""People shouldn't have to pay taxes if they don't want to"" free rider problem. In addition we all benefit from what these taxes are spent on, both directly and indirectly.

I lived pretty fucked up for a while and we're still working it out, but I'm 25 and we're just now getting really close again. I didnt want to lose him before we got close again, but I had to grow so damn much to realize that. There were some things my dad could've done better, but if I was to suggest anything, live as a beacon man. Let your life be an example. Not only for your kids to see but for your church and for all the people those kids interact with to see. My dad is an incredibly selfless dude, it's part of what brought me to the realization that while not perfect, that hes a good man. Just step up, be a Man (not like you have to be macho and kill shit, but be a man, stand tough on your values and be an example for your children to follow.) And fight for them however you can. I know family court is so biased against fathers but do what you can. Children need their father to grow into successful humans. I can tell you're a great dad, your kids will realize eventually. Just do your damndest to hang around until then. Work with your ex wifes parents, other family that's sympathetic, church elders, anyone your kids interact with that can act as an antidote to the poison your ex is filling their heads with. It's worth it in the end. Dont give up on them and your kids will thank you forever when they're older. Best of luck my friend.

Also everyone buys you cute newborn clothes. My baby couldn‚Äôt fit any newborn clothes and only lasted about 1 1/2 months in 3month clothing. After that it was constant clothes shopping.

My kids don't have any obvious signs, they do have some brain/mental issues that can be HIV related, but could also be caused by other factors in their early lives. Those things would be too early to see in your friend, even if  she has HIV. The early symptoms are similar to any other illness, or to just being run down, which makes it hard to rule it out, if you are worried about it. Does your friend have a specific reason to think they are exposed? If they had an exposure to someone with untreated HIV, there is obviously a risk. If they had exposure to someone who is HIV positive, but taking meds, the risk is very small. If the meds they are on are working well, the risk is basically non existent.

My Dad was a firefighter. Back in the days when an average local firefighter did a little bit of everything from actually fight a house fire to auto extractions to search and rescue to... dive for drowned kids.

Anyway, there had been this downing that summer of a girl that was my age and (by all accounts in my family) looked *just* like me. The firefighters in my Dad's station took turns and dove the lake for a week before they found her. All the guys were obsessed. Both my uncles were firefighters too. So that meant both my aunts and my Mom were making food and bringing it to the lake round the clock to keep the guys going to look for this little blonde haired blue eyed girl. They were there on their time off- beside themselves to find this poor kid for her parents. My Dad was there the day they brought up her little body. It haunted him for months. Hell, for all I know, maybe years. It was the first time I ever saw my Dad cry.

I guess the fact that I couldn't swim was like a knife in his side from that moment on. He couldn't bear it. I think he looked at me &amp; saw that girl's body every day. He made my Mom sign me up for lessons the moment school started.

She didn't know what they were doing to me. It was the kind of thing where you drop your kid off before school and they walk you over when school starts. And at first it wasn't that bad. It was kind of fun until I wasn't making ""adequate progress"" and wouldn't stick my face in the water. Then the shit hit the fan. And I was only 6 years old. When I complained my Mom thought I didn't want to get up early or didn't want to get in the water because it was getting colder... and I wasn't doing a good job of explaining the guy was mean. She told me later that all I said was he ""didn't like me.""

Once she saw what happened, she was so beside herself angry she could barely speak. What I didn't see while I was getting dressed was she told that instructor if he ever laid a hand on any child like that again she would have him fired, sued and possibly murdered. And apparently once she told my Dad what happened he went down and had the guy's credentials pulled. I never knew any of that when I was little though. The next summer, my uncle got a pool and my uncles and my Dad taught me how to swim. (I still don't put my face under that much though... I like staying on top of the water most of the time.)"
9523,"It doesn't help with *crucible* steel, which is what modern steel is, but no one had crucible steel back then.  Their furnaces weren't hot enough.  

Here's how everyone (and I mean everyone) smelted steel:  
1.  Get rocks with iron.  If in Japan, get sand with iron.  
2.  Throw rocks into furnace.  
3.  Copper, tin, lead, etc, melt out, and pour out the bottom.  
4.  The iron doesn't melt, but kind of oozes into a blob at the bottom of the furnace, with roughly the same speed as molasses in Canada.  It never liquefies, but it softens enough to sort of gloop together.  
5.  Put out the fire and retrieve your iron.  

The smiths now have a big crusty chunk of iron, some of which will have mixed with the carbon ash and soot to make steel.  The smith breaks off the steel to use.  

The misconception that katanas are made with pig iron is just that, a misconception.  They did add extremely high-carbon steel to the swords (too high carbon for a proper sword), because the longer you have the steel heated for forging, the more it burns the carbon out and turns it back into ordinary iron.  They intentionally had too much carbon, with the intent of burning it down to a good level.  European smiths just stopped fucking about and finished before they burned out much carbon.  

On the subject of folding, literally everyone did that.  Without being able to actually liquify steel, the  only way to even out the impurities and carbon content along the entire blade was to basically knead it like dough.  Except you can't knead it, because it's really, really hot.  So instead, fold, hammer, fold, hammer.  

Unless you're a celt.  Then you twist, hammer really flat, and braid steel ribbons together to make the blade.   The celts were metal as fuck, which is appropriate since they were one of the first cultures to enter the iron age.  "

  Just because it's understandable doesn't make it all right to do or mean that no one should say anything.  People's kids are theirs to raise, but not to damage and abuse.

Basically if you didn't hit numbers (which were insane) you got written up and if you missed them again you were fired. I missed numbers once and they rode my ass and that's when I decided to quit without notice. The conversation the day I quit went something like this

9621,"A few months back I was sent to a really fancy house to do some electrical work. I went into the attic which was a mess and had to move a bunch of shit to get to where I needed to work. 

While moving some boxes I uncovered a guitar. Literally under a 20lbs box, just laying there. I talked to the owner and he was like ""oh wow, I haven't seen that in years"" and then goes on to tell me about how he had bought like 8 years ago and he forgot all about it. I was actually looking for a guitar to start messing around with and I recognized the maker, Ibanez. So I ask if he would be interested in selling it. He said, ""hell man that guitar would never see the light of day"", had I not moved that box. And said I could have it. I was blown away. It was a really nice looking guitar. I looked it up when I got home and it was like a $7-800 guitar. Even more blown away! 

So I take it to the music store and they tell me the neck is a little warped but nothing major and obviously needed new strings and some work to the electrical components. $100 and it would be good as new. Paid and went and picked it up a week later. So pumped. 

I was in my work truck when I got it. And as I was getting in the seat my boss calls. I answer and hes like hey so... That guitar, they want it back.


The wife thought I had stolen it! This bitch is seriously crazy. (These people are very very rich and shes pilled out 24/7.) Her husband was out of town and he must have talked to her about it how else would she know it's not like she's checking under the box to make sure it's still there. So I'm like fuck it, it felt too good to be true so I went to return it. When I got there I told her that I had not stolen and and explained what happened and also that I had paid $100 to have it fixed. Showed her the receipt and she was like ""I'm not paying, give me the guitar."" I said ""ok but first I'm taking the strings."" I went to the van, got my side cutters and cut all the strings off and handed her the guitar. She looked furious and i drove away.

Really long story for really no reason. My boss felt bad and gave me a $100 ""bonus"" on that weeks check. He's a cool guy.

9622,"My mom was a university student when she met my biological father. He was older, classy as fuck, dressed in suits, had a Mercedes, swept her off her feet. They started dating and he took her out to amazing places, went all out, met the parents. This guy spend literally all day with her, kept staying in my mom‚Äôs house from early morning until late at night, spent all his money on my mom and whatever she wanted. Even when he was home he was stuck to the (landline, early 90s) phone. My mom went to his house and met HIS parents, they made dinner and congratulated the beautiful couple, even mentioning that they could hear wedding bells. She also met his siblings and other family members, who were supportive. My mom decided she had to finish her Master‚Äôs degree before settling down, which looking back was a good idea. 

My mom got pregnant with me, and while I wasn‚Äôt planned, she was over the moon and told my biological dad. He acted kind of weird, but she attributed it to the news. Then he started to not take her calls, to slip out early, ignore her needs. When she asked him to start getting ready for the baby (diapers, crib, pregnancy/birth stuff) he wouldn‚Äôt pay attention to her. It got to the point she basically told him to either step up or go to hell, and he said he couldn‚Äôt take care of the baby because he had like 5 others. 

Turns out he was a married man with kids, who actually fully lived with his family. He just liked to frequent young women and his family supported this, to the point they would normally meet the women he swindled and act like he didn‚Äôt have a wife at home and a troop of kids waiting for their dad. My mom was shocked. She officially broke up with him, sent him to hell, called his wife to tell her. The wife knew, but regarded my mom as a slut who seduced her good husband, and has stayed with him until this day. I don‚Äôt know my half brothers and sisters because they are still brainwashed and think their dad is amazing and he could do no wrong. 

Stupidly enough my mom always spoke of him positively even though he‚Äôs never even given me a call or a birthday card. I‚Äôve been trying to add my biological dad on Facebook/sent him messages asking to talk so I can get closure, but he deletes my friend requests and leaves me on read. 

His wife, his kids, my mom, me ...we didn‚Äôt deserve this. He might had seen this whole ordeal as just a couple months of fun, but my life was created this way. That is my beginning. Sometimes I want him to die, other times I wanna hug him. Mostly die, though. "

9663,"I had a massive war on my class and it was actually my fault. a friend of mine was bored during the mechatronics class and decided to mess with his materials. he ended up discovering that he could make a slingshot using a piece of cardboard, some icecream sticks, an elastic and a piece of folded paper. he taught me how to do it and we spent the following weeks improving it. in matter of days it went from a big square with several elastics on it to a small rectangle with only one elastic. the improved sling was really efficient and the range that the projectiles could reach was impressive, needless to say that we were really proud of it. it was before the smartphone era and i didn't had a decent computer so I had a lot of free time. I got some cardboards for free at the supermarket, bought a box of elastics and started to make a shit ton of slingshots. I was now u/winterglitchh, the great slingshot blacksmith. eventually, I became u/winterglitchh the great slingshot dealer, because everyone I knew wanted one. it wasn't so hard to produce so I was selling each slingshot for the same price as a snack on the cafeteria and only a few cents per projectile. I must have sold about 15 slingshots to my classmates in just one week. I even branded it! I called my company ""dino"" (because I liked dinossaurs) and the logo was a dinossaur footprint. I was a good CEO. I tried to sell it inside a small box with a manual, but I gave up after two units because it was too much work. I spent all the money I earned with food, because I wasn't particularly good with money. anyway, the classroom was constant, it was always the same students every time, differently from some american schools where you have different rooms and classmates for each subject. the teachers were the ones that changed the rooms, not us. it was almost the end of the school year, so in one of the last days, when the teacher left the room, it happened. one kid decided to shot the other using his very deadly (/s) and majestic slingshot. a few moments later the place was literally a battlefield. everyone that had brought the weapon to school was firing it  aiming at literally anyone, and the ones who didn't had bought my slingshot (FOOLS!) were seeking shelter or shooting their erasers. one kid trew his book on the wall fan, for some reason. it was epic, almost like the things you see in movies. it didn't last long though, as the other teacher was on the way. I still don't know how no one got blind or something. at the end of the war we picked up the things from the ground and pretended that nothing happened. it didn't work very well, because a dumbass kid had cracked the fan blade with his book and we overlooked some projectiles, so eventually me and my friend were discovered and we ended up on the principal's office. she was really cool so we didn't get in trouble but she took every slingshot and projectile we had, except for the hidden ones. 10/10 would do it again

9668,"It's kind of a major unspoken rule in society that we don't point out each other's character flaws even though it would benefit everyone to know about them, because when you do, people usually react with defensiveness instead of gratitude.

For example, If you have a habit of interrupting people, the vast majority won't politely and discretely point it out, they'll just stop including you in conversations. If you have a friend who does point these kinds of things out to you, you should definitely keep them around, because those friends are hard to come by.

People in Academia get away with it a bit more, because A) you can't just hire a new physics professor off the street because the last one was an asshole and B) It's also a bit expected that someone who's spent more time with their nose buried in a book than they have interacting with humans would be a bit rough around the edges. It's one of the few places where people actually earn their position based on merit, in nearly every other career field you'll hear people complain ""That girl only got the job because her family is connected"" or ""That guy sucks at his job but the boss likes him"" so there is a bit of a trade-off with that."

I mean I pretended it was hot because I wanted to survive, and he had gotten the same response from multiple women, and I was like ""Maybe women respond like this because they were terrified and thought their lives were in danger, because that's certainly what I did."" And he was like ohhhhhhhhh. I truly think he didn't get it until then. That's not even mentioning porn making bobbing a girl giving you a blow job seem hot, or the surprise no-prep anal, or twisting the shit out of your nipples. Porn makes a lot of shit that is painful for most women seem like it's super hot to guys, and I've been on the receiving end of this. Honestly now if I'm dating a guy and he's really into porn I simply don't date him-- even though I don't think there's anything wrong with watching porn.

I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with porn, and it COULD be an incredible platform to educate young men about sex-- and there IS some porn and some porn actors who do this, I remember seeing one about using the labia to stimulate the clitoris. However, conservative people who have weird and toxic ideas about sex, and leftist people who have dismissed the entirety of porn because of ethically crappy porn, really prevent this from ever being a feasible reality. But in the meantime porn just seems to overly promote really really bad, painful ways to do sex to women. I no like."

9709,"For privatization of public utilities or services to be efficient, private managers must have an incentive to serve the public interest over the interest of shareholders. Of course, private firms will always in act in a manner which will generate the most profit. Noting these two things, it is only logical to come to the conclusion that private companies will only serve the public interest over the interest of shareholders if and only if doing the former will give them more profit. For that to be the case, the market must be competitive. [Source.](https://hbr.org/1991/11/does-privatization-serve-the-public-interest)


Now let's look at internet infrastructure. I completely agree with you that Big Cable is an oligopoly that is harming consumers; however, the reason why the cable industry is inefficient is not because of the inherent nature of the market, [but rather because of regulations by local government which make it impossible for potential competitors to enter the industry.](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/) If these barriers to entry were to be eliminated, then ISPs would have an incentive to better serve their consumers or risk losing business. 



In regard to healthcare, while I am against single-payer healthcare, I am for universal healthcare which combines both public and private elements--a sort of hybrid system somewhat akin to Obamacare. The latter is much more common throughout the world and is almost always much more efficient than the former. I would much rather prefer a system of healthcare similar to Germany's or Singapore's, as opposed to an American version of the NHS.



Of course, to answer your main question, I believe that most publically run services should *NOT* be privatized because the majority of them are mostly non-rivalrous and non-excludable, so they could not be provided in a free market. That said, I do support free market reform such as *reasonable* deregulation at the local level (getting rid of barriers to entry in the ISP industry, getting rid of zoning laws which make building housing unprofitable, removing virtually all forms of rent control which causes the prices of homes to skyrocket, etc.), removing barriers to free trade, and allowing for increased and easier immigration (which is actually a pretty liberal position, but I digress)."

He was nearly 50 coaching a teenage co-ed ski team, when most coaches are 18-30. The girls on my team didn't like going up the chairlift alone with him and even the boys were uneasy around him. Our parents thought we were being rude and just didn't like the new coach since our old one left. We all did considerably better that season though we were told to just deal with it.

A few years after we aged out of his team, found out he was arrested for a massive child porn ring and our parents were asking us ""did you know about this???""  "

What I do want is for the president and the Republican Party to stop acting like there is nothing wrong, to grow some red, white and blue balls again and call Russia out on this blatant act of sabotage on our democracy, and for Congress to censure the president for his obstinate refusal to condemn Russia for it, and to stand against corruption, fascism, Nazis and the KKK.

Anyway, they all tried to tell her she shouldn't get married and said it wouldn't last. I really just wanted to hold mirrors up to their faces whenever I saw them after that. Some people just can't accept that even though it didn't work out for them, it CAN work out for others."

She displayed signs of abuse and told me her brother would steal her stuffed animals and cut holes in them to use them for his own pleasure.  The dude was unstable and always lived with his mom. His mom ran a day care and one day it was raided and he was hauled off. 

She was forced to shut the day care down when she bailed her son out and let him return home. She was more concerned about him than anyone else. I can't say if he ever did do anything to a day care kid but I do know, in hindsight, his sister was most likely being sexually abused by him and her mom brought the predator back.  

Last Google shows he was picked up again and he's serving small time.

Then his mother died while he was still a teenager and he subsequently joined the military and ended up fighting in a war.

Despite all of that tragedy early in his life and the horrors he saw in the war, he was an incredible father to us kids. He was neck and neck with our mother in terms of being motherly and nurturing and the only time any of us witnessed him being violent or ill-tempered was when a screaming man started striking his wife/girlfriend in their parked car at a gas station. Our dad intervened by punching through the guy's window and dragging him out to toss him on the ground."

I haven't had a date in years. I'm not even able to make friends. It's been years since I've had sex. By this point the idea of abandoning my ideals in order to just be able to experience physical intimacy again seems very attractive.

Not really competing, because fuck me - your car looks like nobody walked out from that one, but once upon a time dozed off at the wheel. In a friday post work ""rush hour"" if it can be called that. On a 2 way highway (ie just one lane for each direction, in case my english terminology is wrong). With wife and kid in the car.

Being a sleep, just calmly swerved to the opposite lane, and then off the road, down the bank there. Some half way there I of course woke up with the wife screaming from back seat (she had been looking at the kid for the duration of this), didn't really get to do anything but hit the breaks (figured any sharp movements on the wheel would have flipped it)

Down the bank there was about 1 meter deep field of wet snow, which acted like a pillow and just took in the speed and stopped the car. Got out, scratched my head, called a friend to pick up the wife and kid and drive them to our place, spent next 3 hours, with 2 tow trucks trying to fish the car out from the snow. 

The car had lost a tiny piece of plastic somewhere under the front bumper, but not even deformed anywhere. Not a scratch on anyone. didnt hit anyone or anything on the way. not the (busy!) traffic in the opposite lanes. no trees on the bank or anything. Even the car - snow melted off the engine and I happily drove it home the next day.

So yeah. No point in buying lottery tickets and such - all luck was used up just there. The enormity of luck used up, is still still sometimes not fully grasped, but I do try to appreciate it.

9969,"Holy shit fucking *no*. That movie is **messed up**. It's way too real in terms of anxiety and dread and when it actually gets to the horror part it mostly shows you things in the background hiding in the dark which will get you staring at shadows all night for days. The rare times it likes to show you something head on it's really messed up imagery but not cheesy enough to not be unsettling. When it ended the theater was dead silent for a bit into the credits. It was a fantastic theater experience with no jumpscares. It hangs on scenes with something in the background and you could hear the individual gasps of people as they realize and point towards it. 

It's a very damn good movie. The acting is out of this world. It makes you feel a little sick like you're about to have an anxiety attack. I highly recommend watching it just to experience a movie with emotion like that, but you really have to be prepared for something a bit different.

Edit: I will add that the movie is also a very slow burn. 

Kinda funny extra bit but I had asked a horror buff buddy if it was any good and he almost seemed abrasive on the subject. Like he liked it but didn't know how to put into words if he actually recommended it.

Then there was Rick.  He was ""the really good motorcycle mechanic.""  Rick needed a cell phone for his ""business"" and of course, no cell phone company would sign a contract with him.  So here comes Andrea.  This was during the days before unlimited so you had to pay for minutes.  First month the bill comes in, it's $1200 and of course, Rick didn't have that kind of money....

Rodney at least tried.  She cosigned another loan for him to buy a truck and a bunch of tools.  I can't remember but maybe he was an electrician or HVAC.  Anyway, he does his best but work was spotty and he fell behind.  The truck was finally repossessed and that signaled the end of this."

His lawyer may have threatened a lawsuit and they caved. I query whether in reality if this ever went to court if you would succeed in your argument. I know there are regulations in place in some jurisdictions to protect workers that may prohibit them from unilaterally clawing back the worker's pay, but I believe on the flip side that they would also be able to go sue the worker for repayment, get judgment and then potentially garnish his wages. The protections more there to protect against employers unilaterally imposing repayment without any oversight (maybe you don't really owe for whatever they say you do), but at the end of the day, it's not like Monopoly - ""bank error in your favour!"" You don't get to keep extra pay you didn't actually earn - especially if the paycheque was so large that it should have been self-evident there had been an error that should have been brought to the employer's attention, but you cashed it in bad faith any used the money anyway."

I don't know if he worked there or what, but it seemed like he was always there and he would always chat me up. He was friendly enough, a bit on the odd side, but I had zero interest in him. Anyways, so one day I'm at the mall solo and he comes up to me. I'm drinking a smoothie and he asks if he can have a sip. I give him the cup, he takes a long sip, and then hands it back. I take a sip, and then he says something along the lines of, ""How difficult do you think it is to contract AIDS?"" I freak the fuck out and leave. I immediately call my mom to ask her boss, who's a doctor, if it's possible to get AIDS from drinking out of the same straw as someone else. Looking back I should've known better, we learned about HIV/AIDS in middle school and I knew full well I couldn't contract it, but it was such a creepy thing to say to someone.

Former real estate broker here.

Mortgage brokers are the scum of the industry.  Many will do everything possible to keep you from seeing the paperwork until the last possible second.  This is usually because they're hiding something and hope you either won't notice it when you're at the closing table with 200 pages of stuff, or that if you do notice it you will be in such a hurry to get closing done, you will just sign anyway.  

I almost always had to fight to get my clients the mortgage paperwork in time to read it before closing, and half the time there was some bullshit the mortgage broker didn't disclose.  It ranged from thousands in additional fees to completely different terms than what the client was told they had.  On several occasions clients who had been adamant in requesting fixed rate mortgages were presented with variable rate mortgages.  The closest I ever came to punching out anyone I did business with was when one mortgage broker who tried this justified his actions by saying ""well, it's fixed until the interest rate rises.""  At a time when fixed rates were about 6%, this mortgage would have had my client paying 12% after three years.  Client did get a 6% fixed rate mortgage somewhere else after I convinced them their 'family friend' was a shitbag."

""Okay, but what should I do?""  She told me about calling Mom's friends and relatives.

""It's really late, what should I do now?""

10100,"&gt; Suddenly is such a shite way to go. ‚Ä¶ Suddenly dying can be the worst way to go, and not just for you.

Ive had just about my entire family die in in a five year period, ten to fifteen years ago. 23 people. Started with my best friends suicide, then my girlfriend got in a car accident, then parents, grandparents, siblings, a nephews, more friends etc.  Heart attacks, car crashes, suicides, tragic fatal accidents, cancer, cancer, more cancer, even more cancer.


Suddenly is by far the preferred way.  Getting terminal cancer and sticking around for two years when you are in pain, not enjoying life, and everyone knows you are going to die, and still feels guilty and obligated to visit the hospital every day and watch you suffer, every day for two years, and then feels extra guilty about feeling obligated about visiting you, is by far the worst way to go.  Watching that slow painful slide into nothingness while there is nothing anyone can do to help.

Getting a phone call. ""your uncle who was like a father to you and raised died of a heart attack last night. There will be a funeral next Saturday""  is about the easiest way it can go about of all the options Ive lived through.  Way easier then say, eating breakfast with your mother and having her not feel well and go lie down and then her heart stops and you call 911 and give cpr and then spend weeks watching her in a coma at the hospital until she finally goes.

That said, everyone is different in how they grieve, and I am truly sorry for your loss.  I lost a long term girlfriend, and I didn't think we were going to end up married, but it was still painful and brought up a lot of mixed emotions, but nowhere near as painful as your story."

They can manage to be minimally friendly or kind without being emotionally involved. Empathy doesn't mean ""making someone feel better"" or even getting emotionally involved at all. It means understanding what others are going through and being a decent human being. It's not that hard to be kind, or at least not rude. So no, I don't think that's an excuse. At the time, I just wanted to go home and I was too embarrassed to think much of it, I even thanked them multiple times for helping me and apologized for taking their time. Now though, I'm really angry at how badly they treated me, and I have a right to be.

Also, I paid *thousands of dollars* for a minor procedure that barely took their time. The ER was almost empty.

There was significant bleeding in his brain and the chances of him waking up were next to none. He had also begun bleeding uncontrollably from his nose which was alarming. 
We spend the next 6 hours with the child during which we had to perform cpr twice. His father looked pale and like he was going insane in his own head. His son finally passed away while we performed cpr the 3rd time, and his father kept trying to hold on to his son and kept calling his name hoping he would wake up. The whole incident left me shaken. 
&amp; the worst part? The accident happened because his son kept insisting he wanted his dad to buy a toy for him and so his dad took him out for a little trip around the neighborhood. It still haunts me when I think about what his father must have felt during that night."

10114,"I'm not in this profession, but I studied it for my degree in school...chemistry...relating to pharmacology, medicine, statistics, etc.

Basically, in a high level chemistry course, we were taught how there are a handful of formulas that we will learn more about in graduate school (think Master's or PhD in pharmacology/chemistry) that will allow us how to purposely skew data to align more with our hypothesis. The purpose is to show more favorable results to secure further funding (grants for continued research on your project even though it's garbage), or to secure approvals (think medicine to market approvals).

We were shown three different formulas and their effects on graphs, data, and how they are used in the industry today to show more favorable curves on graphs related to the data collected.

We were then taught, this is why all scientists must only look at the raw data for anything in order to glean an actual idea about the information at hand. We were also taught that all of these methods are legal, generally accepted practices.

On that day, I learned that most medical/pharmacology statistics are bullshit. Moral of the story? Don't ever trust science statistics without reading and understanding the raw data. The science/medical stats shown in news articles, brochures, on TV, in documentaries, etc tend to all be skewed BS that the company/researcher has skewed with math to prove their point.

10169,"They can be intelligent, but they can also not knowing how painfully much they don't know.  

Think about it.  As a 15 year old, talking to a 40 year old, that 40 year old isn't telling you don't know things, because of the number on your learner's permit.  He's saying it because he knows that there's another 25 years worth of life information, things you haven't seen, places you haven't gone, things you haven't done, that you are just missing.  

Its not just that that data is ""missing"".  Its that it is impossible for you to even grasp HOW missing it is.  You can't even grasp how incomplete your depth of experience is, because you don't have a frame of reference for that 25 years because you've never seen it.  

Its like watching the FIRST season of Game Of Thrones, not even knowing really that more seasons exist, and arguing with someone who has seen the whole thing up to now, about who you're rooting for and how intense the death penalty episode was.  "

10209,"There's a lot of great insight here. I'm 32 so social media really started picking up when I was starting college. ""Back in my day"" Facebook was limited to only folks that had a university email. However, I've always been a gamer so I started making friendships online before social media made it as easy. Many people older than me simply never branched out electronically so their circles of contacts are pretty confined to the people they see on a regular basis.

When you choose friends based on proximity rather than shared interests or world views it can be very difficult to maintain those relationships without basically walking on eggshells. This *greatly* limits the things you can talk about comfortably. The combination of older people not branching out along with the fact that you have a smaller group of peers you frequently interact with means that people tend to, as you noted, become less social and live in the past.

Similarly, the internet basically started becoming a thing back when I was in elementary school, though it was a shadow of what it is today. Still, I grew up learning how to look things up online so I still have that drive to learn and the ability to do so just like younger folks. I would say that aside from the obvious date, the introduction of the internet is what most clearly divides Millennials (and younger) from the older generations. Gen Xers only really had the internet start when they were in later high school or already professionals, Boomers had it well into their careers. Millennials and younger though grew up with it the whole time.

As for adults talking to teenagers, I guess it just comes down to not knowing what to talk about specifically. The larger your age divide the harder it is to find things in common to talk about. I don't have much of a problem because I still keep up with media and games so I can usually find something to talk about, but I totally get how it can be hard."

10213,IM ASKING YOU A QUESTION. 
10214,"High school English teacher. I've had a few helicopter parents, but since I mostly work with upperclassmen and our population is from a largely economically under-served district, the most heartbreaking stories are usually about the parents that couldn't give a shit less about their kids. 

I did have one parent that desperately tried to project herself as a helicopter mom. She came to assemblies, after-school events, etc., always taking tons of selfies with her daughter and talking about how ""proud"" she was. I had the absolute privilege of teaching her daughter a couple of times; I know teachers aren't meant to have favorites, but fuck that. This girl was (and still is) amazing, and everyone at the school knew it. She was on student council, president of a bunch of clubs, hell of an academic, even worked as my TA for a year. Beyond that, she was just a great person: smart, funny, considerate, strong...you get it. 

One day during the end of her senior year, I'm chilling in my room during my planning period, and this student comes in, tears streaming down her face (never seen that before). I have her sit down and drink a bit of water before she tells me the problem. She had been in a few sports that year, both for the camaraderie and for potential scholarships (did I mention that she's smart?), and her mom had continually refused to pay for her sports fees. I know how this whole thing works, and I know that the fees were always very clearly stated before any student starts a sport. I also know that this particular mom loooved to brag about how awesome her daughter was at so-and-so sport. But, because the fees remained unpaid at the end of the girl's senior year, that would mean she couldn't walk at graduation with her peers unless she paid them *that* day. Daughter had already been telling her mom for weeks that this would happen; mom didn't give a shit. She wasn't going to pay them.

Now, here's the worst part of the conversation. I had known that this student had been diagnosed with (and beat!) skin cancer in her sophomore year, and so she tearfully tells me that she would be happy to pay for the fees with her own money from her weekend job but can't **because she is still paying her mom back for her own medical bills** and doesn't have any money. 

Yeah. Seriously. I was so fucking pissed, my hands were shaking. Trying to keep my voice calm, I tell this student to take a long bathroom break to calm down, go back to class, and leave the rest to me. I let her know she was absolutely *not* to worry about this. She would be walking at graduation, and that was that. Girl is much calmer, nods, even smiles a bit, and departs. 

I march to the front office like a motherfucking bull in a china shop, and I fix the situation. I make sure she is going to be able to participate at graduation, and later in the day, I let that student know her fees are no more. Cue lots of hugging (which I permit for once) and happy crying.

Cut to the graduation ceremony. This girl is winning awards left and right and getting standing ovations from the staff, and well deserved, too. She is definitely having the time of her life. The infuriating part? Her designer-purse, gold-bangled, cake-makeup mother is hanging off her arm the whole time, *oohing* and *awing* over her daughter and talking about how proud she is of her and how much she loves her. 

That night, I drink. A lot.  "

10230,"I returned a box of tampons once and it felt so icky, but I wanted to make a point to the company.

The story is that I bought the same brand I always use, but this time I opened the box and was hit with a horrid wave of perfume. The company had added fragrance to them without noting it on the box, and if I had used one, I would have had a horrible allergic reaction including pain so bad I wouldn't have been able to stand. You bet I took that open box back to the store and made them note the reason for return.

Naturally there were five people in line behind me and the guy working customer service was a teenage boy. It was quite embarrassing, but it shouldn't have been, because adding a major allergy trigger to a product that you use internally without noting the change on the box is nearly criminal. Doesn't matter what the product is."

Well mom flipped her shit and was yelling at me- how could I let her take them out, the holes will close, she could have lost the very expensive earrings, etc.  My boss told her if they were so expensive then a 3 year old probably shouldn‚Äôt be wearing them and it wasn‚Äôt safe to wear hoops as a 3 year old.

10260,"I will say this: as a high school teacher, my hatred stems from when the fad actively starts interfering with students' learning. Fidget spinners were annoying, sure, but honestly there were actually quite a few kids who it helped calm down in the classroom, so I let it be (well, except for the kid who decided to try and bring a spinner he sharpened into blades).  
Fortnite (and PUBG), on the other hand, has become actively disruptive. While I have my students put their phones in a shoe hanger (we call it the ""Phone Home""), students in other classes are basically ignoring the teacher to obsessively play. Kids were getting in fights over the damn game. It's ridiculous."

10263,"Wow! I forgot all about this but your story just reminded me. My stepmom took my n64 and sega games for some weird reason back then. I probably made a C or something. 

Anyways her best friend had some sons that I was really close with. Fast forward like 15 years and I'm at one of their houses. And sure enough he's got all of the n64 and sega games that my stepmom took from me years ago. She had taken them and given them to her friend.

And my grandparents are indeed saints. They also helped my aunt raise her kids, who are like siblings.

10295,"When he decided to be a fucc boi. After we became roommates he started hanging out with a bunch of kids right out of high school (we're both grown ass adults) and started trying to emulate them. Now's he's a flakey fuck who won't say whether or not he'll actually show up to an outing, just in case something better comes along. He refuses to clean up after himself and has decided that eating with your mouth open is the thing to do. Dumbass pulled my own kitchen knife on me when I told him (for the nth time) not to put it in the dishwasher. Puffed his chest out too, just like a 16 year old. 

We're no longer friends. He's just my shitty roommate now.

EDIT: Just remembered, he also enjoys being the creepy older guy at parties."

Terrorist attacks are actually pretty rare, *especially* in major cities. I for one have never had to worry about security.

Separately, a man in rural Colorado was found murdered. Turns out in their remote cabin where he lived with his daughter, he had been sexually abusing her and she finally had enough and killed him. 
The police searched the house and all of his property, and found my friends wallet in the trunk of his car. 
Police thought to themselves ‚Äúfuckin idiot murderer left his WALLET in this dudes trunk damn easiest arrest ever‚Äù 

Friend had the super believable alibi of ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt have been me Officer, actually that wallet fell out of my pants while I was skydiving.‚Äù "

2) The mayor refused to pave most of the roads leading to the trailer parks until he hired a new assistant who lives in one. She used to dance at his favorite strip Club. Anyways, he was tired of his Classic Chevy convertible getting roughed up on the dirt and gravel roads from all of their ‚Äúwork emergencies‚Äù he needed to drive to see her for. So now her trailer park is paved

10321,"My mom died in a car accident when I was really young so I was raised by my grandma because my dad wasn't really in the picture. As it turns out, this guy isn't my dad like my mom had led everyone to believe. She had told one person the truth and he finally came forward after 20 years. My real dad was another guy who had also died in a car accident on the same road (close to the same location) about 1 year before she did. No one knows why she kept this secret but DNA testing confirmed it and my family doubled in size that year."

10328,Me too. This is my fave story! 
10329,"Similar thing happened to my dad. He grew very distant from my mom and started making really shitty decisions, like giving the okay for some of his more slimey friends to hit on his daughters (we were early 20s but still super out of character for him he was always super protective of his daughters). He would stay away for days and my mom was convinced he was having an affair. She was about to divorce him when he had a grand Maul seizer one night, was rushed to the ER where we found out he had stage three brain cancer. There was a lot of guilt for my mom. He knew something was wrong, didn't know what it was and was with drawing from his family because of it."

We all know there is a fair share of 10-15 year old players in there, and there is also a fair share of 15-30 year old players in there. Obviously differences occur but its nowhere as bad as it could be. Dying isnt so punishing and there are many occurances where people get incited to laugh, which makes the age difference not so impactful. I'd say fortnite has a way better fanbase than most games, due to the games' own simplicity and nature."

10355,"I gotta share my husband's story. I don't know what he ate, but one day when we were out and about downtown Denver, he knew it was comin'. He was in a panic and screaming that he had to go NOW. We ran to the public library and the men's room, there's a line out the door. A lot of homeless men hang out there all day and the bathroom was full of them. So I tell him just go in the women's room. I go in there with him. It's so funny because the stall doors are way shorter than usual, I guess because the staff likes to keep an eye on the aforementioned homeless clientele? Anyway, so he's in there having to hunker down so that he won't offend a lady that walks in. To top it off there's a woman that comes in with obvious ocd. She's washing her hands, wiping down the counter with a paper towel, wiping down the mirror, the soap dispenser, in that sequence over and over again, pacing back and forth among the stalls, all while he's taking a violent shit. When he was done, so many ladies were coming in and out that he texted me to try and get him out, cause he has a full beard and all. I ended up tossing my hoodie over the stall and he pretty much wrapped it around his head and ran out. Ah, what you do for love. "
10356,"Man, my first thought was Lady Bird Johnson... like he was randomly asking for LBJ's wife probably confusing that poor old lady even more.

10361,"Okay so when I was thirteen I was very attracted to one of my classmates. I just loved the way her body looked, I loved how girly she was, and I loved the clothes she wore. I eventually realized that I did not have sexual feelings for her. I was jealous. This is what started my journey of realizing the fact that I am transgender. Fast forward to around five years later and I was trying to reach out and make new friends. I went into the LGBT club at my school and met this badass transgender guy. Him and I became good pals since we were the only two students with abnormal gender identities. This is where the plot twist comes into play. Last week we were hanging out and playing some Pokemon Go. Eventually we decided to talk about the past and he showed me a picture of him when he was in freshmen year. He was the girl who made me question my gender identity in the first place. I was completely mind fucked. Thank you for reading and sorry about my grammar.

10373,"Back when I was a kid we had one of those local mom and pop video shops that we used to rent from like once a week. Then we got word that a Blockbuster was finally coming, right into our local strip mall like three blocks away! We rejoiced!

Then, a few weeks before the new Blockbuster was set to open, we received a letter in the mail from that very same mom and pop rental store. In it, they mentioned how we were no doubt aware of the new big movie conglomerate entering our town, but despite that, they were determined to keep our business and retain us as customers. It was fucking heartbreaking. 

Over the next several months, we tried to visit that little video shop as much as possible and give them our business. However, I‚Äôd be lying if I said we didn‚Äôt shop at the new Blockbuster a little bit more. We tried to stay loyal, but any time we went looking for a movie at the little guys that they didn‚Äôt have, invariably it would be stocked at Blockbuster. The video shop lasted for somewhere around another year before they had to close up. It was a truly sad day, and I still feel like shit because in whatever small way, I supported that process. Anyways, I feel no sympathy for Blockbuster. They crushed the market, had a chance to become the new streaming juggernaut, and they blew it. No remorse. "

10378,"From the moment you hold your baby in your arms you will never be the same 

You might long for the person you were before 

When you had freedom and time 

And nothing in particular to worry about 


You will know tiredness like you never knew it before 

Days will run into days that are exactly the same 

Full of feedings and burping 

Nappy changes and crying 

Whining and fighting 

Naps or a lack of naps 

It might seem like a never-ending cycle 


But don't forget... 


There is a last time for everything 

There will come a time when you will feed your baby for the very last time 

They will fall asleep on you after a long day 

And it will be the last time you ever hold your sleeping child 


One day you will carry them on your hip then set them down 

And never pick them up that way again 

You will scrub their hair in the bath for one last time 

And from that day on they will want to bathe alone 


They will hold your hand to cross the road 

Then will never reach for it again 

They will creep into your room at midnight for cuddles 

And it will be the last night you ever wake to this 


One afternoon you will sing ""the wheels on the bus"" and do all the actions 

Then never sing them that song again 


They will kiss you goodbye at the school gate 

The next day they will ask to walk to the gate alone 


You will read a final bedtime story and wipe your last dirty face 

They will run to you with arms raised for the very last time. 

The thing is, you won't even know it's the last time 

Until there are no more times. And even then, it will take you a while to realize.
 

So while you are living in these times, remember there are only so many of them and when they are gone, you will yearn for just one more day of them. 
For one last time. "

When you're that age it's easy to distract yourself or wallow in inaction, but it doesn't mean you forget what's right and wrong, or are incapable of empathizing with someone else's feelings (though you may be in the middle of a conflict - which is why I think it worked best to have the other parent visit and gently remind)."

Looking back i didn't see how much it hurt her, to me they were on good terms, but that's only because my saint of a mother didn't want me to think badly of him.

I stayed with him often during the holidays and breaks from school, but as i got older i started to realize that if i wanted to see him or have any interaction at all i had to put in all the effort, and when i started to work i saw him perhaps 2-3 times a year.

To keep this relativly short, im saying that it took me a long time to realize my mother was all i needed. I can honestly say she is my best friend, and love her to death. She worked her ass off to make sure i never went without and i could never express how thankfull i am to this day. I havn't spoken to my deadbeat father in over a year and couldn't be happier.

Many people don't realize that sign language is its *own* language. It's not simply signed English. It has its own rules and grammar. Hell a lot of colleges and high schools don't even accept ASL as a foreign language credit. "

They are loaded on their own, strapped down securely in a dog cage with blankets and lots of water. They are in the same hold as bags, but separated via cargo nets.

That's not even including basic armors and stuff. Even a high school understanding of chemistry and metallurgy would make you a god.

I'd been back and forth for 18 months with my son. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE kept telling me there was nothing wrong with him. The drs, the health visitor, my midwife who I still saw at baby group, my family, my friends.

Everyone acted like I was crazy for 18 months. 

And that day a nurse pulled me to one side and told me off for bringing him to hospital again. And then shortly after the dr tried to send us home. Again. I said I wasn't leaving, there was something wrong and I wasn't leaving until they found it. They reluctantly agreed to do an x-ray.

After that they came back and told me they had discovered a shadow on the xray.

And I was so happy and relieved. I wasn't crazy. There was something wrong with him. And they could fix him.

The happy didn't last, because later they told me they thought the shadow was a tumour and they thought it could be cancer and so an ambulance would be here soon and we were being transferred to the oncology ward at the children's hospital. I wasn't happy when they told me that. If I'd known how bad a shadow could be I definitely wouldn't have been happy about it.

But for a little while, just when they told me they found something but not what. I was so happy. Because I knew all along there was something wrong with him and everyone made out I was just a new mum panicking over nothing. And I was so glad I was right and so glad I wasn't crazy and so glad they would finally be able to fix him.

(For info, it was a huge tumour and had caused a lot of damage because it had been undiagnosed and growing for so long , he nearly died. But he didn't, he's a fighter my boy. He's now 9 and doing amazingly well)."

I checked it to see if it was something important and it was from another guy talking about how much he missed her and loved her and asking when  was she deciding who she wanted to be with.  

Being pissed more than anything I started texting him acting like I was her. Basically (as her) I broke up with him and said enough to piss him off enough to block her on MySpace (that's how long ago this was) . I then called and had her phone line deactivated (she was on my plan). Finally I woke her up and told her I knew about him and she had twenty minutes to pack up and leave. She acted confused at first and finally told me the truth, she had come to see me to get all of her stuff and was going to leave while I was at work and block me on all social media and change her number to be with the new guy. 

She left and went to her parents and that was it. Found out a few months later that he wouldn't take her back so she was single and miserable. Fuck you Kayla ."

10460,"I was assigned a service project in undergrad. We had to meet with an elderly person in an assisted living facility 3 times and gather information on them and write up this big report on them at the end of the 3 visits. I met with an elderly man and gathered the required information needed for the first session. He was so lonely and so happy to be telling an interested party his story.  He told me all about the people who don't come visit him anymore and how he understands people get busy and have to move on with their lives, but it still (understandably) made him very sad.
At this time, I was struggling with untreated mental illness and the executive dysfunction was out of control. It's amazing that I graduated, even.  So after the first session with the guy we were supposed to schedule 2 more, to complete the project. Which I did. When the 2nd session came up I was too depressed to get out of bed and called to reschedule.  The day of the reschedule something came up and I forgot to call. The day before if the 3rd session came up and I just didn't go.  Not only did I do to this man, what he told me makes him incredibly sad... But in order to get a good grade I made up all the information I needed to gather on the second and third sessions. My plan was to go see him after I felt better, I even thought about sending flowers or something... But I just never did... It still upsets me to this day... And I've never told a single soul because I'm so ashamed."

When we looked at the photo, a hand was on my shoulder, but the others hands could all be seen elsewhere. And this was not an ordinary hand, it was a brown/red colour with long thing fingers that looked shriveled up and veiny. We later learnt that a man had been killed in the very house due to someone drowning him in a boiling hot bathtub.
After hearing this my friends were horrified that they bathed in this bathtub and were very quick to go and buy a new one"

10576,"Okay, so I actually have a rather long one (TL;DR at the bottom). I consider myself a rational person, but I still can't explain what happened that day so I still get a bit freaked out when I think about it.

So one of my great-aunts on my mother's side recently bought a large plot of property with her husband (kind of in the middle of nowhere). On Easter weekend, our family usually gets together and this year was being held at the house on my aunt's new land.  So my mom, her fianc√©, my sister, and myself all head up to the new place, and once we got there, my uncle tells us about this semi-large cave system that has several entrances scattered around the property. He told us how people had come on to the property all the time to explore the caves and that they were known and all that but you needed some actual like, caving equipment to access/explore them.

Of course on hearing this, my sister and I both immediately knew that we were going to ditch the family at the earliest opportunity to go find this rad cave (because duh who'd want to sit and talk to relatives we never see when there are CAVES WE CAN EXPLORE). So we saw our chance and headed off on one of the trails when no one was looking. As a side note, neither of us had absolutely any idea where or how far the cave entrance(s) were, and neither of us brought ANY equipment (no flashlights, no rope, no helmets...nada). Hindsight is 20/20.

So we were walking and just bullshitting back and forth about how awesome it was going to be and all that. We were following a dirt road, our logic being that if people knew about the caves then there'd be a clear path and that we'd see it. In our high spirits, the time (and distance) passed very, very quickly, and while we were still following a clear road, we thought that we'd come a little too far for comfort (our family's loud party couldn't be heard anymore and the land was open flatland so....?). We decided to push on just a bit longer and if we didn't find any entrance soon, we'd head back.

Naturally, just as we were turning back, my sister saw a pile of rocks that just looked...strange to her for some reason, so we walk over to check it out. Lo and behold, we find a black hole in the ground *just* big enough to squeeze through (my sister and I are both relatively thin). We both look at each other and decide that we'd probably be better served by just looking. So we stand around the entrance, shout into the hole, toss a pebble in...you know, the usual. We're both just messing around (it was dead-quiet because we were deep in the country in the middle of nowhere and it was just my sister and I) and then out of nowhere *I'll swear to whatever you find holy* we both heard a laugh. Like a little girl's laugh. Clear as a bell. It wasn't an animal or another person and I know it sounds crazy but it was something else. 

We both looked at each other, pretty spooked, and I pulled the big brother card and called out to see if anyone was there. No response. 

We decided it would be best if we left, so we headed back (with many backward glances) to the party and never spoke of it again.

TL;DR: My sister and I apparently entertained the ghost of a little girl (or something that wanted to sound like a little girl)."

The bagging areas are both badly calibrated. One thinks customers aren't bagging any items, while the other thinks customers are stealing. The customer at the other machine wants to buy bananas but the machine won't weigh them. She dissolves into tears and leaves all of her items behind, half already bagged and scanned. No one can find an employee to void the already scanned items. Her unpurchased ice cream carton is dripping condensation on the tiny counter. Someone offers to buy her abandoned things just to get the line moving, but the angry man in front doesn't want to let anyone ahead of him.

You and every other customer in your line is watching every transaction, praying that no one needs an employee. A man accidentally scans his donuts twice and resigns himself to paying an extra $3.95.

She chased me and my mom (who is deaf) and my brother upstairs because my dad was at work so she thought she could overpower us. I remember her asking us if our dad was home. I was too blind being a child wearing rose colored glasses thinking the world was full of good hearted people. I told her no. A little after she came in she chased me and my brother upstairs and my mom chased the lady. The lady started to choke my mom at the top of the stairs and for 5 minutes straight I could hear them both screaming and it scared me half to death. I eventually got so scared and angry and hopeless I CHARGED at her with everything I had and it knocked her all the way down the stairs. Her head hit the bottom step and you could hear the worst cracking noise. I gag thinking about the noise now. She was dead. Nobody told me if anyone got into legal trouble but from my knowledge nobody got in trouble. She was on our property..."

2) Boston area. School shootings were never thought of or talked about. Columbine was huge news but that was a couple years after I graduated. 


3) In the city where I'm from, we hung out in parks, down the tracks, in small wooded areas and alley type places (all of which was completely acceptable behavior, even by the cops so long as nobody called), and houses where parents were away. In the suburbs where some friends were from, it was mostly woods, fields, sand pits, old watch towers, some hard to access small lakes and houses where parents were away. This was pre cell phone so once everybody was out of their houses, we all had total freedom. Outside of those things, we'd also take bikes or the train into Boston and just mess around. In the summer we'd ride out to wealthy suburbs and pool hop and shit.  Obviously cars eventually came into the picture. At that time and place, we all had jobs at places like supermarkets,  CVS, hardware stores, pizza joints, etc. so everybody just always had cash and shit was cheap back then. If you've seen the movie Dazed and Confused, it takes place in 76 but it is pretty similar to what I experienced in high school in the mid 90s. It was just a really great time. All the different groups basically crossed paths a lot and got along. That was my experience.  Could go on and on and was nostalgic all night. "

Thats exactly the issue. When everything goes well, theyre great! But then, thats true of ANY car. Or any anything really. When everything is going smoothly, of *course* youre not gonna have any complaints.

The test is when something DOES go wrong. Is it an easy fix? Or is it INSANELY needlessly complicated because the people who designed the car were on shrooms?

If the car works flawlessly the whole time, then it doesnt matter if its a VW or Toyota or a Ford or whatever. But when you get a flat 500 miles from home and literally CANT change your own tire because VW decided to use non-standard lugnuts but STILL include a standard tire iron in the trunk, you might have a few things to say about that. Or when you need to change a simple fuse but have to disassemble the entire dash board and half the engine just to get to it. Or when you want to change your own oil but cant because they designed the car with a plate covering the oil drain bolt that you need at *least* 6 feet of clearance off the ground to remove.

I live in the world‚Äôs largest Muslim country and while yes, for many women, the hijab is a form of free speech &amp; empowerment, I still see many women who are forced into wearing it. 

A friend of mine decided to wear the hijab one day, but after a few weeks, she had to take it off because wearing a hijab all day in a hot &amp; humid tropical country gave her all sorts of scalp issues. She  has a huge social media following, and as soon as she posted a picture of herself without the headscarf, the vitriol she received was shocking. People were calling her all sorts of names and telling her she‚Äôd deserve it if she got raped since she‚Äôs an attention whoring slut. It was nuts. 

So yeah, in this part of the world, the head scarf is not necessarily always empowering.

She found out her husband had been cheating for years and there had been a mutual attraction between us for months before so we quickly started banging. Realized pretty quickly we both had legitimate feelings for each other. Fast forward a few months, she calls it off because she was extremely depressed and seeing a psychologist and had to focus on herself and her kids. I completely understood. Eventually, she tells me she had an abortion a few months prior. She was scared to tell me because she wasn't sure if I'd be okay with that. I 100% was though because other than the fact that I was NOT ready to be a dad, she had previously had ovarian cancer after her last kid and could die if she had another so in no way would I let her risk that. In the end though, if she had told me prior I'd have supported her either way. You need to let her choose what she wants. I will say though, even though I would have chosen the same, it DOES fuck with your head. If she chooses to abort it, talk to a professional. Don't work through your feelings alone. 

Additionally, I would advise waiting until she actually was divorced to continue any relationship, as in my case she got back with her husband and they worked it out and I was left heartbroken. Luckily, I met someone shortly after and have been dating them ever since but man, it really was not worth getting involved with her while she still was married.

Some kids who have an exterior toughness and borderline recklessness worn as a type of armor against the world due to past trauma don't see that those very characteristics can attract predators who will treat them as mini adults to make them feel special and understood. 


When they eventually go through another cycle of abuse, it makes them doubt their own judgment and feel as if it's at least partly their fault that these things keep happening to them, especially as they thought their eyes were wide open. 


Later, as adults, they have to confront the feelings that they were never in control of who they got to be. The choices they made were all shaped by the things that happened to them, and that loss of sense of self is just another trauma to endure. "

We completely misestimated the final hill, which had no uphill swing to it, and went around a corner (mistake number two,) but we went for it anyway. 

About five seconds in, the speed wobbles started. I had zero concept of stance or anything. I maintained the speed wobbles for about 20 more seconds, and midway through, everything slowed down. I remember thinking, ""man, this sucks. This is really gonna hurt"" and ""try not to fall on your phone so you can call 911 in case something happens to Corey. His mum's ill, he can't afford to be in the hospital that long.""

By some absofuckinglute miracle, I speed-wobbled all the way down, and rode the street I ended up on until I could stop. I got off the road, sat down on my board, and proceeded to shake and hyperventilate for almost 20 minutes. Corey had a better ""oh shit"" sense than me and had bailed off into the grass before he got going too fast.

And as Im getting downvoted to hell, another person says ""That's playing. Gorillas do that when they play. The kid would've been just fine."" And that getting upvoted.

After about six months we got back in touch, not very often, but it was cordial. Eventually I contacted him to ask a favor and he did me a solid. We talked a little more.  

One day around this time, about a year after we broke up, he was in my neighborhood for a work meeting and asked if I wanted to have dinner afterward. I agreed, with no expectations, just to catch up with an ex. Dinner was nice, then we had another, and then another. Neither of us were seeing anyone else at the time and time and we started dating very casually. Then not so casually. Then we moved in together. Then we got married. That's the story."

10930,"I told this story before, last October my car caught on fire almost immediately after I arrived home from work.

The official story was (and I bought for a couple weeks) is that I had an oil leak and it caught on fire.

I now strongly suspect that it was arson and I know who did it.  I really can't come forward right now because it'll open a can of worms and I will likely cause myself all sorts of trouble and potential threats against me, and it would probably be impossible to prove now because the car was totaled and destroyed by my insurance company.

But lining up certain events in my life, times and dates are just too coincidental, and I know what happened and who it was.

Edit: to clarify and I'll say this as much: I actually don't know ""specifically"" who did it, but I know who orchestrated it and at least ordered it, but I can't say who.  Not right now.  Here's the evolution of my thinking, though:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/77etg9/what_companies_can_you_just_not_stand/dolanh5/?context=3

10931,"I agree. It is completely sickening, nauseating, disgusting. 

While it would be great to see ""the average person"" put more towards charity, many do, and most middle class and below people are stretched on their budget / trying to keep up with bills themselves, with debt, retirement etc. to fund.

Companies and individuals who wilfully tax evade simply don't care about other people and that's a frightening thing to see.

Yes, all the free time I spend on myself rather than others (and ¬£ I spend on inessentials myself rather than someone with no food) is already kinda creepy. I know I don't NEED this artisan pizza, and I know people out there are starving, and I am choosing to not feed starving people by buying unnecessary stuff for myself. I'm already quite uncomfortable with that.

But billionaires and millionaires do not need all that ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£. For the very richest you could have multiple homes, travel in luxury, create trust funds for your kids and STILL be able to give say 6 billion to helping the earth, human rights abuses, hurt animals, children and adults with severe health issues, families in poverty. But they'd rather pointlessly hoard their millions. Truly it is disgusting. Some do give a lot, like Bill &amp; Melinda Gates.

I encourage you all to Google ""David Beckham leaked emails Business Insider"". A good illustration of the problem. He's an ambassador for UNICEF for his own PR (and to increase the likelihood of a knighthood) but was extremely reluctant to donate any of his own funds to the charity and was ""p-ssed off"" that the head of the charity had the nerve to ask him... he also tried to expense a 6k business class flight back to UNICEF. He's worth 280 million. 280 million. Now does he need that 6k more, or do impoverished children? "

10937,"I wouldn‚Äôt diagnose someone, he might show traits of a narcissist but no one can truly say he is one without being able to professionally diagnose a person with mental disorders. 

But I agree he is unstable, he admitted to have bipolar disorder and like I said in my original post, celebrity culture can have a huge impact on a persons mental state. It‚Äôs not normal to have the entire world watching you! "
10938,"But that's not how any of that actually works.

First, me having ten dollars doesn't force you to have one.  Since money is fiat currency, not tied to any real item of value - the amount of money others have does not stop others from gaining wealth.  Governments add more currency to the system as their economies grow.  There is not a finite supply.

Second, all of the people you mention are fabulously wealthy - but the bulk of their wealth is on paper.    Take Bezos for example - the majority of his wealth is tied up in Amazon stock.  He's worth that much because the stock of his company went up.  In order to liquidate that wealth and ""spread it around"" as you suggest - he would have to sell the shares of his company making him no longer the owner of said company.  

All of the people you mention got rich by building a company that together provides jobs for *millions* of people.  All above minimum wage jobs as well.  (WalMart pays almost $4 over minimum wage)

We celebrate them because they took an idea and turned it into a successful company.  And that *is* something to celebrate.  You don't stop admiring success just because it becomes ""too successful.""

All of the people you mention give enormous amounts of money to charity.

The one you left out - Gates - is on track to literally cure several horrible third world diseases through his philanthropic work.

And a reminder - the poor in western countries enjoy a standard of living that people in developing nations dream about.

10952,"Yep. Teaching is one of the absolute worst professions to go into right now. Considering the requirement for undergraduate and advanced degrees, continuing education (often paid out of pocket), continuing recertification (also often  out of pocket), brutal working hours,  zero career/salary growth potential, and extreme uncertainty about future pay and pension benefits, I don't recommend anyone go into it.

I know teachers who took home less money in their 7h year than they did on their first, because increases in the mandatory pension and health insurance contribution grew faster than their salary. I know teachers who were kept at the same number of years experience for several years, because the district didn't want to pay them what they are worth. Every year it seems like they raise the number of years teachers need to work to be able to retire, raise the pension contribution, and reduce the percentage of salary you get. 

For example, my wife pays 10% of her paycheck into a system that says she'll get 70% of her salary after 33 years. If we move to another state, she starts over at zero. 

I contribute 6% into my 401k at work and the company contributes 3%. I'm projected to bring in over 90% of my salary at the end of my career, and if I move companies I take it all with me. "

If my dog just died and my girlfriend offers sex, I might not want to do it. I'm more concerned about my pet than having sex. If I'm sick or depressed or stressed, I might not be in the right mental state to have sex, either.

11017,"I worked in a German amusement park for six months. My job was to relieve other ride operators so that they could go on break. That also meant I had to know how to operate every single ride in the park. A lot of the time I wasnt instructed how a ride really worked it was more of a ""press that button to start and you can figure out the rest"". So naturally one of the roller coasters got stuck and I had no clue on how to evacuate so I called the park mechanics who were understaffed and took nearly twenty minutes to get there. And all the time people were panicking and I couldnt even tell them what was going on since I couldnt get to them. Of course they were pissed when they finally got out. After that I refused to work rides without being shown how to fucking evacuate them.

Actually that park had a lot of problems. In my six months two ride operators got fired because they were drunk, one because he took his shirt of and there were a lot of times when people got no breaks or had to operate two rides at the same time. 

And then they opened their new swing carousel which i got as my main ride since I was the only one without my own ride who had been there for longer than three months.
So I start my new job and again got the minimum instruction coupled with the fact that everyone seemed really unsure what the height requirements were or who in general could ride it...

11034,"It was sold as a gimmick kind of thing for select high net worth clients. Basically it let you switch the funds your life insurance was invested in each week, so if they published the new price of the funds at the end of this week and say fund B is 2% higher than fund A that you're currently in, you could switch it back at the price from the start of the week or something, pocketing the difference. 

They called it a fixed for life arbitrage product or something. Thing is, back in the 80's mutual funds were priced very infrequently, like I don't think they had a daily NAV, plus you had to physically call your broker, he had to submit a ticket, which had to be routed then processed then filled all by individuals. So it's not like you instantly got that 2% difference, and I think they thought most of the clients would just use it as a novelty type thing here and there and not bother with all the paperwork. 

I think the main driver behind it was also that each time you wanted to do the look back change thing you had to physically call a broker which gave them the opportunity to sell you some new investment. In the late 90's though as markets became more electronic and the availability of pricing on an instant basis via the internet, the insurers who offered these products started buying out the contracts at very favorable terms for the clients, but this one guy bought the policies for each of his kids, in the late 90's from one french life insurance company that was still offering them.

There's a big court battle over how much one of the guys contracts is worth, I guess one of them as all the documents going back decades, and even has his legal team hand deliver the instructions to change the investments each week or something. 

edit; [Here's the origional article](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/02/27/2120422/meet-the-man-who-could-own-aviva-france/) that does a good job going over it, [and here's an update from last year](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-5186489/You-owe-ONE-BILLION-euros-investor-tells-Aviva.html) that has some updates. Sounds like they are taking it to the french supreme court, but at this point it isn't whether or not the contracts are valid, but how much they might be liable to pay.

11038,"My mom is an RN at a nursing home. I just want to say that people often think all nursing homes are bad, which is just not true. Many nursing homes are very considerate of each and every resident and their families. I don‚Äôt want to disrespect any of you who disagree with me, but many family members do not realize that most of these workers are medically trained professionals (doctors and nurses) who genuinely care about their patients. My mother, for example, stays in her office for extra hours after her work to talk to a schizophrenic resident who speaks to my mother in Polish (which my mother doesn‚Äôt speak) because she thinks my mother is someone else. She doesn‚Äôt have to do this, but she still does it because she cares about this resident. It really sucks there are people who work their asses off all day and night doing physically and mentally demanding work for residents that they actually care about, just to be told that ‚Äúnursing homes suck‚Äù.

Try a nude beach. If you're a woman it's usually accepted to keep your bottoms on, and you can lay belly down so nothing is really showing. If you're male, you can also lay belly down and hide it all.

Spend an afternoon at a nude beach and you'll realise it doesn't matter shit, nobody cares about you, and all the things you are embarrassed about, someone else has it a lot worse and they don't care.

Nude beaches are full of fat people, people with ugly scars or missing parts, people with deformities. Super hot people, people with fake tits, big tits, no tits, trans people of undefined genders. And nobody gives a fuck.

Yes, people see you. But they won't stare. If someone bothers you, tell them clearly to leave you alone and 100% the people around you will back you up and shoo creeps away if you tell them off.

Going to a nudist beach is good for you. It helps you be happier in your own body, it lessens body issues, and embarrassment. Just remember sunscreen, especially in places that don't usually get sun.

Figuring out this technology could accelerate human advancement by millennia without having to waste time to develope new technology.

I had left the house one day to go to the grocery store and also pick up some togo mexican food for dinner. All of this is farther down the road from the airport but still on the same road. While on the way, I noticed a hearse followed by a bunch of cars so I pulled over to the side of the road and cut my car off because I live in the south and it is just a sign of respect to grieving family. Once it had passed, I went back on my way. I had finished shopping and went across the street to the mexican restaurant. As I was pulling in, I notice the same funeral procession coming by. So I get out of the car and notice dozens of cars lining the road with american flags. All of us are hanging our heads until it passes. 

This experience seemed a little odd to me for some reason.. especially the people lining the roads. I assumed maybe a serviceman had passed in the Middle East and was being transported home. I watched the news that night and was not too far off. Apparently, a serviceman's bones from WW2 had been identified and he was from a small town nearby. They were finally bringing him home to rest. Broke my heart thinking that 60 years ago, his parents probably never knew what happened to him. I was glad I got to pay my respects to him for giving his life for all of us. "

The kids are at the gym exercising their muscles and you're inside playing fingering exercises or paradiddles or arpeggios. If you want to be a world-class musician, you have to put in the time to learn how to make that sucker sing. The other kids are going on dates, and you're going on recitals and auditions. You have to really want it.

If you're learning to play rock instruments, you have to learn to replicate parts on records, up to the limits of your ability, and then break through that barrier and work on the next level. You literally *have* to be better than the other guys on the scene. Players are a dime a dozen. Players who can blow other players off the stage are rare and sought after by others who can do it, too.

The goal is to be good enough to play with those people, and if and when you find each other, you spend all your time playing together, developing songs and devising arrangements and writing songs and practicing them over and over and over until they're right.

You will have given up a lot of your life to get that far. If you can get noticed by someone who counts, expect to see even less of the outside, because now you're going to work on your studio tan.

I have experience in this area. I'm retired now, but I learned to play piano, then drums, then bass, then guitar, and played them professionally for 25 years.

She lied about it to get me to talk to her and go out with her. After I demanded she buy a test and take it in front of me, she blocked me on everything.

Few weeks go by and i start getting texts and calls from some girl with a british accent and wanting to hang. Met up with her and she was insanely hot. We hit it off for a few dates but never did anything.

Finally she wanted to bang but said she had to bring her 16 year old sister because she was babysitting. I assumed they would come over to my house and the sister would watch tv in another room or something while me and her were in another. Instead she wanted me to meet her down the road at a school parking lot.

I go there and she shows up with another girl, but she also showed up with the crazy chick who lied about being pregnant. They all had their phones out and were recording me claiming I was going to jail for trying to hook up with the 16 year old sister. I never once said anything about doing such a thing but then the crazy girl sucker punched me in the jaw and they all got in the car and left. She then texted me saying if I ever ‚Äòcross‚Äô her again she will go to the police and claim I suggested a three way with her and the 16 year old. "
11243,"Partial shame, but less than 50%.

Right after high school I was a counselor for an awesome adventure camp. It was the best job growing up. Taking middle schoolers every week to Six Flags, the water park, etc. every damn week. And because they were close enough in age we got along well.

There were two kids that were insufferable pricks, bullying and obnoxious to the max. One got kicked out early in the week so the other kid started taking over the harassing. Myself and the other counselors kept saying to cool it, but never escalated it.

Anyways, at the end of each day we end up in a gym playing basketball while the kids are picked up. One day, after dealing with this little shit way too long (forgot to mention, the kid who was kicked out had his parents bring him to one of the parks the camp was at just to rub it in, which made this other kid act even worse), we end up on the court and they're playing Gotcha.

This bully gets a few people out, saying some pretty hateful stuff to each. I'm done staying on the sidelines so I hop in on the game. End up right behind him and get him out. Without thinking, I shout ""Sit down shemale!"" (he had longer hair and slightly effeminate). The other kids who were tormented were laughing hysterically, and I've never seen someone change so quickly. Head down, went to the bleachers and started crying. Parents came and he disappeared around the corner with the mom. Told the lead counselor I was probably fired at that point, but nothing came of it!

11247,"I heard a sermon one time on forgiveness. I can‚Äôt remember the exact words but it was something like this:

When you forgive someone it does not mean you are choosing to forget or that you are the weaker person; you are letting go of the action done against you for good. When you truly forgive someone, you do not bring it up later or hold on to it to throw against them. When you truly forgive someone you aren‚Äôt letting the action ‚Äúrent space‚Äù in your head or cause negative turmoil inside.

Think about some one that has done or said something to hurt you: spouse lying to/cheating on you, someone betraying your trust, someone saying nasty things about you....if you still think about it months down the road, it causes you to get upset, or every time you argue with that person you bring it up; have you truly forgiven them?

It's normal that the inner circle ALWAYS has its limits, determined by capacity of the venue! Instead of dealing with it they bring it up and send you on a guilt-trip. Don't let that happen to you! Try to view the disappointing behaviour of your relatives as a seperate thing. The guest list is naturally not only determined by the grade to which you like people. If I would marry, I would invite my granny, just because she is close family. I don't even like her, but she's closest family. And yes, I would cut friends in favor for her that are not my BFFs. AND IT WOULD BE OKAY. And so was your decision. Decisions can turn out to not having been perfect, but that is life and your friends should move on. If they make the quality of their friendship dependant on your past decision, they are the problem and not you. You are a nice person to reflect about this and to regret it, but you DO NOT DESERVE THAT GUILT TRIP. You deserve understanding friends. All the best for you."

&gt;Ex girlfriend came into my work one day 8 months pregnant, after we had broken up 8 months earlier. She had worked there too and quit after we broke up. She admitted to everyone that it was mine and when I showed up that day I heard about it before I ever saw her. I broke out laughing when someone told me, and once I got ahold of myself she was there asking if I found it so funny with her there about to pop with my kid. She said she was going to make sure I helped take care of it even if she had to take me to court for support. 
&gt;
&gt;I had to ask her if she even remembered why we broke up. It was because I busted her fucking some other guy in the backseat of my car at a party. And that she and I had never even slept together. The look on her face was priceless. The baby was black BTW, both she and I are pasty white.

So his devs learned the bits of the product they worked on).

Personally, I am, but not a huge fan of NASCAR (for various reasons). F1 and lots of other series are interesting in a number of different ways. Racing is not really like the movies where you are constantly wheel to wheel fighting for a position, it's more of a chess game played at high speed. It's much more about strategies and car setup than anything else. You have to watch the progression of various teams/drivers throughout the race to see what is happening. Spec racing series (like IndyCar, F2, F3, etc.) are more interesting from a racing perspective because everyone is in the same equipment. F1 is a bit of an oddity in that it's really an engineering competition (70% engineering, 30% driving skill)."

I mean, yeah, I'm tall and relatively fat, and we all know it. I love the original sentiment...but I certainly wouldn't mind if he dropped the part about me being big and fluffy. I know it, he knows it, anyone with eyeballs knows it, but the reminder definitely kills the feel good vibe. I'm not ashamed of my size, so it doesn't torture me or anything when he says it, but it kind of kills the point of a compliment. And remember, this is an intellectually intact 11 year old, not a toddler. I don't want to call him out, but I sort of do...mainly because I don't want him to one day do it to someone who isn't as chill as me about it. I just can't figure out a kind way to correct him...so I haven't yet. But regardless, it deflates my balloon a bit.

11349,"Those aerators are required to:

1) Decompact compacted soil

2) Put air into the roots of plants. 

Many people don't realize that plants not only perform photosynthesis but they also perform respiration. They need oxygen in their roots to breathe, or else they literally drown. I.e. when you overwater plants and they are sitting in water, they are literally drowning because their roots have no oxygen.

So, you need to do these things because the soil isn't friable. It isn't friable because people are walking on it, but also because you've been taking leaves off the lawn since it was established. Leaves couldn't be eaten by earthworms who dig tunnels in the grass and get air down there. Grass monoculture has a matting root structure and no tap roots to drill deep. When ""weeds"" eventually go to seed and die, their long taproots decompose and they ""aerate"" the soil naturally. Just like that machine, only completely natural.

The best way to aerate a lawn is to \*gasp\* spread dandelion seeds all over it. These have long taproots, they feed the bees as their first source of food in the spring, then quickly go to seed, die out and aerate the lawn by their long roots dying back. 

But of course, we pull those out, because they are a ""weed"". They are ""ugly"". Forget the fact that they are 100% edible not only to bees but also to humans. You can eat every single part of that plant, from the roots to the leaves to the flower. 

Okay, so you aren't going to plant dandelions in your grass (unless someone like me comes along and kicks the white heads everywhere - mwuhahaha), so maybe rent the aerator this season, get the holes dug in, then spread some wood chips super thin all over the grass. Like so thin you don't even know they are in there. Keep the leaves in the fall, shred them, mow them, and leave them in place. If you have way too much, compost the extra. Take that compost when it's done (roughly 1 year), and spread it all over your lawn and seed into it. You can overseed grass, or add some clover like a good boy.

Once you get food for the worms, food for the mushrooms, and particulates of varying sizes (wood chips that get broken up and dragged down), the soil micro structure will start to decompact naturally. 

And again, even if you don't want to actually SEED IN dandelions, at least let them exist as flowers. If you don't want MORE dandelions (like a crazy person who doesn't see their value), then simply cut them before the heads go to seed (white fluffy). Just be on top of your lawn for that one week when it's all going to seed, and cut them THEN. At least that way the dandelion had a chance to grow big enough to develop a good thickboi root which will decompose and aerate your soil, and feed all the life you have inside your previously dead lawn."

11407,"I don't know if you're trolling or not, but I'm gonna assume you're being genuine and well-meaning. But sign language is important for social development in early life, not just when D/deaf/HoH people communicate with hearing people. It's important that kids get language to work with at a developmental stage before when learning to read happens. Sign languages are just like any other languages, and saying they're ""outdated"" is like saying spoken languages became unnecessary when writing was developed. D/deaf /HoH people using sign language to communicate with other D/deaf/HoH and hearing people visually or tactilely is no different than how hearing people speak aloud and take in the information auditorily. Sure, technology *could* be used to facilitate communication, but if there is a sign language allowing people to still use the body as the sole medium for communication instead, why deprive people of it when it offers so much benefit? Especially considering D/deaf/HoH people themselves are telling hearing people through their orgs and political activism that they value their languages and us hearing people disregarding that does actual lasting harm. I am a hearing person and not a language studies major, so I am neither an expert nor authority on this topic in any way, but Deaf communities love and depend on their languages just like any other culture would. Cell phones can still be used when there is a shared written language, but English is different than ASL and not everyone who uses ASL can read and write English."

11419,"We bought our house at the same time as a few other friends. Ours was not flipped, still mostly original from 1943 but well maintained (with newer appliances/furnace/electric/windows). Home inspection was basically perfect with only some very minor repairs needed.

All our friends bought older homes that had been flipped. They each paid quite a bit more than we did for similar houses and all had some major issues  very soon after closing (leaking chimney ruining drywall and requiring major repair, flippers used interior paint on the exterior and painted over lead paint requiring a very expensive paint job and lead removal, another major chimney repair, furnace broke immediately, sketchy foundation issues, etc etc).

We are now a few years in and have saved up enough to renovate our basement and kitchen in a way that‚Äôs exactly what we want, using an architect and contractors that we trust. Pretty glad we didn‚Äôt succumb to the appeal of a newly flipped house."

It goes something like Acetaminophen is just as good (if not superior) to treating most of the ailments which narcotics are currently prescribed for with less risk for addiction and bodily damage (though it DOES still exist). But Narcotics have a higher rate of patient satisfaction when prescribed than Acetaminophen (especially when they tell you it's just Tylenol), because people hate the idea that they went to the doctor, urgent care, ER and just got something they ""could have just gotten over the counter"".

The PT was a quality practitioner and I still regularly refer him to my friends that are injured from adventure sports.

I had an xray taken when I went in to the chiro and there was a curve in my back, from left to right, not front to back like it should be. I had an xray taken after 6 months and that curve was almost completely gone. I hesitate to think the placebo effect could adjust my spine via provable xrays.

One day I decide to up my pickpocket skill as it's my lowest and I want to level up. Sneak down to the place the beggars and merchants sleep in Riften. And because I am lousy with gold, decide to play santa. I put necklaces, rings, and other stuff I didn't want to bother selling into these guys' pockets and no one's the wiser. No one until Snorri, that is. I don't know how, but I was spotted and failed my attempt as I peeked into Snorri's pockets.

I draw and sheathe my weapon to calm the guards, but as I'm doing this she grabs Snorri by the waist and suplexes him to death (or some other unarmed takedown, either way, she killed an old man with her bare hands).

I heard this (it happened over like 2-3 seconds) and turned to say something to the woman but my son, bless his heart, goes ""LEAVE ME ALONE CRAZY!!!!"" in the loudest, most shrill little boy scream you've ever heard (I taught him to scream as loud as he possibly could if someone tried to grab him and kick and punch as much as he could)...next thing I know I see him run full speed at this woman ready to do some kind of flying kick or something (lord only knows), and I grabbed him.

By this time the lady was profusely apologizing saying ""I thought he was lost! I was just trying to help!"" and she was backing away.  I looked her dead in the eye and said ""You saw me standing there, and you assumed he wasn't mine?"" and she just smirked and started walking away.

11490,"Here's the Franz Boas recording of it:

Ten brothers and their wives who were hunting in the mountains far from their own village decided to spend the night in a village they saw in a valley. They went down the mountain on their snowshoes. In the village, each family invited one of the strangers into their house. The chief of the village invited the youngest brother, his wife and baby to stay with him. They had no idea that all of these people, who looked human, were really mosquitoes.

During supper the baby began to cry. The wife of the chief took him on her lap to comfort him. When he kept crying, the chief's wife put her mouth to his ear and sang a song. The child grew quiet. When the young mother took her child from the chief's wife, she discovered to her horror that he was not asleep, but dead, and blood was coming from his ear.

Quietly wrapping the child in a marten skin blanket, she told her husband that the people of the village were not real. She asked him to warn his brothers that they should all leave during the night.

When all of the villagers were sleeping, the guests slipped out and started up the mountain. Before they reached the top, they looked back and saw the villagers coming after them.

To stop them, the hunters and their wives dislodged snow with their staffs, creating avalanches that swept the villagers away. As more people came up the mountain, they created more avalanches, until finally all of the people were dead except the chief.

Short and stout, with a proboscis of pure crystal, the Mosquito chief ran to each of the hunters and their wives in turn and killed them all. Only the mother of the dead child was left. Luring the Mosquito chief to the edge of a lake, she hid in a tree, and teased him with her reflection. He went into the water searching for her, came out, and went in again. Finally, very cold and moving very slowly, he came out of the water. Caught in a north wind on a clear cold night, he froze to death, and lay with his wings frozen to the ground.

After the woman had poked him with a branch and her foot to see that he was really dead, she took her fish knife made of shell and cut out his heart. The heart had two eyes and a mouth. It was still alive, and looked at her. She was afraid of it, but took the heart to each of her friends who had been killed, and swung it over each of them four times, bringing them back to life.

The next day, the hunting party built a fire to burn the Mosquito chief's body and heart. When only the ashes were left, some of the people blew into the fire scattering the ashes. The ashes flew upward, became small mosquitoes, and spread into the world.

The hunting party then reached home safely."

She's the most kind, caring, compassionate, loving person I have ever met and she inspires me to be better just by being herself.

She's very community minded/oriented, she loves doing charity runs/bike rides and volunteering whenever she can. Our most recent endeavor is volunteering to clean the headstones at a local cemetery and restore them to like new condition.

She loves the outdoors; camping, fishing, hiking, nature walks, swimming in the river, stargazing, etc.

She has a beautiful singing voice, I absolutely love hearing her sing especially the song Strawberry Wine.

She loves my family and they love her, she shows me how much they mean to her everyday and she actually enjoys spending time with them.

She's a goofball, I can't be sad around her, its just not possible. She's always making me smile and laugh.

She's the most beautiful woman, both inside and out, that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting let alone being blessed with the opportunity to spend the rest of my life with.

She is my everything."
11535,"This accurately describes the situation. People like my self, and you I imagine are tired of seeing the stupid extremes both the right and the left go to. I have met rational people on both sides of the table. People who have differing opinions, lifestyles, ideologies willing to talk, debate and change minds. This isn't what is covered in the news. I rarely see a constructive discussion between two parties on any media outlet or news source. It's sad to see this destructive wedge brutally‚Äã splitting the left and right. No reasonable discussion, only constant bickering and fighting.  "

The wedding couple spent hours and hours and hours planning and calling, getting bitched at by friends and family, getting told what to do and arguing about why they don't want to, planning logistics for elderly people, doling out exorbitant amounts of money for decorations, etc., etc. all to make this day perfect for THEM.  Not for *her* proposal.  This day is about the two people getting married.  For someone to plan and execute that, it's basically trying to override their day, steal the spotlight, and get attention on *yourself*.  It's putting yourself and your need for attention ahead of your loved ones and it's very disrespectful.

Not only that, but they planned it out to make DAMN sure every single eye in the place would be on them and every mouth would be silent.  They *literally* stole the spotlight from the bride and her dad.  Fucking literally.  They basically said ""what you're doing right now isn't as important as us"".  That's a HUGE slap in the face."

So, for that to be the end of seeing them...it just, for lack of a better word, sucked and made me think there was still bad blood between me and my godmother.

I hate being wary of kids like that, because it's so important for them to interact with good people and grow.  I'm definitely far from a 'good person' in my book, but being responsible for them brought out the best in me and I really would've loved to see them succeed and overcome the rough family life.

Edit: Most of the damage was internal, so even I'm not really sure of the consequences yet.  It's far from the really damaging stories you hear about, so I'm not complaining.  It's just something that still sticks around, 12 years later, ya know?"

Everyone seems to forget that a recurring theme in the wizarding world is that they're, for all intents and purposes, stuck in the middle ages. 

They've never had to innovate because they've got magic. Any diseases don't get treated with medicine. They just come up with more herbs and spells to use, or just sleep it off. Any things they use, like tea pots or stoves or grandfather clocks, they were all invented by muggles. If it fills a need that they haven't filled themselves and it's invented by muggles, they'll just use that instead. They don't invent every day items for their own use, no matter how convenient it is.

So, of course they'd just stick their criminals into a horrific prison meant to scar them psychologically. It's the idea that they'll be scared straight and just not want to commit crime again. It's very classical school of thought on punishment to do so and it fits with their other attitudes towards most modern inventions, including areas of science and philosophy.

For fucks sake, people, sending children into the Dark Forest, or whatever it was called, was seen as a perfectly acceptable punishment. Are you really surprised that they stick their murderers into a prison with beings whose sole purposes in existing is to make you as miserable as possible?"

And then there was Kristallnacht, with Jews openly hunted down by lynchmobs around the country. You'd have to literally be living under a rock to not notice that your state is doing some seriously racist, fucked up shit. 

Of course, it was in the times when the US had racial segregation and lynchings as well, so I guess we shouldn't be surprised that Germans would hold similar views, but even in those times there were people who disagreed with it and preached love and acceptance, so it's not like being a racist slaver was something you couldn't help."

For example, if I spend $300 a month on meals using child support money, (meals that the kid benefits from) I still have an extra $300 lying around because of the availability of the child support.

This is actually a problem with earnings and taxes relating to the lottery. States who have lotteries that are directly routed to school funding, suddenly see a decrease in funding that is structured so that they funding is the exact same amount only they use the lottery taxes.

So instead of funding the schools, those lottery taxes are subsidizing other aspects of government even though on paper they are directly funding the school."

11663,"Periods are just sort of messy and gross, period (pun indented). 

The pads are pretty good at absorbing up the discharge and holding onto it. And women learn how often they need to change it out to keep everything clean and contained (depending on flow rate), but nothing is perfect. They're pretty easy to remove most of the time, just grab a clean edge and rip it off your underwear. A lot of women then roll it up in paper and bin it. Sure, some discharge sticks around down there, by that's what paper, wipes, and showers are for. 

Tampons are just absorbent plugs made of cotton. They're not perfect either and sometimes they fail, just like pads occasionally do if they're not seated correctly (they also have a higher chance of causing toxic shock). There is still the act of yanking it out and inserting a new one, which isn't always a clean and not gross as you might think.

It really comes down to personal preference. Neither is perfect and neither is ""not gross"". Periods are just gross and we learn to deal with it. "

Once the British left it was divided into India and Pakistan (East and West), with most local provinces joining one country or the other over the next few decades. Only after the Bangladesh war for independence in the 70s did East Pakistan cease to exist and we have the 3 countries we know today, plus the still disputed region of Kashmir. "

Imagine seeing just a huge, 25ft massive black wall rushing towards you, engulfing everything in it's path. If you got caught under it, you would absolutely be screwed, the weight crushing you or drowning you as you struggle to get to the top. I'm already terrified of drowning, but this fate would be much, much worse. Yikes indeed. I don't think this was when the term ""slow like molasses"" was coined."

11687,"Facebook reaches like 2 billion people and its algorithms are tuned to manipulate users by any means possible to get them to click ads and spend money. If that algorithm were tuned to genuinely enrich people's lives it is hard to describe how big a positive change that would make to the world overnight. I really cannot overstate how significant this would be. Instead of social media algorithms taking advantage of a moment of sadness/anger as a window of emotional vulnerability which might make you impulse buy something, it would connect you with the friend who will best ease your pain. The tattered social fabric would start to heal. Suicide rates would fall. It would truly be something else.

If Zuckerberg turned around and instituted such a change tomorrow he wouldn't need to rub shoulders with Nobel Prize winners because he'd soon be one of them. He'd be a hero and go down in history as one of the greatest people to have ever lived.

But apparently that's not as good as a few billion more dollars. I really cannot comprehend the immensity of the selfishness. The amount of good that could be done, the amount of value to all the people's lives it would improve would be worth 100x what Facebook is valued at, but apparently 100x the value shared is worth less than 1x in your own pocket."

11730,"So the ""official story"" was that this girl I knew in high school got an abortion at 15 and then went to go live with her Grandparents up state so that she would have a fresh start away from her ""bad influence"" boyfriend.

I don't know how much of what she says is truth or lies. 
I spoke with our family physician about what I knew about the situation and she didn't know whether to call CPS or not. Considering I had just given birth to youngest a week earlier, I didn't want to fight the wrong fight. 
I did talk to my sister directly and told her we could take care of everything and that coming to stay with us short term or long term would be in her best interests. But, of course, in comes the manipulation, lies, and guilt trips from the other parties involved. Short of showing up and bringing her back in the car with us I didn't see another option.

To remove all the other bias that goes along with this subject, let's pretend for one moment that the for-profit system doesn't exist, and that the justice system is flawless - everyone that is in a cell, is there for a crime they committed, and are serving the appropriate sentence. 

In this system, you have a bunch of people repaying their debt to society, through inactivity. They're sitting in a cell, doing nothing. They are not getting paid for that time. They are not building their skillset. They are not doing anything productive. They are not generating an income. They are not putting their skills to use to serve that society that everyone else is working to serve. 

I feel that this may drive bigger issues when you have repaid your debt to society, by leaving you with the obvious stuff; a large resume gap, a felony charge, a certain reputation... But also with the stuff that isn't so obvious - you haven't actually been *doing* anything for the last couple of years. You haven't had to get up and work, or have a proper routine or earn your way. 

Isn't there possibly an argument to be made that:

A) this assists with repaying the debt to society by 'giving back' through labour

B) this continues *a* skillset of sorts, including a routine and some kind of task to fulfill instead of rotting in a cell

C) we shouldn't be *paying* employment rates for prisoners, since they're not really entitled to be a part of society for the duration of their sentence. If we are paying market rates for these roles, and no costs for overhead rent or food, aren't we making prison less of a ""punishment"" and more of a ""life alternative""?

To be clear, I'm aware that prison isn't glamorous. But neither is homelessness or poverty. And people in desperate situations may see this as an alternative to their current horrible circumstances, and commit a crime in *order* to be detained. 

Again, I have no idea what I'm talking about, and would love for someone with more information to tell me what I'm missing here. 

Also aware that this sounds like I'm advocating for slave labour, which I'm not. I'm a big believer in human rights, but I also would like to balance that view with the idea that prisoners shouldn't be ""paid"" for their time in prison.

11812,"Yup. You also just 100% described the issue my friend's and I have with our one buddy's girlfriend. Can't even invite him to any sort of social gathering that is rowdier than sitting around a kitchen table sipping wine and discussing house d√©cor because otherwise when his girlfriend tags along, she insists on sucking the fun out of everything.

Hell, on *his birthday*, someone asked if he maybe wanted to take a few shots, and she got so pissed off that we were acting so immaturely (for taking shots???) that she went and sat alone on a couch and glared at him."

Same with those who play loud sub bass in their cars, loudly rev the engine on their sports car or truck or motorcycle, people who speak abnormally loudly in public (often looking around to see if anyone is paying attention, lol,) and so on.

Also people who act ""dominant"" toward strangers in public (excessive staring/eye-contact, not getting out of the way, excessive exaggerated swagger walking, etc...)

It all comes off as try hard, like a toddler throwing a tantrum for attention. Only the fools are fooled by the above behavior and other similar types of behavior. "

You could always think of it more like this: there are literally billions of women out there I would not want to have sex with for all different reasons.  You're just another one of them.  Likewise, there are billion of women out there who would not want to have sex with me.  You're probably one of them too.  I've read stories of guys kicked out of bed by women who were otherwise interested over being uncircumsized. Any little thing can screw up a would-be sexual encounter.  It probably doesn't put you in much more of an awkward spot than cis-women born with two vaginas--or any other medical condition that makes intercourse different, painful, or even impossible.  "

Like, for this kind of person the statement ""Stop making fun of that homosexual, making fun of peoples sexual orientation is gay"" makes perfect sense, because it's the equivalent of saying ""Stop making fun of that homosexual - making fun of peoples sexual orientation is lame"". 

And now here's the part of my comment where I clarify: I'm not saying that the above is okay or it's not/shouldn't be offensive to LGBTQ folks - just saying it's the explanation to OPs question. "
11832,"Pretty much. I understand his sentence. He did it, he never came forward, he witness tampered and did his damnest to get out of prison. 

But he was basically still a kid. He was a freshman when it happened. Between 18 and 20. And he was scared shitless. He was scared of jail. He was scared of being raped. He was scared of being murdered. He was terrified. 

He fucked up. Big time. But a lot of those fuck ups came from his fear of his own safety and knowing if he came forward his life would be over too. Even if he got a light sentence he knew his major was as good as done. Good luck getting a good job when you have a murder charge. 

I can't really say if he deserved the 40 years. I understand both sides. This case is heartbreaking all around. There is no monster to hate. Just a bunch of dumbass college kids doing dumbass things. And one of those choices escalated into a tragedy. "

Like really emphasizing the changing room, only ever training one gender, there being another accessible option for training (like at the church or a more public gym), not wanting the parents there, or other questionable things.

11855,"&gt; it's just upsetting that they aren't attracted to me because of something in my past.

But why shouldn't things in your past be allowed to factor into attraction? I mean if you found out for example that someone had been a rapist or something, wouldn't that change how attracted you were to them after the fact? 

I'm not saying being transgender makes them a bad person like in that example, of course it does not, but my point is just that attraction isn't solely about looks and it can change when you find out more about a person. 

In the case of a transgender person, knowing they were once a man, biologically at least, would change how attracted to them most men are. Obviously they still look the same as when you hooked up with them, but now you know they are different from what you are most attracted to (in their case a biological female) the attraction becomes less. Not to mention the fact that you would feel somewhat lied to since surely every transgendered person knows that most hookup partners would want to know."

I might think I'm depressed, but look at that person. They really have it bad. If anyone deserves help, it's them.""

When I finally decided that I am worth the cost of therapy and a therapist's time, I started learning so much about my brain and what was really going on in there. It changed me. It didn't fix me, but it made a difference knowing that my thoughts and feelings have value, and I'm worth other people's time/attention. This is true of you too.

In January 2017 I was driving home from a late shift at work, cruising in the left lane at 50 (the speed limit) just north of downtown Fort Worth, TX when I was struck from behind.

It started with the sound of screeching tires. The other driver was speeding in the left lane and looking at his phone when he looked up too late and tried to swerve around me. He struck my back right side, put me into the wall, and then apparently came up under me because I rolled to the right and skidded on my roof for 1/4 to 1/2 a mile according to the wrecker guy based on the wear on my roof. I remember seeing the dashboard lights roll right then left and then blink twice and die, and then thinking super calmly like three different times ‚ÄúThis is probably it right here.‚Äù

Once I came to a stop the other driver helped me crawl out of my driver side window, I pointed to the car, laughed hysterically, and with blood running down my forehead asked him ‚ÄúCan you fucking believe I‚Äôm not dead?‚Äù

The fear didn‚Äôt kick in until later. To this day I hear screeching tires and I‚Äôm no good for a couple of minutes at least. Loud sudden noises in general fuck me up. I have regular nightmares where before I had one every decade or so not counting fever dreams. I had glass in my head and my hand, my neck got compressed against the roof and my posture‚Äôs never been the same even after months of therapy and nerve injections, and I still have neck pain.

11885,"I haven't failed (I'm a commercial photographer), but I've watched many, many others fail when they thought they could make it. Many of the mistakes I'm seeing mentioned here are things folks should definitely pay attention to! 

Here's my biggest advice:

1. You won't make money from it right away. Ever. It takes 2-3 years hopefully, 4-5 years realistically. It takes time to grow, establish the business, get and keep customers, repeats, figure out expenses, etc.

2. Related to #1-- always make sure to have both an accountant and a lawyer, and also MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY BEFORE YOU START TO LAST YOU AT LEAST 1-2 YEARS! I don't care if it's your own, stuff from an investor, a loan from a bank, whatever. There's no way your business is going to make profit right off the bat, and what money does come in will go back to bills/expenses/reinvesting into the business.

3. Don't do business with family or friends.

4. Be veryyyyy careful picking your partner. Very careful. Chances are one of you is going to do more work than the other, and there will be anger/hurt feelings/etc.

5. Get an accountant. They're invaluable. I know I said it already, but I'll say it again. Shop around if the first one you find doesn't feel right.

6. Market research - this'll make or break you. Know your area, know your competition, keep an eye on your competition, but don't trash the competition.  Hold your own, stay above it. 

7. Deliver on time, quality product, communicate. Delay? Let them know what's happening. Sick? Let them know. 

8. Payment--- you don't finish the product, then get paid a week later. Nope.  You finish and deliver, then you get paid 30, 60, 90 days after that. My first and second year was a nightmare because I didn't have enough clients yet to fill in the gaps, checks ran late, extremely stressful! 

9. Just because you ""Know people"" doesn't mean those ""people"" are going to hire you/cause you to get hired/guarantee you success. I allowed someone to share my studio (she was paying half the rent) that knew the mayor of the town we were in and she knew all sorts of fancy people that came to her grand opening party... and none of them hired her for anything. She expected to ""make it"" simply because people knew her and she knew people. It didn't work.

10. Don't screw over the people trying to help you (this is also communication) and have a strong support system. I thankfully finally found someone reliable/awesome, but I've booted people from my studio space because not only did they not pay me rent on time, they lied to me and told me the rent was coming when it wasn't. and then wouldn't communicate with me and tell me what was going on when I asked. By the end, I was just tired of her Bullshit. I tried, I really did, but in the end she had to go.

11. Specialize. The photographer's market is REALLY saturated. There are SO many people doing the same thing, people just really go for the cheapest. If you specialize and do your one thing really, really well then you can set yourself apart from everyone else and you can charge more, get more/repeat clients,  and generally grow with more flexibility. It's huge. It's the same in all the other industries. Everyone's trying to ""make it"".

12. Website/SEO stuff- when I started, I did my own website and just put it out there. It did OK, but I didn't show up any searches. I found a local web design group that I trusted, and even though I was on a budget they customized a template for me, then I customized everything else and took it from there. Don't go with an online/scammy one, or a really cheap one, find someone local that you can walk into an office to walk with, have meetings, milestones, etc. it's huge.

13. Don't be afraid to say no and walk away. Something feels off about the client? Walk away. Red Flag? walk away. Suspcious phrasing? Walk away. Drama queen/king? Walk away.  You don't have time for that shit.

edit: I forgot a couple things!

14. Get everything in writing. everything! I don't care how much you trust the person... everything!

15. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. So you have one great client, that gives you most of your income... what's going to happen when you loose that client and that money coming in??? It can happen for various reasons, not just crappy service.

16. Sustainability. You can't sell your co 24 hours a day. You can only do so many things in so much time without getting stuck/burnt out/etc. What direction can you take/where can you be visible to where you'll get repeat clients, or people will find you on their own vs you having to find them.

All in all.. it's not an easy journey, it's stressful and it takes over your life. But worth it if it works! Good luck to the people in here reading the comments and thinking about starting their own businesses!"

&gt;You don't need to run faster than the bear to get away. You just have to run faster than the guy next to you.

Same thing applies here. Some hamster ancestor was born all freaky, and his fur got a little bit lighter in the winter months.

None of the other hamsters said much about it, because they're hamsters, but they probably would have laughed at him if they could.

Then, when they were hiding in the snow, an owl flew overhead, saw a dozen hamsters. One of them was a bit lighter, so would have been harder to grab, so it just went for the other arseholes instead.

So the light hamster survived to get his freak on, and his freaky genes on."

11951,He probably was at one point in his life. That's what makes rescue stories that end this way so much more awful. He could have been someones best friend or a service dog protecting people and saving lives but that's not the hand he was dealt.  Too many not so good boy owners can turn any creature into the living embodiment of fear and aggression. Being terrified of everything around you must be as bad if not worse than even chronic pain. With pain comes the instinct of knowing what pain is. Cruelty has no related awareness. It's just fear all the time for an unknown reason.
11952,"""clever....fuck me"""
11953,Wolves aren't too bad unless they're starving and you're alone in the dark and unable to scare them off. Really not that high up the threat index - you probably have worse snakes. 
11954,"Snakes might be dangerous in that they *could* kill you. But most of them aren't too aggressive, and they definitely won't go out of their way to attack you in any circumstance. I hate all the negative press associated with snakes, because even the venomous ones will only ever attack you if you step on them or get really close to them. "

11957,"I had a close woman friend at university. We went out drinking, seeing music, dancing, getting up to no good. Not a sexual relationship though. Just good friends and partners in crime.

She got involved with a guy and they sort of shut themselves off from the world for a couple of years. We lost touch.

A while later I meet her at a party while I was visiting the US. She tells me that someone at the uni told her that I had been bragging about how I'd fucked her while she was still with her boyfriend (who incidentally was also a friend of mine). I told her that I was insulted that she'd believe gossip that some idiot told her, that I'd never say such a thing even if I were fucking her, and that she should know me better than that.

After that incident, looking back, I started remembering some things about her, particularly that she liked to get into fights with people for no good reason. And I decided that I didn't need that kind of shit in my life, so I disappeared and didn't keep in touch.

Decades later, I'm in a good place in my life. She's had a succession of failed career attempts, is on her third marriage and has fallen out with most of our mutual friends. It's a pity, since she's got a lot of positive qualities, but that mean streak's a dealbreaker."
11958,"I'm between Chicago and Milwaukee. Plenty of lakes, but until a trip to Boston over the 4th, I'd only ever really travelled to Wisconsin, Oklahoma, and Columbus, OH. Parents didn't have much money to spare growing up so we didn't travel much further than the cities. Now that I'm older and supporting myself for the most part, I'm taking advantage of having the chance to travel. Growing up is fun (at least in that regard)."

11970,"Seriously, why does this happen? I'll wake up feeling like I'm going to shit myself on occasion, so I run to the bathroom and suddenly won't have to go. So I'll go for a walk that takes me over an hour and will feel great. Then I'll drive to the store and once I get close but not close enough to the store I will suddenly get severe cramping and will have to drive like a maniac into the lot and run into the store and then have terrible shits."
11971,"Happened to me when she threw the bed out the window in Kaer Morhen and when I went there to see what's wrong she was bitching about Triss' hairs in her bed(who knows why, hehe).

11984,"The summer after I graduated college I volunteered for a charity group that was visiting Malawi and Tanzania. We flew through Nairobi's airport on the way to Malawi and we noticed that the shops and stalls in the international terminal all had rubbish and insulation swept into the corners near electrical outlets. We all thought it looked like a huge tinder box waiting to ignite.

One week later we had to fly through Nairobi to get to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania but were delayed at the airport in Malawi because an [inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi_airport_fire) had gutted the building a few days after we passed through the first time. We wound up getting on the flight and landing in Nairobi, only to find ourselves dealing with immigration and customs agents that were operating out of tents on the tarmac. It was nuts. Thought we were gonna sleep on a runway, but wound up getting a free night in a 5-star hotel."

12010,"Best part is we could hear them but nobody answered, so we had to make entry."
12011,"I am no doctor but I have a story that would fit in here.

My grandmother was married several times. Her first two husband's killed themselves. The third was an alcoholic, physically and mentally abusive, a liar and a cheat.

When the third died we had the funeral/wake. We sat and listened to his final wishes after everyone else had left. He wanted to have his ashes spread on the shore of their cabin in northern Wisconsin. He left everything to his sons from his previous marriage that he hadn't seen in years and didn't even show up to his funeral. Of course that's not how it works, it was now my grandma's stuff. 

We left the funeral home together. My grandmother sat in the back with us holding his ashes. We got close to her home and came up on his favorite bar. My grandmother asked us to stop. She asked my dad for his pocket knife and he gave it to her. We pulled up and she got out carrying the urn to the front door of the bar. As I watched her I remember being confused about what she was going to do. She set the urn on the ground, opened it and pulled out the bag of ashes, cut it open with the knife and pored his ashes in the container you put out cigarettes in.

She picked up the urn and got back into the car. She said loudly ""he spent all of our money here so that's where his ashes belong"". We started driving away and she said loudly ""his soul is in hell anyway"". We were all quiet the rest of the ride. We dropped her off at her home and gave hugs and kisses. I still remember the smile on her face as we drove away. She looked so happy. "

12013,Totally agree
12014,"I dunno man, people are kind of afraid of gods, and all the people whose lives you saved by cleaning off germs probably really love their God. 

Like think about this. Christians conquered the world to spread their religious beliefs. But no one has ever met this good guy, and if anyone met Jesus they would have died hundreds of years prior. But the conviction was still strong enough to kill and die. With no miracles or direct attributable gifts from God in their lives.

But you're walking around. Talking to people. Curing their diseases. Building great works. You'd have many more friends than enemies. 

Unless you decided to hoard wealth over an effectively infinite times on like some kind of absolute dick weasel. You should share and inspire."
12015,"Years ago, one of my sisters took our mom (very hard of hearing) to a doctor's visit.  Among other things, the doctor said something to the effect of, ""Your kidneys are working at about 30% efficiency, which is not bad for a person in her '70s.""  My mom only heard the first part.  As they were driving home, my sister noticed that our mom was very quiet.  When she asked why, our mom replied, ""Well, I guess that's it.  My kidneys are failing and I've only got a week to live.""  [She heard, ""Not bad for a person in her 70s"" as ""a dead person in 7 days.""]  She celebrated her 88th birthday last month."

They generally just push out whatever pizza they think they need out, but they're more than willing to push out any pizza combination you can think of. 

I had family that is lactose intolerant, they actually made them pizza without cheese. Just sauce bread and toppings. They're really cool, I'm glad they're doing so well."

12034,"Amusement park in the mid 90s... Like a giant putt putt.

1. Idiot puts token in batting cage machine. Ball comes out. Swings at ball in misses. Proceeds to bend over and pick up ball. Hit in the side of the head by 65 MPH baseball with no helmet. Part of his suit in court was that, ""he  didn't know there would be more than one ball"".

2. Go Kart tracks are designed so that they are narrow enough that you cannot turn your go-kart around. However, ""genius"" idiots figured out you could have your buddy do the ""fish tail maneuver"" to get you turned all the way around. Idiots would then proceed to drive down the track full speed the wrong way and ram people. This happened frequently. One time this happened at the crest of a small hill and one go-kart managed to ride up on top of the other gokart and into the second riders chest.

3. Idiots will try and ""tee off"" on the putt putt course. Ball goes airborne and hits people.

4. Not the park I worked at, but another one had a bumper boat pond with dyed water so you couldn't see how nasty it was. That was all good until some kid fell in and drowned because nobody could find him to save him it time.

5. Manager closing the store down at night, going to drop off the days cash at the bank. Someone with a gun trys to stop him in the parking lot after he's in his car. Ran his ass clean over. Guy who got rammed apparently wound up on the hood of the car yelling at the driver to stop, who slammed on the breaks... forcing the driver to fly off the car. Manager then drives around the person and off to the bank. No crimes were reported and the robber was not seen again."

I am a male in his 20's who works at a restaurant that employs mostly women so of course I am the one who goes outside and picks up, not only our guests butts, but also the entire staff's.

I was gonna eat them when I got home so I reached in and pulled the slices out. It was my favorite pizza flavor (buffalo chicken) and was resting on top of some old receipts and a cardboard microwaveable mac and cheese cover. That's it. It wasn't resting on top of 3 week old rotten meat. She said ""Eww, omg how could you eat that out of the trash?"". Bitch, I don't know. Maybe because it wasn't touching anything that might actually be dirty? You just relocated the pizza storage from a fridge to a trashcan. Pizza is still good at room temp. But nope.

12086,"I have a friend who's mom died giving birth to him. I remember it was a well known fact in our school and some assholes used to bully him by saying he killed his own mother. I remember him telling me how when he told his dad what they had said and apologized to his dad if he felt that way about him too, his dad broke down and told him to never ever believe that, and that despite losing his wife, he's alive because of her and everything she was is now in him, growing up healthy. I'm not an emotional guy but hearing how his dad rationalized losing his wife to the birth of his son really punched me in the gut for some reason. His dad must have gone through a lot of pain and heartache and yet chose to make the best of things for the sake of his son and himself."

12108,"Yes, you do not need to be compliant with medical intervention for your kid. A classic example in peds are the antivaxxer families. They are recommended and safe and could save your child‚Äôs life, but many families refuse them. 

An inter-family transplant could have been an option, but their religion did not allow for this. The fact that they allowed us to do dialysis was actually shocking to most of us d/t their religion. Though, the child did receive mostly blood from family members after the first few days. "

12117,"Real Estate: 

1. The language in the contract is not that difficult, just please read it and ask questions even if you are embarrassed.  



2. Buyers/sellers are HORRIBLE negotiators, especially when they are Realtors. (Frequently)



3. If the buyers/sellers are people, not corporations, you are negotiating their story much more than the price and dates. You manage their story correctly the terms become more in your favor.



4. When you think you are a hyper aggressive negotiator who's using your Realtor to attack or punish the other party, you are going to get a much less satisfactory outcome than if you let the professionals do their job, this is assuming you've hired ethical good brokers with whom you have good rapport with.



5. No matter how much you have fallen in love with the house you're looking at, there's another one very similar to it not that far in your future. There's frequently only around 20 different styles of house in whatever your price range is that you're drawn to.



6. You make the decision whether or not to buy a house in less than five seconds of walking in the front door. You make a change of breathing that I listen for and I know we're going to spend a minimum of 45 minutes in that house while I effectively watch you argue with yourself about the fact that you're going to want to write an offer for that home.



7. A good broker knows there are certain times when it's best to let the buyer and seller finish certain parts of the negotiation on their own hopefully because of a very good pattern of honesty and communication that's been established between both parties.

Let me know if there is any interest in more of these.

I used to have to play actress to keep my empathy working towards the end of a double or triple shift. (which would be mangled somehow to keep from paying me overtime. I'm pretty sure it was illegal the stuff my bosses did)

I used to cry in the bathroom because I would find myself annoyed at residents that I knew I adored most of the time, because I was fucking tired and they needed me to be at the top of my game. They I'd shotgun a energy drink, force and smile and get back in there because half assing wasn't an option no matter how much I wanted to pull a sickie and go home."

12126,"The if in her statement is pretty important. If she is just saying if something was to happen she wouldn‚Äôt pursue treatment it may be rational. 

As a physician if I were diagnosed with some select diseases I might just do everything I could to help my wife and kids out but not bother treatment. My wife and I have discussed this. What we would and wouldn‚Äôt want done. We talked about it with our parents so we know what they want. 

If you‚Äôre still worried ask her to go with her to her next doctors appointment. Depression screening is pretty common. 

I think discussions like this can be very healthy and informative. Ideally you want to have the talk before you have to. Before the diagnosis. "

I am not good with words so I hope this doesnt come off the wrong way, but hopefully your fiancee's heart was filled with happiness because she was having such a great time that day with you and she didnt feel pain or fear in her last moments."
12130,"I tell my best friend the whole time that the only reason that I'm not dead now is him. He was with me through everything, even when I was in my worst state and pushing him away, he kept supporting me. When I was standing in the bathroom with the knife in my hand and blood spewing out of my wrists, I thought about how sad he would feel when he found out what happened, and after everything he did for me, there was absolutely no way I was gonna do that to him. I love him more than anything. "

12136,"This one happened recently actually. I was called into the hospital in the middle of the night for an elderly lady with multiple chronic medical problems that had just had a massive heart attack and probably wasn‚Äôt going to make it. She was on maximum support and still was hypertensive (low blood pressure). I went to the waiting room to tell the family that she was probably going to die. 

In the family room was about 5 members of her family and one random lady who was watching the last race of the triple crown on TV. I asked her to turn off the TV but she refused. I asked her a little more sternly. The family told me that it was OK, the TV could be on. I asked again to at least turn the volume down on the Tv but they insisted that it was ok. A few of them wanted to see the race too. I sat down to tell them the bad news, TV blasting and the random woman getting more and more excited about the race. 

I told them that there was probably nothing we could do, their mother/grandmother/aunt was probably going to die tonight the woman still did not turn off the TV even though he could easily hear what I was saying. The daughter and granddaughter cried but some of the cousins kept looking at the race. It was surreal. Finally, when people started crying, I stood up and forced the Rando out of the room and turned off the TV. She got really upset at me but I wouldn‚Äôt let her back in the room. The patient died later that night"

12144,"For me, its also losing his family. I have a pretty terrible family, that I broke contact with because they were abusive. Even when I was still in contact with them, they lived on the other side of the country, so I spent so much time with my bf's family.

Then I got to 45 and my marriage fell apart and afterwards I met an amazing girl with a toddler.  And I'm so happy I got to experience this.  Watching a little person grow that tiny little bit every day, being fucking amazed when he does something that he's come up with completely on his own, like making up a song that features me and Mommy (sadly, Mommy and I were sort of dolts in this song because we kept falling in the wawa).  Experiencing stuff I never would have, like how actually fun some of the indoor playgrounds are, and how other playgrounds are NOT made for 6'6"" dudes, and that walking on the beach with the tide out and no shoes on is amazing, and that Peppa Pig is actually sort of entertaining especially when watched with a 3 year old (but Super Why can fuck right off).  Yeah, I could do this stuff before, but it's this brand new perspective on it.  There's so much to it that it's hard to explain.  The little conversations.  The love that goes both ways.  Being fucking proud when he does something like he did yesterday, when we went to see his sick grandma and he charged right up and gave her the biggest hug and told her to get better.

I'm sure childfree folks will just say ""oh well you're invested so you're justifying your life decisions by the usual Parenting Is A Unique Experience bullshit"".  But it is a unique experience, and not a negative one.  Yeah, you get meltdowns randomly when the kids are too young to rationally deal with stuff, and then when they *are* they just turn into different stuff to deal with.  But the negative stuff is a small and necessary part of all this.  

I *did* no kids and tons of time and money.  It was cool to not really be responsible for anything, to be able to say on a Tuesday ""fuck I'm bored, I'm gonna go to Vegas this weekend"" and be on a plane Friday afternoon.  I guess I got the empty nest part out of the way early.  Now I'm digging what this all is and would recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn't judge them no matter what decision they make.

He never actually showed me that he knew, I was always able to derail the conversation to another tech subject or find an excuse to leave the room before he got to part of his lecture on how to see everyone's history, but I'm like 98% sure he knows and just doesn't care (like 99% of all tech people) or knows not to talk about it.

I don't really like him that much or have a strong relationship with him. He has a tendency to argue things he knows nothing about then tell me I'm arguing things I know nothing about just because I disagree. He falls into that trap of ""the loudest wins"" and a variety of other things whioe daring to lecture *me* about it.

Not his twisted version of help. But like, actual help. like ""Dad. Just stand there, and don't chime in until I ask you something. But don't go back to *your computer* either."" kinda help.

He's not oresent but complains about us not being present while failing to realuze that we are not present because it was a combination of learned behaviour and the fact that we've decided it isn't worth confront ing him about it.

I want help searching for a job and writing a resume but won't ask him because he is blind to his own stubbornness and doesn't realize the depth of his in-person absence. All he would do is argue with me.

The story starts out with the same general premise of girl enters new town and finds the really intense guy who sits next to her in biology strange, but then completely deviates from the whole concept as she starts handling the situation in the way a smart person would, such as 'immediately transferring away from her biology class when she starts feeling threatened' and 'immediately confronts her stalker when she realises he is stalking her'.

12299,"A bit late. I had a camper that would constantly cause trouble and lie about it afterwards. He was a repeat camper and we were warned before he was placed in our cabin. Since I was the junior counselor and this kid was apparently such a problem I was assigned to pretty much watch him. (It was two counselors to a cabin and roughly 13 kids in a cabin. So I literally had to watch only one kid) Though he was old enough that I wasn't supposed to hover just make sure that if issues arose I saw what happened. 

Here are some of the things he did: 

* First day he tried to push a fellow camper off the top bunk
* Second day I caught him trying to steal additional candy from the snack cabin
* Third day he got kicked out of the pool for continuously ""Play drowning"" fellow campers (He got place in my activity and again had to watch him) 
* Culminating on the fourth day when he fucking Luis Suarez style bit another camper to the point he drew blood. I had to pick him up and lift him upside down to get him to let go of the kid. 

After that I told the camp director I wasn't watching him and he wasn't allowed to be in my cabin. I guess none of the other items were bad enough to be sent home but that one was so he was promptly sent home and I was told I did a good job. Supposedly the previous year he had knocked over all the bunks in the cabin breaking 4-5 so a biting was considering pretty tame? Regardless I've never had a kid like that before or sense. 

The parents responses to those above issues were: 

* He was likely just playing around he probably didn't mean to try and push the camper off the bed. 
* He probably was just getting a friends snack for them, he was trying to steal them. 
* Kids horse play in the pool all the time this isn't anything serious. 
* If he bit another kid I'm sure he had a good reason for it. 

I didn't know how to react so I pretty much didn't say anything and just helped load the kids stuff into his parents car. "

12393,"I went to a Halloween party in college, and I decided to dress in drag with a few of my friends. We borrowed clothes from girls in the dorm room, then walked a few miles to a party. On the walk there we came across a group of girls who were being flirty with us, and they decided to follow us to the house we were going to. One girl in particular started talking to me and we just chatted the rest of the walk.

When we got to the party I was feeling pretty confident. I was also pretty drunk. The girl who was talking to me started offering me shots and according to my friends, the two of us finished a 750ml bottle of some Russian sounding vodka. She then decided she needed more liquor, but no one was going to drive, so of course I volunteered to walk with her to the nearest store which was only about half a mile away. 

We left the party, and that's when I blacked out. I don't remember anything until the next morning, but according to my friends I never made it back to the house.

I woke up the next morning in the hospital, for obvious reasons, and by the time I got back to my place I just wanted to sleep. I couldn't though because this girl had told a few people quite the story about the night before.

She also got taken to a hospital that night, but she ended up in a different city. When she was taken into the ER, they gave her a tox screen, and she tested positive for multiple things including heroin. Her parents were called to pick her up since they were her emergency contact, and when they heard she tested positive for heroin and other drugs she blamed me for everything.

She claimed that I gave her drugs by having her drink from my water bottle that I had spiked. She then said I took her off campus and was physically inappropriate until she cried. I knew I hadn't given her anything. I didn't take any drugs besides alcohol, and obviously didn't test positive for anything. I didn't know what had happened after I left the party with her since I had blacked out and ended up in the hospital. Since she was already lying about drugs I just figured she was lying about everything else as well.

At first I was a little hurt, but just sort of brushed it off since it just sounded like a crazy story. That was until a friend walked into my room, handed me his phone, and just said ""It's her from the other night."" She reiterated a little bit of her story, and said we needed to talk. I was almost angry, but I could hear people in the background of her phone, so I agreed to meet with her only if she brought a friend as well as me.

When we met up she stuck with her story at first, but eventually just started crying when I pointed out that we drank her vodka all night and I didn't test positive for anything. She caved that she had been doing drugs and her parents were going to pull all of her money. I was still angry about it, but her friend stood up for me and told her how messed up it was that she was trying to get me arrested for her mistake. 

I'm glad nothing ever ended up coming of it. I blocked all contact with her after that, and from what I heard she ended up dropping out. I'm still thankful everything ended the way it did, and that night definitely taught me a few life lessons."

Dealing with that level of betrayal and emotional turmoil makes people do irrational things, like attribute blame to people who aren't the primary agonist. Like, sure, if you're removed from the situation, the ethics of sleeping with someone in a relationship are tricky. The person you're SO is cheating with isn't the one really at fault, they aren't violating an obligation to you, and if they don't know, you could argue that deontologically they aren't at fault at all. But people don't really take the time to think about the ethics of the situation or attribute blame rationally, because they're angry and betrayed and hurt."

She only shops at the store nearest her apartment because it's the closest, but it's also the most expensive. I didn't see a single good price on a thing while I was in that store. I watched her buy a $10 package of two small chicken breasts and threw up in my mouth a little. (For context, $5-6 is a fairly normal price in our area).

Another time I two disabled guest passes at the same time (at the same ride as the last story) and according to the policy I can only let one group with the passes on at a time given total capacity for the ride was not very much. The woman behind the first group with her grandkids got upset and called it ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù for whatever reason (if it was somehow racial I don‚Äôt see how it could be since herself and I were white and the first group was black) so she demanded a manager and they settled the issue.

A stranger sat down next to me and started complimenting my son's strawberry blonde curls. Next thing I know, she is stroking his hair. I don't even like strangers touching my baby under normal circumstances but while my nipple is in his mouth... That's not okay.

Another incident that comes to mind is a strange visit I got a couple days after he was born. A woman from a local church (my husband and I dont attend any church, let alone the lds church this woman was from) showed up at our doorstep. She brought a gift for the baby (a bandana. Not sure what use a baby has for a bandana but ok.) Next thing I know she is stand over me while I'm holding him, stroking his cheek. He wiggled a bit and then smiled. She then proceeded to tell me that when newborns smile, they are talking to angels. Without even thinking, I blurted out ""that's a nice thought but in reality, he just farted and feels a lot better. He's a gassy baby."" She pulled her hand away like I had just slapped her and said ""no, it's angels"" before storming out of my house. I still have no idea who she was. "
12544,"All three of my sons basically learned to ignore it unless it crossed the line. If it did, they where quick to let us or someone know. Once, a girl at the same high school as my middle child was too obsessed with taking his picture so he did report her to the counselor. My middle child was also the one who had pictures taken of him at some wrestling tournament by some high school girls at another school clear across the state. They started to share one in which he had just won so was standing on the mat, sweating, and wearing only his singlet. That picture made the rounds so much that word came back to us. Nothing we could do to stop it unless the comments became too vulgar as they didn't post his name. 

Sometimes, it's more innocent but still annoying. Just the other day, my youngest (now 18) was at a game watching his cousin play baseball. He was sitting right next to me on the stands. Below us were some girls that looked about 13-14 years old. I noticed they would look over their shoulders at my son and then giggle. After a few minutes, they each had their phones out pretending to take selfies but pointing the camera over their shoulders toward my son. I nudged him and once he saw what they where doing, he pushed his hat further down on his head and slouched down. Finally, he just got up and walked to another location far away from them."

12576,"I'm not sure what else you've listened to and what sub genres you like, so I'll try and list out a few different genres and the great bands that I like or others like in them. 

To start, we've got the big ones like [Metallica](https://youtu.be/S7blkui3nQc), [Iron Maiden](https://youtu.be/hltTDVIkGkA), [Megadeth](https://youtu.be/sONL6QUMR9E), [Slayer](https://youtu.be/6M4HtTZ8iGM), [Judas Priest](https://youtu.be/EKSU1W0ZUmQ) and more. These guys are almost all influenced by the fathers in [Black Sabbath](https://youtu.be/4YbD40UMwHQ), and you always include them in any list. From there, you can go a bit softer and more mainstream with [Ozzy Osbourne's](https://youtu.be/CprfjfN5PRs) solos stuff. If you like Ozzy's guitarist check out [Black Label Society](https://youtu.be/9ZGt4JVX860) which is a groove metal band like [Pantera](https://youtu.be/i97OkCXwotE) (also check out Zakk's [Book of Shadows](https://youtu.be/Q29SbuuvGEM) if you like blues). Then related to Black Sabbath there's [Dio](https://youtu.be/EhGEGIBGLu8), which is hard rock and metal depending on the album, but all metalheads love Dio. That about covers your basic mainstream sound that everyone has heard at some point in their lives. As cliche or mainstream as they are, they're still great and a good addition.

Now if you want to go heavier or more progressive, something more akin to Mastodon or Gojira, you've got [Devin Townsend](https://youtu.be/YhcoLO8vZZU) and his various side projects, each of which with fairly unique sounds. [Baroness](https://youtu.be/PZKPpeuHvJk) is a prog-metal band with solid output, highly recommend them. A band that I discovered because they opened for Metallica is [Defecto](https://youtu.be/2Z8imJA8rPA), and their vocalist is also part of a group called [Theory](https://youtu.be/dDxFLLFElD4). Both are great more traditional prog styles. Continuing in the prog sound we've got [Dream Theater](https://youtu.be/SGRgAULYgWE). Dream Theater is especially good with a a few concept albums that tell stories, and James Labrie's voice makes it sound like a legit opera with guitars. Then there's the smaller but still great guys like [Fates Warning](https://youtu.be/0hguUU-VYug). [Pallbearer](https://youtu.be/IHfjaT0Omt8) is another good one in the doom/prog area. I discovered [Shokran](https://youtu.be/EO18nR1pWOw) on Bandcamp, and I can recommend them, they're Russian and sing about Biblical themes mostly from Exodus and lots of Egyptian influence in their lyrics. And finally because I'm adding way too many prog specific stuff, there's [Symphony X](https://youtu.be/cG8orlq6_yE), another prog band that is great.

Then since this comment chain was spurred with a death metal comment, we absolutely need to include [Opeth](https://youtu.be/98wXIjkO4i0) in another comment, they're phenomenal and their vocalist has an operatic voice as well as a rough growl and the two together make their songs sound incredible and they're one of the best death metal bands out there. This band [A Sense of Gravity](https://youtu.be/VXNA_nWfsrE) I found on Bandcamp is great as well with another vocalist that has both the operatic and rough vocals, highly recommend. Then one that was recommended to me a while back was [Persefone](https://youtu.be/i8lOyn49W-s), and they're pretty solid. I don't know a ton from death metal even though I love the sound, so I'll trust and grab /u/stregg7attikos's comment below: 
&gt;obscura, beyond creation, scale the summit, animals as leaders. maximise beastiality, ingested, igorrr, metsat√∂ll, korpiklaani, agalloch, watain, teramobil, wormed

If you decide that you like weird concepts, non-traditional flows and riffs, and really good bass lines [Tool](https://youtu.be/hglVqACd1C8) is great if you ignore the weird obsessive fanbase, but they're not for everyone. If you like Tool's vocalist, [A Perfect Circle](https://youtu.be/BIsH686xWl0) is more traditional sounding while still being experimental like Tool. Tool is kinda related to the industrial metal sound (sorta), so I'll stick some [Meshuggah](https://youtu.be/qc98u-eGzlc) here. [Acrassicauda](https://youtu.be/2fIDFSUMvLY) is kinda industrial, kinda thrash, idk they came from like Iraq or Palestine and fled to America and made great music, but I don't remember all of their sounds.

If you want stuff that's more regular heavy metal but smaller bands, there's a southern rock/metal band I found called [Blacktop Mojo](https://youtu.be/jFjo1pWy6XA) that did a great cover of [Dream On](https://youtu.be/qF9dCWmq3pM), and I thoroughly enjoy their albums, so you might check them out. Metallica's bassist [Jason Newsted](https://youtu.be/GQ9mJtJ94Pg) did a couple things before retiring but they were solid.

If thrash metal tickles your fancy (Metallica/Megadeth/Slayer), [Evile](https://youtu.be/924bRfmiJ20) sounds a lot like early Metallica but a bit heavier, definitely a great band. If you really like Metallica, [Hell Fire](https://youtu.be/e4cD4fAtBKY) sounds like early Metallica with a hint of Iron Maiden in there and it's great. [High on Fire](https://youtu.be/AZlgBRokTCg) is almost universally recommended, so check them out.

A unique take on metal that is essentially pop music with metal sound (their words not mine), you've got [Ghost](https://youtu.be/-0Ao4t_fe0I). Having seen them live, I can highly recommend all of their albums.

That's about all I can think of to get you started right now. Start with the basics, get a feel for what you like. If you think ""man these Metallica guys are great, I want more of that but faster or thrashier"" then check out the thrash section. If you loved Mastodon then check out the prog stuff, but prog can wildly vary between bands, so give each one a shot. The weird concepts and industrial stuff like Tool and Meshuggah are great but not for everyone, but again can wildly vary (Tool has like 5 different genres in single songs sometimes). One great thing about most of these artists is they change sound a bunch so for example Metallica (my personal favorite so I'm biased) went from your thrashy Kill Em All and Puppets era, to a mainstream metal sound, to a randomly blues-rooted and groove rock feel with Load (and I love it) and then went back to some heavier and somewhat thrashier stuff with their last two albums. Each artist name here is a link to either a random song from them, or the one I thought best represented them. If you like it, listen to more of them or more like them, if you don't I recommend giving another song from them a shot before writing them off.

I hope I helped, and welcome to the genre!"

12600,"I grew up in the 80s &amp; 90s, an old guy down the road from us didn't have plumbing at all.  He only got electricity in the late 70s because candles and oil got expensive and then he admitted it was rather nice to have.

On one end of his property was a well.  On the other was the outhouse area.  Area because you can't just leave it in one spot, it's got to be moved on occasion as the hole fills up.  So an uncle of mine would occasional use one of his tractors to dig a new hole, drag the outhouse over it, and fill in the old one.  

The dude absolutely refused to ever consider plumbing, even for cooking or bathing.  He'd draw up a bucket for meals or drinking and a couple for bathing."
12601,"I could see my mother doing something like this in one of her more self-centred moments. She resents that my children live so far from her and crosses a lot of normal, rational boundries with them when she gets a chance - overcompensation. And she can do this with other people's children if she feels the need and mine aren't handy. 

Combine that with the fact that I caught my normally very rational dad sneaking a finger of frosting into the mouth of my 3 month old the first time he met him...he had this fear of missing out on all the ""grandpa"" moments and let that get him carried away...

...not at all an excuse, but I can see circumstances lining up in his mind that led to the false idea that ""everyone will understand that this is harmless and I REALLY WANT TO..."""

12603,"That's ridiculous. A 16 year old is completely capable of understanding what bodily harm is, and that it's not a good thing. A five-year-old can understand that. The fact that he pretended not to see it so he didn't have to help means he knows what it meant and that he should have helped. Arguing that you're not a thirty-year-old whatever with a completely developed adult brain is not a compelling argument against a teenager not having basic moral behavior 

No offense to OP because that's the point of the thread. "
12604,"There are essentially two different types of budgetary spending. One is called discretionary and the other is mandatory. 

Discretionary spending is the amount of money that can be move flexibly year to year. Mandatory spending is for programs that a bound to a certain amount of money by law. 

For example, Medicare and Medicaid take up a huge portion of the budget, but are untouchable due to their mandatory status. This does not mean that their cost is fixed either: unfunded liabilities like Social Security are the primary reason we are in such a fiscal hole. 

Discretionary spending makes up about 30% of the total budget. 63% is made up by mandatory spending. 7 Percent is interest on the national debt. 

You could actually get rid of our entire defense budget and still not cover our current deficit (the amount we owe year to year, not to be confused with the debt, which frankly isn't going anywhere but up). That means literally no army, no navy, no airforce, no marines, etc, and we'd still be billions of dollars in the hole.

12607,"I‚Äôd guess not, if she‚Äôd been talking to him and had her guard down (and was just unperceptive as I know many people who would never miss this sort of thing) she may not have noticed the odd positioning. Also, if they were close together she couldn‚Äôt see his lower body, which may have telegraphed intentioned movement, which the commenter noticed subconsciously. In Taekwondo we learn about that for sparring purposes, the body will often telegraph whatever movement the person intends to take as soon as they start considering it through tensing, favoring one side/positioning, and looking towards their target (eg stop looking at eyes and switch to looking wherever he planned to push). All of those are things that an unperceptive person could not notice and/or mistake for more normal behaviors."

Also you cannot die from a broken bone, or 2 or 3. It is impossible to die from a broken bone. There are things that can accompany a broken bone you can die from but clearly you haven't died.

Emergency medicine is for emergencies. A broken foot/ankle sucks but it is not an emergency.

It's unfortunate you had that experience in hospital, but if it came down to you or someone with chest pain the chest pain comes first.

12661,"On the Sims 2 I had a lovely lesbian couple who adopted a child. The van rolled up and the new family addition was unveiled.

Cue absolute horror.

Thanks to some glitch in the generation of the sim the child was a monstrosity, a chimera of ill-fitting parts, with a face that seemed to have been modelled on the beak of a hummingbird. Not only that, but it had NO personality points in any category. It was a lazy, dirty, stupid, antisocial little freak.

I was so disappointed.

It turned out that killing a child in the Sims is very difficult. They don't starve, drown or play with electrical equipment. But I wanted rid. It upset me. Its face haunted my waking moments. So I built a special room, with 6 fireplaces and lovely think rugs on the floor. One of the parent Sims lit the fireplaces and then left the room, leaving the child in there alone.

I deleted the door.

Within 8 seconds the room was ablaze and the child... Well, the child ceased to be 'controllable', let's say. The gravestone was set in the garden. Life moved on.

It took two nights for the child's red, violent ghost to manifest. And boy did it manifest. It constantly haunted the couple. They couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't bathe as the ghost bothered them constantly, terrifying them. They had to move out. And from then on the house was never lived in again. "

12679,"Subjective experiences are what make up our lives. We are all human, and everything we can experience is fundamentally similar to other things we can experience. I don't know what it's like to be blocked out of a career for my race, but I know what it's like to be excluded from a group for it. I know what it's like to be excluded for my appearance in general, too. Both of those are things I can't control. 

An important concept is internalization. Without that, it's hard to imagine what it's like for a black man in the 1970s. But if you're excluded all the time, you begin to internalize that. It changes how you see yourself, how you see the excluders, and how you see others like yourself. If we take that into account, it becomes much more possible to put yourself into another's shoes.

No, I can't think back to a moment that felt exactly like a black man would feel about his race...but we're human beings. We're all about learning through analogy. As long as we recognize analogy for the imperfection it is, we can get a lot closer to understanding our fellow people.

The mentality you have is that you can't understand what you haven't experienced. I disagree, and believe you underestimate people's ability to understand and empathize. Yes, we can do terrible things, but the spectrum swings both to the very evil and the utterly exceptional. This belief in the utter *other*ness of human experience does great harm to the social justice movement, in my opinion."

12689,"For the same reasons she might have buck teeth, or her hair might be darker, or she might be taller, or her legs might grow hair faster: different bodies are different - yes, there is a general truth to how calories are burned just as there is to our bodies using them to power itself, but pretending that it comes down to this simple method that works for everyone is completely ignoring literally everything else that makes our bodies different.

Even if it was the case that her body wasn't more naturally inclined to store fat rather than use it, the practice of only feeding her lettuce during meals could have caused her to overeat in other opportunities because she wasn't sure when she would get a chance to get actual nutrition.

Would that make it the parents ""not entirely to blame""?  No, fuck you, of course it would, because the worst case scenario for them not acting like fucking psychos and feeding their child lettuce as a meal is that the kid grows up a little fat, OH NO, THE HORROR!  Also, again, fuck you."

Our lawyer managed to get the prosecution to back off and we have 90 days to meet with a probation officer who will deem she's not a threat and after the 90 days, if everything is good, all charges will drop off as if they never happened."

And kids who aren‚Äôt raised around dogs usually have no idea how to approach one calmly so they don‚Äôt get the dog too excited. If I am aware of what the kids are doing I know how to guide my dog  or move my dog so it‚Äôs on the other side of me as the approaching kid so there is no issue.

12740,"Lived in a town home when I was in middle school and for the 5 years that I lived there my personality changed. Doesn‚Äôt help that I also went through most of puberty in that hell hole. 

I remember being sad and feeling heavy all the time, so much so I slouched while standing and it felt impossibly tiring to keep my head up. I stopped eating to the point where my had me checked out. Everyone in the house was fighting all the time; got especially heated between my step father and I. This tension wore on me and exacerbated my depression to the point where I attempted suicide. 

More to the point: I would be lying in bed and my half sister would always keep the hallway light on for her room. I would never face the door after I saw a shadow waft back and forth underneath the door way. Every night at 5:30 pm my touch lamp would change settings three times, periodically. One-two-three, one-two-three, just like that. I‚Äôm also pretty sure I was lifted out of bed at one point because I remember falling back onto it in a way that seemed plausible. I very well could‚Äôve have been dreaming but all I remember was seeing a flash of purple before I was rudely awoken. 

I‚Äôd even hear someone calling my name all the time and I literally thought I was going insane until my mother told me she‚Äôd hear someone calling ‚Äúmom‚Äù while we were all at school and her guy was at work. 

The scariest night was when I was home alone. When I‚Äôd be left there I‚Äôd turn all the lights on, even the basement‚Äôs.  I felt like something was standing and watching me from closet and they were these ugly metal closets painted white. I was drawing and listening to music while sitting on my bed and I suddenly have this overwhelming terror, like I was going to die. I rip the headphones out of my ears, drop all my shit and I just ran out of the house. I walked around all night until sunrise and was later grounded for it. 

I still tear up in fear when thinking about all that. I‚Äôm sure no one I‚Äôve told believes me. "

But I've never mentioned the 5th floor, that I'm aware of. I'm regularly followed by something up there that aggressively stomps along behind me as I do my nightly security walk. It seemed one night last year like it wasn't going to be a problem anymore, then right as I passed room 516, something exhaled on my ear. I spun around and pressed against the wall, looking both directions, and slunk across to the elevator.

I haven't seen or heard anything up there since, but whatever's up there wanted me super fucking aware that it's there. I'll deal with the apparitions coming and going on the first floor. I don't ever want to deal with the thing on the 5th floor again."

I completely went crazy and tried to will my heart to stop in order to escape.  True death was preferable, and I didn't think I was ever going to wake up anyway.

  I'm not alone.  Though rare, this kind of thing happens during induced comas.  An even rarer few are lucky as fuck and have a whimsical journey that feels great.  Most of us suffer in ways I don't wish on anyone.

Another would be the few months I lived as ""big brother"" to a friend I met when I returned to university. She was 7 or 9 years younger than me, so dating was just way too creepy. But we got along spectacularly and spent hours together almost every weekday. When we embraced the whole big brother/little sister thing, it honestly felt like the first time I ever had family.

I came home from 1st grade one day to find it full of dirt. They had been leveling out a part of the yard and needed a place to put the dirt. Didn't want to ruin the lawn.

Since they stopped covering it once it was full of dirt, I used to play in the mud in it out of pure spite. It wasn't the same; but my mom hated how I got mud everywhere everytime I did it.

Had a similar situation. My senior year of high school, my best friend started dating a guy who raped and abused our mutual friend. Despite my warnings, they were together for a while. She didn‚Äôt believe me, but even if a small part of her did, we were naive teens and she felt like she was in love and maybe it would be different. He fucked her up so bad mentally (and hurt her physically, humiliated her, forced her to distance herself from friends and family, raped her). I stopped talking to her for a while when they started dating and I regret it all the time. Maybe I could‚Äôve supported her and held her after she was raped. Maybe I could‚Äôve helped her feel safe enough to get away, or at least I could have been there for her to talk to.
She eventually managed to get away from him and she‚Äôs happy now, has a beautiful family, and we‚Äôre still friends.

I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong. I hope you feel like you did your best and the fact she‚Äôs with your abuser is not your fault. She made her decision to be with him after you warned her, and she blocked you, you‚Äôre best friends yet she‚Äôs with your abuser.

12900,"Happened to my aunt. Somebody did the movie thing of put a basket on the front door and ring the bell. Well inside the basket was a newborn and some heartfelt letter about how the mother could not raise the kid. They were a well known christian family in the town (at the time her husband had a seat in the town's parliament). So, they raise the boy  with their older kids never telling him he's adopted, until one day, about 17 years later, in a family lunch one of the matriarchs (a greataunt of mine that was in the early stages of Alzheimer's) casually says: ""Oh, he's so handsome and resembles you (to his father) in every way. Would you mind if I take a picture to show his mother?""

12931,"&gt;Tell her to read Corinthians. Paul himself says people shouldn‚Äôt speak in tongues unless there‚Äôs an interpreter there to make sense of it because it‚Äôs just a distraction for everyone else if they can‚Äôt understand it. It is rude (or crazy) and the apostles agree.



It's especially interesting because speaking in tongues was a completely different type of action in Acts when the apostles were supposed to have done it, as opposed to what's described in 1 Corinthians. In Acts the apostles spoke to a multicultural crowd in their [the apostles'] own language, but the individual members of the crowd heard their own native languages instead. 



Modern Pentecostals cherry pick not only the 1 Corinthians version of speaking in tongues, but like you pointed out they simply neglect the whole requiring an interpreter bit as well as the fact that prophesy is apparently better and more important than speaking in tongues, which is the actual point of the whole chapter.



1 Corinthians 14:


&gt;Intelligibility in Worship
&gt;
&gt;1¬†Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, **especially prophecy**.¬†2¬†For **anyone who speaks in a tongue¬†does not speak to people but to God**. Indeed, **no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit**.¬†3¬†**But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort**.¬†4¬†Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.¬†5¬†**I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,¬†but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues,¬†unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified**.

I kept telling her that it felt like something snapped in my left ear, but she kept brushing me off and sending me back to work. I even asked for imaging and she said ""work comp is picky about things, so no.""

I later spent 2k of my own money I got a CT scan from another doc. It ends up I have a condition called superior canal dehiscence.

This means there is a hole deep in my inner ear probably caused from the loud noise exposure.

Only treatment is opening my skull, lifting my brain, and patching that hole.

13007,"I don't know you, but if your parents were happily married, I don't think your dad is just ""moving on"". He's faced with a huge permanent hole in his life; having a partner to love, a person to share his home with, to share himself with, to finish his life with.

Think of it this way....your mom made your dad so happy for so long that without her, life feels *incomplete*. Here now is another person who understands what that *incompleteness* feels like. Someone he could maybe share stories of his life and his love, your mother, with. Someone who can talk to him about her late husband, someone who knew him and their love story and who misses him too. Someone who lost like he lost. He isn't forgetting and moving on. He is remembering how wonderful it was to have your mom as his life partner, and she is doing the same. 

And maybe, maybe, the permanent holes in their lives will get a little bit easier to bear as they remember together. If your mom and dad truly loved each other, how could he not miss that love and be tempted to try and find comfort from someone who understands his loss?"

13077,"I'm a medical student. Two years ago, I had a young patient (on his twenties) that suffered from neurofibromatosis. He had developed brain tumors several times and received treatment. At that point, he had been really lucky because despite the tumors affecting the CNS and the multiple surgeries he had undergone, he never had neurological deficit and even was on remission for some time. But, as he had neurofibromatosis, he developed a brain tumor again. Sadly, this time he also developed severe neurological deficit. He could hardly talk, he couldn't walk and he had lost sensitivity in a great extent of his body.  Unfortunately, this time the tumor was inoperable. He had to stop studying, which was what he liked the most. Even though he and his mom knew about the bad prognosis of his condition, he would always say he would go back to school after recovering. It was heartbreaking.

I used to go and perform a complete physical exam, emphasizing on the CNS. One day, I went to perform the physical exam, as usual, but this time I found out he had recovered sensitivity on his face. (the prior day, he had no sensitivity). It was incredible. His mom and him were so happy, and we could feel their happiness too. They still had hope, and saw the good things in their bad times. But it was also bittersweet, because we knew he wouldn't recover this time.

This has been the most emotional experience I've had as a medical student. I felt happy, I felt sad, I felt empathy. And even though he passed away, I'll never forget him.

You literally connect with hundreds of people every time you breathe or your heart beats in a way that is so personal its miraculous. 

Every breath you have exhaled has breathed life into someone else doing something different. The air that comes into you was, at one point, closer to a person than a hug or kiss. And now it is in you. That is beautiful.

You are linked here, in blood and bone and humanity. You are with us, in a strange way. You are never alone, not while your heart beats and your lungs breathe.

For months she had been experiencing a gradual neurological deterioration.  This was affecting her mental and physical health.  She wasn't going off the walls crazy or anything like that but you could tell she was slowing down.  

My parents had recently purchased a new house and we needed a tenant for it.  With her health deteriorating we decided the best action would be to move her there.  The house had no stairs and we got a wheelchair ramp installed on the porch.  Much better than carrying a wheelchair up and down 14 steps to take her outside.  And her house was a virtual hoarders mess.

On her 85th birthday we took her out to IHOP.  Took us an hour or so to get her in the car to go, but we got there.  We had a nice family meal together and after that we took her to the new house.  She was not thrilled to be there.  No one had told her we were going to move her.  We did feel bad about the deception, but it was the only way to get her cooperation.  

My dad and myself setup her TV in the living room as she watched.  She lightened up and was thrilled she could watch some of her shows.

Over the following weeks she was able to have visitors over.  We brought our piano down and set that up.  She played it a couple times.  Some of the visitors even played the piano.  She wouldn't have had these visitors at her old place.

My uncle spent a lot of time caring for her and my parents sometimes took a night so he could rest.  Occasionally she would say that she wanted to go home, my uncle would tell her that she could either stay there or go to a nursing home.  My grandma always said she would like to stay where she was.  It gave her a sense of countrol that she could make a choice.

As time progressed she started to sundown.  At nights she would talk to my mom telling her how she could see her grandparents out on the farm among other things.

She started eating and drinking less and less as the days progressed.  Her own mobility decreased and she could no longer walk without aid.   One day she said to my uncle ""I am so very tired."" He told her that it was alright to go to sleep.  With that, she closed her eyes, fell asleep, and passed."

It‚Äôs stupid but stuff like that actually gave me a few coping skills that I didn‚Äôt have before. Of course I‚Äôm in therapy now and I‚Äôm on meds, but before I had access to those things, seeing other people make jokes of it kinda lightened the mood. "

13182,"I love that you're still optimistic and idyllic. You remind me of myself as a teenager.

The adult world is difficult. There's a lot of hardship and pain waiting for you. Some people can take it. Some can't. Those who can't are the ones who say things like that.

They aren't actively trying to be a downer. After a while all the hurt wears at you. After a while it just leaks out because they can't contain it anymore. It's like trying to carry water in a glass with a hole in it.

No, here in the Western world aren't living in squalor with our life constantly in danger. That's not enough to be happy. That makes it a hell of a lot easier to search for happiness but not everyone will end up finding it. Being out of danger and having reliable meals isn't enough to satisfy one's heart. We're not dogs.

Those people used to ""keep that shit to themselves"" but they can't take it anymore. They're hurting. They can't help it. Don't be mad at them. Don't pity them. Just realize that they're in pain and lost the ability to keep it all in."

I don't even know how I got through that dinner.  I do remember trying to get the peas to stay on my fork, and watching them jump off in terror as they approached my gaping grinding mouth.  Cutting up the meat was a grisly horror, but I managed to eat enough to make a good show.  Finally I headed for bed immediately after dinner, mumbling something about ""not feeling well.""  Bro did the dishes (we normally did it together), then came upstairs and knocked on my door.  I let him in - totally peaking by now - and he said ""WHOO BOY you look ALL FUCKED UP!  Just LOOK at your PUPILS!""  He was just messing with me, we loved and looked out for each other, but he couldn't resist.

13198,"Expired can be a vague term and he likely doesn't actually mean rotten.

For example, most Fast Food places cook some extra burgers and chicken early during busy hours, and keep them heated. They have a fairly short time frame for how long they're supposed to keep that cooked meat around before a timer goes off, and you're meant to cook some fresh.

At the location I worked, we were told to reset the timer at least 3 times before throwing away that food and replacing it. That was 'expired' chicken being sold.

Similarly the salads we made were only meant to be kept in the fridge for 2 days by corporate policy. Rather than throw it away after that, we were told to inspect it and only toss it if it's actually turning brown. Otherwise we would just put a new 2-day sticker on it and sell it. Especially in this case, if none of the salad was even wilting, that would be a complete waste to throw it away."

13273,"I saw a show about Steven Spielberg  where they talked about his bitter resentment towards his father for divorcing his mother and breaking up his family. It is a theme in most of his movies, he said E.T. was about divorce before he even added in the alien and the resentment towards the dad in Close Encounters was pulled from his own childhood. He didn't speak to his father for years. 

Anyway, it turns out his mother cheated with the dad's best friend but his father knew young Steven would hate his mother for it and didn't want the boy to essentially lose his mother to resentment. So they told the kids he was leaving her, and he took the responsibility for it. "

The weird thing was, we definitely had chemistry since the first day we met, and she opened up to me about really personal things and it physically hurt me not to tell her how I felt. We did eventually go out, where the chemistry was still there, but she dumped me for her neighbor and our closeness faded and we aren't friends anymore :/

13342,"Even if they had a happy marriage, it can still be true in a way.

My paternal grandparents were high school sweethearts.  They got married shortly after they both graduated.  Grampa went to work, Gramma went to work having four children by him and taking care of the house.

My grandfather treated my grandmother very well, and they loved each other dearly.  Initially, she was absolutely crushed by his death.

But she had spent her entire adult life being defined by being his wife and being the mother to their kids.  And for the last ten years, she's been able to focus on defining herself on her own terms.  She went on a trip to Alaska.  Her backyard garden and all the flower beds around the house (and there are a lot) are the talk of the neighborhood.  She recently adopted a cat.

13401,"At a cabinet shop I worked for, the project manager was a good guy. Always happy, fun, you know the type. He worked with charities, had a great wife that worked in payroll as well. He had been with the company for 15+ years.

The cabinet shop was a growing small business, but was changing VERY rapidly into a medium sized business. This is important later.

We worked on an order basis. After an order was finialized, it was drafted using plans from the manager, and shipped out after completion. The order gets to a jobsite, a team installs it, and that's it. The company was paid after that.

What no one knew however, was these orders weren't all being sent through the company owners. The project manager was taking orders from customers. After passing the designs to the correct parties, they were drawn up, and moved onto the production line. There we're zero checks and balances. No signatures, no memos. Just ""Work this order next.""

This is where the business growing so quickly was important. The owners trusted everyone to do their jobs without supervision. There were over 10 orders which were pushed by the project manager, onto the floor, and installed. The owners had a non-exsistant inventory system, so when an order would come through, they would order parts for it. The project manager would have his wife put a po in for wood, nails, etc, and his wife would approve it. Orders ranged from 5 cabinets, and a countertop, to 100 cabinets and tops, backslashes, and so on. The project manager had his own dirty team install the jobs, paid them under the table, and pocketed the rest. 

The 100 cabinet order one was what tipped the owners off. They looked at the orders vs what they were paid for, and found out what was missing. Cut to the arrest of the wife and project manager. For stealing at least (the owners were never 100% sure they caught everything) 100,000, the project manager got 10 years, and the wife got 3 for assisting him. Checks and balances followed shortly there after.

2) Negative reinforcement: do a good thing, get rewarded with a bad thing being taken away.

3) Direct punishment: do a bad thing, get punished with a bad thing.

4) Indirect punishment/timeout: do a bad thing, get punished with a good thing being taken away.

When I left, I really had to sit my kids down and tell them that we couldn't have the same type of life we had before. That I didn't make as much money as their father. That I couldn't just decide to buy things, that I would have to save for a long time. You know what...being honest with them was the best decision I have ever made because now they understand the value of things. 

We talk about wants, needs, saving, helping around the house, me working. We came up with a list of desires and how long we would have to save. Their biggest want, buying a house with a yard and 3 bedrooms so they wouldn't have to share. It was so important that they were willing to give up birthday and Christmas presents for 2 years, move to a new city, and change schools.

I don't think the older generations understand how soul-crushing it is to spend years in higher education working your butt off and sinking into debt (because we were told that this was the golden ticket to success) only to graduate and have jobs you are more than qualified for sending your resume straight to the trash. The narrative that college will lead to financial stability may be true for some, but for the majority of people I know, they are walking around with their diplomas clutched tightly in their hands begging for entry level jobs to give them the time of day. 

I just finished a graduate degree and applied for 63 jobs (about half in my field and half in other fields, mostly administrative assistant type jobs), most of which required an associate's degree or on the rare occasion, a bachelor's. Every single job denied me for even an interview, saying I lack the qualifications and experience relevant. I have never felt so worthless and hopeless as I did around the time of graduation. I spent two years making pennies and working my ass off to get an advanced degree to be shrugged at and tossed aside by hiring managers.

13532,"I spent a summer working [here] (https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/us/roller-coaster-derail-daytona-beach/index.html) a few years ago. This particular gem was allowed to be operated on the boardwalk and the rule was that you had to ride it once to get a feel of what it was like for customers. Let me break that down for you.

First, you had to push start this thing, which usually took 3 people. It was heavy enough empty, but put 2-3 people per car in it on a busy weekend and it took every bit of 3 people to get it moving. You had to push it about 40 feet and manage to get it fast enough to reach the mechanism outside that grabbed on and pulled it up the first drop. If it rolled backward, you had to do it all again. 

Then, on the first drop, even with one person per car, you could feel the cars listing like it was gonna come off the track. I brought this up to the company that ran the coaster and they said it was perfectly safe. I never rode it again after that. 

The company that owns this thing also owns an as to my knowledge non-operable Ferris Wheel right next to it that hasn't worked in years as well as a teacup style ride that was decommissioned out of state and the county lets them operate it. I doubt you've heard the last of this place. "
13533,"Oh man. These things suck so bad.

From one of my previous posts because I'm too lazy to type:

Years ago I was voluntold to participate in a mock hostage rescue as a public demo at a stadium with around 5000 spectators. I got to play the part of the hostage.

There was a shitty little 12x12 shack constructed out of 1/8"" plywood that I would be rescued from. I'd be grabbed, dramatically dragged off in this shack and tied to a chair. People could see my through a cut out window.

The rescue team was supposed to breach, toss a flashbang into a barrel (the spectators couldn't see it), shoot the baddies in the face, and rescue me.

When the time came for the actual demo, buddy rimshotted the flashbang on the barrel and it bounced into the room with me. I just remember being blind, deaf, and getting kicked in the chest. The walls blew out and I, complete with chair, were thrown backwards.

They continued with the ""rescue"" and carried me, still tied to a chair, backstage, directly to an ambulance.

Shit sucked. Would not do that again. 

TL;DR - Flashbangs are flashy, bangy, and full of ouch"

13670,"It's a wonderful country with wonderful people, so the terrifying realization you come to is that horrors like that truly can happen anywhere. It's not some flaw in the people of a particular nation. 

The other thing that's hard to come to grips with is that there is so little left from the holocaust. Knowing what happened in Dachau, it seems like it should be permanently covered in darkness, that you should feel sick when you enter the grounds. But there is sunshine, bright green grass -- parts of it look like a park. There are places in the world that should be frozen in time because of the atrocities that took place there; but people in the town of Dachau are living their normal lives, buying coffee, having dates. It's hard to reconcile."

Often the teacher would teach to two students at the same time and it would often be the same pair. My lesson buddy was this younger boy (around 7-8 years old) who was so good at playing the violin, he was way ahead of me even tho he was years younger than me. 

I knew his mother was strict but one day the music school organised an event where students of all instruments would play for parents and locals (it was a fairly small village) along with some food served. Me and all other violin students played too, this boy played perfectly except one note, right after we all finished his mother stormed out of the crowed towards him and slapped him hard in front of everyone then proceeded to yell at him for doing one mistake.

The boy started to cry and she dragged him away, it's been 15 years but I'll never forget that..."

13721,"Oh boy....I made a throwaway account just for this. 

So when I met my wife and we were first dating, she asked casually in conversation if I'd ever tried drugs before and I said no......when in actual fact I was the biggest drug dealer in my city and the surrounding areas. 

I was out of the game by the time I'd met my wife, but before I met her I was a big time dealer of coke, mdma, E's etc but I never dealt in heroin or meth or anything like that. Pretty much just party drugs. 

I was fortunate and smart enough to have never been on the police's radar. I'd never even been so much as pulled over so after a few close calls I decided to quit while I was ahead. I literally turned my phone off one night and turned my back on that whole world. 

My brothers and a few close friends know what I used to do but no one else. 

As a result when I hear incorrect info on tv or someone talking shit about drugs I have to bite my tongue as not to let on that I know stuff. I've nearly dropped the ball once or twice when on TV the show said something like ""this cocaine has a street value of ¬£300'000"" I've instinctively gone ""and who the fuck is paying ¬£300,000 for half a kilo of cut Charlie when the going rate is ¬£40 a gram?"" The wife has turned and looked at me and said how do you know that? I just said you learn lots from Reddit haha 

She's never doubted that I've never tried drugs or dealt drugs because I'm a normal looking guy that has a regular job, is well spoken and has a nice family. 

I'd like to tell her that I've tried the odd thing on a night out just so I can change her misconceptions about some stuff but I'm too deep into the lie to come out now. "

By the time we got back to shore my friends said all the color had drained from my skin and I was ghost white. It was this weird feeling where every part of my body hurt but I couldn‚Äôt feel any part of my body like it wasn‚Äôt actually there. I remember grabbing my buddy‚Äôs hand and squeezing it as hard as I possibly could. He said it felt like I was barely squeezing later. Either way, as weak as it was that squeezing gave me something to focus on that wasn‚Äôt causing me to go into a full panic attack and make it worse. If you want to be alive and live through a moment like that you‚Äôll know it and you‚Äôll fight with every ounce you can muster. It‚Äôs not something you would question.

13739,"In a different context: when I was a youngin, I got sick all the dang time and was constantly running fevers. My mom would fill the bathtub with cold water and ice cubes to try to get my fever down and avoid the trauma of having to go to the ER (Urgent Care wasn't as big of a thing back then). I obviously haaaaated the ice baths but preferred it to going to the ER, so I'd get in. My dad would put on his bathing suit and sit with me in the tub, as a show of solidarity.

13746,"I heard a story like that from my neighbor. When her son was around 6 or 7, I guess, he would kick the blanket/uncover himself in his sleep because he got hot at night. And his mother would only cover him more after he fell asleep, or so he thought. After he told his mother not to come at night to cover him, the mother was shocked because she said she didn't do it anyway. So she didn't sleep for a night to see if the son was telling the truth. She said she saw a bride come at night to cover the son and disappear after that. They moved out immediately. "
13747,"...so what? 

Kids of all ages show up with their parents in the changing room here in Norway. It's common to see the dad and some 7-8 year old girl taking a shower naked in the men's changing room.

No one gives a shit. This idea that nudity is inherently sexual in every context is stupid. I used to swim every day and never saw a single person care about naked kids running around in the changing room."
13748,"Occasionally there are outliers who are single parents who use their child support to buy drugs, or Gucci bags while they feed their children bologna sandwiches. But they are outliers.

All of the single parents I know are working hard to provide for their children and most are trying to minimize their conflicts with their ex affects their children.

The only purpose this law would serve would be for harassment. Would you like to have your monthly spending analyzed? Say you bought a bottle of wine for a friend's birthday. Suddenly the auditor general is asking ""what is this 27 dollars at shoppers discount liquor? It is a month later. Can you remember.

On top of that, do you have any idea of the time involved in keeping track of this? I do. I am a handyman and have to process all of the receipts for my business expenses. And that would be tiny compared to the monthly household spending. Who is going to look over the reports? The ex? Because usually there is a reason they are an ex.

Some yet to be created government department? Because children's services is both not coping with current demand for their services and we regularly hear reports of known child abusers ""slipping through the cracks"" and ending up killing some child.

And you want to add to their case load?

Tl;dr No, this is a very bad idea. "

I told him, ‚Äúno, thank you‚Äù and continued walking again, he stepped off his porch and continued to try and get me to come in and I just walked faster and faster and never looked back.

13758,"My sister went missing a few years back. She'd been having a hard time with her boyfriend and was extremely worried she was going to fail that year in college. We both had spent a lot of time drinking and partying together. One Friday  night we went to a party and fell out at like 7am on the saturday morning because I wanted to go home and she didn't. I went to my boyfriends. She went to hers. On the Sunday afternoon I was studying and I got a phone call from her mum freaking out asking if I had seen her and obviously I said no. Then I got a call from the police asking me a bunch of questions. Turns out she broke up with her boyfriend, cleaned her room, took a bunch of her mum's painkillers and disappeared.  I spent the half the night out searching for her and half the night posting all over social media and talking to everyone she knew trying to find out if anyone knew anything. The next day the news broke online that a body had been found at a local park. I convinced myself it wasn't her it was just a coincidence. Then 35 minutes later  I got the confirmation it was her. I broke down on the spot. After a short nap I went to meet all of our friends and the people that she knew to go put flowers down. I spent the next two weeks completely numb and supporting everyone else and making sure everyone else was ok. I didn't cry again until the funeral. Got wasted on the night of the funeral. Quit college, spent 4 months straight sleeping and drinking and then all of a sudden found out I was 6 months pregnant. So yeah. Everyone involved has been completely destroyed by it a nd I don't think it has ever got easier for anyone. Our brother in particular barely leaves the house and is too ill to work even though its been a couple years. I didn't ever grieve properly and I'm still trying to deal with it now. My child was born happy and healthy thankfully despite me binge drinking for the first 6 months of my pregnancy And every single day I hate myself for our last conversation being an argument and I blame myself for what happened. So yeah."

--
We asked our daughter not to tell anyone that I was pregnant. But somehow the daycare workers seemed to know more than they should, so I asked her if she had told anyone that she was going to become a big sister. ""No. I only said that Mom had something secret in her belly that was going to be born"".

I bought a Christmas present for my husband with my three-year-old, and she loved that we now had a secret to keep.    
Three-year-old daughter to dad: ""We've bought a present for you that you get to open at Christmas.""    
She looks at me uncertainly. ""I can say 'present', right, but not 'pants'?""    
We assured her that she had understood everything correctly.

My four-year-old son to his dad: ""We have a present for you!""    
Me: ""I told you not to say anything!""    
My son, deeply offended: ""I didn't **say** it, I **whispered**!""    

--
My sister to our dad:    
""Do you know what your present is gonna be?""    
""No, and I don't want the surprise spoiled.""    
""But what if I just tell you *half* of it... you're going to get *one* shoe."""

13806,"I have a weird one that kind of fits

When I was 23, I went to a baseball game with my 19 year old girlfriend. I am very Mediterranean looking and she is clearly Asian. 

I brought her to the sign up tent for those between the innings games, and the fucking people told me ‚ÄúSorry, but all of the 12 and under games are booked. You can sign your daughter up next game.‚Äù

Then I got over it the next time i saw him coz I‚Äôm just not attracted to him. :( "
13813,"I mean as shitty as that is for her I'd say that's a relatively good outcome overall with that eventual encounter.  He was just deep in the closet and marrying her as a cover, but finally at least had something of decency before getting married for years and then breaking her heart even worse.

Not trying to defend him just bailing on her in any way, at least could have explained a little more in the note than just ""I can't marry you"". At that point though if you're just gonna bail you might as well give the person closure and explain she's been your beard and you're leaving because you can't go through with it now that it's getting too real, I'd rather at least get that explanation than my fiance just running out on me with no explanation whatsoever.  But from her side that would at least make me feel better and feel almost bad for the guy that he was that insecure that he was gonna get married because he was in that much insecurity and denial.  "

13846,"Yeah there's a weird trend on reddit of fetishizing the 'good old days' and how fucked the millennials are going to be in the future.  Life for most people in the past fucking sucked.  Countless people born into shit with no chance to leave the shit and who never expected anything but to die in the shit.  Miners, sailors, tradesmen, farmers, soldiers.  You were born into a life and you lived it.  Survivorship bias is a live and well and we remember a few exceptional lives and forget the countless children struck down by now-eradicated disease, or still countless more who survived to live hard, hard lives until their ungracious end.

Sure things aren't perfect today but at least you have some options, and typically the average person has career paths available to them, usually with clear and accessible entryways.  At least the concept of 'retirement' is something you can think about and attempt to plan for.  At worst, we are missing out on some of the benefits that some people from maybe one, two at most, previous generations got to enjoy.  Yeah, it sucks that some powerful forces took those things away, and we might have to work to get them back or pursue other avenues, but jesus people here make it seem a lot more dire than it is."

Enjoy the time you have with people, if they‚Äôre going to cheat or hurt you then they will, you can‚Äôt control that and you‚Äôre basically creating the feared result of them leaving you all by yourself even if your S/O is a saint.

I'd also add another problem that writing snobs seem to have ‚Äî giving unsolicited advice. If a writer hasn't asked for feedback or help, keep it to yourself. 

Being published doesn't make you a ""real"" writer. If you write, you're a writer, and you should keep writing if that's what makes you happy.

13950,"This was my family when I was younger, and I think it stunted me socially so I had more to learn in a shorter amount of time in my later teen years into my early twenties.

I lived in a nice middle-class neighborhood and wasn't aloud to leave my yard to go down the street and hang out with the other kids. They had to go to my house. On top of that, I wanted to do different extracurricular stuff in school (basketball, soccer, etc.) but I was always pulled out as punishment because I was one of those kids who never did their homework. So I didn't really have friends and I was at the bottom of the social ladder.

Eventually, due to my step-father going to jail and my mom unable to keep up with everything, I was able to do whatever I wanted and hang out with more people, socialize, and learn the skills I needed to become a ""normal"" person."

We never lived under the same roof or even saw her more than twice a week on weekends. She was only a stepmom on paper. Entertained the idea to leave a review on the websites she advertised as such but didnt want to get in the way of my dads happiness. So i told him i despised the idea of her doing it. At first he said that she is an actual therapist and 'technically qualified' to do so, so i left it for what it was. They apparently had a fight over it and she stopped doing it a few months later.

I would be sad that I could never age with my romantic partners. I would experience the pain of grief over and over again. I would get lonely without people I know I can rely on for my entire life. I would be disappointed to learn of all of humanity's failings in person. I may be sick of life's monotony after some time.

Not hospital's tissues get donated/sold. Some keep them for much, much longer than 10 years. Some gets used for research, some incinerated, some saved. Hospitals have tens of thousands of samples each year so it is expensive to dispose of them. Why not use them to help further research? "

After everything was done and doctor's spent a hour trying to ressesitate her because everyone thought that was her heart beat.

My teeth were horrendous when I was 7. Went to an orthodontist and stayed there for ten years! Temporary retainers, fixed retainers, in the end they installed some kind of wire on the back of my lower teeth that was supposed to stay infinitely.

I stopped going because they never did anything, just checked. Maybe a mistake. Unbeknownst to me, part of the wire broke, and a tooth started shifting again.

Went there again at the age of 20. They removed the wire and got me to wear a retainer again. Every night. Until I decided they can go fuck themselves because I stopped caring. If this was going to be a life-long thing, that's not fucking worth it.

I'm 28 now, off retainers for 7 years. Two teeth shifted a bit, then settled. I don't give a fuck. Started studying English with a focus on British anyway, so now at least I fulfill the British teeth clich√©. 

No ragrets (sic).

Edit: the great thing is, this was on my dad's private insurance. He pays 10% of the costs on dental work himself. This whole ordeal cost around 20,000 Euros. For him. Which means it cost 200,000 overall. What the fuck.

Edit 2: apparently, the whole situation is a bit more complicated. The deductible was variable, with the lowest being 20%, and for some methods, it went up to 80%. So we're at around 80,000 -- 90,000 bucks (since the 80% stuff was way rarer; most is 20%). Still, that's a metric tonne of money."

But still... We were in the process of cleaning the body up for his family to do a bedside memorial and this son came bursting in the door, saw all the coagulated dark red blood oozing from his father's mouth, and smelled the horrible odor it produced and said ""Looks like I missed a heck of a show! I hate traffic. Get any of the action on tape for me?""

This resident died horribly in my arms and was a close friend of mine after caring for him for over a year.

My assumption is that since they were labeled blood traitors, the pureblood wizarding world basically ganged up on them to reduce their wealth and standing until eventually they had very little left. We also know that Arthur's department isn't taken seriously in wizard society, so even his government job isn't all that great, and he's supporting (and has been supporting) a LOT of children (7) on that job, as well as Molly who doesn't earn a wage (despite working quite hard raising all these children).

14223,"Oh God I heard it years ago, so it's a bit hazy but it goes something like this:

 When the Romans conquered then built the first proper paved roads in Britain way back in the first couple of centuries AD, they used as a rule for the standard width of a road, a measurement based on the width of four mules backsides. The reason being that that would allow two mule drawn carts - usually pulled by two mules abreast - to pass by each other. 

These were the only decently paved straight roads in the kingdom and were not matched for nearly two millennia,  and the size set the standard for any future roads.

 But before even road building was widespread to a semi decent standard, the railways came along in the mid 19th century. They, quite naturally, used the standard width of a Roman road as the size of the rail bed for their tracks which in turn largely governed what gauge the track could be.

Seeing as British railway engineers were the only ones around, when railroads started to be built in the US they used British engineers at first and adopted British standards of gauge for the tracks.

Fast forward to the 1970s when the Space Shuttle was being developed, parts were manufactured all over the US and were to be shipped to Florida and assembled at the launch site. 

The transportation was mostly by rail, especially for the very large bits of the shuttle. The designers were aware of the size limitations of the railroads and limited the size and weight of any component to something that could be comfortably sent by freight over the railroad network.

""What's that?"" 


""Oh, that's the next door neighbors' house."" 


He then proceeds to ask what everything is on and around the house and I answer him.


""I want to go look. I want to touch it."" 



I explain we can't touch it because it doesn't belong to us. Can we compromise? How about we go outside and we can look at it just a little bit closer from our yard. 


""That's a good idea, yes,"" he says. 



So I pick him up and we venture outside. On the way to the front door he cuddles in close, pats me gently on the back and says, ""You're a good friend (my name).""

14374,"When I taught we had a Math teacher whose kid was in the same school. I taught an AP course that required you to sign up for by a certain date, and you had to meet me to get a sign up sheet (went over the course description and expectations, and the student and parent had to sign that they read it to cover my ass after another parent created drama over their kid‚Äôs C grade). It is a VERY hard class, and I didn‚Äôt teach down to them, so many kids who took it the first year I taught it ended up dropping because they expected ‚Äúslightly harder tests but weighted grade‚Äù and were shocked to find it was ‚Äúalmost all essay tests.‚Äù

Anyway, simple requirements. Get the form from me, then read it and have a parent read it, sign it and return it by a certain date. All counselors told kids who wanted to take my class this was a requirement. We made announcements every morning and I included this. I put signs all over the school for this requirement. Kids knew. 

Teacher‚Äôs kid wanted in my class. Never met me. Never got the sheet. Never signed up. I just heard other kids tell me he was bragging that he didn‚Äôt have to do all that ‚Äúsign up bullshit‚Äù because his mom would ‚Äúhandle it.‚Äù

Smash cut to last two weeks of school. Kid‚Äôs mom comes in and says her son wants in my AP class. I tell her sign ups ended a month ago, I‚Äôve already met with the class to discuss my expectations (again, giving kids every opportunity to know how hard I made the class so they could drop if they felt the need too), and it was far too late. She just said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù

She complained to my department head (he laughed at her and said no, he was awesome and gave no fucks, and HATED this woman), the assistant principal (he tried to play peacemaker but still wouldn‚Äôt let her kid in), and the principal, who was the one who TOLD me to put all those steps in due to difficulties with the AP kids I already had, so no dice with him.

She went to the superintendent who backed the principal. Finally, she went the school board members. She eventually got a couple of school board members to show up and pressure the principal who in turn pressured me to put him in the class on the last day of school.

Finally defeated, I said ok. I need to see him. It‚Äôs the last day of school. She said fine and brought him to me after school was over the last day.

I gave him everything I gave the other kids at the previous meeting. Here is where it got fun. This included a summer assignment. A series of historical readings with the student writing about what they read, the subject, and a paragraph description of the reading (writing about a page per reading). There were 10 readings to complete over the summer and due on day one of the following school year (all approved by the principal BTW). Kid went white as a sheet when he realized what he got into. Started stammering that maybe it wasn‚Äôt for him. He didn‚Äôt want a class that gave homework over the summer, maybe it was a mistake. His mom tried to reassure him, but he clearly wanted no part of that class.

Funny post script: took another job over the summer, washed my hands of that whole politically bullshit school and teaching altogether (get paid 30k a year to spend 12 hours a day teaching and grading? Fuck that.) but the teacher who took over AP? The department head who gave no fucks about parents, hated the mother, and was an even more harsh grader than me."

My advice, using a compass and grids may seem hard and complicated but it isn't. Dont let it overwhelm you. For travel distance just get a good feel for how fast you move on a regular hike or march. Don't worry about counting paces and all that. That's used for scavenger hunts. You want to get close enough to see you destination. Just walk a known mile at your normal pace and time it. Then you start to develop a feel for how far you've gone over time. As for getting your bearings it's easy. Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Find sometujtn flat like a tree stump. Get that compass pointing north and then get a relative bearing. Turn the dial to point the bearing and as long as you keep the needle north you will be close enough to see the objective. That's all there is to it. The maps are usually good enough to determine your grid coordinates based on what you see. Find you objective? OK what direction is it in? Where is the sun? Now you know if you are north, south, east or west of it. Take note of the ground. Look at the map. What matches up with where you are standing? That's your location.

When I was in boy scouts my dad and I got separated from our crew. I had to take a shit and they were dumbasses and didn't wait where they were supposed to. Had to get our asses to the next base camp in the middle of the desert by basic land nav. It was over 100 degrees and we ran out of water half way through but we did it. Somehow managed to pass the the rest of our crew an hour in without seeing them. I had heat exhaustion but land nav saved my life. If I can do it half delirious in the sand box so can you. You'll do fine. Learn your pace and get used to taking relative bearings. "

14409,"Damn dude. I know I'm hitting a hornets nest here, but I don't think you can tell the difference between American Propoganda and Russian Propoganda... Actually, just Propoganda in general.

Yeah, of course the EU likes to laugh at us for being backwards. In contrast to American, most countries in the EU lean left, progressive, compared to our *very* far right conservative views. Makes sense in context, dont'cha think?

As far as Garmany relying on Russia for fuel, a ***lot*** of countries rely on Russia for fuel, but Germany's case is a bit special, so I'll give you that, unless someone can fill in more information.

&gt; ""What if instead of donating to charity funds to the EU, we focused on our own infrastructure or put money into healthcare or education?"" 

Let's unpack this one; we (the American government) don't donate money willy-nilly like that. No, instead, it's a beurocratic nightmare. Actual straight donations to the EU are, for the most part, done privately, as with *many many* things in the US. Your point on focusing on our own infrastructure is an extremely valid one, and one I agree with bipartisanly, but unfortunately for us, most (actually almost nearly, depending on who you ask) of our infrastructure is privatized.

""So, cool, right, let the free market fix our problems!"" Not so fast. The reason our infrastructure sucks *isn't* because we don't have the resources to fix it; we absolutely fucking do. Its ~~ironically~~ *because* the system is privatized that we have these issues. The corporations running our infrastructure would much rather cheap out wherever they can ***NOT*** in the name of efficiency, but in the name of the bottom line. Furthermore, we've *tried* fixing our own problems. Unfortunately, we allow ~~bribery~~ massive lobbying donations in our government, so until that stops, and these people are held accountable, and actually invest some of their profits to make America great again, we (the people) will always be less important than our money.

And I hear you thinking ""Well, isn't Europe's infra also privatized?"" Yes, it is, but the reason they can get away with that is because it's so damn regulated (which is a separate, but much lesser issue; it's a *good* issue to have, if you can believe it.)

I agree with you on focusing on ourselves *first*; first and only are not mutually exclusive to each other. But I wouldn't call waging a trade war and breaking diplomatic ties with nearly every nation on Earth 'reasonable' for any reason short of impending war.

We backed out of the Paris Accords because Trump didn't like the fact that other countries didn't cut down on coal as much as we did. This was a stupid argument at the time, and it still is now; nearly countries in the EU *combined* don't use as much coal as we do. He later tried to back it up with the fact that we were paying the most into it. Okay, shitty business play, but nevertheless one that Trump did frequently *well before* he was president, of businesses that he bankrupted. He managed to turn multi-billion dollar companies into million dollar companies. Several times. Trump is not a smart businessman.

&gt; ""But being a fan of your contry is 'lame'""

Hey, can you separate your patriotism from your nationalism? Thanks.

&gt; ""That mindset is truly a luxury only spoiled first-world citizens can have...""

Nice projecting there. Yes, it is.

&gt; ""...especially with as many freedoms and positive things that we do get to have here.""

...the things that nearly every other country in Europe, in this day and age, have, except ours suck more. Europe isn't a shithole collection of nations, mate. Ask any serviceman who's been overseas, the reaction is pretty similar to ""Wow, I thought America was supposed to be amazing, and that everywhere else sucked."" America isn't Top Dog anymore; we haven't been for a *long* time. Countries the size of one of our states are standing up to us because the world is sick of our bullshit.

As for the whole Brexit thing; I'm absolutely positive neither of us are qualified to talk about how much of a shitshow that was. Also as a note, the UK wants back in; I don't think they really wanted to leave, just make a political statement."

You can also get an order to keep your children from spending the night at the same dwelling with this man. You can even get orders that he can‚Äôt visit them during certain hours of the day.

This is not legal warfare? Because of a name on some forms? How to use this to get custody, how to get other men away from his ex, and those other men are probably pedos anyway.

Half-baked ideas that needed years of editing are being published after the first draft. 

I'm not exaggerating: I review books on the side to make some extra cash, and some I can't even make past the first page because they never had the book copy edited. Once read a book so poorly formatted half the sentences were sliced off on the end. I told the author it was unreadable, and she said: ""Oh, I didn't think it happened that often.""

So most of the time when a family is being split up and the kid is taken away... the child just becomes some random anonymous farm laborer on another planet.

My bedroom is on a corner, and the guest room is right next to it, and my sister's bedroom is on the other side. For some reason, that morning, I was getting something from the guest room and as I walked in, I heard my sister say something as she was walking into her room. I was busy so I thought if it's important she'd just repeat herself. Within a second of me hearing it, my sister turns around and says ""wait, what did you say? I didn't hear you properly."" We had heard the same thing, at the same time, but neither of us had said anything. I just sort of mumbled ""Nothing"" even though I was freaked out. When we were on the bus, I told her that I had heard the voice too. She said that except for asking me what I said, she hadn't said anything. To this day, she claims that she really wasn't messing with me, and that she definitely heard something. We told our parents when they got home from work that day, and my mom said that it was probably a neighbour or something. But here's the thing. To me, it sounded like my sister, and to my sister, it sounded like me, and we have totally different accents to the rest of our neighbours (we're South Africans, living in New Zealand), so that was sort of ruled out as an option. My sister, who's a total skeptic says that that was the only time anything creepy that happened in our house (there have been a few uhh instances) has really creeped her out."

It scared me because we lived in a sketchy neighborhood and my mom hammered stranger danger in my head. So I ran inside and told my mom what happened. She said I was overreacting. The van drove by again with the guy looking all around and I pointed it out to my mom. It worries me that I may have come close to being kidnapped.

Well, said grandson doesn't have many toys there, for whatever reason, so my daughter always brings out an assortment of toys for them to play with. Stuffed animals, bubbles, chalk, whatever.

They were sitting on the edge of the yard, happily playing together, and the grandson had one of my daughter's barbies in his hand. The next thing I know, my neighbor is SCREAMING from her porch:

"" Poor Little Kid's Name  YOU PUT THAT DOLL DOWN RIGHT NOW!!! WHAT ARE YOU A LITTLE GIRL? DON'T MAKE ME TELL YOUR MOM!""

I was mortified. We pretty much let our kid play with whatever she wants that won't maim or kill her. All of our friends are the same way, so I nearly forgot how fucking stupid adults can be over CHILDREN'S toys.

14638,"We were eating at Golden Corral. Not really a place we like to go very often, in part because of the food, in part because of the clientele. After we all finish eating we are sitting there just talking. My son is about 15 months or so at the time. This woman comes up and just stands over him, without saying a word, and stares down at him while my wife is holding him. He looks up at her and smiles to her. She stares for a couple more seconds to the point I am about to tell her to just fucking leave, when she says ""Your child is Christ reborn. He is a blessed boy."" Then she looks at my wife and says ""Cherish him. Your next child will be Satan reborn. And one will have to kill the other."" Then she just walked off without another word. We all just sat there in fucking shock.

Joke's on her. He's two now and is definitely more Satan than Christ."

14645,"I was working graveyards at a restaurant that was working me to death. To save labor they were making me cook, clean up the mess from sending all the other cooks home early and wash dishes. I was only supposed to work 10 hours but the general manager was always late so ten hours stretched to 12 or 14. At the end of the shift I freakin stank but was so exhausted I just wanted to sleep. I lived 25 minutes from the restaurant, I start seeing this guy and he offers to let me stay at his place in the mornings to rest. I accept, knock out in his bed stinking like restaurant and wet feet. I wake up to him bringing me tea and quietly watching t.v. as not to wake me. I'm like apologizing because I stink saying I probably reak like pancakes (it was an IHOP) he says ""no you smell like French fries, but it's okay. "" offers to make me breakfast before he goes to work. 

Just a completely different experience, I always had boyfriends who bagged on me or said rude things to me and me working my ass off was just expected, they usually were unemployed or part time employed while I did everything. Nobody ever made me tea or breakfast or cared that I was exhausted. It's a small thing but it meant a lot to me. A month later my dog of 5 years had a freak accident and had to be put down and he was there for me through all of that and I was a horrible mess. He took it all in stride and even checked in with my mother to tell her I was okay when I could barely pick up a phone from grief.

Now married with a 6 month old baby, and he works 2 jobs so I can stay home with our son. Still he comes home and asks if I need anything and has never told me no when I ask for anything. I really got lucky there.  "
14646,"Protestantism is, ideologically, very capitalist. I'll quote an article that is not exactly on this subject, but it has a passage that is relevant to the point:

&gt; Protestantism armed the rising capitalist class with an ideological weapon to attack the ideas that justified the feudal social hierarchy as ordained by God. In contrast to the tight social control exercised by the Catholic Church, Protestant ideology promoted the possibility of a personal relationship with God unmediated by the Catholic hierarchy. This ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of Christianity meant that every aspect of Catholic ideology was now up for debate. New Protestant sects proliferated criticizing the supposed divinity of feudal society from new, and often competing, interpretations of the Bible.

&gt; The Calvinist Protestant sect reflected the rising capitalist class‚Äôs economic interests in the most straightforward way. Friedrich Engels described it as ‚Äúfit for the boldest of the bourgeoisie of his day.‚Äù The Calvinist ideas of ‚Äúpredestination‚Äù and ‚Äúa calling from God‚Äù made the highest virtue of the accumulation of wealth as a sign of God‚Äôs favor.

14652,"Serious question, how is Queer not covered by Gay and Bisexual?

They pooled their money together but din't realize their was tax on the pizza so after the person at the register told them this, they decided to just split some breadsticks instead.  I liked seeing these three kids - one black, one white, one hispanic, coincidentally - all just getting along and not getting upset *in the slightest* when they found out they couldn't afford the pizza - so I decided to buy them a pizza, and some soda, just because.  

Now maybe some people would find that creepy - but I think there's a big difference between seeking out kids to give things that you have with you vs. buying some kids something at a retail place... kindness still exists in this world."

14799,"I was born in 87. Teaching college now vs when I was in college 2005-09 there's a huge difference, but I would say its toward increased politeness. The students are all respectful, ask permission if they're not going to be in class, take school seriously, and pay attention. I remember people being far less polite when I was a student.   


That also squares with what I saw when I was working retail. If you're going to have a problem customer, they were probably born before 1970.   


I suspect that there are competing notions of what polite means. You can say please and thank you, but still enforce enforce strict social roles by talking down to people in retail situations. I'd consider that impolite, even if the right words are used. Likewise a I might see a younger person not say ""thank you,"" in a situation I would expect them to, but go out of their way to treat everyone like an equal. "

I've been on birth control since I was 13, and I'm almost 20 now. What am I even supposed to do? The birth control is also potentially causing the visual migraines, but there's no treatment for PCOS that doesn't involve amping up my estrogen and putting me at a stroke risk.

14962,"This might have been the reason your grandmother up and left. I'm not saying it justifies her leaving in any way.

My grandmother is in her 70's and has vascular dementia, and my mom is basically the only person in our family that will visit her or do anything for her. She has a caretaker living there, but she's lazy and doesn't even clean the house. My cousin, who's basically her adopted daughter, never visits or brings her kids around so my grandmother can see her great-grandchildren. My cousin's father, my mom's brother, lives just a couple miles from where we do, and the most he does is mow the yard and leave. My grandfather died of cancer in 2006. I live 900 miles away during the better part of the year, and my dad works 12-hour swing shift, so that really limits our ability to help. She has countless doctor's appointments, both general practice and neurology checkups. Her medicines have to be picked up and placed in an automatic dispenser. Her coumadin must be checked every week or so. Neither of them does a thing, either to help with her care or to improve her quality of life during what are, most likely, her final and (like you said) most vulnerable years of her life.  


Sometimes it makes me really upset. But sometimes I think it boils down to the fact that they really don't want to see her like this, and I can understand that part. What I can't understand is not having the gall to get over one's own selfish/pain-avoiding tendencies and leaving an individual to suffer through this disease, basically, alone.  


TL;DR She could have left because she couldn't bear to see him deteriorate. But that doesn't excuse her doing it, not one bit."

14987,"The remaining 1%, which accounts for roughly 10% of my supervision, are good people who have earned their place where they're at through merit, good attitude and ethic, and genuine caring for their brothers-in-arms.  They are the people that go out of their way to remember details about the Little A (the junior enlisted tier of airman.  e.g. the grunts).  It shows a lot when a SNCO remembers me and a conversation we may have had a few weeks prior in a breakroom.  

Something as simple as ""Hey, good to see you Airman Tickler, how'd your volunteer op go?""

'G'morning Mas Sarnt, it went pretty well, we had a great turn out.'

""That's good to hear, keep it up.""  And then a head nod from both and we're on our way.  That is how you establish rapport with your airmen.  It doesn't take much effort.  You can't ignore people you pass in the hall, or remain strictly business 100% of the time and then expect to make it up at a Flight Call with a useless piece of paper as a commendation you didn't even write.  That's like a biological father coming to visit you once a year and giving you a little gift and expecting you to revere him like the father figure he thinks he is.  Not cool.

Ideally I'd say a SNCO or even a shop NCO should be spending 10% of their day just -talking- to their airmen (I say airmen specifically because I can only speak for MY experience).  The disconnect between tiers is insane, there is literally nothing I would come upfront and speak to ANY of my NCOs about unless it pertains to work.

You don't care what I'm doing this weekend.  I don't care to tell you.  You won't ask.  It's business, business, business.  ""Did you finish 360 day on BDTS 6?  Is the CRT bezel installed?  Be sure to sign off your suspenses in TBA.""  These are necessary conversations to have, but they are the ONLY conversations we have.  There is a lot of down time during my work where I'm passively monitoring something where you can take three minutes out of your day to commend me for doing something, or ask something about me personally.

""I saw you fixed that ESCDU two days sooner than ETC, good job - what ended up being the issue?""  Show me that you notice my efforts on more than a bullshit bullet format.  Allow me to verbally tell you what I've learned and how I've come to troubleshoot my units.  Let my growth be organic and be a part of it, it's not fucking hard.

Six out of seven of my shop NCOs spend at least five hours a day hiding in their office pretending to be hard at work.  There are places you can be on the floor assisting or offering guidance.  You are still an airman.  You can still help.  You make a difference when you make yourself a friendly, professional presence to offer guidance to your airman.

Sick of seeing the complacency and ""Fuck you, got mine"" attitude.  "
14988,"It's not my or ANYONE else's responsibility to be any less disgusted by the crimes these people commit. I was abused as a kid, do you see me abusing other kids? No. Because fuck that. Because even if I DID have those thoughts ( which, I personally do not ), I'd rather shut myself off from the rest of the world if need be than EVER put ANYONE ELSE what I went through.




I have violent intrusive thoughts. They're hard to talk about, I get judged whenever I try to discuss them with someone I trust. It's something extremely difficult to handle, but have I killed anyone yet? Do I immediately jump on everyone I think sexually about? No and no. They can control themselves and seek help, millions of people with similar issues do it daily. She chose instead to ruin a kid's life and for that. She chose to become a teacher, knowing about her attraction. She chose to act on it. She can rot in Hell for all I care.

I think it is different, but your life and mental health is still fucked over by rape and the aftermath. Doesn't end in jail time in the US, although in some parts of the world you do get stoned to death for being a slut. Then there was that girl in Central America that was forced to carry her rapists baby to term and had a still born. She was sentenced to jail for not seeking prenatal care. I'm sure there were people who didn't believe her too, that thought she was a selfish mother, ect. So I think false accusations are a huge threath to both sides.

Sometimes you have to improvise or do what you have to to keep someone alive until they can make it to definitive care. 1 hour ago a single nurse and I had to take care of a coding patient. Arrived with no access and CPR in progress. Coded for a bit, got rosc.  Intubated, central line, on pressors, placed on IV abx. Lab calls with a lactate of 10. Xr with a r lung whiteout. Oh and I'm also the RT here, so gotta keep an eye on vent settings. Now loaded up and flying to a tertiary care center. Oh wait. Also had to go run a floor code (again with a single nurse) and get another helicopter here to get someone else to an ICU.

There would be no religious fundamentalists (or if there were, then if anything they'd be fighting *for* your plans).  

Unless you're an evil bastard you could sculpt a utopia that would be thriving in a golden age thousands of years before any time period we today have clear records of.  12,000 years without (hopefully) wars, poverty, and the emergence of social classes.  Not to mention how you'd almost certainly have advanced health care that would eliminate terrible diseases long before, in our present history, people were doing more than shamanistic rituals.  Bonus:  you wouldn't have anyone suggesting that vaccinations are immoral, either.

You could really be that ""Benevolent Dictator"" concept some philosophers argue might be the best form of government for human societies.  

I guess what it would come down to is whether or not the immortal person in question would be of morally sound character, whether or not they would be able to stand the test of time without going mad, and also whether or not they could avoid being tied to a stone and tossed into a lake by superstitious primitives before getting any serious work underway."

 You'd eventually become jaded, full of self loathing and a strong distaste for your fellow man. Eventually life and death begin to lose meaning, and after a time you'd have everything you could ever want at your fingers but not the will to take any of it. Your only desire would be for a reprieve from the monotony of existence, and the desperate lust for the end.

 Death is a constant for all but you, and soon it is no longer a thing to be feared, nor a thing to look forward to. It is now, out of all other aspects of the world, the one state of being you'd never know. What is money, power, life, and sexual gratification in the face of perpetual, unending existence?"

I don't work in the healthcare system (I work at a specialty shoe store owned by orthopedic surgeons) but more than half of our customer base are patients that have been sent over by the docs because their feet/lower legs are hurting them in some form or fashion. 

In my position, people don't really pay attention if I start talking about wellness and lifestyle. I don't usually mention it unless they bring it up first honestly. But it's super important that people realize that most of the pain you're feeling in your legs and feet can probably be attributed to your weight. They're the foundation of your whole body, of course they're gonna struggle with too much weight. Just like any other support system on Earth. "

No family, friends, visitors at all. She minded her own buisiness, stayed in her room unless she went out side to sit on the porch or the dining area for meals. She had some common conditions such as hypertension and heart disease. Well she would refuse all of her medications d.t believing we were poisoning her. She was perfectly pleasant unless you invaded her space, house keeping wasn't able to step foot into her room to clean it because she would attack them.

 She also hadn't bathed or changed clothes in 2 YEARS. When we would ask her if she wanted a shower she would say she had taken one at 3am or something but it was beyond obvious she hadn't. She had smoke caked onto her face from where she would occasionally smoke. She smelled to high heaven and I don't know of you have ever seen clothes that had been worn continuously for 2 years but they were pretty worn out and stained. I remember she worse a wine red t shirt and blueish fleece  Tweety pj bottoms. She would get clothes donated on holidays but would reject them because she didn't want to owe anyone anything. We would try every day to get her to shower or change her clothes and she would refuse Everytime. Well. One day she said she would. On MY shift. I was so damn happy I pulled the aide for that hall told her she was to give her a spa level bath experience and while she was doing that I snuck into her room and grabbed those old clothes and tossed them into a bag to be cleaned (would have thrown them away but what if they belonged to someone important?) I then drove to Walmart as fast as I possibly could and bought her 3 sets of new pj bottoms and t shirts. When I got back to the facility she was cleaned and was just so damn grateful when I showed her what I had gotten her. I remember her saying ""thanks Kristy this means a lot"" AND HUGGED ME. I was so damn proud I was telling every one!

 I only work weekends so this all happened on Sunday and the next Saturday I came into work to be told she had a massive heart attack while taking a shower during the week at 3am all alone and they didn't find her in time. I was so damn heart broken. She was finally coming around and making a positive change but I guess life doesn't care about that. To little, to late I guess. No family or friends to notify.

This means when you finally get back to present day, you won't recognize anything. This isn't a scenario where you can go and memorize some lotto numbers or stock tickers and cash in last minute.

That being the case, it only makes sense to advance humanity as much as possible, so that when present day rolls around, you'll have something even better than before.

You'd have to start by seeding things like farming, writing, sanitation etc. Then build on that by uniting productive areas into larger nations, and go from there. Maybe become an adviser that goes in and out of courts and brings marvels. Introduce people to the art of inquisition through science.

In the full video you can see a lot of ""the  first followers"" not being able to ignite the fire. It takes time (5 minutes at least) to make everyone notice this guy and also see some first followers fail. You start to feel sry for the shirtless dude and hesitate to do it yourself. Then the real first follower just comes in just as (and let's be true here) the BANGER SONG hits. 
Perfect timing. Other people join to this song and because everyone knows why everbody over there is dancing so furiously the ""secret viewership"" starts storming in like an avalanche of love.

15264,"""Its not even the childs property."" I don't like this argument. Yes, the parents have the _right_ to check their kids phone, but that doesn't make it right. They also have the right to hit their children (in most places, and technically in a disciplinary way but still), but it doesn't mean you should. 

Treat others how you want to be treated, yes? Would you want others to know everything you search and do, especially as a teenager who is learning and undoubtly stumbling upon new things? Imagine they find out you invaded their privacy, how could they ever trust you again? If you want to be there to offer help and guidance you have to let them come to you. Forcing yourself on them and being browsing their phone will only foster mistrust and push them further away. 

I also feel you aren't doing them any good by  ""supervising"" their phone. What exactly do you think you're going to protect your kid from? Porn, alcohol, weed, the occasional bad friends? If they need help and guidance with those things they should trust you enough to go to you anyway. And you can always bring those topics up if you're concerned.

I genuinely see no tangible benefit to digitally supervising your kid. Its paranoid, invasive, weak, and hurtful. The reasoning you gave is desperate, blatantly disconsiderate, and screams the iconic ""because I told you so"" parenting mindset. I hope you reconsider your approach."

The US has absolutely no fucking place to bitch about any country violating international law, the sovereignty of a nation or tampering in foreign politics. They're hands are dirtier than anyone's in that respect.

I personally think that depression levels aren't necessarily increasing, but awareness and talk about mental illness is. Whereas in the past you'd have kids who didn't know why they felt the way they did, now we have a generation who is more open about mental illness, and therefore the amount of people being diagnosed will increase because more people will take their problems to a doctor rather than keeping them bottled up."

I consider myself something of a hotshot at public speaking, so I write a standup comedy routine, which is harder to pull off well than something inspirational or informative. Five minutes of material. 

One of the jokes has a throwaway line about a birth defect. When I wrote it, I specifically made up a fake birth defect: being born with octopus tentacles. I wouldn‚Äôt want to make fun of a real birth defect - it‚Äôs not funny and it‚Äôs not nice. 

So it‚Äôs showtime. Bunch of guests. I start into it and one of the students is in a wheelchair. Strapping guy, nice guy, affable, from what I know of him. But I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúshit, how did he get in that wheelchair...? Was it a birth defect?‚Äù It occurs to me that the *idea* of a birth defect is itself unfunny and inappropriate as a joke. So I stumble and try to skip the joke. But the whole god damn comedy bit spooled off of it. So I stumbled for a solid minute trying to pick up somewhere sensible - that‚Äôs an incredible amount of time to stop speaking in front of a polite, attentive audience - wondering also, is there some other ultra-offensive thing I‚Äôve planned to say? While they‚Äôre all watching. And then I just sat down.

Instead, tell them ""You can do anything, because you're a hard-worker."" This teaches them that if they don't succeed at first, that they can always achieve things with extra effort.

15458,"I wasn't the accused, but I experienced some of the fallout from it.

This happened years ago, back when I was a substitute teacher. I was subbing for a resource teacher (basically, someone who helps middle and high school students if they're struggling with math or reading or whatever), and during this particular hour of the day I was doing what's called a 'push-in', where the resource teacher goes into the actual classes and assists their students (usually a group of 4 or 5 of them in the same section of math or whatever) during the actual class. I was later called in for questioning by the school because that particular teacher was accused of inappropriately touching a student during that class the day I was subbing. They grilled me on it pretty hard and were like ""if you're being pressured to cover for him, don't worry, we'll protect you."" I honestly hadn't seen anything inappropriate, and I just keep telling them that.

As it turns out the girl was doing it to get attention from her mom (basically her mom did the 'oh you poor thing' and gave her whatever she wanted because mom thought her daughter had been abused and felt guilty about it) and the charges were dropped. I felt horrible for that teacher though, even though I told the school I hadn't seen anything that part didn't make it into the rumors that the kids told their parents. He got treated like shit for months after that."

It was a bit of a tradition for the senior classes, I know it happened a few years before me and it was still going two years later when my sister graduated. Our game never officially ended either, but it did lead to a couple particularly fun stakeouts with friends to help them get their targets. My favourite was helping my kindergarten best friend whom I didn't get to spend a lot of time with (we ended up in different friend groups) get his target. We hid in the back of my family SUV that had very tinted windows and waited at the train station for his target to return from a trip into the city. I'll never forget the pure joy as he sprinted full-tilt towards his target and she tried to run but he got her in the end. Ah, memories."

Also my mom is making my dress and a friend who is a dessert caterer offered (more like ""decreed,"" really, but I was happy to accept) to make the cake as her wedding present to us.  In the end the most expensive part of the entire wedding will be my ring, which is pulling double duty as both engagement and wedding band.

I work in pro av and have had to throw away a few really poorly made HDMI leads because they just can't handle the use.

He hugs me and tells me he loves me but it's not quite the same. He is just a very quiet, to himself kind of person. He has always been that way. Doesn't share emotions well even if I ask him.. That sort of thing. His way of showing he cared was to get me the things I wanted when I was younger. Of course I'm grateful for him, I just wish he could share his feelings with me more openly. I still love him immensely but the emotional connection just isn't anywhere near as strong as with my mom who was home with me my entire life. I wouldn't trade either of my parents for the world."

A little too soft? Does letting them do this, but not do this affect them? What is too tough for one kid is just right for the other. Punishments aren't effective on all children, and need to be tailored individually.

You want to raise your kids to be moral, kind, respectful, with a desire to learn and to be a hard-worker. How you accomplish that for each kid, there are no right answers in my opinion.

But definitely agree with you, you wouldn't really know until they are older. My mom made some mistakes, she will admit it as we just talked about it the other day. I will make some mistakes as well. But we just do the best we can."

&gt;‚ÄúWater is, of course, the most important raw material we have today in the world. It‚Äôs a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. **The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution.** The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value. Personally, I believe it‚Äôs better to give a foodstuff a value so that we‚Äôre all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water, and there are many different possibilities there.‚Äù"

Now the state attorney general's office has a whole campaign educating the public and encouraging them to call the cops if they suspect anything because it's better to be wrong than for someone to be enslaved a moment longer.

15610,"The myth that humans all ""start out female"" is wrong on multiple levels, but it pops up all the time on reddit.

You start out genetically male or female and phenotypically undifferentiated (like a universal template). That's why males have nipples and a raphe down the center of the scrotum, and females have an itty bitty peen.

edit: ""itty bitty peen"" was for comedic effect. The penis and clitoris are differentiated structures (a penis isn't internally bifurcated and a clitoris doesn't have a urethra running through it and doesn't ejaculate, etc). My point was that they stem from a common undifferentiated precursor in human development. And *that's* why a clit can resemble a tiny penis, why it's so far north, and it's arguably why an erectile erogenous structure exists in women at all... evolution prefers to tinker with existing materials, rather than invent new things entirely.

15617,"I'm going to point this out too - you keep saying 'I want to be with my kind' like it's something separate/special.

I don't know where you got the impression that it's ok to view it that way, but you need to probably stop that line of thinking.  It sounds more like you're falling for the line of thinking that most people who want to visit reservations do - that it's a place of great culture and a path back to the roots - it's not.  It's just people, living their lives.

'Your kind' is who you grew up with, whether you like it or not.  Going to hang out with relatives on a res isn't going to get you access to what you want.  You'll always be an outsider, MORESO if you tell them you want to 'be with your kind'.

Definitely see your family, get to know them, because that is important.  You want to know who you are and where you come from and that's important to.  And visiting is a good first step.  They are your people and you should want to know more.

But just understand that you're not going to find some major path to your roots by doing this.  You will ALWAYS be an outsider, no matter what you do.  I'm trying to not sugar-coat this because you seem to have some understanding that's going to be very contrary to what is actually going to happen.  You didn't grow up there, you weren't a part of the culture to begin with, and that's just how it is.

Not to say they won't be welcoming - they will, hopefully.  And hopefully they'll have some folks they can introduce you to who will help you find what you're looking for.  Just don't expect sudden culture immersion at any point now or in the far future - there's a good chance you'll never get that, unless you spend decades participating in their society and working for the tribe in a government-type capacity.

EDIT: That was a lot of gloom.  I didn't want it to end like that.  So here's some not-gloom.  Go visit your family.  Get to know some folks as much as you can in a couple of days.  Then ask if you can possibly visit during a feast celebration, if there are any coming up at another point when you can visit.

You'll enjoy one of those a lot, especially if you have family showing you everything.  It's a great way to see ceremonies, dances, hear stories, and just generally get a good taste of everything in a day or two."

1:  Ok, so when I was about 9-12, I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw death itself. When we were younger, my sister and I shared a room. We both slept in a bunk bed, me on the bottom and her on top. One night, I‚Äôm jolted awake by my mom (mom would stay with us until we fell asleep) and sister standing 1 ft from the doorway from inside my room holding each other‚Äôs hand, and someone I don‚Äôt recognize on the other side in the hallway. I don‚Äôt remember much, other than it looked like a pterodactyl‚Äôs head turned sideways superimposed on a torso. It was at least 6ft tall, all black, opaque and horrifying. And at that point all I could smell was a sulfuric/rotten egg smell. The next morning, I asked my sister if she had any weird dreams and if she ‚Äúsaw the dinosaur‚Äù. It‚Äôs been almost 10 years and neither of us can forget it. 

2: This one isn‚Äôt scary, really. My grandma (dad‚Äôs mom) died about 10 years ago. After her property was divided up between my dad and his brothers, one of the things of hers my dad brought home was her home phone set. One evening, less than a week after her viewing/funeral we get a phone call. Now, on a home phone, caller id shows who‚Äôs calling. This call didn‚Äôt. I mean the green backlight lit up, but there was no name or any sort of indication of who it might be. I answered the call, only to discover that my (now deceased) grandma was on the phone and wants to tell me and my sister that she loves us and misses us, and that she wants to talk to my dad (her and my dad had been close since he was little). I don‚Äôt remember what she said to him, and I don‚Äôt think he ever told us.

He said he had feelings for me and that he had to distance himself from our family because he didn't want to hurt me, as I was only a child. I didn't know how long ago he had sent the letter, but I had realized he hadn't been around as much lately.

15662,"Just to expand on this, 

The main protagonist is a young teenaged boy who is given the duty of checking up on all the worlds. When it's time for him to go, his ring lights up or something and he goes to a cave portal in Brooklyn to go to the different dimensions. His main antagonist is a shapeshifter named Saint Dave (or something), who seeks to bring about the ruin of all civilization in a quest to bring about ultimate chaos and anarchy because ultimate freedom or whatever. 

In each book, both arrive at a turning point in a civilization's history, with Pendragon fighting for peace, and Saint Dave fighting for disorder, except I think the protagonist doesn't know for certain what the problem is until he learns more as time goes on, so expect a few bits of foreshadowing and red herrings. Among the many civilizations, there's first, second, and third earth, i.e. past, present, and future, where all 3 are reliant on each other's history, so if first earth is fucked, then all 3 go down with it. Oh, also, there's a planet where most of the population is impoverished and enslaved, and they have to go out into the fields and harvest fruit where dinosaur like predators await them while the upper echelon relax with their technology and walls. The poor all carry glass prisms which they cling onto for hope, as legend has it they carry the key to their salvation in the rapture to come. Oh, also, there's another one which is basically Nozick's ""Pleasure Machine"" thought experiment come to life and society is on the brink of crumbling 'cause the real world is too dull in comparison, so much so that they wanted to avoid having to come out and eat, so they got rid of food and developed basically jello which can be I think absorbed through the skin and comes in a variety of colors and flavors.

The worldbuilding is excellent, the story telling is great, the characters are all memorable, and the creativity that goes into all the different worlds, twists, mechanics, etc stops for nothing short of brilliantly fresh.

They're outstanding teen novels, and they're all good enough to where you can have fun reading it at any age. There's some weird aspects about romance and whatnot in I think the 6th book which I personally didn't like, but the rest of it was a great ride. "

15690,"Ive gained ten pounds this year because i slacked off on exercise and diet. I can already feel a difference. I can feel that extra weight pulling me and hanging awkwardly on my body when i run around.

How someone can get to 300-400 pounds ''without noticing'' is beyond me. You can feel it. You can see it. Things become more difficult. Your pants have to get bigger and bigger. Being obese doesnt sneak up on you."

Strange to me since even after working in fast food for a couple of years I've seen few people that I'd consider more than just slightly chubby. Certainly never come across someone that's 400+ lbs.

15700,"Also shocking to them:   


* Marrying for love (partners were chosen for economical/social reasons) 
* Dating Apps (Dating was strictly maintained by family and approved matchmakers, you did not just hit up some pretty young thing without going through the proper channels)
* The total taboo of marrying your cousin (Most Marriages in America used to be 2nd cousins or closer until the civil war but they were still fairly common 100 years ago, texas did not ban it until 1985)
* marrying someone outside of your county (people did not travel far especially for a partner)
* women not getting married by 20 or without the approval of her father, keeping their maiden name, and getting divorced and remarried (they were basically property with limited rights)
* many modern couples choosing to cohabitate and have long term relationships without getting married (its only in recent times christians were okay with kissing before marriage)
* A president that has been married three times and known to have had relationships outside of his marriage(s)... (I mean that's kind of shocking today, but the republicans are surprisingly progressive in being totally okay with it)    


Marriage has changed a lot and will continue to change, I think gay marriage is more shocking to modern old people. People from 100 years ago would think everyone was crazy sinful heathens, hetero or homo."

Once I start, I'm exhausted for several days since I bleed so heavily. I used to get cramps in my lower abdomen so bad that I passed out a few times. I've vomited many times from the pain alone. It's always felt like someone was putting immense pressure on my pelvis and like... Trying to curl my bones in. Idk. It's hard to explain. Either way it was awful.

15733,"Not having proper identification can make you fall between the cracks quick and hard.  It's one of the biggest factors in the poor, homeless, and/or recently incarcerated members of society struggling to find, among other things, gainful employment.  It's not something one often thinks of, but without legal proof of your identity you...kind of don't have one.  Makes applying for jobs, loans, school, housing, etc. nearly impossible.  My parents didn't do the best job of keeping up with mine and it meant I didn't end up getting a drivers' license until I was nearly 20 years old. It also made flying on planes in a post-9/11 world difficult; After visibly becoming an older teenager, I was almost always ""randomly selected for additional screening"" and found myself being summoned into the TSA office to answer questions about myself to an unseen voice over the phone in a windowless interrogation room more than once just to fly to grandma's for the summer.  I also found myself just a few years later having to pay money I barely had out the nose for overnight delivery of my birth certificate for my first ~real job because they required it to be on file (most do).  
  
Sadly, there isn't an ""easiest"" route if you don't have at least one of the documents because getting any one of the three usually involves having the other two.  The birth certificate is my recommendation, however, as it will always be on record in the state of your birth and can typically be requested by anyone for a variety of reasons.  [Here's](https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents) a good primer on how and where to get/replace all of the above. And trust me on this: when any office or institution says ""we will only accept X"" as form of identification, ***they mean it.***  You can bring all the school documents, insurance papers, medical records, etc. with your name on it you like going back as far back as you can find, but 99.99% of the time it will not be accepted.  And honestly, the best time to get all of these things (passports too) *is* before you turn 18 as it largely falls on your parents to help you get these things.
  
TL;DR: get a drivers' license/state-issued ID, Social Security card, and verified copy of your birth certificate before you turn 18 and know where they are at all times. Just do it. "

15736,"Excessive body hair is kind of gross on anyone, tbh. I mean, I think most people have the decency to groom themselves to an acceptable level but to expect women to just be completely smooth everywhere is kind of asinine. Even as a man I think having hairy nipples is weird, so I shave mine. All I‚Äôm saying is that if my gf doesn‚Äôt shave her legs or pits for a few days, I‚Äôm not gonna get all bent about it. Also though, we‚Äôre just animals. If natural traits gross you out so much, I‚Äôd suggest growing up a bit. "

15747,"I hired a full time assistant to take care of all of that for me.  I used to play in the NFL, so I can afford that. "
15748,"I would advise not doing this. We went with a photographer that we found online that charged a very reasonable price. Photos looked fantastic. She had been taking photos in the area for almost 2 years. Met up with her in person and felt comfortable with her expertise and professionalism so we agreed to it and wrote up a contract.
She ended up bringing her 5 year old with her which wasn't a big deal even though it was a distraction for some people. What was a big deal was her losing all of the photos, or claiming she did another photo shoot over the top of our photos.
She offered to redo the photo shoot, but most of our friends flew in, so we just asked for our money back. Then she vanished. Deleted her website, changed phones, removed her facebook, etc.
We hired a private investigator to serve her papers to get our money back, and the investigator handed the papers to her husband. When we made it to court, they ruled that since she was not physically served papers (even though she was married, 2 become one you would think), it did not count.
By that time they had moved and we lost track of them and couldn't re-serve papers to get our money.
2 years later my wife found the photographer had started a new website and a new facebook account was up. When we contacted her, she actually had a change of heart and did end up paying us back very slowly on a payment plan.
Buyer beware with someone who does not own a real company. I know we are probably an outlier, but it's still worth considering that possiblity and asking if you want that risk. We never even thought something like that could happen, or I would have not went that route.

Thankfully, my wife did rent a photo booth and we got pictures of important people at the wedding having fun and being silly. Some of our friends also took photos as well and sent them to us. So, we have some photos of the wedding reception, just not the ones we paid for."

Also, I treated it almost like a throw-away day, like a day we planned to go to the beach or for a concert, any other occasion that took more planning than dinner and a movie. And it just wasn't. It was so lovely, I wish I could have shared it with more people, and I felt so bad that I didn't. "

15806,"He was upfront and honest with me from the beginning, which made it easy for me to be also (I was determined to, since my ex and I had such terrible communication, but having him do that too really helped).

He told me I was beautiful. Still does. I hadn't gotten that with my ex.

He warned me that he was forgetful, yet still managed to put things in my fridge and cabinets back where they belonged, unlike a previous partner I dated who, when I pointed out that he'd put [whatever] back in a weird place would slump and pout and whine that he was forgetful and I really had to give him leeway because of that.

He pushes me to talk about how I'm feeling, saying ""what do you mean by that"" and ""okay, say more about that"" this goes along with my first point, but it was also the first time I'd dated someone who wanted to know not just what I was feeling but why, and helping me understand things. Yet - he's managed not to get too therapist-y.

By the end of our fifth date, 15 days in, we had spent 104 hours together. We could not get enough of talking to each other. We've slowed down, but he's still my favorite person to talk to, and he makes me laugh every day.

There's the dumb theory about how every relationship has a reacher and a settler. We both feel like we're the reacher.

15932,"When I was little, we lived in Nebraska, and my dad, grandpa, and brother would go hunting on Thanksgiving day. They almost didn‚Äôt go out one year because it was sleeting so hard, but they decided to go anyway. When they were driving out in the country, they saw a small, black lab in the ditch who had been dumped with a  ratty, old blanket. She was less than a year old and shaking from the sleet and the cold. They decided to take her home and they posted fliers everywhere, hoping someone would claim her (I didn‚Äôt want anyone to claim her because she had clearly been abused - a few open wounds, patches of fur missing, worms, malnourished, not to mention dumped on the side of the road). Unsurprisingly, no one claimed her.
We ended up keeping her and she lived to be 13 years old and was one of the best dogs my dad ever worked with. He said she was the fastest dog he‚Äôd ever seen, and he raised dogs his whole life. She was the sweetest dog, but it still makes me sad to think about how she was abused in the first few months of her life. Until the day she died, she would still cower if you approached her too quickly or made loud noises.
Thankfully, she died fat, happy, and loved. RIP Maddy girl."

So I made sure my breeder worked her dogs in IPO and other sports, cross checked and re-cross checked references, pedigrees, etc. I worked hard for almost a year to ensure I chose a proper breeder because I didn't want to support a BYB.

15983,"It's much worse than that. I used to work for a vet. Did you know there's a Holiday Rush to put down pets? Because they're effort or they have allergic family visiting. And they refuse allowing others to adopt them even if they're young. Because to then they're property. One time we had someone going vet to vet with their dog on a cart trying to find the cheapest place to put it down. It had a tumor so large it was actually ripping through it's chest. 

FYI because I worked with a small practice we refused people who wanted to put down animals for stupid reasons and put that dog down at a discount just so it could be fukkin free. But you know they will always just go to a major pet hospital to get it done otherwise.  "

My father was a violent drunk my entire childhood, and my mother has some very narcissistic tendencies that, in his case, manifest as enabling his behavior while also deriding it to everyone she knows. They don't much like each other but for some reason refuse to get a divorce. There's nothing like getting old enough to realize that Mommy and Daddy are terrible to each other and growing up internalizing that this is how relationships are and how adults, and in particular men, are going to treat you.

16028,"I worked in games for a summer at cedar point, but my best friend worked in rides on the top thrill dragster the first year the ride opened. She told me she had to clean up a lot of vomit, and that she had to fish a seagull head out of the lagoon below after the ride ran it over. Also, she was working when a cable snapped and injured a few people. The people were sent to the hospital and were fine, but all the workers on that ride had to sign a non disclosure agreement and were not allowed to talk to the press. She didn't even tell me much about that incident until a year later. 

That place was strict. My roommate (I lived in the dorms there) was fired for pointing. Someone asked where the corkscrew was, she pointed to where it was, a higher up saw and she was fired. You're supposed to direct with your WHOLE HAND because some cultures find it offensive. I thought it was really silly to be fired for that.

It was a close miss as he was so small, cars driving out of the park didn't see him in front of their car. He was rescued by a guy working in the ticket office who saw him running out.  


Another time a chimpanzee managed to escape from his enclosure. People didn't realize how dangerous it actually was, as they always saw the chimps being cute and swinging from their ropes. No one got hurt, as the chimpanzee guard coaxed him into his car with some bananas and a bottle of coke."

Abuse. Any kind of abuse but especially child or animal abuse. Like why?? What do you have to gain by hurting something weaker than you? Does it make you look cool? Does it make you feel tough?? Cant imagine a logical answer to either question  because hurting a child or animal just makes you look like the weakest and most pathetic mother fucker on Earth.

Fan girling/boying celebrities. Ok...it's a celebrity. So....?? They are normal people, ya know. They still shit turds just like you and me. 

Listening to anyone not specialized in a field because they googled information. So what you're trying to tell me Jenny Mcarthy is that vaccines cause autism because you googled it. Wow. Doctors and scientist all over should be ripping up their qualifications because Jenny Mcarthy fucking googled! Oh wait. Kim Kardashian is juicing rose stems to gain 2 inches in her left butt cheek?? Gotta find a florist ASAP. Fuck off with that shit already.

Being on the autism bandwagon. UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED BY A PROFESSIONAL, DO NOT CLAIM YOU ARE AUTISTIC. Being socially awkward and/or shy does not fucking mean you are autistic or on the spectrum. And for the love of all you hold holy, parents stop labeling your fucking kids as autistic just because they arent up to your standards. If you really think your kid has a problem, take him/her to a fucking specialist instead of ""Dr. Google""."

The intense yellow coloration of his skin said some form hepatopathy, the badges on his head said recent surgery. I tried to measure the blood pressure, and it was this weak and really quiet thing. I didn't know how to help her or her son, so I told her the resident will help them later. When I reported his vitals to the doctor, he said: ""Oh yeah his condition is deteriorating due to hepatic encephalopathy. He'll probably die tonight""...and he did.

There is a canopy in a little bag attached to the slide, which you can unfurl and attach to what are basically vertical tent poles. That's very difficult to do because the canopy is large, and will be caught by any wind. Also it will require coordination of all the passengers on the slide - no mean feat in the aftermath of a crash into sea.

To clarify, my friends and I at this time were nerds. Of course there wasn‚Äôt as much shame in being a nerd in high school by 2013, so it just meant we knew what we were talking about when it comes I nerdy stuff. Video games especially. 

So my one friend who we‚Äôll call Nate is a compulsive liar. His lies are usually either white lies to make himself seem impressive or bullshit excuses when he wants to cancel or explain his absence from plans. We always let him off the hook (hell we still do when we see him nowadays) even when we knew he was lying because he could still be a really great friend and a lot of fun to hang out with. 

So we‚Äôre sat in class typing up some investigations were doing that nobody really cares about because it isn‚Äôt graded and provided the randomly selected samples from the class pass, everyone passes. So the teacher is chill and let‚Äôs each group chat casually provided we finish these things off. Naturally we start talking about video games, GTA5, Battlefield 4, and the upcoming Gen 8 consoles. 

At this point Nate starts hyping up the PS4. He describes features no one else had heard about (because they didn‚Äôt exist) and basically just bigs himself and this console up. Naturally we ask him where he got all this info, and he *insists* he has the PS4 already. The PS4 that we know doesn‚Äôt release for another couple months. This naturally doesn‚Äôt sit well with the group, and we all simultaneously realise that this time he‚Äôs dig himself in too deep and we‚Äôre going to catch him out. We start questioning him about games he‚Äôs been playing, how he got it, and if he‚Äôs aware he‚Äôs potentially sitting on the biggest tech leak in gaming. He starts to fumble, the contradictions begin, he has no explanation for how he got it beyond ‚ÄúI just asked for one and GAME sold it to me‚Äù. 

Eventually I decide to put him out of his misery and tell him if he just stops talking we‚Äôll all forget this ever happened and we won‚Äôt make fun of him for it. He doesn‚Äôt stop. He contorts a sentence in which he admits he doesn‚Äôt have the PS4 but does have the DualShock 4 - the systems controller. While smaller this is still just as ridiculous a lie as Just saying he had the console, so naturally the guys and myself ramp back up out sarcastic and mocking questioning. It‚Äôs a happy memory. 

To this day I don‚Äôt know why he chose that controller as his hill to die on. And that‚Äôs what makes it the most ridiculous lie I‚Äôve ever been told. Because after spending at least half an hour desperately lying about the console, we gave him a chance to forget about it and he decided to just go harder on a smaller thing. And to this day we still bring up How bat shit insane it all was because up until that point and *including earlier that day* we‚Äôd all been sharing our hype for the November release, then all of a sudden he‚Äôs telling us he already had it. It may not be the most outlandish or stupid lie here, but the lengths he went to to try and maintain it, even when given an out, impression me to this day. 

**TLDR:** Guy insists he has a PS4 months before release despite being with nerds who know what they‚Äôre talking about and who he‚Äôs previously told how excited he is to get the system. When given a chance to move on e doubles down insisting that he doesn‚Äôt have a PS4 but just has the controller. 

He never mentioned it again after that lesson and the rest of us still laugh about it now. "

Macchiatto literally means ""marked"" in Italian and preparing a machiatto is actually very different from preparing a latte. The drink is more bitter for the first few sips because the espresso should be floating in the foam at the top of the drink.

A tv show once said that anything over 80% of your body is considered fatal. Sounds like this guy, every thing but the top of his head burned 

It's not the burn that kills you, it's the pain and infection that follows. The removal of the burned/melted skin and clothing puts you into shock, and if they don't get it off of you fast enough, it festers. If they go too fast, you go into shock.

This put me in the position of either signing 100+ pages of legal documents without reading or sitting in a room with the real estate agent, title lawyer, and the seller waiting impatiently for me to finish reading it at 6PM on a Tuesday.

I had verified a few things in advance over the phone with the mortgage broker and in retrospect I should've requested the documents in advanced but being the first time I've ever purchased property I wouldn't even know what documents to ask for. Realistically, all the documents from the sales contract, mortgage contract, title insurance, etc should be emailed to to the buyer in advance so they do have time to actually read before signing."

I just call it the vibes of the universe in lacking other words. A lot of people dismiss that sort of idea as unscientific but it's so limiting to think that science as it is today has discovered everything there is to know about the universe. Stuff we've proven today has been dismissed as hearsay in the past, and it will happen again in the future.

One of my weirder experiences was with a roommate I had at the time who I was very close to. I hadn't seen her for a few days because she was staying at her boyfriends place and had a dream she was in. The next day she came home and when she walked I said to her that she was in my dream and then explained it. When I got to the part where she first spoke in the dream she cut me off and said the exact same she had said to me in the dream, and told me she had the exact same dream last night. It was the weirdest thing because I hadn't spoken to her for those few days so there was nothing that should have triggered such a specific shared dream at random, but she knew verbatim what she had said in my dream, and what had happened after up until we parted ways in our dreams. It's not beyond me to believe that people could experience a moment of shared consciousness or awareness so to speak in waking life, especially with people who would be as close as twins can be. "

Almost 10 years ago, my son was admitted as a newborn to the local children's hospital and it was *the most* traumatic thing to happen to me in my entire life. But the staff was so nice and sympathetic and understanding. I'd had a home birth to avoid the hospital, and ended up at it anyway (it was unrelated to the home birth), and they were so kind to me. I remember several nurses saying, ""I know you didn't want to be here in the first place and we're going to make your stay as nice as possible."" They always explained what they were doing, answered my stupid questions, held my hand; they were so kind. It meant the world. Contrast that with my experience 3 years prior, being admitted to the kidney ward of Tallahassee memorial for rhabdomyolysis. The doctors blamed me for it, the staff was unfriendly, I felt like an inconvenience; I couldn't believe how terrible it was. I left thinking, ""I am never ever setting foot in a hospital again in my life"" and it was actually the reason I had a home birth lol.

16145,"My great grandmother was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma for the first time when she was in her sixties. She went into remission twice, but it came back for round three when she was 89 years old.

She was always a strong woman, her oncologist called her his hero because of how well she handled the treatments. She got mad at him once because she thought he was diluting her doses. When he asked her why she would think something like that; she answered by saying, ""You told me that this stuff would make me weak and put me on the couch! I've been up vacuuming and cooking, I have all sorts of energy!""

My grandfather's brothers and sisters insisted that she receive a third round of chemo and, even though she didn't want to do it, she went along with their wishes. The next four months were the most excruciating that I've ever seen a human being experience. There were so many late nights where everyone rushed to the hospital because we were sure that it was the end.

When she passed away it was almost a relief because she was finally out of the misery that my aunts and uncles caused. I know they didn't want her to go and I know that she handled it like a champ the first two times, but I've always felt that it was such a selfish and bullheaded move on their part. She was just too old.

My point to all this is that I'm happy you gave her the real story and the real options. It may very well have saved that woman a great deal of pain and stress. Sometimes family members don't think clearly about a situation...sometimes they don't think at all."

Have to buy a few more washers and dryers (ours were already pretty much always running), hiring one or two more people to wash them, hiring more house keepers (at least one, the effort to just move that much material would add on a bit of cleaning time per room), and the additional cost of water, electricity, and laundry goo.

16168,"Warning, this is a long one.

I had a terrible Spanish teacher in middle school. She was the type that liked to constantly prove and re-prove her superiority over her students through humiliation. I was grateful to be moving from Middle School to High School. 

At the High School, my new teacher was smart, funny, and tolerant without being overly lenient. A real gem. My grades bounced way up and my interest in the language resurfaced. She was engaging and encouraging. We had a couple of wise-asses in the class, as every class seems to have, and instead of constantly butting heads with them, she taught them to give sass in Spanish. It was effective.

My second year of High School, the previous nasty teacher transferred schools and she was my Spanish teacher again. My grades plummeted again as she kept up her old techniques of making sure all her students knew their place as below hers. I ceased my Spanish lessons entirely after that. (I took Chinese my senior year and that was fun)

Years later, a friend of mine started dating a girl whose last name I recognized. Turns out, she was the daughter of the awesome Spanish teacher and was now a teacher in the same public school system! This all ties in to your comment about working in the system because apparently, once the nasty teacher transferred over, she also gave a lot of shit to any other teacher she deemed beneath her, which was just about all of them. This included the awesome Spanish teacher and now, her daughter had to deal with her decades later. Apparently, she's still doing the same crap with all her students and peers. I can't even imagine the amount of damage she's done to student's academic careers over the years, she was so discouraging and disparaging. "

## Facts about poverty and hunger in America

Even in the world‚Äôs greatest food-producing nation, children and  adults face poverty and hunger in every county across America. In 2016:

* 41 million people struggle with hunger in the United States,  including 13 million children. In 2015, 5.4 million seniors struggled to  afford enough to eat.
* A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life.
* Households with children were more likely to be food insecure than those without children
* 59% of food-insecure households participated in at least one of the  major federal food assistance program ‚Äî the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps); the National School  Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,  Infants and Children (often called WIC)"

16324,"So your advice to poor people who are buying gifts late because it's cheaper is to... invest a year in advance in a gift?

How?  Skip a Christmas?  Buy gifts for this Christmas and the day after buy for the next one too?

This does not solve the problems of a person who has a cashflow issue."
16325,"Oh, congratulations! That's very exciting!!! ^_^ For us, I really struggled to get onto a decent sleep schedule. It took us about 2 - 2 1/2 months to get a solid feeding routine down, and she certainly woke a few times each night. That said, about 3 months in, she slept the whole night through. From then on, it's been pretty consistent. 

My best advice when you start off is:

- set phone reminders for naps, bedtimes, feedings and diaper changes;
- sleep when your baby sleeps (seriously, dishes can wait for a couple hours while you two catch some ZZZs);
- don't keep the house too quiet when your baby is asleep or they'll wake at every little thing; 
- sometimes babies don't sleep well and you will need breaks - be sure to have a few people set on emergency dial for you to get that break. A nap or even lunch can do wonders for you! 
- and, especially, as a first time Mommy, make sure you burp baby very well after every feed. If baby gets gassy, DO NOT give honey or sugar water as many parents/grandparents might advise. Call the doctor/breastfeeding groups if you go this route for advice on chronic crying and lots of gas on baby's belly. The only thing babies can consume in their first few months of life is formula or breastmilk. 

- last but not least: despite common advice to let the baby ""cry it out"", or ""self settle"", I held my girl every single time. I've never had a problem with separation anxiety as of yet, and bed time routines are consistent (unless she's teething, then I'm guaranteed to be awake at 4:30 am.) So, do what feels right. My kid didn't do well being swaddled while she slept, so we layered her up in warmer clothes, kept her room cozy, and kept her crib clear of everything (including blankets.) We placed her feet at the bottom of her crib, face up, and she seemed to like that she could touch something with her feet. We checked her often during daytime sleeping to ensure she didn't throw up in her sleep, and, we never co-slept (because, generally, this is extremely dangerous unless you have a specific safety setup.) We stuck to our schedules and bedtime has had minor adjustments with time changes, but beyond that, it seems to be going OK. 

Don't know if any of this will be useful, but I hope it is. Every baby is so different, so I'm hoping you have an easier time than we did, and just remember: nobody has a clear guide to their kids. Just do what you know is best, to the best of your abilities. Instincts will change and you'll see everything and everyone differently once your daughter arrives. It's amazing, terrifying, wonderful. I wish you all of the best!!! &lt;3"

People are allowed to feel feelings and be judged only by actions and intentions."
16379,"I've told this story on reddit before (but never in real life). It was one of the biggest plot twists in my life:
   
I was about 14 (don't remember my exact age, although I could reverse engineer it). I had never kissed a girl, never really had a girlfriend. I was a gawky and introverted nerd living in a little town. Didn't have many friends, and not all that crazy about most of the few I did have. I was the smartest kid in my class, but scrawny and unathletic. In the span of a few years I had somehow gone from being one of the cool kids in my grade to being one of the people who are mostly ignored by the cool kids. I felt alone and isolated most of the time.  

My older brother gets married, and they have a major wedding reception at her parents' house in a town about 10 miles away from my hometown. Two bars, no one cares if kids are drinking. This house is an old mansion in a hick town in the midwest, has about 20 rooms. I've had some drinks and am feeling good, when someone tells me that one of the bridesmaids has a little sister my age who thinks I'm cute.   

I eventually find her (it's a huge party) and we chat for a bit and hit it off. She's pretty and seems bright and funny and nice. I have visions of having a real girlfriend for the first time. I feel like this could be a turning point in my life...I've met a cool girl, and she actually seems to like me. Between the alcohol buzz and the unexpected situation, I feel like a little kid who has come downstairs on Christmas morning and found everything he wants under the tree, plus a bunch of other great stuff he didn't even know existed.   

We roam off, holding hands, and find an empty room. We sit on a little couch and talk some more. Finally, I work up my nerve and I kiss a girl for the first time in my life.   
  
And she pukes *in my mouth* and runs out of the room.   

**TL;DR** - Alcohol bringeth, and alcohol taketh away.

16388,"Absolutely. Cheating is usually not a malicious act, rather than a personal failing. If my wife faltered, and temporarily gave in to temptation, I'd forgive her. I'd be hurt, sure, but it's not like she did something specifically to hurt me. People forgive all kinds of vile language and acts that are designed to hurt each other (in arguments and the like), but for some reason simply slipping once and giving in to your base human instincts is the biggest betrayal imaginable? "
16389,"This actually sounds cost effective compared to some of these weddings here. 

Limited guest list constrained by boat size. No bussing people between hotel and reception. One venue for both ceremony and reception. Simple pleasures (swimming) rather than lots of complex entertainment. 

I mean yes it probably cost a penny, but not as pretty a penny as ya might think. 

LPT: Hire a boat to get married. "
16390,"Not to be too much of an armchair psychologist, but people do stupid things when they're in high school. People also do stupid things when they are confronted with big life decisions and changes (moving to college, etc.) You combine a teenager's newly blossoming feeling of adulthood with a relationship that started when they were barely old enough to *have* a relationship, and then toss in the stress of an enormous change in your life and you're gonna do some dumb things. 

I'm not saying she did anything right, but obviously she was deeply ashamed of her actions and we can at least empathize, if not sympathize."
16391,"Your high school sweetheart didn't cheat on you then?

It sucks that you broke up. I think you give this friend way too much credit.

16400,"The bride was the sister of one of her best friends. She's always rubbed me wrong but she'd known her since elementary school so just kind of accepted her as who she was and overlooked a lot of the negative. After the wedding she made it a goal to destroy their friendship and then send my wife what is quite possibly the most perfectly written hurtful message. She took a lifetime of knowledge to  just shred her on every vulnerable spot my wife had, damn near drove her over the edge.

I'd have killed her if I thought there was any way I could get away with it. Took years for her to get over it."

16403,Perfect timing OP! I live in a fairly small town in upstate New York. My friends dad has been feuding with a woman in my town for years and it recently escalated to the extreme. My friends dad got drunk and went up to the university where he worked (after the woman got him fired) and tried to run her over with his SUV. He missed and totaled his car by running into a tree. The cops saw it happen and chased him all over the campus while he was driving a totaled car that had the airbags deployed. He eventually surrendered and he was arrested. It's all anyone has been talking about for weeks now. Needless to say not much happens here.

Yes, that is the way people treat someone accused of a sex crime.  **Even after the claim is proven to be 100% false.**  Even over a decade later.

There are still a frightening percentage of people who treat the accused as though 100% guilty, and craft amazing excuses for the false accuser.  (my story elsewhere in thread)"

She's explaining how great it is, how some guests just need to get a few pieces, and everyone can pitch in for a whole set, so it's not *that* expensive. 

Each plate was some crazy amount of money, and my wife I and I nearly laughed in her face. We said ""we don't need or even want a china set.""

the lady says ""oh, I know, I know.. but down the line, many years from now, you'll be hosting dinners and parties and you'll want a really nice china set""

We said ""no... we won't, we have no interest in a china set, we'll never ever use it.""

pure disappointment on this lady's face, and she gave up the battle. 15 years later, never have I said ""god damnit, i wish I had fine china!""

Sent some texts to the girl I had been on the date with about, 'sorry about getting you embarrassed, gonna have to take care of stuff.' She had some weird response about 'you're going to be a father now, you need to go see your ex.' A few days go by and new girls cousin calls me, like yo what is wrong with you. We haven't heard anything. Turns out after I found out about the 'pregnancy' I had slept on the exes couch and she slipped my phone from my pocket switched new girl to a burner number she had (finally made sense why she suddenly had purchased the same model phone as me on a whim).  

Long short, decided to force a pregnancy test or threaten restraining order. She tried without me in the room, but I wasn't having it. After about the third dropped in the toilet, I pulled out my roughly 12 extras and offered to hold it. Of course not pregnant. Told her to never contact me again and left.

While I have a sprawling extended family on my mother's side, on my dad's side it was just him and a grandpa I met once when I was a kid.

Anyhow, I remark one day that his surname was the same as dad's. He asked where my dad came from. I said the tiny town in New Zealand and he said ""yeah, that's where I am from and there aren't many of us with that name"".

I emailed my dad for a family tree. He sent one, and the next day I compared notes with that colleague. The relevant parts were identical except for a question mark on his where my grandfather should have been.

Apparently our grandparents were brothers and mine had fled town.

I dont think it's easy to tell the difference though in day to day life. I'm super open about it not being a diamond, but I don't think you can tell by casually looking, unless you are looking closely or if it is too large for the couple to afford if it were a diamond. At a pawn shop you are probably looking much closer than your average passerby. Its definitely not costume jewelry if you get a good quality setting - would you say the same about a gem stone ring?

Beyond that in a universe where everyone has a spaceship and ""complete garbage"" can make an easy entry into orbit, travel at hyperspeed* (*whatever that means) and has already had not one but two ""death stars""...  **NOBODY NOTICED** the first order constructing a new death star until it had already fired.  Don't mention the fact that if starkiller base was in the solar system of the planets it killed it would be impossible not to notice it.  Then also remember that this base absorbed the star it used as power which kills everything on every planet in that solar system.  At the end you see a new star formed from the wreckage of starkiller base at (ballparking again here) 1/10000th the size of the original star, in a different position in space than the original.

Also it's an ice planet that is the closest in proximity to the star, ICE PLANET!  

Finally the ""hyper lightspeed weapon"", that they barely make reference to, travels slowly enough to watch the beam move from the firing station across the bow of some ships but also goes fast enough to reach another solar system instantaneously.  If it fires to another solar system you would need to shoot it about 2-5 thousand years ago for it to hit its target now.

So was it all in a single solar system?  Was it in multiple?  Does the speed of light not mean anything in the SW universe?  How can a beam of light energy go faster than light while also going slow enough to watch its progress in real time?????

**Edit:** A personal preference would be like, ""I think Asian women look the best"" but even then, sexiness is impartial to race and there are commonalities that sexy people share so it's super suspicious when someone says ""I wouldn't date someone because they're black"" rather than ""I wouldn't date someone because they're ugly"". 

Same guy by the way said ""he doesn't like black women"" and when questioned about that he said ""it's not how they look, it's how they act.""

Even racists typically are still physically attracted to the race they hold prejudice for, but they are *mentally* (pathologically) unattracted. I mean, the fact that anytime something is taboo in a region, the porn search results for that taboo thing increase (that is to say, in the most stereotypically racist areas, interracial tends to be the most popular genre) indicates that racists are still attracted to other races.

16666,"Hell, the idea that 'barbarians"" were unwashed and gross is largely a myth as well. Germanic and Celtic peoples were, on a whole, actually cleaner than their Greek and Roman contemporaries. Part of that was because they didn't live in such urbanized populations, but still. The Romans didn't have soap until they imported it from Gaul, and Roman bathhouses were \*\*fucking disgusting\*\*. Rome itself was called 'sickly' during the summer months, and tens of thousands of people died from disease every year. Gallic and Germanic (although that was later in the Dominate period, when infrastructure was breaking down) dignitaries occasionally commented on how \*gross\* Rome was."

16694,"Your experience is called inclusion. In the past, anyone with exceptional disabilities were segregated to other classrooms. this causes a few issues. 

Students with disabilities would not get a full education. I don't mean, ""as much as you received"" but ""as much as they're capable of."" more often these students would just be cared for so they were literally alive for when the bus picked them up to go home.

Also, YOU wouldn't be educated. It's important that regular Ed. students learn about people with disabilities and learn how to work with them. If they're segregated, then they become some sort of freakish thing that no one wants to acknowledge. 

Today, we have full or partial inclusion. Students with disabilities are in regular Ed. classrooms. It's important that they learn in a demanding environment so they can get to their highest potential. It's also important for all of the other students to see them as another human and someone they can work with.

Making a system where your pin backwards calls the police wouldn't be too difficult, it's a simple matter of coding in a slot for your backwards pin to seperate the normal processes of your pin and the processes done by your backwards pin and then writing a process for it to send an alert to emergency dispatch with all the necessary info."

I finally moved my head up enough to see what was attached to the body. It‚Äôs head was shaped like a hammerhead shark, I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs face looked like but I remember it was smiling at me. I felt true evil, but more importantly I felt myself dying. I grew up in a Christian home and my mother had always taught me to call on Jesus‚Äôs name in times of trouble. I was barely able to speak, but I was able to gasp out a plea for Jesus to help me. Immediately it vanished and I remember being able to breathe and I felt peace. I think I passed out right afterwards because I don‚Äôt remember falling asleep.

Athiesm and agnosticism in communism had the purpose of dedicating people to the best interests of the community rather than a god. Communism doesn't see it necessary to be fanatically athiest, but the idea is detaching theistic ideas from your person so it doesn't distract or distance you from real world issues. Also the separation of church and state is vital, but how far that goes depends on the movement."

Long answer: it really depends. Jurisdiction, hunting laws, what type of deer, etc. I'm a cop in a small town and we have lots of deer accidents. If they're reported, we come out and provided no laws were broken we give the driver a tag if he wants to keep it. If not, we have some people we can call that process the deer for local food banks. No joke one of my partners responded to a deer crash where the driver and his friend already had the deer skinned and in the bed of his truck, just waiting on a tag. He was maybe 15 minutes out. Gotta love rednecks.

In my case I called highway patrol and a statie came out and dispatched the deer. I didnt want the meat, I wouldn't even know how to process it. Plus, how am i gonna haul it with a busted leaky Honda?!"

16805,"The reason I struggle with this is because when I was raised, I was always taught that what your gender is doesn‚Äôt define you. That just because I am biologically male doesn‚Äôt mean I need to be interested in and behave like the stereotypical man.  I always believed that the best way to get equality between genders was to break down the roles that men and women play in society. So when the whole concept of non-binary became present in the public eye, it seemed to me like the idea of not letting gender define you was completely abandoned.  I understand the pride of figuring out who you are, but to me I would rather be identified by who I am. When someone describes me, I‚Äôd rather they say ‚Äúwitty, nerdy, kind‚Äù instead of ‚Äústraight white male‚Äù, and that society is becoming worse at grouping people by what they are, not who they are.

Two weeks later I sprained both of my ankles at a temp job and was totally helpless. He was absolutely amazing and never once made me feel like a burden. Then I returned the favor when he was tight on money and rather down. It's a level of support I didn't know existed before him. 

I knew he was it when we found out that my mom died and he comforted me in the most perfectly fucked up way. No one else would have thought to do that, but it was perfect. 4 years later and we're still happy. Things outside of the relationship can be rough, but I know that he is always there for me. "

No way it could have been human because the thing was huge, at least it seemed from my perspective. At least 8 or 9 feet tall. We both freaked the fuck out and ran inside.

They eventually found me sitting in the host's closet, playing with her shoes. "
16862,"I wouldn‚Äôt have been upset had I not been obviously profiled. There was literally no reason for anyone to think my daughter was a kidnapping victim. She was clean, and happy and out in public. Kidnapped kids, especially infants, are more often than not disheveled and dressed like the opposite sex, very irritable if not screaming because they are with a stranger, and almost never out in public. 

They had no right to approach me with out the cops, and it was stupid to do so because had I been a kidnapper, I would have fled. 

I‚Äôve thought about many times what would have happened had I went with security. Would they have taken my daughter from my hands? Held me in a room without letting me leave? Which is ACTUALLY kidnapping. Physically restrained me? Which would have been false imprisonment. And it being walmart, all of those scenarios are completely plausible. "

The second time something like this happened I was around thirteen and couldn't sleep, so I cut my long hair really short, dyed it dark with grape kool-aid packets (it was blonde originally so not that hard), and pierced one of my ears twice.  My mom screamed when she came to wake me up because she thought I was a stranger in my bed.

16895,"I judged a science talent quest once where kids had to do a project on one of four scientific issues (eg deforestation, renewable energy etc) which was presented as a poster. They then had a 10-15 minute presentation to the judges where they explained their project and answered questions. Marks were awarded for both the project and presentation. The kids were generally aged between 8 and 13. 

So about three hours into the judging, this very young boy walks up to our table. He was in his first year of school (what we Aussies call Foundation) so wouldn‚Äôt have been more than 6. Hands over this beautifully presented project with references, labelled diagrams and scientific jargon. Red flags go up at this point but hey, maybe he‚Äôs a very bright kid and he just had some help typing it up and doing the drawings. We start talking to the kid and quickly realise he has NO idea what is on ‚Äúhis‚Äù project. Like, he can‚Äôt even read the title. It was about deforestation and we asked him why there was a picture of a chimpanzee. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an elephant, stupid head‚Äù. He kept climbing out of his chair and trying to run away or hide under our table. Obviously mum or dad had entered him into the competition and completed the ENTIRE thing - I doubt he was even in the room when it was being put together. Why? I don‚Äôt know since he clearly hadn‚Äôt a hope in hell of winning anything, since it was very much not his work. I also don‚Äôt know how his teacher was OK with it - if that was one of my kids I wouldn‚Äôt have let them enter if I was sure it wasn‚Äôt their work. We made a note of that on our judging sheet which would have been sent to both his teacher and his parents.

1970 gold price was $38/oz. So ~$466/lb. 

1979 was $459/oz ($5,508/lb). It peaked in 1980 at $594.90/oz and never went above that price until 2009 ($1,087.50/oz). 

Granted $1 in 1970 equates to $6.31 in 2017 money, so presuming you landed in 1970 with a pound of gold that would be about $2,940 in modern (2017) currency worth for perspective. 

For those wondering, if you waited until 1980 to cash in, $1 in 1980 equates to $2.97 (2017). So that same pound would be about $1766 (2017). 

Today, if you had a lb of gold, it would be worth approximately $14,803 ($1,233/oz).  While nothing to scoff at, that doesn‚Äôt really go that far. 

Anyway, the average home price in 1970 was approximately $24,000. A car was $3,500 and the average family income was $9,800.  That‚Äôs a whole lot of gold to ‚Äúhide‚Äù to be sitting comfortably - if that was the only plan.

Once you‚Äôre bleeding cum out of your eyeballs in anticipation, lube up your fingers and b-hole. Insert one finger first, and just kinda go in and out while you get comfortable with the sensation of having something in your butt. It should never hurt, but might be uncomfortable at first. If it burns, you‚Äôre either using too little lube or your hands were dirty. I should mention, make sure your nails are cut and smooth (filed) and your hands are clean. 

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with having something there, curl your finger up towards your belly button. You kinda rub it the same way you finger a lady‚Äôs vag. Play around while you‚Äôre fapping and eventually you‚Äôll touch a bit that kinda makes you feel like you have to pee, even when your bladder is empty. That‚Äôs the spot.

The Puritans and other early American settlers did this. Often a child may be given the mother's name if the mother died in childbirth or later of puerpural (child bed) fever, but that was common practice if the mother lived as well to have a daughter named after her, though maybe going by a different nickname, like Peggy, if her mother went by Margaret.

Of course, it also follows that smokers are 3000% more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers, and 2307% more likely than passive smokers - but passive smoking is still a significant health risk *in comparison to not being exposed to second hand smoke in the first place*."

Basically I was about 4 years old and my dad worked while I stayed home with my mom, like a lot of kids. One day, my dad picked up my uncle at the airport on the way home from work. I didn't know he was visiting, so I wasn't expecting anything different. I see Dad coming up the front walk to the house and go running out to him, he picks me up in a hug. Over his shoulder, I see my actual dad getting out of the car, laughing his behind off. I ran into my room and couldn't get over it for years. I did not appreciate being hoodwinked in this way. "
17115,"I had a similar response when I told a parent that our field trip to the theme park was dependent on weather, and that we couldn't go if it was thunder-storming. I then explained, for the benefit of the kiddos, why you can't ride a rollercoaster in a thunderstorm.

Parent A: But it's the rides that get struck, not the people *on* the rides, so we should be fine.

Parent B: No, (Parent A), people get struck by *lightning*, not *thunder*, so thunderstorms aren't dangerous.

Cue having to explain to a group of kiddos that lightning and thunder are actually part of the same weather phenomenon, and that you only hear/ see them at a delay because light travels faster than sound."

Did we have the same 8th grade social studies teacher?

For real, she was carrying a grudge against me for stuff my dad and uncles put her husband through years and years before (basically they were jerks who liked to be the worst students ever). Anyways, I would do stuff with my friends and we'd write down the same answers. I'd get a C, friends would get A's. I ended up getting really upset and talking to the 7th grade social studies teacher, asking what I was doing wrong because social studies was always my favorite subject. The year before, I basically never got below an A- on anything and couldn't figure out what I was doing. Anyways, the 7th grade social studies teacher asked to see my stuff and I showed her. She ended up taking it to the school administration. Second semester rolled around and I was moved to another teacher's class. Meanwhile 8th grade teacher ended up getting forcefully retired at the end of the school year.

It would have been nice if my parents had been on my side and not all 'well it's only this one class, this one year so it's okay' which was probably part of the reason why I went to the teacher I'd had the year before."

17178,"The thing is too, there is such a thing as a 'bad teacher' that is performing just fine.

I saw this at my last school - a teacher having wildly inappropriate classroom discussions with their students.  This person was rude and inconsiderate to many of their students, and had all the classic signs of 'burn-out syndrome.'  *But*  Their students average acceptable test scores.  Not amazing, not terrible, just average.  

Since our country became addicted to test scores back when No Child Left Behind Act happened, that's all that matters.  And when it comes to evaluation, that's all that matters - test scores.

This teacher wasn't abusive, but their classroom culture had degraded so severely that I can't really call them a good teacher anymore.

So many of these people are the 'bad teachers' you all remember, and nothing can really be done to stop them.  It's just like if a cook spits in your food: Prove it.  Your best hope is that other employees report it.  And even if we do, there's not always things that can be done about it.

Tenure contracts are a double edge sword - they keep bad teachers in, and prevent good teachers from being abused.  I guarantee you that teachers would be a lot more willing to give up tenure though if you paid them more.  I have to fight to keep tenure, because losing my job moves me from financial unsteadiness to financial ruin.  "

Thing is, the vCJD ban isn't lifted for a few reasons: the mechanism of transmission isn't fully known, and the disease is catastrophic. Also, there are no current screening or blood tests that can be done that don't involve an autopsy (at which point you're pretty useless for blood donation). And, most importantly, *the ban in place doesn't appreciatively reduce the available blood supply.*

The number of people who cannot donate is comparatively small next to the population of otherwise eligible donors. Time, research and limited funds and resources are much, much better off raising awareness to increase the eligible donor pool (only about 3-7% of eligible donors actually donate, depending on the source you read) than in trying to prove that a relatively insignificant group are technically acceptable. 

I am subject to the same ban. I'm not offended by it. I just donate financially instead because it's a necessary service that's saving lives. I help as I can. "

You can also purchase a repair guide for your vehicle. They are usually $20 or so and have all the information you could possibly need to even do advanced repairs on your car.

To be fair, there are some vehicles that you either can't or shouldn't work on. Some cars have an oil filter that is ridiculous to get to, or have special proprietary tools needed to fix an issue. Basically, a good part of amateur mechanics is knowing when you are in over your head.

This is an *intensely personal question* -- I find it more personal than questions about my body -- and it's complicated and confusing and I don't have an easy soundbite answer that won't fill someone with misconceptions about what it means to be trans, so I don't want to be asked this by random people all the time.  Seriously.  I enjoy being asked questions sometimes even by near-strangers, but this one digs too deep for most situations.

if I have a friendly rapport with someone then, if the person is curious about these topics, I most enjoy questions like ""What's something unexpected from taking hormones?"" or ""How does transitioning work on the NHS?"" or maybe ""What have people's reactions been?"" and I don't even mind ""What does 'the surgery' involve? Did/will you have it?"" -- questions where I can be a bit educational, have a bit of fun, not delve too deep into emotional introspection.  But that's probably unique to me and everyone will have different preferences, and many people have a preference for no questions at all.

Also, in general I hate the assumption that my life is super tragic because I'm trans or that I deserve sympathy automatically or that I have the ultimate trump card in conversations about sucky bits of life.  No, my life is great and I'm happy and I'm extremely lucky!  Please just engage with me as you would engage with anybody else.

Also also, I hate it when people expect me to be The Good Trans and ally with them against The Bad Trans (usually: nonbinary people, flamboyant/openly trans people, trans people asking for basic human decency).  No.  I won't shit on my trans siblings to make you feel more comfortable, and I usually agree with them more than with you.  (This is not directed at you personally at all, sorry!

As they progress through elementary school I up the talks a little more each year.  I was always told if a kid is old enough to ask their old enough to give an honest answer so I gauge my talks and answers based on what they are saying.

 I make sure to ALWAYS tell all my kids straight up if you have any questions you don't want to ask your teacher just ask me. Don't ask your friends, they're idiots and they don't know they are just going to make something up and your going to get bad information.

We joke around a lot about everything but I try to also give them real and honest answers. I never treat anything they ask seriously as dumb or weird and try to mix some personal experience in there without making it weird. I make sure to verbalize that sex is something everyone and every animal does and it's natural and it's ok. It's really hard to balance.

Years later, long after I'd moved out, my mom mentioned that she had been curious about marijuana, and had tried it, but hated it. ""Felt like the nitrous gas from the dentist. Ugh!""

17567,"English teacher in Japan here. I formerly was a teacher in America. I'll preface this by saying that I much prefer teaching in Japan over America. The school environment is much more pleasant, and the parents and PTA are on my side completely.

While the Japanese school system produces disciplined students capable of high test scores, there are some major gaps in their education. Most education revolves around rote learning. It's true that my students are learning more advanced math and science in middle school than I learned in high school. And I teach in one of the poorest towns in my prefecture.

However, problem solving and critical thinking are a major weakness for students. If I ask my students to write a paper about their opinion of something, they either can't do it, or a large number of students have almost identical papers. If I ask them to write a paper on what they did for summer vacation, they have no problem, so it's not a language issue. Because Japan has a collective-minded society, many questions are seen as having a right or wrong answer, even if it's a matter of opinion. The same applies to problem solving; there's one correct solution.

Also, most of my students attend cram school at least one day each week, with high achieving students attending almost every day. That's around 2-3 extra hours of class/studying per week, most of it memorization and rote learning.

Given, based on my experience teaching in America, the current curriculum is lacking on teaching critical thinking than when I was a student, but achievement remains low in all subjects."

17604,"While I was never an alcoholic, I did used to be quite the heavy drinker. The realization came for me when I did a week sober just to prove I didn't have a problem... and I felt like hell and homicide the whole time. I ended up doing something like a 6 mo sober stretch. It sealed the deal when people seemed so much more upbeat about me after a couple weeks and were congratulating me. That stung.

Other signs included engineering reasons/ excuses to have booze, getting bitchy when I didn't have any, feeling ticked when people told me I was drinking too much (in all seriousness I was a handle a week guy -- 2/3 drinks a day will kill a handle without breaking the daily advised cap; you can imagine how that pissed me off when people would go get hammered for parties and weekends and they'd be treated as normal but people considered me a dysfunctional for drinking the same or less just spread out over a week instead...), having liquor in bits and parts throughout the day, obsessing over drinks. I did my budget at one point and my #1 expense was booze. I ultimately could never stay in budget on booze -- I would always end up going over. I didn't have any problems functioning; great student, good trooper, no law problems, no conduct issues, never alcohol-addled.

I never was an alcoholic, but I was becoming a drunk, and not just the kind who likes to but has to. I never let on to people just how it was becoming and still haven't, but in a way it was starting to get out of hand. My consumption is 90% reduced and most tellingly, the thought of never drinking again doesn't fill me with this kind of sheer horror as it used to."

A) There is one American plane out there, and another aircraft which cannot be identified.  
B) There is a possibility that this plane is carrying a nuclear weapon.  
C) When you approach an unidentified aircraft, they do not respond to any communication attempts.  
D) The still unidentified aircraft is wearing KAL 747 paint, but to assume the Americans are unable to paint their aircraft would be foolish.  
E) When you again try to establish communication, they try to throw you off.  
F) There is still a possibility that the aircraft carries a nuclear weapon.  
G) You are the only one who can pull the trigger. If you do not, and this plane does carry a nuclear weapon, hundreds of thousands will be killed, potentially many millions more given the state of increased political tensions.

17701,"Well what are they supposed to do? Not sell management treatments? A lot of management treatments for incurable conditions take things that would have either been debilitating or fatal in the past and make them instead a few added degrees of suck. Asthma, diabetes, HIV, depression, schizophrenia, and cystic fibrosis immediately spring to mind as diseases that can't be necessarily cured, but can be made so much less horrible with treatment. The phrasing of your post makes it look like you're attributing drug companies with either inducing the illnesses on purpose, or even deliberately withholding cures and peddling snake oil."

Most of their personal trainers have certifications that take maybe a few days to get, usually online or thru the coopers institute and they require no formal education.

In HPMOR, Harry was horrified when he learned about parseltongues. *Snakes are sentient?!* He then considered the possibility that the parseltongue magically grants intelligence to snakes, but a record of Slytherin sending a snake to talk to other snakes suggested that such an effect could be transmitted. That would mean exponential growth and sentience for all snakes. But what if it wasn't just snakes? What if someone wanted to talk to cows? He swore off meat. Then he considered a carrot on his plate. Wizards wouldn't consider the ramifications of trying to talk to carrots either.

I went through this same thing when I was a teen. I always looked a little bit older than I was, and I'd already grown to my adult height by age 12, so there were people who assumed my 6 y.o. brother was my son from then onward, if we ever went to a park or anything alone. And there were a lot of uncomfortable occasions where a grocery cashier, barista, or other total stranger would assume I was my father's wife and comment on it. I think some of them may have suspected that I was an abductee or some sort of child bride, rofl, because some asked things like ""So.... how did y'all meet?"" or ""how long have you been together?"" or a nervous ""you aged well!"" Like yeah, thanks, my anti-wrinkle secret is that I'm fifteen years old!"
17724,"If you're able to grow a full beard, you're going to grow one - regardless of how often you shaved. As kids go through puberty and as young adults get to grow more facial hair (still waiting) they are continuously shaving because it isn't passable yet. The more often they shave, is as a result of the growth they experience. I shave more because it's growing quicker. The relationship is because I grow more, I shave more, not, I shave more so it grows more. 

My Iranian friend, with full facial hair and back hair said it's because he shaved often. No Mohammed, it's because youre Iranian. You could grow back hair at 14, and I can count the number of hair follicles on my back on one hand 10 years later. "

17735,"We had a special-needs kid in one of my art classes in highschool that would regularly masturbate in class. If girls wore flip-flops or open-toed sandals to school he'd try to lick their feet. 

The teachers didn't do anything about it because they wanted to be inclusive. It was terrible. 

I understand that being inclusive is important. But an action that might benefit the one person, can be INCREDIBLY detrimental to everyone else in the classroom. You have to do what's best for the group, and if someone can not behave appropriately they need to be removed, because they hold everyone else back. Plain and simple. "

It does not always end badly, your just in a dangerous situation. Let the thing play, try to distract it, then run far away.

But again, it‚Äôs not just playing after midnight, you also have to open the door when it knocks. Seeing the hooves under the table is bad, but it‚Äôs also a good thing that you notice them before it‚Äôs too late, and gives you a chance to escape.

17761,"Or how many old people are in the neighborhood. When folks die or move to retirement homes, they rarely (never) leave their houses in a condition that will demand a high price. Combine that condition issue with the nature of selling a house that has been inherited and you can pretty quickly push the sale price of a house down quite a lot. Do that several times in a given neighborhood and it can have a real effect on home prices. All of these old folks blaming the brown people for a decrease in home values in their quite little neighborhoods, are often the actual cause of that decrease."
