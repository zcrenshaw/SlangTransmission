2,"them being a pedophile would make me wanna kill them, pedos are fucking sickening and don't deserve any better "
3,Letting my gut hang out
4,I never liked the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Not even the first one. Not even when I was a kid. I was ten when Dead Man's Chest came out and I remember that was all the other girls would talk about. They would talk about how much they loved Johnny Depp despite never seeing any of his other movies (not that I had either). I've never been able to sit through a Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

8,"Jimmy page, since I been loving you (Led Zeppelin). This dude is playing it on a tele which isn't ideal and he misses few tied notes and omits a sweep, but to be fair it's really not easy to play, and harder to get right every time.

12,Storytime?
13,"man if you dont like the food in minneapolis dont ever come to salt lake city. 

at least in minneapolis they can properly season and cook beef.

when i moved to SLC i thought i could go on a fun burger-quest and try a bunch of delicious burgers. turns out it was a quest to find just one burger that didnt have the flavor forcibly removed. "
14,"I don't mind paying for my food. We can discuss that before hand. I don't think it makes the date less of a date if we pay, you pay, or we split. If I'm having a nice time it's not a big deal if you need me tp chip in. Just let me know."
15,"My mom discovered this clip on YouTube a few years ago and now she has us watch it every Thanksgiving while we make dinner. She’s not usually a person for comedy, but she laughs hysterically every time. It’s become one of my favorite holiday traditions."
16,What was their reaction to getting free alcohol?
17,"I just watched White Christmas, holy shit this was sick. It wasn't even murder what he did, it was obvious manslaughter. And everything of this is just wrong. The whole blocking part, which blocks the person for you, the part on how you can be disallowed to get near a person without even doing any kind of offence.  The point that sexual offenders are blocked for every human as a fucking red block. And of course the slavery thing.   


There is one obvious thing I abhorr the most and that is slavery, how someone should be capable of doing that to themselves is absolutely beyond me. This whole world would result for me to fucking become part of some anti-government rebel group with a poison ready at all times so I can't get one of these chips into my head if they capture me.  


That said, lel, a high tech society and a 4 years old child doesn't know how to call the police? Yeah sure."

28,"Just tell us. It's not so much that we're all clueless idiots, we're also trying to be cautious and sensitive.

There's so much pressure in modern society for men to respect women's boundaries and to resist making unwanted advances. We hear about horror stories of false rape allegations, bad experiences women have with sexual harassment, and there's a myriad of subreddits like /r/niceguys and /r/creepypms that show countless examples of the kinds of shit women put up with when a guy *thinks* they're being flirted with. We don't want to be any of those guys. We're deathly afraid of it. That sort of reputation can destroy us.

We're all mature, consenting adults. Just ask him out! Do you know how much of a massive confidence boost it would be if a cute girl asked a shy/oblivious guy out?

35,"I respect your opinion but honestly I don't see how, BITTSM to me was a very generic sounding album while ASTROWORLD was a return to form in that he was going back to that experimental sound from Rodeo"
36,"I have a lot of respect for Waffle House.

First, those rules on the wall for everyone to see. The employees and patrons are all held to a standard of behavior.

Second, they teach people. I've never been in during a breakfast rush and NOT seen a 16 year old at his or her first job, learning the ropes and being given instruction by an older staff member. You don't get the next generation of good cooks without this. I'll wait a little longer for Jimmy to learn how to fry bacon right, because in 5 years he's going to be relying on that trade. It's important, and it's an education that schools can't give but that society needs people to get.

Third, the food is all made there and you can watch it being made behind the counter. I've eaten at enough places that slop cold food on a plate and pop it in the microwave. If the plate is hot, it's been cooked by Chef Mike and you shouldn't go back. That's the first thing I check when I eat out.

Fourth, all of the ones I've been in have been reasonably priced, clean, with polite service, and food cooked properly. Nothing under- or over- cooked. Probably because of point 2, they train their people."
37,My mom would fry it and make me eat it because we were poor and it's cheap. I can't stand it. 
38,"I've heard the opposite- that teaching kids chess only makes them good at chess.  Teaching them music, on the other hand, has all kinds of benefits."

44,She probably wanted Freedom Fries and she assumed the potatoes were the French part. Bless her heart.
45,"Babies R Us, was shit though.  They used a ton of floor space on baby furniture that you'd rather buy from Ikea or some other store.  Their baby food section was barely competitive with that found in large grocery stores, Walmart, or Target.  They had some neat baby accessories, but between Amazon and Walmart, you could cover just about everything you needed.    


In Houston at least, every goddamn Babies R Us on the north side was also right next to some ghetto ass neighborhood."

63,Meh. This was in the early 2000s so internet porn was in full swing.. It's like he thought black people were an alien species or something.
64,Thank god for Arthur CD's.
65,"As I said, knowing the truth is how you spot a lie, and trivial private things like that are unlikely to be known. Also, being trivial, they are inconsequential: they are not unlikely, the evidence threshold to accept such a claim is naturally low, and in most cases the consequences of falsely believing it are very low. It's easy to lie because no one cares, including the liar."

74,"Yeah, I completely get it, and it's something I argue with myself about.

 But it still feels better to make some sort of progress than to just accept that my rationalization is flawed and continue to eat all types of meat just to satisfy my pride of not being hypocritical, when I know that not eating beef alone has a positive impact. 

Edit to add: and it's not about the taste at all. Beef is my favorite by a long shot. It's about the availability and impact. 

I pass by a McDonald's at any point throughout the day with a line full of cars and can be fairly certain that the majority of those are getting some sort of beef product... And there is a McDonald's or something equivalent on about every street corner.. Which makes my realize the vast amount on beef being used on a daily basis.. 

Now I know chicken and turkey are also used in very large quantities, so I'm not going to argue my hypocrisy since we've established that I am, but there's my rational behind beef in general. "

76,"Either! Sometimes there is a cache container with things to trade, or “bugs” to help travel. Sometimes it’s just a logbook or paper scroll to sign. Sometimes is a beautiful vista or unexpected hidden gem of a place you’d have not known about if you hadn’t gone. Sometimes it’s the thrill of solving a multi-level puzzle to find the cache. There are different levels of difficulty, too. My family loves geocaching, we’ve done 200+ all over the USA. They are everywhere. Probably a few right in your locale. "

91,"How about the idea that being gay is the only thing nesscary for gay relationships.

Like I'm legit annoyed for gay people that every movie or TV show is just two gay people, often with nothing in common dating and we can't question it because they're gay.

Like in *The Office* when Pam says she only knows two gay people but they should be together even though they're not even remotely alike. Darryl tries to point this out and gets shut down."
92,"I always thought of this more as a quality of life thing. Like, I might die when I'm 75 whether or not I'm a daily smoker, but if I don't smoke, I might not spend those last few years wheezing painfully in a wheelchair."

107,We wouldn't be bedfellows with Russia for the wrong reasons.  
108,"19 agents in an agency of over 20,000 think Trump is taking them from their original purpose in his inane quest. They're right about Trump misuing the agency. But Trump is a moron, but you can't just abolish an agency that also investigates domestic terrorism because of one moron.

And calling me xenophobic because I think we should avoid knee jerk reactions doesnt make any sense. But apparently baseless ad hominem attacks have gotten you this far in life, so you may as well stick with what you know."
109,It actually requires some pretty amazing time management skills and split decision making. At least for someone worth their salt. Employers being lazy by hiring equally lazy and unmotivated children for the job is what’s perpetuating that idea. Very few people can do that job for very long. The physical demands alone are enough to send people running. That’s why a smart kitchen manager pays his dish dogs well. Last dish job I had was paying me $14/hr and I still left after 18 months for less pay at a less grueling and less soul crushing job. You motherfuckers saying shit like that wouldn’t last a full dinner rush lmao.

I think you should reconsider your actions, friend.

120,"I mention the film in an essay I’ve recently written for university. 
The major problem is that much of the book’s content couldn’t be directly depicted and sometimes could only be slightly hined at, due to the restrictions of the Hays Code. For example, pornography couldn’t even be directly referenced, hence Bogart’s line “she takes a nice picture”. "

How does Russia fight a war against the US and its European allies when it's economy is almost entirely based on selling raw materials to the West, and vice versa?

The world wars were fought as a result of decisions made in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain a balance of power in Europe. It's not inevitable that a third world war will occur, because those conditions no longer exist."

Those people will suffer greatly once they no longer have that safety net. As will the rest of us who needed those things, who didn't vote that way. 

I realize that some people had their premiums go way up under the ACA, and I didn't actually think that was a good system either - I think we should all be able to have health CARE equally like every other developed country in the world.

I have a family member who worked for the VA that is currently working as a doctor on a military base. They have said that VA hospitals are inconsistent and did not believe a friend was having a stroke because of their age and that the VA where they were working at treats the worst first, instead of treating patients that need treatment. I have lost friends and family members from this way of doing things in our area. But, some military clinics are worse.

One of their coworkers is in the military and is not board certified in a certain area of medicine and has over exposed countless patients to radiation. Despite several investigations, from the mishandling of patients to sexual assault and stalking other doctors, this doctor is still working, but will be retiring from active duty soon.

What scares me the most is the chance of hiring this doctor as a contractor in addition to the amount of underqualified people in the VA and military clinics."

https://qz.com/1184574/the-idea-that-everything-from-spoons-to-stones-are-conscious-is-gaining-academic-credibility/

There is, obviously, no concrete scientific evidence for the afterlife. There are people who have observed weird enough shit however that the possibility itself remains, and more broadly there's a lot about the nature of human consciousness that we don't really understand and that a purely materialistic conception of the universe fails to explain adequately. 

Most people have a pretty limited understanding of science. And I don't mean in the sense that they don't know how electricity works or something like that, I mean they have a pretty limited understanding of the *method* of science. It's aims, it's tools, and especially its limitations. On the latter, especially in recent times, there's been this assumption that the physical sciences are capable of observing and understanding all phenomena. 

To illustrate my point there, if god for example *does* exist, can you really find him by looking closely at the world? You can go to the store and buy a quilt, right? And you can examine every single stitch in that quilt, the kind of material, where it was made, what kind of machine made it...but even if you figure out every single thing about this quilt as a physical object, the *person* who made it is going to remain a mystery to you. You can only infer that this person exists. 

Using physical science to answer questions about the incorporeal is like trying to find the maker by looking at the quilt. The best you could ever hope for is to find something that *could* point to some hypothetical ""other"", but even then that's an assumption coming straight out of your own imagination, isn't it? 

Human beings instinctively crave for things to be put into a language we can easily comprehend. When it comes to shit like life after death we find ourselves incapable of fulfilling that instinct. 

Naturally this pisses a lot of people the fuck off.  "

234,"&gt;B&amp;Q

In the United States, they have workarounds for these type of things so they CAN prevent people from suing. My example is that when 2008 market crash hit, my father worked at a prominent Fortune 100 company (not the company itself at the time, it was a subsidiary.) He didn't get laid off, but when they cut off the subsidiary company and converted all those employees at that location back to the original big company name; they made them all sign a contract saying that they were going to be fired from the subsidiary company and be rehired at the big company, and that they'd lose all their pension years (my dad had 15 at the time). If they refused to sign, they'd be let go since the company that they were working for was being shut down. They couldn't sue if they refused to sign because that company technically no longer existed; and they couldn't sue if they signed because there was a clause saying they couldn't.

Pretty shitty all the loopholes that these big companies can find to screw over their employees."
235,"I was a shift manager closing with an assistant manager. Close at 9, out by 9:30 normally. 


On this specific day, we were short handed. It was just me, the assistant manager, and a cook. 


I asked the ASM if we could start Doing close prep early because I really had somewhere important to be after work. I don’t remember what it was, I just remember I *had* to be there on time. And she agreed. She said we’d start cleaning and breaking stuff down early so we could be out the door faster. 


Then 8:30 rolls around, when we were supposed to start. She decides she’s done working so she just left. Due to having a couple customers, I wasn’t able to do any of the close work before 9 without a second hand. 


My grievances had been piling up and this was the last straw. I told the cook to go home and I’d clean the store. After she left, I locked up and left the store destroyed and dirty. But just for some context, I worked at this place for 9 months. Not a single employee that was there when I was hired was there when I left. It was an extremely high turnover. Someone was hired/fired/quit every week. I had four general managers in 9 months. 


I came in the next day to drop off my work shirts and the owner was there. He came and sat me down before I had a chance to officially quit and said “listen, what happened last night is not okay. Unfortunately we’re going to have to let you go.” 


I laughed in his face and said “really? You didn’t think me ditching the store and then walking in here with a handful of shirts was a pretty good clue that I’ve already quit?” 


He did ask me why I quit and why I chose the manner I did. So I laid it for him and he goes “I’m sorry that happened, but you had a responsibility to this store”. I simply said back “not anymore I don’t!” And left. 6 months later he bankrupted the store and had to sell it back to Corporate for a fraction of its worth. "

She would also yell out in the halls about if I have my period and would throw tampons at me in the cafeteria in the name of feminism.

I also loved Tusk and Yoga Hosers.  They're my kind of weird as hell cinema.  I appreciate that he's making whatever weird shit he wants to make regardless of if people enjoy it.  He referred to it quite a few times as ""my stupid walrus movie"" and explained how the concept was developed from a random craigslist ad they discussed on a podcast.  I've had several ideas of about the same weird caliber that I wouldn't have the ambition, money, or audience for.  I do applaud him for doing the weird thing he wants and flexing his creative (albeit super weird) muscles.  I'm sure he was bored with the Jay and Silent Bob universe.  I am looking forward to the third movie in his weird Canadian trilogy.  I hope it's just as strange as the first two.  I've also very much enjoyed the random TV show episodes he directs of The Flash and a few other random things.  I'm not a Kevin Smith superfan by any stretch of the imagination, but I think he's doing the things he wants to do for fun.  That's a rare treat in life that we don't all get."

356,"Our current, useless apartment complex management did something similar. Shortly after we moved in (like within the week) we had a huge ant problem. No, we didn't leave food out or anything; I suspect they bug bombed the ever loving shit out of the apartment just before we moved in and it took that long for the population to come back. Anyway, after trying ant traps and sealing what areas we could, we tell management that we have an ant issue, yes we've cleaned up all the food, no it's not our fault, yes please send someone. They tell us ""the Terminix guy"" only comes around every other weekend and then schedule us for two weeks out. When he finally shows up he spends five minutes spraying all the doorways and windows and then leaves. That's it. The ants did not care. At all. When I called management again I got the response of ""there's nothing more we can do"" followed by subtle accusations that we simply must be leaving food out and it was somehow our fault.

Fortunately, management's incompetence did have an upside: the ant problem was actually able to be solved, and quite easily. We'd been using ant traps and so on, but the dry and gel type. The wife did some research and suggested we try a specific brand of ant trap, Terro. I managed to track down a store that had them and picked up a 4-pack. Holy fucking shit did that work. The traps all attracted so many ants they filled up with ant corpses within a few days. We ordered more and kept setting them out until they stopped getting clogged with ant corpses. A little over a week later and they were totally annihilated in the apartment proper, with a few stragglers on the porch occasionally. It cost us maybe $20 in traps and the ants stayed gone for a good 10 months. When they did come back, more traps, no more ants. 

I wonder what management is paying Terminix for their non-existent service? I bet it's a lot more than $20 per apartment. I mean, assuming they didn't just buy a Terminix shirt off eBay and have one of their maintenance guys go around with a spray tank full of water."

367,"I was a police officer for a number of years in a relatively high crime area of a major city.  At the time I was working midnights (10:30 pm - 7:00 am) and my beat was in a quiet area, mainly consisting of small single family homes and apartment buildings.  There was a particular residential street that occasionally became the site for ne'er-do-wells to do their bidding due to its close proximity to a major highway and some sketchier areas.  One particular evening in January (freezing) at around 3:00 am, I was driving through the block and noticed a car with the drivers side window cracked and the driver's seat reclined.  I couldn't make out any activity, but I rolled down my window and gave a very polite ""hey."" The driver's seat went upright in dramatic fashion with a very surprised and sweaty young man who looked like he had seen a ghost.  Before I could utter a single word, a head started to appear - seemingly coming from the lap of the young man.  This was the face of a very large, bald man - but I only noticed that after being struck by the amount of cherry red lipstick smeared on this gentlemans lips and face.  I again locked eyes with the driver, who blurted out ""look man - I ain't gay, but he is good!"". I very politely asked that they continue their carnal acts at an alternative location.  The male passenger with the lipstick became very upset and started to bitch.  The driver gave a friendly wave and drove off."

Then she gave me the prescription. I was shocked, hurt, and appalled by her reaction. Until I started taking the meds. They made me an actual emotionless robot. At the time I loved it. Like, a lot. Too much, in fact. My love for Lexapro was essentially the only thing I *could* feel. :/

EDIT to add that while religion isn't a weird deal breaker in and of itself, his rising hysteria over ""fixing me"", and yes, he used those words, his disrespect for my non belief, and his inability to accept a polite ""no"" about going to his church all added up to be one of the weirder dating experiences I've ever had.

492,"&gt;Nothing mandated or even encouraged their creation.

America's voting system ensured their creation.

Even in the 1700s and 1800s, few people had sufficient free time to spend researching all the nuances of the various people running for office. Political parties worked as a shorthand to allow voters to quickly narrow down candidates that they might want to vote for, and they foster cooperation and coordination between individual representatives, facilitating the smooth working of government. I can't think of a single democracy that hasn't had political parties; they're pretty much inevitable. 

Our voting system generally gives the win to whichever candidate has the most votes at the end of the election, regardless of whether they've won a majority. It's a winner-take-all, first-past-the-post system that gives all the power to the winning candidate and none to the supporters of other candidates, even if supporters of the losers outnumber the supporters of the winner. 

Say you have four major candidates in the general election; the winner might have only earned between 20 and 25 percent of the vote. Couple that with a turnout that often struggles to hit 50%, and you could have a candidate win the office despite being voted for by fewer than 10% of the population.

So the voters for the other three candidates, despite vastly outnumbering the voters for the winning candidate, are shut out of government. With that in mind, the voters who voted for the 4th-place finisher would've been better off throwing their support behind whichever other candidate best represented their views. That way, as a voter for that candidate, they would have some influence over the candidate and would have some say in the government. Well, once the 4th place voters do that, the 3rd place voters may as well do the same thing, until you end up with just two candidates.

That's what always tends to happen in a winner-take-all system: you're more likely to get some of what you want from a representative by aggregating your vote with as many other people as possible, which inevitably boils down to there being only two viable options. Eventually your two major political parties have a stranglehold on the government.

If you don't want that to happen, you either need some kind of ranked-choice voting or some kind of proportional representation.

493,"I have an old family friend who was diagnosed with cancer and his kids never visited him. He even stayed with us for a while when I was little, just because my grandma had a habit of taking people in. He eventually moved into a care community and had a beautiful little garden.

We went over to visit him a few months ago. He's doing pretty well, but we discovered that he'd been hiding a bunch of hospital visits and stuff from us (we found out because his garden had died because no one had come over to care for it). We didn't notice how lonely he was till we realised he couldn't even get anyone to water the garden for him. 

We're trying to organise days together to get him out of the house, so that's nice at least. "

496,"My asshole can fit a car tire. If anyone actually reads this, keep in mind that an average asshole of a human being can dilate between 2-4 centimeters. One car tire is roughly 500x200 cm. So yeah, fitting a car tire in my asshole is probably a world record and should deserve a Guinness book of world records entry. My first piece of advice if you think you can beat this record is don’t even try. My second piece of advice is (if the first piece of advice is ignored), start small and gradually move on to bigger things. Anal bleeding ruins many articles of clothing including but not limited to socks and shoes. Actually, while we’re on the topic of anal stretching and clothes being ruined, you should know once the anus is stretched beyond 8 cm, the sphincter is rendered useless. Gravity will just pull turds right out of your ass with no regard for anything. If your diet is fiber rich, this may not be as big of a problem, as solid turds can be easily disposed. However, if you are a fan of taco bell, be warned that splash damage is a very real thing. It’s best during the anal stretching period to invest in a wide range of butt plugs. Not only will this stem the tide of fecal matter making dramatic exits through what can only be described as an industrial laundry chute, but with the proper fitment the plugs will maintain your latest stretch during downtime. Proper resting with a press fit butt plug is good and allows the body to accept the new monstrosity that is the size of your asshole. Anal fissures are a by-product of stretching too rapidly without the necessary downtime and recovery. Anal fissures are extremely painful, especially when infected by wet bowel movements. The only benefit of anal stretching is lack of fart noise. Like a balloon stem, the known fart noise is caused by air movement vibrating the orifice it exits. Noise intensity are directly proportional to air speed velocity, while harshness of pitch is indirectly proportional to size of hole. With an escape hatch the size of a mini-sub, air speed velocity is virtually zero, thus no noise is heard. Any gas produced by the body and exiting the colon tends to just waft out as produced. I’m not even sure the action of “farting” is a thing when your asshole can fit a small adult inside of it. I suppose technically there is some air movement, but it would be no more significant than running a leaf blower through the grand canyon. Finally, it should be cautioned to never leave your expanded asshole uncovered, as birds, fish, and reptiles will nest in discovered cave dwellings. This then becomes a health and safety violation in many public settings that is best to generally avoid. I personally recommend having a sealed traffic cone or small inflatable raft handy when leaving your asshole alone for more than 5 minutes. Butt plugs are an option but only if you are staying under 24 centimeters in diameter. Greater than 24 centimeters, and the butt plug industry will have to create a custom sized plug (which is costly and generally best to avoid). So in conclusion, when going to the extremes of anal stretching, keep realistic goals, but always prepare ahead of time for a size you may think unattainable. Your anus will surprise you.

They were never a respected camera brand and didn't go after the professional market to solidify their own brand. They were reliant on selling their sensors to other brands and they got out competed. They also had a huge amount of resources tied up in film infrastructure, and they weren't very well diversified. 

Other companies like Sony and Fuji are huge conglomerates with all kinds of different irons in the fire and even the smaller brands like Nikon and Canon have big industrial and scientific imaging devisions. Kodak had film technology and manufacturing primarily and evidently, digital sensor technology alone couldn't keep them afloat.

535,"You are misunderstanding irrationals. For example, imagine a ""random"" infinite number that never contains a 9. One example would be 0.121121112111121111112... It is an infinite irrational number (take my word on this).  But it does not contain a sequences of all numbers.

There are numbers that contain any finite sequence of digits, and we call them normal. The easiest example is [0.1234567891011121314151617181920212223...](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_constant) basically putting the natural  numbers in order after a period. The precise definition of normality, I should add, is that every sequence of numbers is just as likely to appear as any other sequence of equal length. So within a normal number, such as the one above, if you pick three random digits, they are just as likely to be 428 as they are to be 590. 1/1000. 

It is proven that almost all irrational numbers are normal, in any base (we're talking base 10, but we don't have to). This means that if you could pick a random irrational, you would pick a normal one with certainty, though it does not mean that all irrationals are normal. There are uncountably infinite non-normal irrationals*. Despite that proof, i is very hard to prove that a specific number is normal. Another example of a number proven to be normal is [0.23571113171923...](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_constant) which are all the primes in order. 

As of yet, π is not proven to be normal although we highly suspect it is. 

*Uncountably infinite means ""more than the rational numbers."" There are just as many rational numbers as there are natural numbers, but the irrationals are infinitely more. "

For Holy Week (or Passion Week), the schedule gets bumped up a little bit, with Vespers for the “following” day being served earlier in the day, to make room for the morning service - Matins - later. This is because the schedule of services gets very crowded toward the end of the week and Easter (Pascha). So you do end up with both Great Friday services served on Thursday, with the 12 Passion Gospels read on Thursday evening.

557,"Not as horrible as some on here, but something nasty that was ""going on"" that never clicked with me until adulthood.

In the 1980s my Uncle and Aunt moved from the English Midlands to an affluent part of Glasgow. They had a huge Victorian merchant's house, many bedrooms, and our family visited every school holiday as we couldn't really afford a holiday then so this was our ""holiday"".

It being the 1980s playing out in the street on bicycles was what kids did. Every year the same thing happened.

We would be out in the street with the local kids, and then some of the local tough kids would arrive. One or more of the neighbour's children would then scurry off and have an animated conversation with them. Toughs would be pointing at us, the English kids. Neighbour's children would be seemingly defending us. I remember one girl saying ""No, no they're fine, they're X and Y's cousins from England!"" in a strangely desperate ""please believe me"" fashion.

Then the toughs would ride over and start demanding to know what school we attended.

(At this point, any redditor from the west of Scotland, or Ulster will know what was going on. I had absolutely no idea.)

So, baffled as I was, I'd have this conversation saying that ""well we go to schools near Wolverhampton, you won't know them"".

No matter. Being pressed for the school's name.

So I'd tell them and they'd think about it, and then get a slap on  the arm and a declaration of ""Hey, yee alright pal!"". And off they go.

And then the local children would all relax and the rest of the week would be fine.

I could never work out what these bizarre conversations were all about. It wasn't until several decades later when I was working and car-sharing with a Glaswegian Catholic that I found out and only when he made a throwaway comment about not putting your primary school name on a CV when applying for a job in the west of Scotland.

They were basically trying to sniff out if we were Roman Catholics. The friendly children were worried we might be and there would be a scene if we were asked and said the wrong thing. When I didn't answer the ""what school name?"" answer with something like ""we go to St. Bernadette's of the Sacred Heart and Father O'Reilly is our headmaster!"" they assumed we were Prods and so acceptable for the neighbourhood.

The shocker was that this was thirty years ago in a beautiful and incredibly expensive suburb of Glasgow, the very definition of middle class.

If you use the basic definition of racism, that it means to hate someone based on skin color, then you’re incorrect. Plenty of black democrats hate white people, Asians, and Hispanics.

Unfortunately no one (not even MoCo) makes a bike that has the raw potential for customization like older harleys did. I tuned out on factory stuff when they rolled out the twin-cam, and the new water cooled abominations are even worse. They had multiple, excellent opportunities to keep their brand image alive while expanding in new directions (FXR, Buell, the co-designs with Porsche) and instead focused on chasing an imploding market in baggers, too many barely different models and obscenely priced accessories.

A friend I new my entire life also ended a relationship and she convinced me we should get married because she had a young daughter and needed medical insurance and we were friends and there didn't seem to be any downside, I already blew the sanctity of marriage down the toilet on my first marriage, might as well do it again for a tax break. Turned out everything I knew about her was a total lie, she was about 200,000 dollars in debt, she was on anti depressants and was bipolar as fuck. I filed for divorce and She spent the next two years milking me dry, spending all my savings, getting herself out of debt and driving me into it. Then she ran off with a coworker who was married. it took me another two years to get the divorce finalized as she ran up another 80,000 dollar in debt in my name. She played the system so hard, got her daughter to tell lawyers and judges I was her father, all kinds of shady shit, I was fighting the courts like crazy, everything was in her favor and I wasn't given a chance.  luckily I finally didn't have to pay her alimony or child support for a child that wasn't even mine, all it cost me was every thing I every made, my house, credit, savings so It was a pointless victory.

My mum lives a few towns over with her boyfriend who is much younger and to be quite honest he's an asshole, actually beats her and stuff. She's addicted to pain meds and so is he. She pretends to be a good mother and grandmother but every time she tries to be nice I get a weird feeling and I feel like I can see straight through her charade and it makes me cringe.

My dad lives by himself, he's given up the booze the smoking and given up on relationships aswell. Can't see him being with in a romantic relationship again. He's a good dad to us lot, there if you need him but I think he's lonely and still hasn't gotten over the crap that happened or his love for my mum.

I suppose I'm the black sheep, I can't manage to hold down jobs or anything, tbh I haven't ever had a real job and I've only ever had one interview which I failed at.

You have an illness that makes it hard to understand those friends are there, but please know they are, and they love you, and they're maybe not even great at saying it, but they would howl."

801,"I'd shift the time window back to 1975-95  but otherwise I completely agree with you. The new hires my company is picking up that are fresh out of college for the most part have no understanding of their local computer versus a network drive versus hosted online. And that's just one of many examples. I was born in 77 and started having computer classes in middle school when they were pretty new, writing very basic programs that required an understanding of how a computer actually works. I'm running into a lot of trouble training people today because the fundamental understanding of what's behind the GUI just isn't there. And this is in a hardware and software engineering company."

912,"I think the biggest problem is that many people, including news outlets, social researchers, etc., use the term 'racism' and 'racist' in a lot of different ways, just like happens with so many other squishy words like this. I can try to at least offer the perspective on why some people argue that these are different. I'm not a sociologist, so I may get this wrong.

I'm sure most people would agree that treating someone poorly because of their race/ethnicity is bullshit. That's still generally described as prejudice based on race.

However, sociologically speaking, racism is the term used when both prejudice based on race *and* some form of social power intersect to create some kind of social effect. I think it's generally used at a larger scale to describe the bigger picture... what happens on a broader scale when prejudice combines with power and how that impacts the lives of those whom the prejudice is directed toward. Particularly, when prejudiced people have some sort of social or economic power and then apply that to discriminate, you get a system of racism that can negatively impact those groups.

So they're connected, it's just that sociologically speaking it's helpful to have separate terms to describe these different phenomena. But of course when others just use the term ""racism"" to describe all the aspects above, it can cause some friction when we're using the same words but meaning different things."

He spit when he talked and didn't give you enough space when he spoke to you. He had numerous health issues, and spoke about them (or showed them off) constantly, there was one time he had pus filled boils all over his legs.  He'd eat in the office, which would be ok if he wasn't a very loud open mouth chewer. He'd leave specks from his food all over the front of his clothes.  He'd eat chips all day and open and close the crinkly bag between each chip. He had narcolepsy and would just pass out and start snoring in the afternoons.

I genuinely feel bad that I broke off talking to her after the class ended, because she seemed to sorely lack many friends. But when you talked to her personally, the only topic she would talk about was creepypasta characters. She’d insist on showing me really annoying videos on the level of shipping Jeff the Killer with Freddy Krueger that seemed like they were made by 12 year olds.

If you tried to talk about any other subject, she’d change it back and bring up another cringe-worthy YouTube video. I really do feel bad for her, but it was too much."

I worked with him for about two years, and there was just so much about this guy that made me want to slam his head into my desk and staple his ears down until he suffocated. 

He had horrible allergies, and instead of using a tissue to blow his nose he'd *constantly* (I'm talking once every two minutes or so) suck up what sounded like a gallon of snot into his head. He sounded like a muddy pig having a fight with a vacuum cleaner.

Also, he was one of those people that did not stop talking. Even if nobody was in the room with him he was talking. He'd stand at my desk and just talk and talk and talk, and what made it worse was that he was a mumbler who spoke with a really low, quiet voice and you couldn't understand a word he was saying. It was ""blehblehnurmadurdurdurblehbluhbleh"" all day every day. 

He also liked to tell really racist, sexist stories about customers at his old job that he fantasized about beating the shit out of while customers were in the office.

I had reached the end of the street, where a park was established. It is here I usually turn around and head home. There is no parking lot for this particular park, so people often park their cars parallel to the sidewalk surrounding it.

This day, something told me to look down. The sidewalk around me was absolutely covered in small puddles of phlegm and saliva... I had noticed too late. A big glob of spit struck me in the arm and shirt. 

Two young guys were sitting in the car parked right beside me, smoking. They were apparently spitting out their windows after coughing. The passenger was spitting on the sidewalk side.

I stopped walking and asked ""really?"" 

The passenger seat guy stammered ""o-oh shit! I-I'm sorry!"" 

""Do you at least have something for me to wipe it off?""

Without missing a beat, the guy pulled out two napkins from the glove compartment and handed them to me.

""Thank you,"" I said, taking the napkins. I continued my walk back home, wondering why he couldn't just spit into the napkin instead of the sidewalk (you know, where people walk). Showered first thing when I got home.

I recognize it's really hard for senior citizens to hand in their license because it's usually their last piece of I and they've had it their entire life, and I also recognize that the licensing agency of whatever country they're from (e.g. RTA for Australia, DMV for US) often feel sorry for these people and keep giving the license to them, but it's super dangerous. Especially when they're approaching their 80s or 90s. My late Great Nan was responsible enough to hand hers in after going through a test and having it handed back to her.

992,"Oof, as a novelty account, I won’t disagree with you; the novelty of novelty accounts has waned over time. But because I think about this a lot, I’d like to add another contributing factor: reddit has changed, too.

In response to T_D, the algorithm was changed to really reduce the visibility of “controversial” content. This hurt OC posts and comments, too. Novelties and OC on reddit has always been hated and downvoted by a grumpy minority. I won’t unpack why I think they do this, but it used to not matter; their downvotes were nothing against the thousands of upvotes of novelties’ fans. But now a drop of controversiality damages visibility so much more. So a vanilla, hackneyed but “safe” pun with 100 upvotes and no downvotes has more visibility than OC with 1000 upvotes and 100 downvotes. I’ve noticed this impacting Sprog’s visibility a lot over the last year, and as far as I can tell his support and his quality are as great as ever. Only the algorithm has changed.

I have a lot of political distaste for Trump, but privately what hurts me the most is that he ruined reddit, my favorite place. I know that’s stupid and petty, but I’m being honest. I was never here for the fake internet points, but it was nice *to be heard*. I was proud of my effort (even if I can acknowledge my style was not for everyone). Frequently getting “out-seen” by one word comments since the 2016 election and its fallout has seriously limited my motivation to create for this place.  Maybe it’s been a blessing for me—because I’ve been enjoying writing for more real life muses—but I’m sad for reddit. In hiding political bullshit, it’s also hidden some magical stuff people do."

1019,"When I was a sophomore in high school I went to spend the night at a friend's house. This was in the 80's so there were no cell phones or internet. My mom dropped me off and I went to the door. Nobody answered, but I heard voices around the back of the house. They had a pool so I just assumed everyone was out by the pool so I walked around back. What I didn't know was that I had gotten the time wrong and I was about 3 hours early. Instead of finding him and his parents, I found his cousin (who lived with them) and two of her friends. All three girls were seniors at my high school and all three were hot and popular, and I just walked in on them sharing a joint while sunbathing topless. 

She had been grounded and wasn't supposed to have anyone over much less be having a topless weed pool party. They cut me a deal, they would skinny dip and I could hang out and watch so long as I promised to never tell anyone this happened. I agreed and for the next 30-45 minutes I basically had to lay face down on an air mattress in the pool because I had constant wood checking the girls out.

As much as I wanted to, I never said anything. I was a very nerdy kid so if my fellow art kids and nerds knew that I had seen three of the hottest girls in school naked, they would have lost their minds. "

Plus they exceed the 1000CC limit so they can't compete in the same races. If you want maximum speed for your money, a BMW S1000RR or a Kawa ZX10R outperforms anything Ducati makes in the price range. If you look at races that use road based bikes, like the TT or any endurance race series, you will find Suzukis, Yamaha, BMW, and Kawasaki on the grid, hardly anything italian. To be fair they do well at pikes peak but that's mostly because of one particular model that happens to conform well to the rules.

Ducatis sell because motorcycles are not just about performance, and because it makes no difference in real life if your bike has 170 or 200hp. I own two Ducatis and I wouldn't trade them for any other bike, but I don't have them because of their specs."

Facebook, youtube, etc are all passive in including content and active in removing content. The threshold for actively pushing out content is much different than actively removing existing content.

I think most people feel there is a difference between not actively saying something and actively prevent others from being heard, especially when there seems to be base in how policies are being enforced. 

To draw an analogy to the enforcement, think of it as the difference in speed tickets between white and black americans. It's generally accepted that is certain places minorities have a lower threshold for receiving enforcement than whites, and pretty much everyone thinks that's wrong. 

If those media organization have a lower threshold for removing right leaning content than left leaning content, doesn't that seem wrong, at least morally if not legally?"

But if there are impurities between the layers, it may create a pattern, but it won't weld up, and it'll delaminate. So there's still uncertain about how Damascus steel was made."

And just take a deep breath, okay? You've already outlined your worst-case scenario: you have to take a gap year (or maybe just a gap semester?) to work full-time, then go back. It's easy to think about that from where you are now, emotionally, and think it's impossible. People do it all the time, though. The last I checked (2015), the average time to graduate with a 4-year degree is 6 years, and one of the top reasons for that is financial difficulty.

Personally, I had to take a gap year when I was in school because I had to drop out and transfer to a school closer to home due to personal/family problems. It 100% felt like the end of the world when I made that decision. I worked full-time for that year and took a couple of gen eds at a local community college to save money for when I went back to school full-time. It was a weird sort of lull of a year, but I actually felt more energized and focused when I went back to school. Kind of like, ""Okay, I'm in the home stretch now.

And a side rant is whenever I get asked about what race I am. Like seriously mind your own business. I can't help that I look some sort of off colored Mexican. I've been called Mexican, biracial, Hawaiian, and India Indian. Yet my racial background is quarter Native American, quarter Italian, quarter German and quarter Irish. I can't help that I have a natural dark complexion so don't go making stereotypical claims. This also doesn't help that I'm the odd one out in the family due to not being pale like the rest of the family. This has led to multiple adoption questions despite that I look exactly like my dad.

The characters pretty much only get stronger from there... and yet they still settle things with punching fights.  On planets.  At some point, shouldn't they be pretty much obliterating planets every time they fight?  Shouldn't the universe basically be like Metropolis at the end of Man of Steel?  "

I'm working on [All Clear Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allclearweather.android) for Android. It's US-only for now, as that's the only weather data I could get. I tried to buy international weather data from IBM/Weather Channel, but part-way through development they cancelled all their API key plans, took away the payment form, and hiked prices like 5x. So I'm using the free US data for now and will expand internationally when I find and integrate a good international weather source.

In D&amp;D this is actually an issue brought up in the DM's guide in the context of world building.  If a Pegasus/Winged Horse can fly, then it must either be very light or have super massive wings.  If it's super light then it'd have hollow bones like birds, which would make it to frail to be used as a mount. If it had a 100' wingspan you'd end up with a horse that drags 90' worth of wings in the dirt behind it.

1382,"Easy. I wouldn't buy any red flags. Just rainbow flags. Then I'd raise those, like three in my yard, and watch the property value in my neighborhood full of conservative seniors plummet. Then I'd buy up all of the houses at Rock bottom prices, knock them all down, and build the first gay theme park /water park combination park ever. We'd be an educational park with rides like the Harvey Milkshake and the StoneWalrus. Of course, I also live in a southern city, so pretty much half of the other neighborhoods are also conservative. My theme park would also lower property values for those, and with the money it generated I would buy them too, surrounding my park with housing for my employees and a lot of air B&amp;Bs for guests who prefer not to use hotels. Eventually, the entire city will consist of either liberal/progressive neighborhoods or my theme park, which will be a huge sprawling tacky mess architecturally like a giant version of 1990s shopping mall, at that point, everyone in the city will love the giant gay theme park (tm) and so property values will then skyrocket. Disney will offer to buy me out as a result of the sheer billions of dollars that my park brings in every year, and I'll agree to sell with the contingency that I'm allowed to see Walt Disney's frozen head. This, they counter, will be a problem, because dear old Walt was actually already defrosted in 2013 as his brain was transplanted into the body of a strapping young celebrity that 'died' in the same year so that said actor's brain could be transplanted into the first Android (property of the Walt Disney Company). So I spend the weekend with the 'new' Walt, frolicking around Disney World and riding the tea cups a hundred times, which, try as I may, I was never able to replicate the joyful experience of with my similar ride, as everyone kept spilling said tea. Walt says that Disney world is the only place he can go and not be recognized, and that he has decided to venture into space with his Android friend, Paul, and that he'd love it if I could join them and several other friends in their Martian chateau. I would love this, but I tend to avoid travel because I have a preference for cinnamon gum ONLY, and often places that I travel only offer fruit or mint flavors. Walt reveals that, alas, there is no cinnamon gum on Mars, and that I would also have to give up extra crunchy peanut butter and pistachio ice cream. Horrified, I decline. But we'll always have that weekend in the park to remember eachother by, and whenever I look into the sky and see that faintly red dot, I'll think about Walt, and how it's so stupid that it's Walt fucking Disney and they can't even get cinnamon gum up there? Lame. "

These people have so much money and power, and are capable of playing global civilization like a chess game, that they can effectively create situations (ie “terrorist attacks, economic failures, etc) that allow beneficial legislation to pass, which in turn allows them to destabilize countries, bringing about more (profitable) war.

Another side effect of world war is massive global population loss, which is beneficial to stabilizing the overpopulation/available resources problem.

If it seems like tensions are running high between the current leaders of nations from around the world right now, it’s because it’s time for World War III to fatten the wallets of wartime profiteers and curb the overgrown population currently straining available resources."

Chick-fil-A gets to be eccentric about politics and opening hours because they serve good chicken. Papa John's Pizzas are just not good enough for them to be eccentric, and they were promptly forced to stop being as eccentric.

Basically, businesses known for being eccentric are going to be good at what they do. Google is good at making search engines.

I suggested a lot of changes she could make (basically revised the whole paper), she resubmitted it, and got...a B- again.

1470,"This also came about because it allows the monarchy to delegate the responsibility of resource gathering to support mounted cavalry instead of having a more centralised, less efficient system.

Also: the English colonies in the Americas maintained feudal structure. Early colonies were overseen by a governor who was from the noble class, and the colony's lands belonged to them. The working class people they brought with them were in much the same situation, and in a great many cases were under indenture contracts...and often were sent to the new world against their will. (Lots of debtors, Irish an orphans were rounded up and shipped away to be used as slave labor.)

In the revolutionary period, a handful of elite still owned the majority of the colonies. People like Washington owned huge percentages of the new states. And since you had to own land to vote, it kept these neofeudal ""lords'"" interests."

Now you're saving $800 a month from your salary, while maintaining the same lifestyle you were before. Put like $500 of that towards whatever your highest-interest debt is that is being drawn directly from your bank account, and you'll pay it off quickly. Now roll however much that payment was before adding the $500 to it into an investment account, and apply the $500/mo your next-highest interest debt. Keep that up until everything is paid off and you're putting away a ton into investment/retirement accounts, all while living day-to-day off of the suitcase money and the $200/month you're withdrawing to avoid suspicion, plus building up $300/month in your bank account so you can afford big-ticket items outright."

1515,"&gt;  I have converted 5000€ of dirty money in on average ~4860€ which are now washed and legal tender.

That's not washed and legal tender, maybe you misunderstand the concept of what you're actually trying to do?  Money laundering is about creating fictitious ways to report dirty money as legal income (and thus being able to place it into the financial system without questions/concerns).  Money laundering is not just exchanging a dollar for another dollar with a different serial number.  Hence why all the stereotypes about cash heavy businesses (laundromats, gas stations, bars, etc) where you can easily falsify receipts and claim higher income than reality.  I.e. a restaurant that normally earns 10k/week suddenly has receipts and cash in the drawer for an additional 2.5k of bar tabs, the extra 2.5k is taken out of the 750k and reported as income for the business, thus having taxes paid and entering the financial system as legitimate tender.

&gt; What is so suspicious about me going into the casino again, on another day, with another 5000€? Part of it, the 4860€, could be from my last run to the casino.

Because the casino keeps records of individual players winnings and losses.  You're right you can fly under the radar with taking in 5k eur and losing every time, but then when you go to deposit 500+k into your banking institution the IRS is going to be asking numerous questions for which you don't have an answer (aka how did you get that money and what amount of it should you be paying taxes on).  You can't say it's gambling winnings as they'll have a record of your losses from the casino.  So you're still stuck with the ""fuck you, you didn't pay taxes on this massive amount of money"" problem."

So, you get the cheque for say $1000, deposit it, and the bank shows that you have $1000 extra in your account even though they haven't verified _anything_ other than what you gave them looks reasonably like a cheque. If you fall for the scam, you send the scammers $900, and get to keep your generous $100 commission or whatever they've baited you with (you do this expecting future earnings that would outweigh the $1000 you could just keep). Later when the bank gets around to actually verifying the cheque, they take back the full $1000, leaving you $900 poorer.

If, on the other hand, you deposit the cheque and _don't_ send any money to the scammers, the bank just credits your account, then debits the same $1000 a few days later, leaving you with a profit/loss of $0. Except they're probably arseholes, so they'll charge you a fee for depositing a cheque that bounced."

We met in spring this year in a hobby club. I always thought she was attractive and a fun person. But I was in a long distance relationship, but later that ended. Meanwhile we became very good friends over a couple of months. During this time I realized that I was really into her. I wanted to confess my feelings towards her but then she told me that she might be moving away for a job opportunity. So I decided not to tell her that. But in a couple of weeks she confirmed that she will be leaving. We also used this time to bond a lot and became more closer. There was a moment I was just about to express my feelings, but seeing that how sad she was already for leaving this place. Saying goodbye to her friends. I thought it would be a bad idea to add something more to her worries. So I never confessed but was there when she needed.

Now she is in another country, it's been few weeks. Maybe she might return here after her new project has ended. We have talked on skype to catch up and chat when we can here and there.

We are in europe, so the country she went to is just a hour flight away. So I'll be visiting her very soon. Now I'm  thinking of confessing my feeling to her when I'm there. I don't expect her to feel the same or give me an answer. I just want to get this out of my chest. I know this might change our friendship forever, which it will; for better or worst.

I am not sure what  to do.

Also she has asked me not to book any hotel or Airbnb for my stay as I should stay at her place (she's renting a room in an appartment there) as she has an extra mattress. So I don't know, if I'm staying at her place and I confess my feeling to her during my stay, it can be super awkward if she doesn't take it well and then I have to be near her :( "

Real good story, but he told it so detached it couldn't be anything but fake. Grandpa gave him $10, the guy peeked into the car and saw me in the passenger's side, started asking my grandpa if he was my dad, how old was I, what school did I go to, did I have a boyfriend, etc. Got my gramps to spill all these details about me (including my birthday and how long I've been wearing glasses, like what the fuck?) and ended up getting about $100 from him. My grandpa wouldn't listen when I tried to rush him into leaving and I was too afraid to get out of the car and walk back into work. I've never been more uncomfortable in my life. Tried to ask gramps why he gave him so much money when he was obviously a scammer creep after, but he just scolded me and said I could never know how bad people had it, and he had a nice talk with him so clearly he was telling the truth.

I was always raised that boots, jeans, and a nice shirt was acceptable business attire; and, If the boots and hat are nice enough, then they are acceptable formal wear. Its just a cultural thing and its not exclusive to Texas. Pretty much anywhere where rodeo culture exists you will find these things, including Panama. 

But that doesn't mean that we are backwards or behind the times. for instance A family friend of mine used to ride saddle bronc at the collegiate level while studying electrical engineering.

1632,"Yeah, but the difference is Corvettes sell. Enough to where they’re supposedly developing a whole new platform for it. People lust after them while they’re young, but can’t afford it yet. The reason the Corvette is the “old man” car is because all those old dudes kept their dream of owning a Corvette alive. They buy them when they’re older because they can afford them. It’s the high performance car for the working person. 

The used ones are a bargain too. I almost bought a really nice C5 for $11k and I’m 25. I’m definitely hooked and plan on owning one some day. Guess I’ll be an old guy in a Vette some day lol. But a lot of my peers do own used C4, C5 and C6 models. 

Whereas Harley...they’re priced out of young peoples budgets and not many young people think they’re cool any more. They also don’t perform or compete. Corvettes are timeless and while expensive, considering what they compete against, are a tremendous value. Harleys are not a tremendous value, except in the resale department it seems. But I expect that market to dry up quick too. "

1643,"Not that horrible.

I was nine or ten, home sick and eating a chicken noodle soup lunch at the kitchen table. Dad had stayed home to watch me; he had the kind of job he could occasionally do that with.

The front doorbell rang, and my Dad went to see who it was. Our house was a split foyer, so the door was down some stairs, effectively blocking sound and vision from anyone in the kitchen.

Eventually I noticed that Dad was still at the door, and had been there for a long while. I got up from my chair and shuffled over to the top of the stairs to see what was going on.

Dad was talking to an older man, blond with a mustache and a green jacket. The man noticed me, pointed past Dad, and said “That must be little TenAndTwoAndBack! I brought something for you, my man!” I remember that clearly. No one ever called fifth-grade boys “my man” in my town.

The man and Dad walked up the stairs to the kitchen. Blondie introduced himself as Roger, “an old pal of your dad’s from college,” and started talking about all the fun things he and my dad had done when they were at UVA. Before he could go into much detail, Dad said “Yeah, those were good times back in the 70s. So what brings you here today, Roger?”

Roger lowered his voice and began talking to Dad in earnest. I couldn’t quite hear him (ears stopped up sick), but one of the things I remember him talking about was a problem with his esophagus, and how he needed a test to see if it was cancer. I kind of lost interest after that because I was sick and hungry and a little shit kid to be honest. Dad said something, Roger said something with a hangdog look, and Dad led him back down the stairs to the front door. After the door closed, Dad came back upstairs, and life was back to (sick) normal.

Of course later when I was in college, I asked Dad about his old buddy Roger, and got the reply “Roger’s no buddy of mine.” With some hindsight, I figured out that Roger was an acquaintance of my father’s, and an addict who had flunked out of school. Fifteen years later, he had hitched and walked to our house to try to play on my dad’s sympathies to score cash for some bullshit or other. If I hadn’t come over to see what was up, my dad would have never let him in the house. 

Dude never did give me what he’d supposedly brought for me. "

Diamonds are basically monopolized by just one company hence why they are so expensive and the company generates scarcity, I think it was in the 20s when they launched an ad campaign with a fake statement that its customary for the diamond in an engagement ring to be worth at least three salaries of the person giving the ring and of course it paid off and diamons have become a statement to one's wealth more than anything, however modern day generations seem to now idealize individuality and uniqueness more than flaunting one's assets so a lot of people are just not bothering with diamonds, hell I won't either... I'm acutally going to get the stone for my gf's engagement ring myself and polish it and everything, know someone who is a jeweler and is willing to help with the ring part and sticking the stone on it, I don't want to divulge any details because I'll be honest I don't want others to copy this idea, but my train of thought is that whenever her friends will compare engagement rings and say how much they cost, she can say: oh my boyfriend mined this stone himself and polished it and everything, he says that if you love someone you need to show you are willing to work hard for them, not throw a bunch of money at them. ha, how many fiancess can say that about their bf's, I don't need to be rich to give her something special, I'm willing to work hard for it instead."

No one realized that lives were lost until later that night. Firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies of the eight deceased teenagers. The bodies were burnt beyond recognition and, at first, were thought to be mannequins. The cause of death for all were determined to be smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. These eight teenage corpses were placed into white body bags to let emergency personnel differentiate real corpses from charred mannequins in the dark.”*"

Like the VA, however, it won't work if it's undermined and underfunded. 

All I know is that our current system costs Americans more than twice that of any other country on earth. That's MASSIVE. Not only is the system almost impossible to navigate (ever try to deal with insurance?) and extremely anti-consumer, but the overhead costs created by our system are literally orders of magnitude higher than in other countries. When you go to an ER and get a $2,000 bill, almost $1200 of that goes to people who deal with insurance and administration. It's just nuts. From a capitalistic standpoint, it's grossly inefficient, money that's being spent on literally nothing but inefficiency. 

Personally, I am pro socialized healthcare. But I'm open to other ideas, just so long as they do away with the horrific mess we've created here and if they don't leave poor children and older folks to die if they can't afford care. If there's an alternative to socialized healthcare, I'm totally happy to hear it, but the only ones I have heard will result in lots of innocent people dying."

&gt; For the sample as a whole, heterosexuality was the most stable identity. For women,
bisexuality and homosexuality were equally unstable and significantly
less stable than heterosexuality, suggesting that sexual
orientation identity fluidity is a pattern that applies more to
sexual minority women than heterosexual women. For men,
heterosexuality and homosexuality were both relatively stable
compared to bisexuality, which stood out as a particularly
unstable identity. This pattern of results was consistent with
previous findings and helps to address methodological limitations
of earlier research by showing the characteristics of a
population-based sample of heterosexual, homosexual, and
bisexual identified men and women over time.

In an earlier narrower longitudinal study, 77% of bisexual women changed their self-reported sexual orientation during the study period.  

&gt;, the two groups with the highest self-report of consistency in sexual orientation identity were heterosexuals (97%) and homosexual men (61%), who reported considerably more consistency than bisexual men (34%), homosexual women (35%), and bisexual women (23%).

Accepting who I am allowed me to overcome the never ending degradation that was happening to my beliefs and lifestyle. I was able to make choices more clearly since I knew what I wanted and ignored anything that would've delayed me from reaching a conclusion."

1948,"Oh man. Our travel agent made our last trip super easy. Booked the hotel, flights, car. Even recommended a great place we did drop the dogs off at while we were gone.

1950,"Sometimes you don't want coworkers or classmates knowing where you live, much less going inside your house. You have easy access to coffee and some food to hold you for a few hours.

I would have my coworkers over in my hotel room if we had to meet, but would never imagine asking them to come over to my apartment. Not to mention that some of us have SOs who probably wouldn't appreciate the living room getting taken up a group of people they doesn't know for hours.

Even when I worked at a tech firm with a lot of collaborative places it was always more natural going over things at a cafe. It's a little strange that this is so foreign a concept "
1951,That the feeling I have of being destined for something is a whole crock of shit and I'm actually no one of any worth or importance who will live an entirely mundane and arguably pointless life.

1957,"I don't think it's all that clear, but I think the point is that the average 40 hour job + commute + sleep leaves very little spare time for anything else.

I spend a total of 42.5 hours at work and my getting ready + commute time adds up to roughly 12.5 hours. If we're counting the 8 hours of sleep into everything, it leaves me with 5 hours/day of free time on average, and it's not all actually free time - chores, food shopping, family obligations etc. And these 5 hours are only once I get home. I live in a small town with only basic facilities like a small super market or post office. If I wanted to actually get up and do something I have to drive about 1 hour out, so that leaves me with 3 hours of free time on that day. 

TL;DR - 40 hour weeks leave little time to live a life. "

It's not sustainable and I know many people that pay 50% of their income towards rent.  It's common to turn your den or living room into a bedroom and have 4 singles stay in a 2BR + 1 Den condo.  This isn't an issue of people being able to afford houses now, it's an issue of people being able to afford to even live in an urban area.  


The problem isn't solely money being laundered nor foreign money, it's a whole bunch of quite debateable problems."

Whether they're complaining about the guns, how long they've been on it, how loud it is. The kids almost always have expensive skins that the parents paid for as well. 

The entire time I'm just thinking, you're the parent!! Turn off the TV, stop financing it, take away the PS4, why did you even buy your 9 year old a headset?? Are you even aware that they're talking to adults online? It's amazing how the parents just act like their hands are tied."

We were on I-35 headed south, listening to music, and having a conversation. I remember just south of OKC I looked at my radio to turn down the music, and when I looked back up we all looked around and said ""Where are we?"". Somehow we were heading East on I-240. The same song was playing from my radio and no time had seemed to have passed as our conversation was ongoing. None of us remembered how we got there, and I couldn't have taken an off ramp because I had my cruise control set on 70. To this day it still freaks me out to think about it. There were five of us in the car and not a single one of us knew how we got there. No bright lights, missing time, or anything else. We blinked and we were somewhere else."

A customer came through the drive-through and wanted one of the 2-piece meals. We had to ask customers which sides they wanted with their meals, but the drive-through menu didn't list them in any obvious place, so we would regularly have to list off all of the options if they didn't want to go with the standard mashed potatoes and coleslaw. I listed the sides to her, and—I'll never forget this—her exact words were, ""okay, but what the heck is corn on the cob?"" "

As I was sifting through the bark chips to get to more of the beans, a glimmer caught my eye. I investigated and lifted a bark chip away and it revealed a tiny pair of golden scissors. I gasped because I knew that they had to belong to a leprechaun.

When I started eating a half bowl instead, I started loosing weight pretty fast.

Her oldest child (my uncle) told stories about how she would sleep around behind her husband’s back, and that when he got sick with TB and basically lived in the hospital, she had a different guy in her bed every week. My grandad killed himself around this time (I was always told it was because of his illness, but my uncle had a different version of events where my grandma basically abadonned him on his sick bed and moved on). She had a mental breakdown soon after this and attempted suicide multiple times before being sectioned for many months. This is the same woman who was the sweetest little old lady who lived for her grandchildren and was my best friend growing up. It was honestly a shock to hear a really negative side to her that I would never have imagined."

My boss was aware of why I booked the day off, but called me to ask me to come in that night... it was an “emergency”. I politely declined. Weeks later, I was working alone when suddenly I was overcome with a stomach flu. I started projectile barf shitting and had to call security to watch the front end of the store while I chundered neon yellow goo for an hour. I called my boss to come in. She politely declined - I could TELL from the tone of her voice and the way that she spoke that it was because I didn’t come in the night of my trial. Said she was busy, couldn’t make it. I called every other store in the city, and every employee they had. Everyone was too busy. Fuck that shit for $10 an hour. Goodbye, Claire’s. "

He’s asked to sit down but before he walks off the stage the new Regional Manager steps up and she says, “I want to ask something! I love doing these!” So she asks him, “How many siblings do you have?” The new hire looks down and responds that his only sibling has passed away not 2 months ago. The whole room goes silent. The Regional Manager’s face had that uncomfortable Michael Scott look on her face. She just looks at him and says, “I’m so sorry”. And she sits down. He walks off sits back down as well.

Doctor: I'm sure you're experiencing pain.

Me: No. 

Doctor: Well it could develop from a slight discomfort. 

Me: I have no discomfort. 

Doctor (to my mother): It could develop into something serious. 

Eventually I did get those cavities filled. I stopped drinking soda and stopped eating candy because I never wanted to go through four cavity fillings in one seating ever again. I went back the next year and guess what???? TWO CAVITIES! 

The dentist's reason? ""To much sugar from soda and candy.""

We never went back there again.

Women do find men attractive, but I don't think many people realize that women perceive attraction different than men do. For men, its mostly about physical traits and then onto her personality and character. For women it's all a mixed bag of emotions, whether or not she feels safe/comfortable, is the guy creepy or needy, etc. 




When a woman rejects a guy because he is unattractive, it's usually something that isn't exclusively related to his looks. It could be that he's too needy, he comes off as creepy or perverted, his intentions weren't clear, etc.

Appparently chemtrails and planes can make shadows and where they have gone or where they are going (or something like this) in 3D space and that's what makes the black ""trails"" you see in the sky.

And that is often the approach from the opposition: if you can’t, this very moment explain in detail, how you would fix this multi-faceted problem then your stance is worthless and nothing should be done.

For example with gun control, the opposition will disregard the fact that the US has an insanely high firearm deaths per capita for a Western nation because you can’t explain how to deal with every state edge-case firearm legislation right this second. They try to make the totally agreeable statement of *”the amount of kids been massacred in US schools is crazy”* moot and therefore the cause / effort that would follow with reform pointless."

2403,"Im super late to the party, I'm pretty sure this will be unnoticed but here we go:Everyone in my family believe in ghosts and all sorts of creatures, a lot of weird stuffs happened to us, like my dad can predict when someone in his side of the family will die or like one of my cousin can see all sorts of creatures running around and a lot of my family members are able to see ghosts.

**TLDR: People saw my dead aunt looking at the window in her unoccupied house, we called a shaman to free her but her spirit pass right through me and my body tried to reject the remaining of my aunt's spirit for days.**

Here's my personal experiences with ghosts: The first one is family related, my aunt died suddenly and she kinda haunted her own house that was left unoccupied since her death. My parents and I, we live abroad so we weren't there when she died and we couldn't come to her funeral because my mom just had my brother and her doctor told her she couldn't take the plane which obviously break her heart because we haven't been able see my aunt for maybe two years. 

A couple of years later, we went back to the Philippines to visit our relatives and some friends, we were extremely jet lagged and my brother was still a toddler so people came to visit us in our place. Our house in the Philippines is near my aunt's house, you have to pass her house in order to access ours.And that's when things got weird, a lot of people who came to see us had the same exact story when they arrived ""*Hey I saw you aunt, why isn't she coming ? I haven't seen her for a while... Yeah she was standing in front of the window, we waved but she didn't waved back, weird...*"" 

Well that story freaked a lot of us, so my mom decided to call a shaman so she can perform a ritual to free the spirit. The day of the ritual, a lot of us came including me, we were all waiting in front of the house for the shaman to arrive but I decided with 2 of my cousins to explore the house. Why ? I don't fucking know, but while I was playing with some kind of old toy my cousins left so I end up alone in this house so I freaked out a bit and decided to go and find my parents who were still outside but while I was walking a suddenly felt something slowly coming at me and then pass right through my body. I felt something extremely cold slowly pass through each cell of my body and then nothing and I went outside, it was weird but I didn't really payed attention to what just really happened.

But I fucking should have because after that I felt the sickest I've ever been, I literally felt like I was dying. It lasted for more than a week, my parents called all kind of doctors, I did all sort of test and nothing showed. All the doctors said I was fine. But clearly I wasn't, I was puking all day, I wasn't eating, my dad was forcing me to eat but the second later I was puking it all, I was boiling with fever and then an hour later I was freezing cold and also there were moments were I was fucking fine playing and running around. So my mom asked the shaman to come back so she can fucking save my ass and when she came she explained that because my aunt haven't seen me in years, her spirit was extremely excited when she saw me and because at that time she didn't quite understand what she was, she tried to hug me but instead she went right through me and that left a remaining of her spirit in my body. So here's that.

The second one is more recent, I now live with my boyfriend, we live in an old building in Paris that was previously a hotel. One night I was alone and was already in bed, I've always felt weird in our place but I never knew why so when I'm alone I always leave 2-3 lights open. That night my cats were having a party downstairs so I couldn't sleep, so I decided to go find them but then I saw a really tall guy who was sitting in our kitchen with a bathrobe full of blood. I pretended that I didn't see him because he was not facing me so I went to find my cats but when I went back to bed he wasn't there anymore."

But if they made a genuinely funny joke, my annoying habit kicked in. I was that guy who would repeat their joke, but louder. I would always try to give credit back to them, though. I would repeat the joke while laughing and I would point toward them to indicate to the group who originally said it. Deep in my heart, I just wanted their wit to be heard because I enjoyed it. To the outside, I was ""that guy"". I didn't realize it until a friend told me it was annoying and he genuinely thought I was trying to steal the spotlight. OOF!

(Statistically speaking.). Someone with no legs is never going to set any records for long jumping. 

The idea that you can willpower your way to success is an absurd lie that does not hold up to reality. Of course some people are unfortunately holding themselves back, but let's not deceive ourselves with the idea that you can single-handedly make opportunities grow on trees. Life just ain't that fair.

If an offender goes to a different state, they have to check in with the sheriff of the county they're staying at as soon as they possibly can. Some states like SC are pretty chill and don't require your information as long as you're there for maybe a weekend and call when you leave, some like Florida require you to come in within 24 hours of arriving and do a full registration that you'll never be allowed off of.

Staying in-state, it's a little looser if you just accidentally end up having to stay somewhere for a single night (this very likely varies per state and what level you are), but if a disaster happens, you're homeless, or you stay in a hotel or someone's house for any length of time for whatever reason, you let the sheriff of both your county and the county you're in know it ASAP.

If the person would have never considered smoking otherwise, then I do have an issue. Sure it's their body, but they seem to be under the impression that vaping is 100% safe. It's still new, and we don't know of the long-term effects yet. 

And then there are the few jerks on both sides of the aisle who believe that they can vape wherever they wish. I can still smell and see your giant vape cloud. Please wait until you're outside or at home. But hey! At least they're not flicking their nasty cigarette butts on the street."

It was black, not blonde. 

Anyway, they kept nagging at me, to do this and that and I was getting annoyed but I did it with a smile. I would stop and read a direction for the work to be done and they would just yell and say no, do this.. throw a few thing around and call it good. I said that's not what the instructions say to do. They would preach about their time there, the way it has been done, and no one has ever complained..  

Anyway my parents were out of town and they were texting me, checking in to see how the house was, how I am and if everything is okay. Really quick questions.
This old lady just walked by and grabbed the phone from my hands 
And threw it into the freezer. 
Don't disrespect me like that, my property, nor my parents. This job is for kids and you take it way to fucking seriously.. 
I yelled at her, told her I could take her horse shit regarding work, but she did not pay or own my personal property and had not right to touch it. 

I said thank you but I do not need this, I have better opportunities, enjoy your time here..

I grabbed my phone and left.

We only found out when she became increasingly anxious about a him not coming back after a trip 'to see his son'. Stupid bitch called my sick grandma and almost gave her a heart attack.

They are mostly going after the big fish in the pond, and a tremendous amount of those big fish get away with it, too.

As for the little guy?  They'll flag a few random audits here and there just to scare everyone into line.  But even $750k spread over many years just isn't that much in the grand scheme of things.  If you're being halfways smart about it (ie. don't get greedy or try to do too much too soon), that's a very easy amount to incorporate into your life in ways that would never get noticed.

The IRS isn't trawling Craigslist full-time trying to snag money launderers who are purchasing a nice, antique china hutch or table saw or used car with cash.

People are getting all paranoid that spending it will automatically trigger something on a big screen in some office in Washington, DC.  Except for very large purchases, the IRS has no way of knowing what you bought, and they aren't going to start assessing the value of everything in your house unless they knew everything you were buying in the first place.  And they don't.

Very useful to have a doc who blanket refuses to medicate. It's like having a dentist who refuses to drill.

I wonder how he figured out I was a pill-seeker? Maybe the fact I asked for pills? I've wondered ever since how so many people get xanax and antidepressants like they are candy. Do you have to fake not wanting to treat your depression and hope the doctor diagnoses it out of the blue?"

2677,"My mom didn't understand why it would be wrong of her to darken her skin and hair, put on a bathing suit and sarong, get cornrows, and go as a Bajan woman for Halloween a few years back. They'd gone to Barbados on vacation and truly loved the people they met and appreciated the culture. She just was being a bonehead, with no malice in her heart mind you, when she thought that actually doing blackface for Halloween was okay. I'm sosososososo glad that I was home that year to stop her. She literally could've lost her job over it; they were going to a work function. 


She just didn't know any better and truly is a sheltered woman. She's since educated herself and asked some of her black friends and staff about it afterwards and luckily, they gently struck her down. She was ashamed and embarrassed but jeeeeesus. To her defense, she was never really taught about the history of blackface. Our history books and curriculum vary state-to-state and even by school system within each state and she'd had a very whitewashed history education. She knew what blackface was but didn't understand that it was actually damaging to anyone. Naivete and ignorance almost made my mom look like an outright hateful racist.  


But then after typing this out I've gone down this rabbit hole of thought...it's SO FUCKED UP that schools would just wipe out entire parts of history and take away such integral parts of the context in our past that might put a sweet puddin' of a woman like my mom in a situation like that. whywhywhy. I'm not lamenting this for my mom's sake, it's just the most immediate example I can think of."

Wait until near a holiday, deposit something less than $500 with the ""change"" you got back from the stores since you could claim you were gifted the money. Random other times a year - say every other or every third month deposit $200 or less of that change as well - you could have gotten the money from anywhere like selling something, got paid back a loan from a friend, etc. Just keep it around two or three thousand a year and the bank isn't going to notice.

So between never paying for groceries or gas or food out with your own money and filtering money through random stores, it wouldn't take that long to launder the money. You have the rest of your life anyways - if you try to rush it, you'll get caught - take it slow and you'll be fine. You could even throw in $5,000-10,000 every 5 or more years and claim a loved one died and you found the money in their house."

2707,"&gt; But the sale of a home can trigger an assessment

This is true in some places, however not where I live.

&gt; Say you bought a 1930s house that requires a gutting and a major rewire.

It depends on the jurisdiction again but if you rewire and gut a house you don't need a permit. If you add an addition then yes but not for non-structural changes. The key would be to buy something run down but not too run down in a place that won't trigger a reassessment.

Overall I don't think this is the best way to launder the $ but if you like building it might be the most fun. Very easy to sink a couple hundred K into a house.

Oh, I mean, it WAS a framed copy of Sgt Peppers, and it was a Hofner ""violin"" bass,  but the dealer my BIL purchased them through got busted for selling tons of fake rock art.

I started reminding myself when I got mad at something to just stop for a second and figure out why I was mad at that thing.  If i could fix it, then I fixed it.  If I couldn't I just had to let it go.

Letting go takes practice, at least for me it did.  I had to stop whatever I was doing and go do something else until I could forget about what I was mad at.

1987, [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/) aka MI6. Five person panel.

First question, totally out of the blue, no prep time ""What's your solution to the West Bank/Gaza Strip issue""

Stumbled through that with a patchy answer

Almost finished, interrupted with ""Name a threat to the UK of the last forty years that is still a threat, and explain why""

Interrupted before finishing again (I went with China, because 1987 Russia was a washed-up basket case) to be told briefly what the job of Intelligence Officer entails, a bit from each of the five, then ""Which one of us is not an SIS Officer?""

I never got further in the recruitment process

I've since found that for #1, any answer at all other than ""I don't have one"" was a soft fail, for #2 China was the answer they wanted but any of Russia, the then EC (!), or the USA (!) would have been a pass. For #3 I was supposed to have spotted that one of the panel wasn't British, had told conflicting information to the other four, and had got my name wrong. I didn't get any of those

2887,"I witnessed a classmate try to commit suicide on the playground when I was in elementary school. It was 4th or 5th grade and there was drama between the popular kids, a typical love-triangle I think. Her name was Emily, she was blonde, had outbursts often. She really wanted friends but there was always fighting and drama around her, the cute boy every girl had a crush on, and his ""girlfriend"" who was another popular girl. I remember seeing them screaming and running around the blacktop, Emily and the boy yelling at each other. She stepped close to one of the teather-balls and tried to choke/hang herself with the rope. I remember her just screaming and crying and repeating something over and over. Teachers came rushing and recess was ended early.

Later we found out that she would go to therapy sessions at school after the incident. I don't know if she had home problems, but I think I remember her complaining about her parents and siblings.

There was also a weird neighbor we had that wasn't allowed to leave his house, and only years later we found out he was a sex-offender under house arrest and that's why my mom didn't like us to go outside."

They are trucked, barged, and then wind up in a store.  Some places they're  even flown.   Game or fish can be found locally for the cost of some gear, fuel, and a liscense.  So for a lot of people that semi-subsistence  way of life provides a very cheap protein source.

No doubt rice, beans, lentils and the like are still dirt cheap.  However you are going to pay a lot for substandard strawberries,  lettuce, or ""fresh"" tomatoes around these parts.  A lot of money goes into transit, and the produce isn't  all that awesome after it's  been traveling  that long."

1.  People are living WAY longer and of course all the extra years are at the back end of life when you get retirement.

2.  People aren't having kids like they used to which means who is paying for the old people.

3.  People have lower incomes today than older generations which means less to take from them in the first place.

With my free hand, I tried to crawl under the bottom bunk (as was the drill) but the space was full of wedged in kit, I was trapped, my only course of action was to lay there and count the explosions, 10 rockets were fired at our base (as big as 5 foot oxyacetylene welding bottles) It sounded like a massive (right above your head) thunder storm. I just laid there waiting for one to land on me. However one did land smack bang on the top of my vehicle and flattened it like a tin can and destroyed all the other vehicles in the vicinity. Previously, before I had retired to my bunk I had been standing in a lunch queue (we patrolled 24/7), whereby one of the mortars came straight through the ceiling above the line, and did not explode. If I recall correctly the first rocket landed on the mortar alarm shed, taking out the warning siren. The blast that destroyed my car scalped my colleague from his collar to the top of his head.

Boy, I fell hard for the girl. For the first time in like 5 years I really got the feeling that I have to get to know a/that woman better. After we all got home I started texting her, trying to flirt with her despite her having a boyfriend. That was stupid in the first place, didn't know what I was expecting tbh. What made it worse was the fact that she started flirting with me too, kind of. So we kept texting for 2-3 weeks now and in this time I realized that she probably is just enjoying the attention I gave her and that she is not really interested in anything further. Crushed me hard because I'm not the guy that goes on tinder and keeps dating, I'm more like the guy that needs to meet a woman IRL and just have interest in her. Didn't happen for 5 years and now it happens and she is not even single.

Fell into an emotional hole the last few days and feel kind of depressed since, no motivation at all and got that ""life sucks"" feeling since, cried on a few occasions since. It will pass by but right now it just kinda fucks me up."

I swear they say it some point, that actually ejecting completely from the Matrix kills you, and tons of people were dying because they rejected being in a simulation, so they added “the real world” which was just a way to make people feel like they have been freed when really it’s just another nested simulation."

So even other races/empires saw this cyclical rise and fall of technology and that was even with the Rakata being crazy aggressive and never really having had peace.

Slept through it then woke up early (had a dream where I was having sex - which was super realistic bc the abdominal pain from appendicitis lmfao) and then crawled to my grandparents bedroom dramatically to say ""take me to the hospital. I have appendicitis"" after surgery the surgeon discovered it was slightly ruptured but I was doing okay after - no illness or anything after surgery.

Anger, as archaic as the idea seems, is the only acceptable emotion for the stereotypical male.  If a man seems angry, it doesn’t actually mean he’s mad.  It can also mean he’s incredibly sad, desperate, lonely, worried, confused or overwhelmed.  Men are just as complex as women - and we have to hide it thru a veil of machismo or else be labeled weak."

I had a student this year (freshman boy) who came to school shortly after the beginning of the year rocking a brand new mohawk.  It looked great on him, and I complimented him on it.  He was beaming for the rest of the class period, and spent the rest of the year asking me how I felt about his other haircuts (once the mohawk grew out).

I was never at risk of losing my job and they were generally very kind to me despite the constant nagging about production being low, because it’s my goddam license to practice and I have autonomy to do what I want. I did however see many dentists in these corporations EXCESSIVELY over-diagnose and over treat. It is mind blowing how many dentists will grind your healthy teeth into dust just so they can make some money. Not all the dentists at these corporations are evil but many of them are. One office I worked at the hygienist mysteriously recommended deep cleanings on every patient. I would have to go behind her and tell her she’s not probing correctly with every patient. Eventually it was just so obvious she was making up her numbers that I had her removed from the office. But the company held onto her, despite committing malpractice daily, because she was a good producer. Nobody trusts the dentist anymore and it’s a damn shame because a lot of us do good work and are passionate about helping our patients. I don’t know of a solution. Don’t risk going to a corporation; just go to a reputable private practice. "

Your roads, much of the the daily conveniences, the educational system that taught you how to read, and even the Internet you're using all come from taxes. If you really believe people shouldn't have to pay taxes, then go buy a boat and live in the middle of the ocean, because that's about the only way to avoid tax-funded things. Even then, you'll probably have to rely on weather reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, another taxpayer funded program, to not die.

You say you don't like others paying for you while sitting there benefiting from them doing exactly that.

3485,"I worked in a (first assignment) ""secure"" facility as a Private in the Military. There was a large conference room that I was told had just been repainted (it didn't look like it but oh well) so it was my task to replace all the light switch covers that were removed before the ""painting"" project. It was stressed to me that I had to ensure that every light was working as I placed the cover. It just so happened that I was given this task during lunch when everyone left (except some dude in a back soundproof room with headphones on).  


As I began my task, I was diligently testing every switch as I placed the cover, so far so good.  Then once I had finished, I still had one cover left. I checked the room over again and by pure luck I happened to notice a coverless light switch about 6 cm from the floor.  !?!?!  I was curious why there was a switch that low, but as a diligent Private I got down on my knees... flipped the switch.... looked for a corresponding light... nothing.  Switched it off...on...nothing. Off....on....off...on...off...on !!!!! I then decided to start putting a small piece of blue painters tape next to a light and it's corresponding switch to locate the faulty light.  About 4 minutes into this endeavor, the buzzer to the secured front door sounded. The buzzer was for visitors that did not have the cypher code to access the building.  I knew the headphones guy didn't hear it so I went to the front door, opened it and was met with no less than 3 tactically parked police cruisers and a few officers at the front door.  They then advised me that they had gotten MULTIPLE triggers from the distress switch in this building.  I about swallowed my heart and then as I was contemplating how[if] I was going to deny these guys/gals entrance to verify all was clear, the rest of my ""colleagues"" and LT came from around the side of the building laughing their asses off.  Apparently the FNGs are used to do the mandatory (periodic) tests; and yes the cops were in on it."

3490,"I'm a little late here but I'll post this for whomever is interested, education.  I will preface this by saying that teachers and principals are some of the most upstanding people you will ever meet (for the most part.   Not denying bad apples). They sincerely want to help your kids.  That said, high stakes testing has led to some really odd incentives.

Most schools are judged by a single act style test, and whatever other data districts ask them to report out.   If you work at a school that mostly has high income students, this isn't so bad.   Most of those kids don't need much intervention for a variety of reasons so they can focus on the kids who really need the help.   That said, it incentivizes low income schools to do strange things.   For example, focusing on what are called bubble kids.   Kids who are really far behind won't make enough growth to make the data look good on the test even if they make more than a year's growth.   The solution?  For a few months prior to the test, schools don't help the kids that need it most.   They help the bubble kids. 

Here's another example, many schools stop teaching reading and math to teach test taking strategies for prolonged periods of time before a test.  I'm talking a month or more.   That's a 9th of the school year.  Will it help kids learn to read?  Nope.  That said, it'll make the school look better and that's snl the districts care about. 

Still another example, suspensions.  One district that I worked in decided that suspensions were too high.   They made lower suspension rates part of how they evaluate schools.   The outcome? Lots of good press for the district, lots of explosive behaviors in the schools.   Actually teaching self regulation skills to kids takes time.   Finding the data and obfuscating the problem by not suspending kids when you should brings the numbers down much faster. 

My point is, when backed into a corner, even good people do strange things.  High stakes testing causes schools to go for short term gain over long term improvement all the time.  

Tldr:  schools do sketchy things to make data look good"

3507,"I feel sure no one is going to believe this, or at least no one who doesn’t already believe in the paranormal, but I interacted with what I can only label as a ghost relatively often from the ages of about 3 until I was 11. 

I called her “the blue girl”. Sounds dramatic and creepy, but I was three and in reality it was just the simplest description. She was not actually a girl but rather a woman, probably late 20’s, maybe 30’s. She was a bit tall for a woman but not dramatically so, dressed in all blue and looked Asian. 
The first time I saw her I woke up and she was standing at the foot of my bed just looking at me. I was a toddler so I just cried and ran to my parents room. They assumed it was a nightmare, I slept in there for the night. 

The next time I “saw” her was in a dream. We were by a lake on the grass and it just felt very pleasant and safe. She put her hand on mine and I suddenly felt very reassured. To this day I never know how to explain this feeling she could give in dreams. (she appeared in them a few other times as well and ultimately I feel like they had to just be regular dreams because I was thinking about seeing her, but they felt unbelievably real and I always remembered every detail so at least in my childhood I thought she was “creating” these dreams. I don’t know what I think anymore.) But essentially she never spoke out loud, but there was this almost telepathic type feeling? It was never conversations and replies, more like feelings of understanding or new ideas. It felt like they were just being implanted in my brain, like I didn’t know it and now I did. Anyway, in this dream one of those ideas was that she was safe essentially. 

I continued to see her multiple times after this, most often at night but I did see her during the day too. There didn’t seem to be a consistent reason/timing for her appearances, though they were in my room more often than somewhere else. Nothing particularly eventful really would happen but typically I felt a wave of happiness wash over when she showed up so I stopped worrying about it much I guess. 

The experience that proved her being real for me and not just some hallucination or imaginary friend happened about a year after I first saw her and I was seeing her very often. My cousin was coming over to sleep over for the weekend and I was really excited, but this cousin was terrified of ghosts, monsters (we were 4), pretty much anything that could be used as a bad creature in a children’s tale. I decided not to tell him about her cuz I was afraid he wouldn’t want to come over anymore. Well, we had a good day and they slept on the pullout trundle bed connected to mine. When I woke up in the morning they weren’t there, and I found them sleeping on a couch in the living room with my mom. She said he thought he saw someone in there and got scared. When he woke up I asked him what he saw and he described her perfectly. There was no doubt. 


There were plenty of other times (mostly uneventful) that I saw her, but nothing that’s as unexplainable the situation with my cousin so that’s the one that keeps me so sure that SOMETHING is out there, even if I don’t exactly get it. It’s also worth mentioning that my best friend saw her once at her own house when I slept over (but no other times) and this was not a house-haunting situation as I saw her for another 2 years after moving houses. I don’t know why I stopped seeing her, but how often I saw her declined suddenly leading up to no longer seeing her. 

TL;DR Saw the same ghost regularly for years of my life, cousin saw her too without knowing about her previously. "

3517,"...No matter how hard you read into pseudoscience, you will find it is meaningless. Astrology is built of the back that the sky is dotted with constellations and images with some apparent meaning to the human race. However when you look out at stars they are not arranged in such formations from any other perspective that from Earth. Many of the larger giants in Orion, for instance, literally do not exist at this present time, having died out in the time the light from those stars took to get here due to limitations of the spped of light. 

The stars you see in the night sky aren't even average stars: they are only the ones close enough or bright enough to see through the vast distances of space, then our atmosphere diffracting them. Then stars that make up the Big Dipper are thousands of light years apart from one another, and not in neat lines in the sky....The idea that big balls of gas floating in space whose light we see if how the star was literally centuries in the past is like saying that clouds form shapes to send messages. Your brain is a highly sophisticated pattern seeker, and strives to see patterns like dog faces, cute bunnies, or big clusters of stars. 

If it makes you happy, far be it from me to tell you otherwise. And constellations are increfibly important for early navigation, signalling of telescope calibrations, teaching early astronomy in fun ways, and many more. But these random collections of gas millions of years ago have an much effect on your personality as the pattern of grass growing in your lawn: as much as you let it. Further, such ""percieved"" patterns can easily be chalked to confirmation bias or selection bias, where you hold the times it works over the times it doesnt. Also, making random shit up, like ""Well yeah, maybe you just EXUDE a different random selection of personality traits then the month you were born says, so that's the Right one! Case closed.""

Now take a movie/show with a friendship between two women, and it will often use the exact same tropes that are used to show that the male/female friend are in love with each other, but the two women very rarely get together. And if the two women do get together, people often claim it was shoehorned in and there was no evidence that the two characters were more than friends."

Naturally this upset me every time but eventually he changed schools and lost contact with him. Turns out his dad as a hardcore druggie and my mom was protecting me because my friend was exposed to that and it took a toll on him. Later a few years ago I found out he got into a car chase high on cocaine, the same year I got accepted into university and was starting to plan out a career. HE was just as smart as me but his parents divorce and bad choices caused that and I always felt bad for him.

Companies that are busy enough for you to flag a lot of hours will pay you a low flat rate wage, companies that are slow therefore you can't flag a lot of hours will pay you a good flat rate wage. It's a no win situation. Where the money is at is working on heavy equipment,  such as forklifts, tractors, diesel trucks and the like. This is also hard on the body thoigh so if you are looking for work that's not sonhard on the body I would think electrician or plumber, which both make good money also. "

Actually, just to play devil's advocate, I would be willing to hypothesize the opposite. I'll argue for conscription based off of the fact that most gun related homicides are committed by non veterans. I'll use the same argument you proposed, but slightly modified. If we enforced a mandatory military service, everyone would have more gun training as you suggest leading to less homicide. Can you find us a statistic to support either of our hypothesis?

I came back from my honeymoon, only to find out that my entire group was being let go in two weeks.  My boss let me go home from work to talk with my wife / sort through things.  On the way home, traffic was bad, and there was a van broken down with a couple standing next to it, he seemed guinely distressed.  Since I wasn't going anywhere, I pulled over and offered to let them use my cell phone to call a tow truck, and asked if they needed anything else.  Turns out, he was taking her to a Doctor's appointment and doesn't know how to get her there.  It was on my way home, and I offered to drop her off.


They agreed, and after a few moments where she was obviously uncomfortable riding in the car with some young stranger, I told her about just being back from my honeymoon, losing my job, etc.  We talked some more and she relaxed as we got closer to the hospital.

And then the female commander who is constantly showing up skirts to her subordinates and practically daring them to speak up about it so she can get all dominatrix on their asses.

Then an older guy came in, looked at the slides, and chewed him out for x-raying me. The slides showed next to nothing.

I guess the assistant had wanted to show his superior how ready he was and x-rayed me instead of letting the real tech do it. He made a fool of himself, and I was charged for 10 useless x-rays months later.

A few years later I had a minor ankle sprain. The ankle was in a ski boot, so breaking it would have been very difficult and very obvious. The assistant absolutely insisted I get an x-ray 'just to be sure' I hadn't also broken it.

They even go as far as replicating the numbers they have on file for me and my parents but change the last digit. I changed my phone number they started harassing my sickly mother. I changed my number back to what it was and just don’t answer the phone anymore unless I know exactly who’s on the other end.

I had to explain to her that Jello is gelatin, and that gelatin is made from pork skins, pork bones, cattle bones, or cattle hides.  She didn't believe me.

3968,"To be honest, I think there was just enough negative reinforcement beaten into my head that I didn't really associate it with a reward anymore, if that makes sense. I started using opiates at 15, IV heroin at 16, used consistently until I went to prison at 19. I quickly relapsed after leaving prison at 20, and finally got clean at 22. I have a few years clean now, and I don't really think about it anymore. When I finally didn't want to get high anymore, the cravings pretty much disappeared after the first few months. It took prison time, becoming a convicted felon, and losing everything multiple times to get there though.

I would book in with a new doctor and state that you are worried about adrenal insufficiency, and want to be tested for it. It's awkward but don't back down, if you do have something wrong with your adrenals then the doctors can move forward with it; and if not then at least that is something you and your doctors can cross off the list. There is something called a ACTH stimulation test that will tell you if there is a problem with the adrenal glands :)"

4002,"The best money laundering device is a golf driving range.  You sell a bucket of balls, go pick it up, and sell it again.  

With every other business there is a correlation between the revenue and some input into that revenue.  Coin operated car wash?  The water is metered.  Coin operated laundromat?  The power consumption is metered.  Ice cream stand?  You need to buy ice cream.  Most businesses have patterns; if your daily sales are $500 and suddenly jump to $1000, you can’t credit the nice weather (well, maybe the ice cream place).

There are very few businesses like a golf driving range, where revenue can vary greatly day by day and there is no way to disprove the source of funds unless an auditor sits on your doorstep and counts customers.  With a slow, steady feed of cash into a warm-climate range, you could easily launder all $750K in two years.  As a bonus,  you’d have great earnings on paper and could sell the business for 5-10 times earnings."

4016,"There aren't really any good guys in this story, but I accept that I was awful.   

Basically, I was seeing a girl for a few months and then we ended it pretty amicably, no harm no foul.  
Fast forward a month later and I had to message her, I think I left a jacket at her house or something, but after she confirmed my jacket wasn't there, I was getting ready to just leave it at that and carry on with my life. But then she sent a ""So how are you?"" text. We ended up talking again, mostly about how we were both getting new places in the next few days.  
After she moved into her new apartment, I woke up to her messaging me saying that she was raped and that she was really upset, so I did my best to comfort her, and she asked if I could go over and keep her company because she didn't want to be alone, which I thought was very fair considering the circumstance.  
When I arrived, she looked fine. She was even laughing and even being a little flirty.  
After a little while of us just chewing the fat and talking in her living room, she said to me ""Oh! I need to give you a tour!"" and she proceeded to show me around her apartment, finishing on the bedroom.  
When we got to her bedroom, she said ""You can have a lie down if you want? We can watch a film through here"".  
You might think at this point I was catching onto what was happening, but I was very naive and I didn't want to make any assumptions that this girl who was just raped wanted to sleep with me.  
As soon as I lay down, she climbed on top of me, and that was when I knew. We had sex that night.  
We ended up dating for a few more months.  
One night while I was holding her in bed, she looked up at me and admitted she was cheating on me, which needless to say, broke my heart.  
I hate to admit that after that night I started to stalk her online. I had been struggling a lot with mental health issues at the time, which she knew about and initially offered support with, but I never spoke to her after that night so it was hard seeing her on Instagram and Twitter having a good time while I had become a suicidal shut in.  
One night, things became too much for me and I started to text her asking her to help me, which instead of replying to me she text a mutual friend and told me to stop texting her. This infuriated me and instead of being smart, I sent her a threatening text, where I threatened to leak her nudes. I lost a lot of friends after that one.  
  
Unfortunately, there isn't a happy ending here. Around 2 months ago after moving on and starting a new relationship, I found out that way back when we started dating again, she was never actually raped. She lied about being raped to get me to go over.  
Like I said, no good guys in this story.  
  
**TL;DR: Was dating a girl who lied about being raped, then cheated on me, and then I threatened to leak her nudes which cost me all my friends and made me the bad guy in this story**"

4105,"When I was younger, we had an attic where I was not supposed to go. It was a one room attic  with a locked door and nothing else in front of the door or on the sides. There only was a light switch and I was told to never touch it. The entrance from the first floor to the attic was shut with a door. It was always shut and as a child I completely ignored the floor above me.

Until I was about 7 or 8 years and I was home alone because my parents were visiting the (direct) neighbors. Somehow I got curious and went up to the attic to find an unlocked door to the rest of it. I went in and found a whole installation with marihuana plants, complete with an aluminium foil sort of cage and all kind of lights. I think there were about 35-50 plants up there.

I quickly went down and didnt really know what I was just looking at. Because it was supposed to be behind a locked door, I figured it was a secret and never told anyone about it. I still haven't told my parents about that, although we can openly talk about weed. "

When on of our teachers asked in class if any student had met anyone famous, this guy proceeded to tell everyone that George W. Bush was his uncle and that he would visit him all the time and ride the roller coaster in has backyard. 

At another point, he was late for school because he was apparently “walking to school when he was hit by a Budweiser truck. The truck driver asked him if he was okay and when this kid nodded, the truck driver threw him a beer and the kid chugged it”. 

Finally in senior year, he was walking to school again but was hit by a Jeep, flipped over the windshield, and landed in the back seat between two topless women. 

This guy was dead serious when he would tell these stories, and they would almost always be presented as a one upper in conversations. This guy had some serious issues and supposedly he molested his sister and skipped town, at least that’s what we heard. Who the fuck knows what happened. "

At least two instances of me going to the ER were from fighting too hard with my sis, one from hitting something at the end of the slide(I think it was sis's knee), one from dropping a glass bowl on my foot, one time I just sorta fell over and apparently that meant my leg was broken.

All hairline fractures, but it means I've broken my both lower legs(though thankfully never at the same time) and didn't even bother going to the ER for broken toes anymore.

Both people refused to show me the homes, claiming they were in another state. And when I tried to inform them that I was not interested as a result, one told me that I should trust them because they were Christian missionaries in Nevada and the other quoted the bible on trust so thus I should trust them.

4132,"Occasionally I have nightmares. I also have been diagnosed with PTSD, so I still have flashbacks and the like. I'm pretty good at grounding myself. I'm 23 now, and I'm not exactly well adjusted. I'm coping. I did not have a good childhood. That's just the tip of the iceberg. My dad remarried a woman from hell.  I have a lot of issues related to touching. In high school I broke a kids nose for smacking my ass. I'm more in control of myself now, but only to the point where if human contact with unfamiliar people is involved I manage to not lose my shit until I get home. I work in a group home, and I had a kid decide it was hilarious to touch me over and over and over again. Touching my neck, my arms, my back, my hair, etc. I barely held it together and when I got home I cried for an hour. 
Edit: just wanted to add, good riddance thoughts are there. But the issue is there were good times, and they dont outweigh the bad, not by a long shot. But I also have a harder time coping because in my family only my mom, dad and former step mom know about this. I dont want to ruin people's gpod memories with my bad. I don't want the other people in my family to have to deal with this too. These memories are like a tar that eats away the good until there is nothing left. Every nightmare I have, I seem to forget a good memory, most of the memories that remain are the family stories that everyone knows, and I'm unsure if I have just heard them so many times and thats why they remain. And I feel like being relieved makes me a bad person. "

4142,"The day that my grandma passed away after a 4 year battle with cancer, my family, fiancé, and I were at my grandparents’ house. I found a stuffed dog that my grandma had gotten as a gift for me when I was in elementary school. It could record a message. On it, she had recorded, “Grandma and Grandpa love you, 123pignoliasDoReMi.”


What happened next was a number of people’s faults: my mom’s, my fiancé’s, and mine. My mom wanted to record the message on her phone. I didn’t/couldn’t help out with doing so, so my fiancé stepped in...and accidentally pressed the wrong paw (there were unmarked buttons in the stuffed dog’s paw), erasing a message which had been recorded for years, and which I would never be able to hear again.


I don’t blame anyone. I just took the what happened as something that was meant to be. I got to hear my grandma’s voice one last time and maybe she wanted me to move on, so she made sure I couldn’t obsessively listen to the recording again and again, who knows. In short, I took the accident as an opportunity to grow and move on. There are a lot of other possessions by which I can remember my grandma, not to mention all the memories I still have.

Everything is just a constant cycle. Down to the micro level, down to the thoughts in your head. Ideas are born and die, thoughts are born and die. Cells come in to creation and are destroyed, recycled, everything is a cycle. Over and over. Humans come in to the world, then they die.

Collectively, these cycles create a bigger picture. Everything that happens is the definition of our world. The entire world is just a giant organism that we're all a part of. We're just the cells of the world, like our body, we're dying and being born constantly.

Like the cells in our body, individually they're insignificant, but collectively they make up you. You are much more significant than each cell in your body, but all you are are those cells. We are insignificant compared to the entirety of human society and culture, but human society and culture could not exist without us.

So when my mother wanted to go have some less than legal fun with her friends, she had to bring me. Now calling it a house is a bit of a stretch as all I remember of the place is a cold concrete room. My mother and her friends were all sitting around in a circle in plastic lawn  chairs. I clung to her leg for a good hour with her constantly kicking me away until one of the  men with her decided they were tired of me crying and have me a popsicle. It wasn't until I was older that I understood how dangerous of a situation I was in then, but stuff like that was commonplace with my mother.

Then another and some words were spoken and I lost my contract with that company. Not to worry. The temp agency had another opening at another company. I work there and it is by far the worst place I have ever worked for. None of the employees knew their ass from a hole in the ground. I would bring something up that needed to be corrected and get shot down. I have 19 years in the field. That was more experience then the rest of the staff put together. I found a place to work on my own and got the fuck out of there. Found a place that not only pays better, but treats you like you know what you are doing.

4226,"This reminds me of something that happened 10-15 years ago.

My mother used to work during the mornings when I was a kid, and she would come back home to make lunch and take me to school in the afternoon. I don't remember my exact age but I believe I was in my early teens, there was a morning when we heard gunshots. That's not unusual since we don't live in the friendliest of neighborhoods, but it sounded like it was really close. I remember my mother looking out the window and telling me not to come near the windows ""because it was dangerous"". She then proceeded to go out of the house. Of course I did look out the window, but all I could see were people standing around in the middle of the street right in front of our house. When she got back inside about an hour later she was clearly shaken by something, and when I asked she told me a guy was killed but never got into detail. I was already familiarized with the concept of death, but I didn't think much of it at the time. This kind of thing wasn't really that uncommon. She took me to school and life went on. 

A few years later she was telling this story to some of her friends and I finally got the whole picture. What really interested me was what was going through her head at the time. She didn't know the guy or anything. He was shot in the middle of the street right in front of our house's entrance. I don't know if he was already dead at the time, but I believe he was since he was shot quite a lot. All the time she spent outside was because she waited for the police and the ambulance to get there. She pressed them to take the body quickly so she could wash the asphalt as quickly as possible (with the help of my aunt, who lives next door). She needed to take me to school, and she didn't want me to see all the blood in the ground, much less the actual corpse. To this day I admire her guts."

4235,"I always found the post office and addresses analogy worked for me when explaining it.

Let's say I live in an apartment complex; this apartment complex has 32 apartments, each of which gets a number. This is my _local_ network. While in the area, you don't really need to know what city you're in to know how to get from #8 to #32 if you want to go drop something off with your neighbor.

The mailbox for our apartments tells the post office how to route mail to us from a public address. Mail we put into the mailbox can go out without us needing to know all the steps it will take to reach its destination - this is my personal router &amp; NAT (local network to public network).

Mail I send out is the equivalent of a request, and incoming mail is a response. All I need to know to make a request is the address of the place I want the mail to reach. Once the mail is sent out, it travels to a series of post office hubs where it is sorted and sent to the right locations to eventually end up at the right place. These are DNS servers and the switches connecting ISPs. The roads, railways, planes, etc. are the types of connections I can make to connect computers together.

The rest is just the same process in reverse when they send it back - the main difference is that, because electricity/light/whatever form of data is doing over the wire can travel much faster than vehicles, all of this data exchange is near instant. 

I tell my browser ""go find Google.com"", it goes and asks what the address of ""Google.com"" is. The DNS server then forwards my request through a series of computers until Google gets it. Google then responds to my request with a file that contains the instructions necessary to draw Google.com on my screen.

Hopefully this is somewhat helpful. "

4275,"I've told this story on reddit before. I was working at McDonald's as a manager for 2.5 years, I got transferred to a new store and the GM liked to eat his own ass about how much he cared for his staff and how great of a boss he was.

Cut to a month later, our schedule says we need like 25 people by the time lunch starts. But people are calling out and NCNS left and right. I have about 10 people, 3 need lunch breaks, I have 6 in the kitchen because everyone in there is a trainee and they NEED that many people. It's 11, we're still only serving breakfast because I don't have enough people to get the lunch product from the freezer, or change the menu board.

My boss. Decided. To. Take. His. WEEKLY. Conference. Call. Where. He. Discussed. His. Stores. Success. With. The. District. And. DM. WHILE HIS STORE WAS IN SHAMBLES. He made himself food, went back to the office, and was just chatting. While I had three employees over an hour past their lunch break, NO ONE coming in for the foreseeable future. I told him 'get off the phone, or next week you're gonna have to tell them about how you left us to fail and why you're numbers this week are shit'. I had EVERY customer screaming at me. I was taking one lane's orders, making fries, drinks, ice creams, and putting together both FC and DT orders, and handing them out. He said 'no, I have to take this call' (AN HOUR TO TWO HOUR CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LUNCH RUSH). So I texted his DM who had come to know me well and liked me. And I said 'your GM is taking the conference call and ~this~ is what's happening in his store, I'm the only other manager and I'm leaving. Good luck with him'. I told him I was leaving as I grabbed my purse from the office, apologized to all the employees as I walked out.

And the next day, his DM asked me if I wanted to keep my job. A week later, the DM from my old district asked me if I wanted to come back to her. I said no both times because I was done after 2.5 years of fighting for promotions I deserved (and was already trained for) and being treated like this by managers. "

4289,"See I don't understand this. My son was diagnosed as autistic. I did ask at first if it was something we had done wrong.

The developmental specialist instead started asking questions. About me and my childhood. My parents. 

In the end, he determined that I was likely on the spectrum. My father most definitely was, which explained many of his struggles and stays in mental hospitals. Possibly some other family as well. The only thing wrong was nerds' with autism causing genes breeding :P

Then it was just like, ""Oh, it's our weird family. Most of us in it are like this to some extent. My kid's just more severe/obvious right now.""

I had an antivaxxer at a parenting group try to convince me that my son must have regressed due to vaccines he had at 18 months. I had to explain that there was no regression. He had lots of delays from birth. He didn't speak. We didn't start seeing progress until he started intensive therapies at age 2. She absolutely didn't want to believe me. 

I guess it makes me sad that people look for a reason instead of just accepting that autism is part of who their child is, and focus on helping them deal with it rather than worry about blame :(

Also, this isn't the government censoring anyone. If Facebook wants to ban people for your example, and society decides that's not okay, Facebook will follow suit, because we're both their customer and their product. So the answer to your question is us. We're the ones to say that.

I ask this question for two reasons.  First, to see if you have an ounce of self-awareness about your flaws.  You suck at something and we're going to find out what it is if we hire you, I'm curious if YOU know what it is.  And second, to see if you're being honest with me in the interview, or if you're just spoon feeding me answers that you think sound good to Idiot Managers.   Good/great answers I've heard in the past:

* I'm not great at reading technical documentation, so I ask a lot of questions when I'm learning something new
* I like to work on several projects at once, and can get bored if there's only one thing going on at a time
* I have a short attention span for repetitive tasks, so I need to keep free from distractions when I'm doing administrative work
* I feel guilty when I take time off of work, like I'm letting the team down by being away

All of these are very real flaws, but none of them are unsolvable.  My job as a manager is to make you better at your job, and that's way easier if you're the type of person who's willing to acknowledge that they have room to improve. "

Je ne prends aucune responsabilité pour les boissons crachées.

Je sortais avec un gars nommé Mike. Mike était une famille serrée composée de Shannon (soeur), un BIL et la mère. Nous étions tous sortis pour dîner un soir mais nous nous sommes arrêtés chez la mère de Mike pour un cocktail.

Comme nous savourions notre cocktail, je l’ai ressenti: une bulle intestinale essayait d’émerger.

La soirée a progressé et je me suis sentie de plus en plus mal à l'aise. Finalement, l'heure est venue de partir.

J'ai vu ma fenêtre d'opportunité brillante: je pouvais libérer la bête de pet dans le bref laps de temps entre quitter la maison et monter dans la voiture.

Shannon et son mari sont allés démarrer la voiture. Je marchais en ralentissant dans le garage pendant que Mike et sa mère mettaient l’alarme à l’intérieur de la maison.

Pppffffffttttt Aaaahhhhh ...!

J'étais reconnaissant pour une libération silencieuse alors que je traversais le garage à travers la porte ouverte. Heck, j'étais reconnaissant pour la sortie du tout! Enfin: je pouvais passer le reste de la soirée sans craindre un son de staccato pareil à une mitraillette jaillissant de mon jean.

J'ai continué vers la voiture de Shannon quand Mike et sa mère sont entrés dans le garage. Tout à coup, je pouvais les voir traverser le nuage vert. Une pâleur visible est venue sur leurs visages. Ils ont commencé à faire signe à Shannon et à son mari.

Soudain, Mike a commencé à crier et Shannon: ""Shannon, viens ici! Amène ton mari! Tu dois sentir ça!""

Que diable? Pourquoi Mike a-t-il crié pendant que sa soeur laissait la chaleur de la voiture dans une froide nuit d'hiver pour sentir mon pet? Je me suis tenu à l'écart et j'ai regardé Mike et tous ces parents vivants entrer de bon gré dans les émissions sulfureuses de mon dos pour respirer.

Mike continua: ""Shannon, ça sent ça. Juste ici. Non, viens ici et sens-le. C'est mauvais! (DM et DBIL acquiescèrent, suivant leur nez autour du garage pour attraper une bouffée du nuage malodorant). ramène ta voiture au garage et fais-la réparer cette fois-ci. Je pensais que ton catalyseur était réparé!

OMG. Non seulement ils se tenaient là, mais là encore, Shannon allait devoir payer une dépense car elle pensait que sa voiture était cassée!

J'ai aimé Shannon. Je ne voulais pas qu'elle dépense de l'argent inutilement. Alors je me suis raclé la gorge. Je pouvais à peine parler. Je riais tous les deux hystériquement et pleurais en même temps. Après tout, ces pauvres gens n’avaient aucune idée que l’air vicié qu’ils respiraient profondément n’avait été que quelques secondes auparavant dans mon côlon.

J'ai étouffé un peu et tous les yeux se sont tournés vers moi. Parce que je suis très juste, j'ai pratiquement rayonné de la rougeur de l'embarras. Dès qu'ils m'ont vu, ont vu le regard sur mon visage et ont entendu mon rire nerveux, ils ont su: ils se tenaient dans mon pet et respiraient dans leurs poumons. J'ai dû avouer à Shannon que sa voiture allait bien."

I passed out on the couch and when I woke up we went down to the dock and I did another hit.

Obviously clueless. In most major cities the business is so competitive that dealerships sell cars below invoice (their cost). They make up for it by making money on the Finance part of the deal and service department. Still, even after taking all the backend profit, the profit margins are slim, and although making $2000 per unit sold sounds like a lot, in percentage terms it is actually one of the thinnest gross margins. In addition, it is an industry with very high overhead and it takes a huge investment to buy/open a car dealership.

One day the highest manager in our department took a vendor’s business card that was left with a box of donuts. He gave it to a random lower level manager and ordered him to call the vendor and tell them they are never allowed to bring donuts again, because “if they can afford to bring donuts, they can afford to cut prices”. 

The equipment that the vendor was selling costs $100,000’s. All this resulted in was hungry, angry engineers &amp; operators. Definitely damaged our relationships with the vendors, too.

4618,"The simplest answer I can give is: because of ignorance.

Muslim sects (Shia and Sunni) can coexist and for the vast majority, have coexisted. The Quran explicitly says to live in peace with one another. Even so, the beliefs of the 2 sects diverge politically. Religiously/spirtually, they believe the same things that make up the core beliefs of the religion. Things get out of hand when the verses of the Quran are taken out of context and misunderstood. Just a quick reminder, the majority of people who've fallen under the sword of ISIS were Muslims. This goes onto say that without proper knowledge, even your own people can turn against you."

4625,"Well all I can say is that we had a dog like Marley. He would destroy EVERYTHING. He was even a golden retriever, what kind of golden retriever eats couches and walls? No matter how high I put my stuffed animals, he always destroyed them. He ate trough a fucking wall! If we let him off the leash, he ran as far as he could as fast as his legs carried him. He would torment our other dog by stealing every tennis ball from her. He ate my toothbrushes and pooped them out as whole. He pooped out gloves full of poop. It didn't matter how much we exercised him, he had energy more than anyone. If we exercised him too much, he went crazy because he was so tired. Oh and he pooped everywhere. He had terrible stomach and no matter what food and medicine we tried, he got diarrhoea, it always happened. He would just poop and run around our house while pooping. Then he would slip in the poop and keep running around with poop all over his fur.

I tell you, he was a nightmare. But everyone loved him. Anyone who met him had a funny story about him, most likely a funny poop story. He loved so much, but was so, so much work"
4626,Cotton is the easiest when learning. It’s sounds like you’ve just got the heat too high and you let the iron linger on the fabric too long. Try again at a lower setting and constantly move the iron. When in doubt lower the heat and don’t let the iron just sit still on the clothes. 
4627,"Saying someone is racist shouldn’t ever be taken as an explanation. The term “racist” is just a useful shorthand for many very different kinds of behavior that someone can mix and match from. It’s probably never useful to say of a person that they are or aren’t a racist, full-stop. Instead it’s better to say that some acts were racist and others were not. Probably everyone does some things that are best described as racist. And probably everyone resists some suitably extreme racist acts (even if they commit other equally extreme ones). 

Jackson was an interesting and complex political figure, and racism of various sorts certainly played a role in a lot of his acts as president. But one should never just leave it at that, and instead should think about how these racist acts came to be important policies, while other racist or anti-racist acts may have been important in his personal life.

4631,"I hated my old job with a passion, but this was the one thing that the company absolutely did right.

4637,"It was my fault actually, and I quit because I didn’t want to face the humiliation of being fired. I worked at a call center for a year, and I hated every minute of it. Management was garbage and they were condescending and rude to all of us. The coworkers were trashy and it was just a piece of crap workplace. They also had a rule of no cell phones, period. I was dating a guy and couldn’t not text him (it felt like) and also, I didn’t really care. Anyways, a supervisor (really mean lady) caught me on my phone at my desk once, and I got a warning. The next time would be termination in a room with all the bosses together. So about a month later, I was dealing with some stuff and was texting my bf under my sweatshirt and the same supervisor caught me. She came over to me, stuck her face in my face, cocked her head to the side and said “office, now.” 
Sooo I packed all my stuff into my bag, walked over to her office, leaned my head in, and to the three or four other supervisors that were waiting for me in there along with her, I said “I’m effing done. Screw all of you. You’re all garbage.” Aaaand I walked out.

4640,"I worked at Macaroni Grill as a busboy and food runner in the early 2000s. It's a shitty Italian restaurant chain. I had been asking for weeks for shifts waiting tables to earn extra money, but management told me they didn't have any room on the schedule...then they suddenly hired three servers.

Fast forward a few days. It's a busy evening, the house is packed, and I'm running food to tables. I approach a family with bowls in hand: an older man, his wife, and their early 20s daughter. Their food was piping hot, fresh off the line. 

The man looks at me and says ""No, take that back. We aren't done with our salads.""

I look down and he has, no exaggeration, *two single lettuce leaves in his bowl*.

Me: ""No problem, sir, I'll go keep this warm and bring it back over in three minutes so you can enjoy your salad.""

Guy: ""No, I want you to remake it. The heat lamps will dry it out, and you brought it too soon. Make me another one.""

Me: ""That is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.""

Then I took his salad bowl, gave him his food, and immediately told my manager I quit. As I was taking off my apron she asks me, ""Are you going to get your other shifts covered?""

Me: ""No, Alicia, they're your shifts now.""

And I walked the fuck out."

He started jokingly saying he wants to have a kid with her and started to call her baby mama as a nickname.  I ended up working next to them  one day and got dragged into their shenanigans. She actully has a kid the same age as mine so we gave the guy shit about how he was no where close to being ready to actually have a kid, and to mess with him more she joked that she would rather have the kid with me.

4686,"So lemme get this straight: you choose to ignore everything the bible says, except for that one particular verse, because it was written by man, and the writers could've been spinning bullshit. Doesn't that mean John 3:16 suffers from the same problem? Which kinda signifies you can believe anything you want about christianity, like...Jesus was 8 feet tall. The flood was beer, not water. God is a woman, and the world was actually created in 4 days. You've chosen to believe a single quote from a book, and then interpret it the way you want, while ignoring the entire rest of the book. Why even bother when you can just believe what you want and justify it with a shrug of your shoulders?

While u/jdog2050 is right in that people got offended ""back in the day"" over equally innocuous things such as swear words, sex and drugs, people are still getting offended - albeit by different things - in the present day at an equally if not higher rate. 

Now, people can voice their opinions much easier today, so it may just appear that the rate is exponentially higher, but it certainly isn't at its lowest point ever.

Fortunately, in both the past and today, the people that get offended by these [things, whatever they may be] are likely in the minority. So I somewhat agree with OP that most people don't really give a shit if you joke about a sensitive topic as most people either find it funny or can at least appreciate the fact that it is comedy. 

The minority of people that get offended are the ones that write a blog about it or make a Facebook post. The irony is they are almost always the ones that are actual toxic people - not the original person who made the joke."

4770,"Absolutely. I did a search to pull it up again, and actually found a decent article from Time after the Baltimore riots titled “What Martin Luther King Jr Really Thought About Riots”.

http://time.com/3838515/baltimore-riots-language-unheard-quote/

The article quotes MLK as follows:

&gt;&gt; *…I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.*"

4774,"When I spent the night for the first time at my jr High best friends house I remember we stayed up all night playing Skyrim and then right before we went to bed he said “oh by the way put a pillow over your feet so nobody grabs them.” I was bewildered. He ended up telling me that basically his house was haunted and something liked to grab his feet at night. After that I thought he fell asleep so we stopped talking and from his living room I heard what sounded like a hall full of people walking around and feet scuffling the floor and all kinds of voices making conversation but I couldn’t make out what they were talking about. I went to wake up my friend but he just said “yeah, I hear it too, it happens pretty much every night.” 
I had no explanation for it whatsoever. Everyone in the house was asleep but us. It didn’t sound like a TV that got left on it sounded like a real life audience of people conversing and moving around. To this day I wonder about it so much. Between what I experienced and the stories he told me of other things that occurred in the house I was pretty spooked."
4775,"You're throwing around some numbers. How about the number of studies that provide an alternate cause? Do those 8k something studies all suggest some other cause? Or do they only confirm climate change without suggesting a cause?  Is there any singular non-anthropogenic theory that is mentioned by more than 4k something studies?

If not, then even based on the non-cited statistics you gave, one could say that there is a consensus that it is real, and there is a consensus that it is man made.

It was a small web marketing company; I'd been working there for about four months... reluctantly. When they hired me, they wanted to pay me $1,000 a month, as an independent contractor. This meant no benefits, buying my own equipment (which, as luck would have it, my laptop died just before I took the job), and paying a lot more in taxes. Furthermore, they wanted me to build 2 websites a *week*.

They had no business hiring people as contractors, we should have been employees. Eventually, the state labor board investigated, and wanted proof that we were contractors. So they asked each of us to create business cards for ourselves (at our expense, of course) as proof. That was the last straw. Calmly, but with very great satisfaction, I walked in to the boss's office and said that I would not be providing a business card, as I would instead be quitting."

When I was working at an after school program, the directors decided they were going to move me from the kindergarten group (where I had been for 1.5 years) to the 2nd grade group, and move the 2nd grade teacher to K. We had a lot of really... dynamic... personalities in kindergarten. Our most challenging kids had diagnosed syndromes / illnesses they had to balance with learning how to go to school for the first time. 

I was working on individual behavior plans with each of the students in question, and was seeing improvement with all of them. I was concerned with one little boy though who, at the time my director told me they wanted me to switch, was on his ""last chance""; that is, one more incident and he was out of the program. The 2nd grade teacher is great and currently doing really well, but her personality is definitely adapted more to older kids, whereas K still needs to be babied a little bit. I saw a personality clash coming up between her and this one student.

I brought these concerns to my directors, who poo pooed them away and made the switch anyway. One afternoon I was subbing at the middle school and got a text from my supervisor saying the kid I had been worried about had just been kicked out, something to do with an argument with the new teacher.

I fucking called it. "

4854,"I read this book way before the show was in production. Even then I knew something bad was going to happen. There was tension in that chapter, I distinctly remember being made uncomfortable by the descriptions of bad food and bad music. 

And by that point in the books (as with the show) the reader knew bad things were just going to happen. 

I expected Edmure to be taken prisoner, or Cat, or Rob. Maybe one of them would die. Perhaps all three, but I thought that was a stretch. I was fully banking on my prisoner/hostage theory. 

What I did not foresee, and it has stuck with me ever since, is the North/Riverlands losing the war right there in that chapter. I expected them to united the kingdoms and ride north to help the Night's Watch fight The Others. But the entire army died.  It was horrific and hit me hard. 

It was a bizarre moment, because it was a book series I was enjoying so much. A book series I couldn't get anyone else to read, and I got to this horrific event with no fanfare or warning. No one else to bemoan it too. And although it was a gut wrenching moment, I had half a book to go, and I had to see what was going to happen next with so many characters (including a POV character) now dead. 

It was a moment that crushed me and made the books endeared to me. 

It was the very first scene I thought of when I heard they were making it into a show. "

People are conditioned from a young age to be against psychedelics specifically. A lot of people would simply reduce this conversation to two neck beards living in their mom's basement or two druggies. This is how people think. And it's wrong. The people making LSD anyways probably have PhDs and are synthesizing it because they actually believe with their heart that they are helping the human race. And I do not disagree with them. Nowadays the movement with psychedelics is more full blown than ever because of the drastic increase in real research and easy access to it. 

I am just very happy I live in this time period. Within the next 25 years, psychedelics will be used once again for what their purpose has always been. Therapy for mental illness, spirituality, addiction, fear of mortality due to terminal illness, compassion, depression, anxiety, coming to grips with traumatic events such as loved ones dying.. you name it.. And even for spiritual purposes(which in my own personal experience, these two aspects go hand in hand as ayahuasca caused me a full blown religious experience and that was exactly what my therapy required even though I didn't know it. Not many people are so lucky to experience something like that first-hand.), But not all people are into spirituality and that's okay, they will still receive aid from psychedelics. Back to it not being for everyone though, it really isn't. The people who it is though, as far as I've seen, are helped in a very real and positive way. 

Psychedelics are just so important. And it's become such a taboo. It is quite sad. Times are changing though, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.

 My point is that this legal definition is not consistent, and is fundamentally unfair and undemocratic in its application.

The solution is a new, distinct legal definition that maintains some degree of streamlining, but also preserves the important distinctions between flesh-and-blood people and the legal concept that defines a group of people working together for financial gain. "

Asking people to act busy when all the busy work is done frustrates me to no end and I just don't do it. "

Seeing as domestic means belonging to as specific country. Now let's say OP is was from France, then in their case domestic beer means French beer. So the sentence translates as ""the largest French beer manufacturer in the world"". Wouldn't it be more logical to just say ""the largest beer manufacturer in France"", seeing as the word domestic is already narrowing the playing field to a single country? 

The other way I thought it might be interpreted is that OP means ""the largest beer manufacturer in the world that only sells and/or manufacturers in a single country"". Budweiser is sold and produced in a number of countries so that doesn't apply to them though."

Two days later the ferret was dead. Bladder infection. 

We brought him in to see another vet, the original one happened to walk by, realised the ferret was in shock because he wasn't moving, and whisked him off to the back to warm him up. Nurses everywhere, hair dryer out, water bottles brought in along with armfuls of towels. The ferret passed away a few hours later.

To the vet's credit, though, he was mortified. He handwrote an apology card to us, and during subsequent visits (our usual vet was his coworker, who hadn't been available to do the initial operation) he did everything he could to mend bridges such as asking after our other ferrets and taking pictures with our disabled boy (the dead ferret's brother). Even my mother, who's still mad at me for things I did when I was *four*, forgave him, so now whenever we see him we greet him warmly. She eventually told him he did his best and it wasn't his fault.

As I learned later, these scam artists make their money by selling you a prepaid amount of space ahead of time, then when it turns out you actually need much more than the initial estimate the price per foot goes through the roof.

So I got on the phone with some slick phone salesman. I told him I had a standard 1BR apt and he came back with ""based on our experience, you should only need two linear feet"".

Huh.

So I asked him to hold on while I measured my sofa. The shortest dimension was 28 inches. So I asked him how sure he was about his estimate.

He responded that he was ""highly confident"" two feet would be enough.

So I told him about the sofa measurement and asked whether the work crew would be bringing a chainsaw."

The worst was ordering a 9lb pork shoulder roast. They'd substitute a single 1lb pork shoulder cut from the meat department despite my repeated notes I needed those 9lbs, not just 1! The last straw was going in the store right after picking up my order and finding 5 of the ""out of stock"" 9lb roasts right there on the shelf."

5273,"In this story, i am not the one who did not understand, but i was protecting someone who was too young to understand.

Anyways, I was 14 and often stayed at my friend house. Ill call her Kim. My friends mother was very mean and although i still dont know her full story, I witnessed her rage and knew that she mistreat and sometimes beat Kim, and Kims younger sisters, aged 11 and 3. One day, while at Kim's, her little sisters were gone spending the day with their father (Kims mother had recently got divorced). When the sisters returned I remembering that they smelled of their fathers cologne (Father sprayed them with it so when they returned home mother would smell it and be forced to think of him. let me also say Kim's mother being reminded of her ex husband was bad because he was abusive towards her and brought back bad memories for her). When Kim's mom smelled her daughters it triggered her rage. she screamed and yelled and eventually went to her room. about an hour later, she calmly came down stairs, where me, Kim, and her sisters were watching tv. She hugged Kim and turned to the 11 and 3 year old and said ""this is all your fault"", said goodbye, and walked upstairs and locked her door. Kim quickly ran up stairs, knowing her mother was about to commit suicide, and banged loudly on the locked bedroom door.  i quickly took the 11 year old and 3 year old outside to the backyard. I didn't know exactly what to do but i thought if there was a gun shot, it would be better for them to be outside, one for the sound of it being slightly more muffled and two so they wouldn't see the mess. now I know there were much smarter things for me to do like go for help or call the cops, but i was scared and wasnt thinking straight in the moment. i pushed the 3 year old on the swing to distract her and the 11 year old walked to a near by friends house thinking her mother was just raging out again and so I let her leave thinking that was probably best. I stayed with the 3 year old and continued pushing her on the swing. I remember that sweet little girl having no idea what was happening. the child wasnt even sad or crying because hearing yelling and screaming was normal for her it probably didnt phase her at all. eventually police showed up and my friends mother was safe. she was planning on overdosing on anti depressants, but Kim managed to break down the door and stop her mother before she had the chance. 

Id like to also say that now, 5 years later, Kims mother is doing much better. she recently got remarried to a good man, and Kim and her sisters have a fantastic relationship with their mother. But I sometimes think, that 3 year old little girl, now 8, will probably never be told about that day and probably wont remember it at all. A day that could've ended in tragedy if it wasn't for her older sister. Kim was a very strong 14 year old, now that I think about it. "

I just figured, he didn’t think I could handle camping because most girls at that age, are grossed out by dirt and boys. Two years later, that same teacher was arrested for molesting the boys he took on those camping trips. No wonder he didn’t want a girl to join the trip.  

     This goes along with what happened above, I was very much a tomboy and my best friend was a boy. He went on a couple of those camping trips and I was mad because he wouldn’t tell our teacher, that I should get to go to. It wasn’t until after the teacher was caught, that my friend told me that was the reason he didn’t want me to go on those trips, because he couldn’t protect me."

One day, I’m sitting right in front of the tv playing that god awful Cat in the Hat video game based on the movie, while suddenly my attention is drawn to my grandfather, drunk off his ass in the middle of the day, with my grandmother pinned underneath him while he screams at her and she cries and says he’s hurting her.  I turned away and didn’t see what happened after but as an adult, I realize it’s possible I witnessed much worse than that and just don’t remember. 

Many years later I was living with my grandparents and witnessed and heard my grandfather going through some anger episode with my grandma. As an adult I realize how fucked up their relationship is and I’m not sure why they’ve stayed together, my grandfather is very verbally and possibly physically abusive.

I once asked my grandmother why he’s like that and she said, “Well, he always says I’m the reason he’s angry, he’s never seen a doctor about it”. I was even in a relationship with a guy once who was very similar to my grandfather and even defended how my grandfather acted, at the time I thought he was right and my grandfather wasn’t doing anything wrong. 

Abuse in any form ISN’T okay. Verbal or physical. Both take a toll on your mental state. I would know, as my grandfather didn’t only verbally abuse my grandfather and my ex ruined any self esteem I had. Thank god for counseling. "

She told me she was going to bring some one day and I didn't believe her. The next day she pulled out a wadded up paper towel from her pocket and opened it up under the desk to show me. Inside was what looked like cooking spices and she insisted it was weed. I didn't believe her but at the same time I was frozen stiff terrified of it (again I was a little goodie two-shoes). I feel bad now because I kind of stopped talking to her after that and looking back she was probably just lonely and thought she would make a friend with me by impressing me with her weed and instead it pushed me away. If I was as familiar with weed back then as I am now I would have totally been her friend.  "

5502,"if the sr71 is mentioned, post the sr71 story:

There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were  the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of  this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun  to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe  flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day  in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to  be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. 

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We  needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission  Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark.  We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly.  My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel  pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying  real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in  the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts  80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from  the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of  simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat.  There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before  us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice  for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority  transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult,  too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire  flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of  the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still  insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however.  Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at  sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with  years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds  for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the  radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The  predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us,  controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their  scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally  would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center  for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie  175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""

Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that  whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force  One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional,  tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston  Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing  documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm  and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other  controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they  basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would  be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the  years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to  pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to  ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at  least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on  frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I  have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I  thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna  brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore  came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he  sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"".  Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a  ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he  asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making  sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what  true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just  wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And  the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct  alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the  ground.""

And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my  hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself  that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be  done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity  will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of  our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a  crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the  integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside  his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from  the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had  become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke:  ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?""  There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday  request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and  forty-two knots, across the ground.""

I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate  and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation,  and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew  that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was  when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like  voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen  hundred on the money.""

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in  the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger  that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys  have a good one.""

It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable  sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal  airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more  importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A  fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency  all the way to the coast.

For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there."

5513,"Oh boy lots to go over here.

First let's address the medical aspects:

[“It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) And they can easily be treated through standard antibiotics if and when there's an issue. 


[“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) Also circumcision is not effective prevention. Condoms must be used regardless.


[""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)


[“Decreased penile cancer risk: [Number needed to circumcise] = 900 – 322,000”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision).


I say at these stats it's disingenuous to suggest these are legitimate medical benefits. All of these items have different and more effective treatments or prevention methods.

And to round it out, [""the mucosal surfaces of the inner foreskin and glans penis adhere to one another; the foreskin is not redundant skin. The foreskin gradually separates from the glans during childhood. By six years of age, 50% of boys can retract their foreskins, although the process of separation may not be complete until puberty: 95% of boys have retractile foreskin by 17 years of age.[5] Parents may be reassured by their observation of an unimpaired urinary stream in a boy with a nonretracted foreskin. Until this developmental process is complete, the best descriptor to use is ‘nonretractile foreskin’ rather than the confusing and perhaps erroneous term ‘physiologic phimosis’.""](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) 

As for what we can do to newborns, the Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:

&gt; Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary. In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices.

Vaccines protect against deadly diseases for which there are no treatments, no other prevention method, and can not reasonably be delayed until the patient can make his own decision.

On to more interesting topics, [Dr. Guest discusses what the foreskin tissue is, innervation, how the most sensitive part of the penis is removed by circumcision, the mechanical function of the foreskin and its role in lubrication during sex, and the possibility of decreased sexual pleasure for both male and partner.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=28m20s)(nsfw slides) 

Here's the study he references which shows the foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) Full study [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847).

As for the evolution aspect brought up, he later discusses [through examples of the ape family](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=41m33s) how the trend of heavily innervated foreskin [is a sign of evolutionary advancement from the lower primate species. It contributes to pair bonding, evolutionarily important for the male to stay and care for offspring.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=46m26s)

5640,"I worked at a restaurant as an assistant manager. I was working 60+ hours a week at a $28000 a year SALARY(this is important later) because I was young and that was a lot of money to me at the time I took it. One day I was working a shift and all of a sudden, out of no where, I got a horrendous pain in my side and lower back. It was totally unfathomable. I couldn't even stand up straight. So I called my boss at the time and told him that I needed to go to the ER. Let me take this time to say that I never called in. I took a lot of pride in my work and my open availability and was there for them all the time for whatever they needed. So my boss angrily comes in and says, ""I'm tired of doing your fucking job for you all the time."" I was in so much pain at the time I just brushed it off to deal with later and called my dad to come pick me up because I couldn't even drive myself to the ER. 

It turns out I had a kidney stone that was small enough to pass naturally, but big enough to murder my insides as it passed. I got a doctor's note to not work until it passes, which took 9 days. I returned to work ON THANKSGIVING after my stone passed and when I walked in my boss told me, ""you know you aren't getting paid for missing all that time right?"" to which I responded, ""ummmm... I'm a salaried manager. This is literally the reason I accepted this position, so that I have these benefits for times like this."" and he said, ""we never agreed to give you benefits."" I very calmly took my store key off my key ring and set it on the counter and left without saying a word. 

It was the best decision I've ever made and I'm so happy I did it. Fuck working in restaurant management. It is literally,"" how far can we run you into the ground before you break and we can promote another bright eyed 19 year old that thinks 30k/yr is a lot of money?""

5655,"Perhaps not someone insanely close to me, but a few years ago I found out some horrible things about one of my father's sisters, and that entire side of the family in general.

Over the course of about six months, my mother began to share stories about raising us (myself and elder, unidentical twins). A lot of ups, but also a lot of downs about a specific aunt of mine, such as:

+ making my parents become financially dependent on her by forcing them to live together, and have my father working with her husband (his brother in-law)
+ trying to raise my siblings as her own
+ emotionally abusing my mother and blaming my brother's autism on my mother's sinful past (as a religious person, this is painful to hear)
+ trying to ""get rid of"" me when I was born (an accident, therefore frowned upon)

It was difficult to learn all of this, especially considering this aunt (along with her two, great kids, adults now) were my closest relatibes growing up, and they coddled me. I've come to learn that the only reasons they were so kind were because a) I'm pretty academic and my culture adores that and b) they wanted to turn me against my mother. Nowadays, we see them out ot courtesy (inviting for dinner) every month or so, far less than we used to, and it is always awkward. It's weird to share greeting kisses with a woman who never wanted you born.

I don't think I could give the situation justice, but it was very difficult to find out and hard to process. More than anything, I felt bad for my parents, especially my mother, who had no choice but to endure abuse from my dad's side for almost 5 years until they could be independant. 

Another, maybe cooler tale, is that my grandad was born to my great-grandad's maid/mistress rather than his wife, unlike all of his siblings, and there are some interesting stories around a lot of land money that disappeared to be told. And my other grandmother was robbed at gunpoint with her one-year-old son for all her wedding gold, so that's... gone."

Rush ends and the truck comes in with stock, the franchise owner THROWS a box of coffee at the backs of my legs, taking out my knee as I’m taking an order, he yells “find somewhere for this to go” and my manager swoops in and tells me to keep quiet. That wasn’t even my final straw.

It’s a good safe hazard, I ask why the manager can wear a pin style poppy but I can’t wear the ones they hand out all over town. Told not to argue and that corporate has approved the pin style and sends them for managers, not employees. Fine. Whatever. 

Sure enough, friends mom walks in, we exchange greetings and she asks me if I need a poppy, I start to explain and chose to just take her offer of her poppy and tell managers to shove it. She sacrificed her son for us. Sure enough I get pulled into the office for the poppy, I explain my case and they decide that I’m either going to take it off or be written up, so I tell the manager I’m also not comfortable with training new people my first week, being barked at etc and she tells me to suck it up.

My only stipulation when I was hired, is that I would not work Sundays for ""religious reasons"" - I left it at that, because I knew if I had said I needed 1 day a week to myself where I wasn't working either job, it would be a matter of time until they took advantage.

Fast forward to month 3. They asked if I could come in on a Sunday for POS training. I told my manager I would make an exception this one time. Minimum hours they can ask someone to come in for is 4 in Ontario. The training only took an hour, so looks like we're all moving/stocking inventory for 3 hours. Looks like I'm the only male there that day, so I get the heavy lifting.

At the end of the 4 hours, ""so and so called in sick, can you stay to cover their shift?"" Sure, no problem. Aaand then someone else... that was the final straw. Quit on the spot.

Has  a nice ending though:

She had an indoor entry/exit but could also use the cellar door if she wanted (it as one of those big metal doors you can lock from the outside with steps leading down into the basement.) When she died in her mid 80s, my cousin was helping his dad clean out her belongings and in a closet he found TONS of his toys she's stolen and hidden from him going clear back to his early childhood. He said one of his memories of her involved him crying about a missing truck and she told him if he really cared about his toys, he wouldn't leave them laying around outside. He found stuff like buckets and shovels from his sandbox, dozens of balls for various sports, GI Joes and He-Man figurines, matchbox cars.  I guess if he left something outside, she'd go up and take it in the mornings before anyone else was awake and she did it for years.  He even found a skateboard he thought his neighbor stole! "

He also became a hermit and would speak to no one but her.

It only sounds eerie or mysterious when you lie about it. Y'all are making it sound like one day all was well, and the next day every person in the neighborhood vanished, and in no way is that what happened.

Clairton shrank from 20k to 7k within the last half century. There are lots of abandoned houses. Lincoln Way is an isolated, dead-end road, so it's not surprising that none of the neighbors stuck around to live by themselves."

I can’t focus on any one thing and it just feels like everything is happening at once and everything is running out. I tend to get this weird sensation of everything is ending very quickly and there’s no way to stop it. Like I’m running out of air, I’m running out of time, etc. That feeling makes me extremely panicked. I try my best to prevent myself from getting close to a full blown attack.

One crash out of about 86,000 total flights (based on the 11.64 hull losses/million flights rate) puts the plane at a hull loss per flight rate 8 times higher than 747s, and 13 times higher than 737s. Of course, it's unclear how much of that is just a statistical anomaly as a result of the very low amount of Concorde aircraft movements.

Flying for 26 years without crashes doesn't tell the full story if your aircraft is only flying ~200 flights a year (other aircraft are flying more like 4 flights a day). The space shuttle ""only"" had two disasters in 30 years, but because it flew just 135 missions, it managed a hull loss per million flights rate of 14,814."

I don't think they're actually attracted to them, but think that they should be so try to convince themselves that they are. When I was young, I was taught that being attracted to thin, healthy women was extremely shallow. I spent years trying to convince myself that I was attracted to large women and would actually feel guilty for finding any thin woman attractive. The media may push a certain body type, and while some are legitimately attracted to that type, other people will simply claim to be into that body type just because that's what they think they're supposed to be attracted to."

Banning lolicon would be like banning video games with murders. A lot of people do murder NPCs in virtual worlds to satisfy their sadistic urges.

But, enjoying killing in video games doesn't necessary mean that you would enjoy killing in real life. The same thing apply to lolicon. Being aroused by lolicon doesn't necessary mean that you would be aroused by real children. "

Before the internet, a guy like Alex Jones would have been limited to news letters and and possibly local radio (though I doubt even that with the things he says).

I was working at a power plant which was under the energy division of a food and beverage corporation that was attempting to diversify.

Now, they gave me the whole spiel of being a great company to work for, that they'd look good on a resume, etc. but I had some doubts due to even just basic stuff like the living conditions of our bunkhouses (which were barely livable to begin with).

One incident that clearly stood out to me was when they were trying to measure/monitor the vibration of one of our generating units. Damn fools used a glass filled with water to see if there was excess vibration. Luckily they had recently purchased a handheld vibration sensor and I took the initiative to get some hard data while the generator was running. They were so impressed that they were telling me that I should be teaching that to the rest of the corporation's sites. To put things into context, it was the first time I handled a vibration sensor and I had zero experience going into the job. The power plant had been in operation for nearly 50 years and the corporation already had a lot of breweries and factories to their name. Are they telling me that they had no idea about this in the collective centuries of knowledge of their workforce?"

1. Don't buy lots of tickets for Freshers events before you meet your house and coursemates and find out what they're doing.

2. Try to visit to your Student union in the day during freshers week, you might be hungover but there's plenty of free stuff and clubs to join. It's less daunting joining a club and society if you speak to their members beforehand, they'll be super nice and welcoming.

3. Everyone is in the same boat and wants to make friends, don't be afraid to knock on doors in your block/introduce yourself to your coursemates, find out what people are doing, join them for a night out etc.

4. Likewise, don't be sad if it's a few weeks and you feel like you haven't made close friends yet. You may have known your friends for years in college and high school so it will take time to be on that level with university people. Just keep an open mind and don't lock yourself in your room.

5. Not all clubs are made equal. The union is cheap and fun but can be really busy and sweaty during freshers. Avoid Tiger Tiger and Space they're not very good. Generally everywhere is super busy during freshers, so make your final judgement after. Experience and decide for yourself, obviously if all of your new friends are going somewhere, you might as well check it out.

TL;DR: Keep an open mind, be willing to meet and befriend people and most importantly have fun! Don't be nervous it all works out in the end."

At the beginning of the classroom portion (high schoolers require this portion in my state) we were to fill out a form that said to state any medical disabilities which could impede your ability to drive or learn. I wrote ADHD, Depression and Anxiety. Though my anxiety at the time was not really that bad at all. He once pulled me out of class and screamed at me, asking why it seemed I wasnt able to pay attention. I told him I had ADHD. He suddenly got pissed and said I should have wrote it on the form. I told him I did. He later fact checked an apologized. Ass. 

Oh, my high school also had a one way horseshoe drive by the front entry. My driving instructor proceeded to go the wrong way down said drive and nearly hit my mom... then tried to reenact it on the white board since I called him out on it in class and couldn't. At this point I determined he was rather ignorant. 

So at the end of so many hours of classroom time we are given this pink slip to sign and then we take it to the DMV to prove our classroom time to get our permits. Technically I forgot stuff at home so I missed about an hour, which I was supposed to have to make up. But he gave me the pink slip to sign and return to him. I signed it, then pocketed it. He asked for it back and I told him I had already returned it. Since he couldn't find it he gave me another to sign and return, which I did. And because his dumb ass had already pre-signed these... I was able to take the one I pocketed to the DMV and skip the hour I had missed because fuck that guy. Didnt learn anything of value from him anyway. Just lots of bad habits. "

Our bathroom was right outside the bedroom door (I heard nothing when I passed it going into my room), and it sounds like it's actually coming from the bathroom and not from the apartment upstairs. So I knock thinking maybe my mom didn't go to work, but there's no answer.


I open the door, and the sink is running full blast. I clearly remember shutting off both taps, ran into my room and snapped the phone shut, grabbed my key and ran out of the apartment.


I still question my sanity over that incident. It sounds crazy, right? Did I actually fall asleep at my vanity and have that vivid of a dream that it scared me out of my own apartment?

Next day, my neighbor asks me about my basement light being on around 2am, which was weird, because no one else was home. I go down the basement, Xbox, 2 laptops missing, TV is unplugged and was near the back door, there were a few cigarette butts on the floor and piss in the basement toilet. Also, I search the rest of the house and there are dirt from footprints up my steps to just before my bedroom. After piecing it all together, these guys were chilling in my house for almost 2 hours, possibly even saw me sleeping, and must’ve been spooked by something because they prepared, but left the TV behind. I’m a heavy sleeper, so I didn’t wake up for any of it."

Those *actions* are evil.

If you think someone's being racist, challenge her on her beliefs. If they're irrational, it should be fairly easy to back them into a corner. But for the love of God please don't assume that everyone who says something racial is some hateful bigot. Just like libel, truth should be an absolute defense against accusations of racism.

About halfway up the stairs he tried to trip me again and it pushed me over the edge. I turned around and just pushed him down the flight of stairs, about 6 steps. He landed on his ass and everyone laughed at him. He never messed with me again after that.

Years later, after high school, I went to a party and he was there. I said ""hey, how's it going?"" He just looked at me and didn't say anything. Then he left the party about a min later. I found out later he left because he hated me and didn't want to be there if i was there. After years of him abusing me I humiliated him one time and like 6 years after that he still wasn't over it.

He then went on to point out all the techniques Belfort used to close his sales - leaning forward, speaking at a low volume, using positive words, asking closed questions with ""yes"" answers, etc.

I pointed out that I don't think those things had as much to do with his success in sales as he thought, it was probably more to do with the way Belfort would blatantly lie to people and make false promises about the returns they would get on their investments. The manager insisted I was wrong, and it was all in the way he spoke and the words he used."

I could have it all clean and reported to the IRS in 6 months. I would also hire a mechanic and pay him cash to do the work. You could find another mechanic looking to sell his 20k Snap-on box for cash and be set up. Buy a couple used lifts for like 5k each, pay a few grand cash to get them installed, renovate my offices, repave the parking lot, buy a couple classic cars and restore them, sell them at Mecum auctions and pay someone to overbid on them. The possibilities are endless. I truly doubt it would take me more than 6 months to clean 750k."

Perhaps if you’re on the left you may not want a child to have extremely religious or fundamentalist parents. And of course if you’re on the right there’s the obvious question of gay marriage. Maybe you just know this couple is mean. So to what level do we allow this kind of bias? Should it be allowed at all for the sake of equality?

It is a little disappointing for me, yes, but their brain structure doesn't support being attracted to a woman. I can't fault them for that, so in the end, I just feel more or less the same. It doesn't make me feel that bad because it isn't anything to do with me. 

^(I realize how odd that ""brain structure"" statement sounds when written out, but I don't know how else to really phrase it. Trust me, I've nothing against gay guys or straight girls.

Once you do... don't just pour water into the rice. Ensure you're using a glutinous rice (aka Sushi Rice, Sticky Rice, etc), but before you fill the water to measure and boil it, you need to rinse the rice.

If you want nice, sticky rice that's easy to clean, fill and drain the container until the water you drain looks clear. At the start of the process, the rice will be white and milky.

Once done, drain the water entirely and tap the pot until the rice is relatively even. Fill slowly with fresh water until the water is roughly your pinky finger's full digit from the top of the rice.

I was in preschool and my father had signed me up for Soccer. Mom was against it (""He'd get bored, don't put him through that!""), but dad _insisted_ that I try.

Guess which parent was right. In my first game, I sorta half-followed the ball. My dad described me as ""30 feet behind the crowd, lazily jogging behind and turning slowly as they went the other way.""

Eventually I stopped playing and sat on the ground, picking grass. Coach got mad, so I looked him in the eyes and said ""I'm bored. I wanna go home.""

I got put on the sidelines for the rest of the game, so my mom pulled me from Soccer. On the way home, I was asking my mom how good I did before I saw it, glowing like a shining pinnacle of society, in _this tiny little town_ I saw a _GODDAMN LIBRARY!_

I forced my dad to stop the damn car. I ran in there, read my fill of Dr. Seuss, admired their awesome fishtank, it was great. I've been trying to figure out where that library is, my mom genuinely doesn't remember. What a shame. "

I like to masturbate while laying on my back but I’m OCD about clean up and hate when it goes all over me or my bed.

Within 5 minutes of the sit-down with me, my husband, the Sgt and the 1st Sgt, I had proven all the ways she broke her oath as an NCO, listing what she had done to my family, how her behavior was below the level of respect and responsibility required of her, and how she was doing a disservice to those under her that she was required to lead. I had prepared 3 HOURS of Army Regs she had broken, proven her twisted cruelty on my family, and warned her I had already gone to the IG and filed a complaint.

im not really sure what lucky means but the random fling part i addressed by saying its not like she(random fling) was the one that did it to me so whatever. whether youre a victim of rape or not if you wouldnt it like it for him/her to say something like that, that as in rape this pussy, then you can say something. you dont have to go into detail as of to why if you dont feel like opening up like that or you can just make something up. it may kill the mood though so you could say something after. but assuming its a one night stand i wouldnt care because like i said again its not like shes the one that did it. thats just me personally though. other people can just speak up or speak up after if theyre afraid of killing the mood so say the second time they go at it he or she wont say something like that.

also @ /u/Painted_Agency you might save that for a committed lover but if this is a fetish of hers maybe its just easier to scratch that itch with a stranger because she doesnt want to feel judged by someone she has a lot of feelings for just yet...you know how you kind of hold back your personality for a while and slowly let it leak out. that kind of stuff takes time so maybe she just wanted to have some fun for a night. 

to sum up my point though. you dont know what peoples lives have been like -- yes thats true but you dont need to make your personal life someone elses problem. you sometimes just need to let shit go otherwise it can become worse than the incident itself."

I ask her to please refrain from the language because this is a family store. She says fuck you i want avocados this is bs.

At this point i tell her i refuse to help her and she can leave my store. This pissed her over even more and she starts swearing up a storm. She told me i can go fuck myself and she wont be shopping here any more. I said we are ok with that have a nice day. 

At this point 2 other women by me ( both customers ) look at me and apologize for her behaviour. I tell them its ok i dont let people like that get to me. The raging women still hasnt left at this point and im just ignoring her waiting for security to come take her out.

Me: ""... No, cheese isn't a vegetable so keep the cheese on the hamburger.""

Cashier: ""Oh.""

Me: ""...The vegetables would be the tomato, lettuce, onion and pickle.""

Cashier: ""Huh, it that so? Didn't know.""*Shrugs*

Me: ... (internally: did this guy seriously think cheese was a vegetable???)


2) My family had just relocated from Canada to Washington DC, USA. At the hotel, I went to the hot tub with my little brother. There were an elderly couple there who overheard us talking, and noted our accent. We told them we were Canadian.

Elderly couple from Texas: ""So do Canadians have air conditioning?""

My brother and I exchanged glances, *are these people serious? We decided to pull a [Rick Mercer moment just like when he would talk to uninformed American republicans about fake facts about Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFgPX0hnNfA), just to see if they were really that clueless about Canada and Canadians*

Me:""No, it's much too cold up north, it drops down all the way to 0 on most nights.""

Elderly Texan lady: ""Oh my! No wonder you wanted to move.""

My brother looked away trying not to laugh as I continued, ""Yeah, that's why our White House in Manitoba is actually an igloo and ice castle.""

Elderly couple were incredulous, ""it's a wonder anyone can survive up there.""

My brother and I agree and change the subject since we just shocked that they could be so uninformed about the country so close to their own.

I really wish I could say that the second scenario was made-up but it really did happen. How could some people be so ignorant about the world around them? I met a lot of Americans who didn't know much about Canada (or other countries either for that matter) at all which is kinda sad really since we are supposed to be allies."

and for clarification, it’s not like every single bathroom in every place has one, it tends to be nicer stores/restaurants in my experience :)

hope this helps!"

6750,"When I was in 3rd grade, my older brother and I were walking home from playing tennis at a nearby outdoor court at an Air Force Base in Germany. It was night time and this man walked up to us and started chatting. I didn’t think anything of it for the longest time, and then he starts playing with his penis and says to me, “Have you ever seen one of these before?” I finally started to realize he wasn’t wearing anything besides a tank top and tennis shoes. I can’t remember what I said, but my brother told him we were expected at home, so the man says bye. When we got home, my brother told my parents all about it and they took us down to the military police. They asked lots of questions and had us go through pictures, but I didn’t recognize anyone and I’m 99% sure they didn’t believe us. 

TL DR: Saw a streaker in 3rd grade and didn’t know better. "

6762,"Cheap answer, but video games.

You'd be surprised the kind of shit you can find for free. A lot of clicker games, but a LOT of genuinely fun free stuff.

**Some obligatory recommendations:**

DC Universe - An MMO set in Gotham/Metropolis where you play a superhero or supervillain mentored by Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Joker, Lex Luther, or Circe. A good game, but rather short. Hey, at least it's free! (minus the expansions)

Lord of the Rings Online - I don't play it, but I know people who do. I'm sure I'd enjoy it if I wasn't already a dedicated WoW player.

Cookie Clicker - If you (for some reason) DO want to play a clicker game, [play the original.](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) It's a lot more complex than it sounds, check out the subreddit if you don't mind spoilers (yes, there are spoilers).

Tetris - You can get it on your phone. It's fucking Tetris, the best-selling game of all time.

Google Pacman - If you wanna play some Pacman but don't wanna invest in some Pacman, go on Google and search ""Google Pacman."" It's a completely unique board shaped like the Google Logo (which may make it more or less enticing), and was by far the best doodle Google's ever done and has yet to beat.

Google Breakout - You can also go to Google Images and play some Breakout by searching ""Atari Breakout.""

This is all some basic surface level stuff I toy around with from time to time, you can go way deeper into the free games rabbit hole. (Also, I guess the comments will be full of them if this post takes off.)"

its  fucking wood  and paper  and wires and  some land  and more  wood  and wires. 

anything over 50k  and your just   throwing money out the door  imo. 

it dosent cost 160k  to build a house. if  you didnt need permits   and  have to go thru a million loop holes i could build a livable house for  like  40k  probably less  because i would not use drywall  fuck that shit. 

like modern houses  have gotten away from  what a house is supposed to be. 

people see houses as a status symbol  or a indication of wealth. 

you know what i see??

i see a person who was so stupid that  they thought  spending 160k  on a house  was a good idea.  i see somebody who wasnt  smart enough to think that that might  be a horrible deal and  incredible over priced. 

i could not give a fuck if you have a 160k home or a  6 million dollar home i still think people who over pay  by that much are all fucking  really stupid  and  have no concept of money. 

if i had a160k  i would  keep that shit and  invest it into  business ideas  or ways   to make my money  earn more money so i never have to set food in a fast food kitchen again. 

you bought a house that makes you no money it infact costs you money  every single month you dont even own  the house the bank does  your paying for the privelage to  live in the banks property every month till its paid off. 

your paying for the insurance and the upkeep and the repairs and  the lawn servicing  and the yearly taxes  your taking it up the ass on this house and it never stops even when it paid off  you still have to repair it and upkeep it and pay water electric  trash   yearly taxes ect. 

in my book that makes you the dumbest  mother fucker ive ever heard of. 

while im sitting in my paid of  travel trailer with  3 slides out dual ac  and  surround sound  and a  big ass tv thats swings  into my bedroom and then  if i want to  watch tv in the living area?? it swings around into the living area coolest shit ever. 

no  payments  no mortgage   no bullshit. its freedom. and its cheap
400 bucks to permenantly  setup on a concrete pad on a dudes rv park all bills paid  exsept propain   but hell you only  use that when its col anyways.

I didn't actually see things, no hallucinations, but it really felt different, the world was a different place, I could see the fibonacci sequence in plants, I could take in the energy that surrounded me, my friends and I had some sort of connection at times, we felt and thought the same things, words weren't needed, not even looking at each other was necessary, only our presence. We made music with my guitar that was impossible, I combined tuvan throat singing with guitar playing like I never did before, I unlocked answers and unlocked abilities that simply needed a boost.

6952,"George Lincoln Rockwell, an American conservative, was first politicised by anti-communism and opposed to racial integration, before becoming anti-Jewish. In response to his opponents calling him a ""Nazi"", he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP, to ""own"" the intended insult. In 1959, Rockwell founded the American Nazi Party and instructed his members to dress in imitation SA-style brown shirts, while flying the flag of the Third Reich.

He said he cheated on his wife and she was ok with it, he showed a picture to other people of her but not to me and they all said she was really pretty.

Go to a festival and buy your tickets, beer, food, and souvenirs with the $100 bills.

But you can’t because you’re working, so you consider why you’re living in this miserable place, doing these miserable things for other people, and being so terribly mediocre. But the grueling day is eventually over, and you get to go home. You lie down, pull up reddit before bed, and the top post of today is how a shooter just killed 3 innocent people in your home town. You then can’t get any sleep because you wonder who those people were but names weren’t released. Were they friends? Relatives? You don’t know so you decide the best thing to do is just to rest, so you dose off. Then you’re visited by a night terror, and in the morning, yesterday repeats.

7450,"I turn 20 in December, and I feel like my mom (58) is somewhat of a helicopter parent since I've been doing extensive research on this subject matter. Let me explain: When I was in middle school, I wasn't allowed to do such things that were deemed ""normal"" for teens at the time. I wasn't allowed to go to the roller skating rink without my mom chaperoning. I wasn't allowed to go to burger king when it was near my school after a half day, I wasn't allowed to walk home by myself until high school, I wasn't allowed to hang out with new people unless she could get a hold of their parents. I didn't really date during those time periods; however, I did have some online long distance relationships that I have never her about. During my senior year of high school, my mom wouldn't let me go to my cast party at a bowling because the roads were 'too icy' which wasn't a legitimate excuse for me because it was MY senior year and not hers. Although I felt more free in college since I had a job and some money, I still feel trapped because she's up my ass about my classes, grades, who I hang out with, and my spending habits. Even worse, she still tracks my location, doesn't let me hang out with people the opposite sex, and she is also up my ass about what I am doing in my free time. At this point, I just wanna stop sharing my location with her and just be a normal young adult. "

Adrenaline spiked me into action: no medical insurance and no cell reception meant broken bones, hours of agony, medical bankruptcy.

Just before the edge, I leap to balance against another boulder's face in the pit below, and-- held there by momentum--leap down to another boulder face across and lower, then to an empty spot between them.

Everybody around me just stared while i breathlessly panted and searched in the dirt for my glasses--another $300 I couldn't afford.

Only when the old guy leading the pack picked up his jaw off the floor and said ""Hi, Spiderman!"" Did I realize I did something badass...and wish I struck a three point superhero landing.

7458,"Do you really not see the problem here?  It isn't that you're criticizing a religion, it's that you're focused on one religion in particular when you've already acknowledged that all religions have similar issues.  That's what takes it from a difference of opinion and into the realm of being questionably racist, because while Islam itself isn't an ethnic group, it is heavily associated with Arabic people and with particular prominent cultural expressions of identity.

You don't hear liberal people defending Methodists from scathing attacks because they aren't being attacked with the same frequency as Muslim people are.  

It's simply a sample bias, not a bias of opinion.  Liberal people don't particularly love Muslims, but Muslims are most frequently in need of support in the face of hatred and bigotry."

I noticed that when driving in the dark, it was terrifying, and I'd feel completely freaked out getting to my destination. I went back to the eye doctor, the people there took a look at my glasses and said they looked fine.

A while later, I was still having problems so I decided to try a new eye doctor.  I got both my prescription and the prescription of the glasses I was wearing. One astigmatism value in one lens didn't match up. That gave me an idea, I closed the one eye and everything looked fine, I closed the other, and everything was completely blurry. Ever since then, I've been going to the new eye doctor. That mistake could have easily cost me my life driving, and they didn't take me seriously even when I came back because I thought something was wrong."

7489,"I would reported it to the police, because in most states, there *really is* a “Finders Keepers” statute.

As an example, if the above occurred on the Golden Gate Bridge in California, what would happen is you would turn it over to the police. They would check their records for reports of stolen property, and if nobody showed up to claim it within 90 days, (unlikely in the case of a briefcase full of money that was probably involved in some shady deal), the police are legally obligated to return it to the people who found it.

http://time.com/10118/california-gold-coins-finders-keepers-john-mary

There’s some nuance there, but unless anyone else could provide it belonged to them, in the US it‘s yours, and local government almost never lays a claim because its near impossible to prove.

So yeah, I’d report it, wait three months, and then deposit it in my bank account along with an affidavit from the police so the bank doesnt flag my account.

7604,"I'd keep my job until I could deposit all. I would buy a small safe and keep at home. I would deposit $7500 each Friday to my checking account. The IRS is not looking that closely at your bank account to see if you are cheating on taxes or laundering money. I would deposit all but like $10k, just in case I had to lam it. I would also spend some cash before I deposited it all. Wouldn't change my lifestyle much but I would buy a few nice things. I would transfer most to a brokerage and savings and keep a good cushion in checking. Once it was all deposited or spent or left for lamming, I would quit my job &amp; travel for a year. "

Even things that are technically someone else’s fault are situations that you should have anticipated, prepared for, and avoided. Getting older is way less of a bummer than I thought it would be- sure a lot of dreams will never come true but I now realize that I’m the only one in control of my life."

Sorry dude, I genuinely felt bad.

More recently, (As in a couple years ago) an old school friend commissioned me to print and assemble some raffle ticket books. He supplied me with all necessary equipment: guillotine/rotary cutter/rotary perforator, business card cutter, heavy duty stapler and heavy duty staple remover, even a multi-function laser printer and laptop. After everything was done, I called/messaged him a few times about his stuff, but we never got around to meeting up for them, until he did call me because he needed his printer back, so I gave it back to him... and completely forgot everything else.

So now, I've had a box of printing paraphernalia and a laptop collecting dust next to my sofa in my living room for ~2 years."

One of us had to die and they had secretly chosen me behind my back. They both said “We’re so sorry,” as they pulled out silenced handguns and shot me in the head.

So I declined the service, took the car home, and began planning how to get rid of the car and get a new one.

On a whim, however, I decided to Google it. I typed in ""1990 Honda Accord st--"" and the first recommended autocomplete was ""--uck in second gear"". As it turns out, it's a common problem, easily traceable to a single bad capacitor and a bad resistor on the transmission control circuit board. I popped open the control unit, and sure enough, the capacitor and resistor were both visibly fried.

Less than $1 worth of components from RadioShack and a little bit of soldering, and the transmission was fixed. The car ran fine for years after that.

You don't make enough to be 'experienced' at a new company, so you put in 2-3 years. By this time you can move to another company, but not in your field of study.

7762,"Yes. It’s easier to argue certain Islam is more violent than others because you can reasonably quantify the violence. However, more you become abstract in your claim, it becomes more difficult to justify your point. What constitutes moderate or extreme and how do you justify your reasoning?

That’s the relativist explanation of the weakness of relativism."
7763,"Well for the US, it'd depend on who is in charge at the time. If it is now, looking at how foreign humans are treated, I don't think extraterrestrials would be well received. Their technology and goods would be well received, not the ETs themselves. "

Studying for finals I was just eaten ramen and maybe a few sandwiches every now and then, and I was so focused on studying I didn't really pay attention that I wasn't shitting.

I told her that she was an evil witch and couldn’t kill me because I was too smart for her. This upset her and she left my room saying “that isn’t normal honey!” Then Edward from twilight ate all my friends while he stood sparkling in the window light.

7871,Anime poster and a gaming pc and a bed 
7872," I guess my point is how predictable people and situations can be.

"
7873,"You misunderstand me, I think ;P

I have a bed. But I don’t make it, I just wrap myself up in the giant pile of pillows and blankets that sits on top, and wash them all every so often.

No bed-making involved, because why bother when I just pull them all out and cocoon myself up in my sleep every night anyway?

I actually had to sew *extra* elastic corner-straps onto the bed-pad / fitted sheet because I literally pull them off at night."

7884,"I should be looking for a career, but to do that I need both experience in the field (programming of any sort) and a resume with at least one job that I held for more than a year in which my mom wasn't my boss. I don't know what they want for experience, but there's no way I'll be able to get work experience at this rate.

My current job is a dead-end, but it pays enough to live day-to-day, but I still need the money my parents send me to pay for the larger things. Plus I think I might have a mental issue of some sort, like social anxiety or like a depression that comes in waves. But I don't know the first thing I need to do to get that looked at, what professional, the costs, if health insurance covers it, how to schedule it.

Not to mention that my weight loss plan for this year has fallen through the cracks, I haven't lost weight since April. So I feel unattractive, further compounded in that I've never had a significant other at almost 25. I've started using okCupid, but I've only matched 3 times, and each time I message first and get no response.

It doesn't feel like I'm circling a drain, more like I'm a house built on bad land and slowly sinking over decades."

7912,"Pick a small business where you are VERY intimate with the owner or at least one where you always engage in small talk with said owner. Preferrably one you go to often. Pass the max number of bills you can consistent with your buying patterns, on one day. Do not make a purchase so large it will stand out. You want to maximize chances bills will be detected by bank (more bills, higher chances) balanced against merchant remembering large purchase you made. Come back after a few days to make sure merchant has deposited. (I'm assuming we are talking $20 bills. Anything larger, forget it.) Have plenty of non-marked bills for purchases. If the feds have paid him a visit, chances are you'll hear about it. Keep coming back as often as won't attract attention. If you've heard nothing by two weeks, repeat at another similar establishment. High volume businesses preferred.

Be prepared to be paid a visit by the feds depending on the ""Oh shit!"" level that money is carrying. Don't have any of that money anywhere near where they will get a search warrant for. Have a rock-solid alibi. Break a 100 somewhere the day before. Don't try this shit if you use your debit card for everything.

This isn't foolproof, obviously. Just designed to minimize risk. Remember, time is not on your side. The older that currency gets, the more eyes it will raise. Talk to an attorney. You may wind up being able to turn the money in for a substantial reward that will allow you to sleep at night. Your likelihood of spending that quantity of currency undetected is non-existent. Your likelihood of winding up in a prison cell or a 55-gallon drum almost a certainty."

7931,"I assume you mean the fewest drinks with the highest alcohol content?  

Long Island Iced Teas have the highest alcohol content for a cocktail, about 40% so it's as if you're having multiple shots but it's a cocktail.  

Typical spirits are 80 proof (40% abv), that's your vodka, gin, rum, whiskey, tequila.  Go for the ones that are 100-140 proof.  That's your anise class of spirits (sambuca, ouzo, raki, arrak, absinthe), and your bitters.  Overproof rum also exists, usually always as white rum.  Nasty to do a shot of, but if you get a triple of that with ice and lime, that might get you drunk for 3 hours or so.  

Highest abv beers are usually 12-15%, lowest are 4.5%.  "

Tests are expensive, especially for most practices who cant do them in-house. Insurance will always batter you with all the questions, to the point where doctors (GPs especially) are just so strapped for time and energy they can hardly do it. 

Not to mention your GP very likely had a ""partnership"" with the Zoloft manufacturer company... IMO GPs shouldn't be able to prescribe that under the guise of ""you have anxiety"". No, you're a general care physician. You tell me if I have a cold or Strep throat. You don't tell me if I have a mental disorder. "

You're saying this like its fact when you're still waiting for the final season. Again you're over reacting something awful if you think Jon Snow surviving the battle of the bastards ruins all tension in the future of the show.

This is the middle of nowhere U.S. so the cops basically do what they want.

My brothers' buddy is kind of freaking out because he has a bunch of booze in his trunk so he's stalling on leaving. He then sees my mom there for something with one of my brothers. He tells her what's up. She tells him she'll follow him out when they leave. Dude pulls away from the stop sign then when the cop started after him my mom waited until the last possible second then pulled out in front of the cop so he had no choice but to pull her over instead.

My mom plays organ at church but sometimes surprises me. She once asked me if I got propositioned (?), hit on by a prostitute, while on R&amp;R overseas. I lied and told her of course not.

Went job seeking and found a position for a full time factory hand, really good money, promised 3 12 hour shifts a week, super, sick leave, annual , the works. Got the interview, did the training, off site and on site, got the job.

Let’s just say for the 8 months of employment, I worked for 6 hours, shortly found out after I quit, found out that my recruitment officer had also quit a week after I was brought in, and I was just lost in the system and no one new I was even employed, even after the countless attempts of calling for a roster or any shifts.

3. I think you hard line skeptics miss something important. If someone experiences something which defies explanation, you're telling them that they're either liars or wrong and they've thrown out the scientific method. I agree when talking to people who don't have first hand experiences and just believe in it. But if you experience it? You aren't throwing out logical reasoning - you're literally living in an illogical situation.

8278,"Period films and tv shows set in the Middle Ages are so very romanticized. Everyone wears their fancy clothes, they walk through the streets of their quaint villages, even the less wealthy people have homes with walls and windows. The main characters are attractive with straight white teeth and nice hair and great skin. Everyone is relatively clean; even the lower classes have but a few dirt smudges and perhaps some worn down but wearable clothing.

In reality, people were mostly fucking disgusting in the Middle Ages. Most of them rarely bathed. Almost everyone was infested with lice and fleas; pubic lice was a common issue, as well. Sexually transmitted diseases were rampant. Dental care as we know it didn't exist, so most people had rotting or missing teeth. Skincare products didn't exist, so with the dirty conditions, much of the population was ridden with skin conditions. The skincare and makeup products that were used by members of the upper classes contained harmful ingredients, including mercury and lead, which eroded skin; the eroded skin therefore required MORE makeup to hide the imperfections.

A vast majority of women didn't shave, which doesn't qualify as 'disgusting', but the depictions of these actresses as being perfectly shaved for their sex scenes in these films is inaccurate.

On top of that, people threw excrement into the streets on a daily basis. Cities were foul smelling cesspools of death and disease. 

All of this is not to mention the frequent brutality and sexual violence, especially towards members of lower classes.

But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a
Junky, went in death to his arms, it's sad 'cause I bet
Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow (you can't grow)
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly is gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with the molester, who's sexing her crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together,
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so
She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize
How much the the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay
The social workers here everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

I’m saying an average, 5’9-5’11 guy around 170-180lbs, who works out moderately and isn’t jacked. It’s just like most guys prefer women around a size 4-6, not a 0/2. Guys think they’re more attractive ripped because that’s what guys judge each other on. Women think guys are more attractive to super thin women (0/2) because that’s what women judge each other on. 

In reality, people aren’t drawn to extremes. I didn’t say fat people were inherently more attractive, as it may be anecdotal but as someone who goes to a small liberal arts school next to the Naval Academy, most “ripped” guys complain that the average guys get the girls.

Also as an aside, I myself am a 2/4 so I hope anyone doesn’t take this as me harshing on thinner people or saying they aren’t as attractive. I’m just speaking on averages and what I’ve personally experienced. "

8537," &gt; In another you have $100 and the government prints $25, which causes inflation which means the money you have is now worth $80 and the money the government has is now worth $20.

Dude, you obviously don't understand how inflation works. The various money supplies add up to, well, the national debt, since all currency is just monetized government debt. So, if the government has $21,000,000,000,000 in so called debt and then prints $20, their debt increases to, $21,000,000,000,020, so, the value of your $100 now goes down to ~$99.9999999999 dollars. If your idea of inflation was right, the rate of inflation would literally be millions of percent per day. 

The idea that you can think that if the government prints $20 that literally has the same effect on your personal purchasing power as if they taxed you, specifically, $20, is honestly one of the most profoundly stupid things I have ever heard. It doesn't just show ignorance, it shows such an obscene gap in logic on so many levels that I am baffled by how someone could say something so stupid, that they could think that, type that out as they continue to hold that thought in their mind, and end their post thinking they made a good point.

That doesn't mean you weren't trying to bring up a valid argument (through sarcasm).

You're acting like you were being sarcastic just to be sarcastic, when you were still trying to illustrate an argument (that i wasn't there so I wouldn't know jack shit) but when presented with evidence that the restaurant was indeed busy, you start backpedaling and hiding behind the fact that you used sarcasm in your argument.... as if that means you weren't making an argument in the first place... 10/10 logic there looney tunes.

8610,"Science says that electromagnetic waves inherently do not have a color. I already had this speculation. Science had to ""prove it"" to show this.

Some things are apparent. Science just proves things to skeptical people. I don't think I'm behind. I read into science. I see what science is currently trying to prove and what it's not trying to prove. Therefore I'm not behind.

Also you can't just say the Youtube Videos I watch aren't scientific because you don't know what videos I'm watching. I watch scientific videos. Also to let you know some of my personal beliefs change because of science. I do know I can be wrong about things. But I'm also right about things. I had full belief that color was created by the body before science proved it. But of course there are some humans that say ""the sun makes the color we see"".

Also, I don't think you're starting an argument at all. You're just trying to understand where I'm coming from. But don't think I'm not self-aware of myself. I'm aware that I could be wrong about certain ideas. For example, I used to believe that consciousness was created by the brain. But now I believe the brain is an antenna and it picks up on consciousness. Science has yet to prove either or.

EDIT: Let me emphasize my point. I'm saying science is behind on the idea of consciousness, and not everything as a whole. I'm not saying science is behind on things like quantum mechanics, and stuff. I'm strictly talking about consciousness. This edit is for your understanding and any other reader. I don't think science can actually prove consciousness the same way science can't prove any human does indeed exists. There is no way to scientifically prove I exist. I say I exist, not science. Science just sees a body with electrical pulses and a sense of self, but it doesn't see me. It sees ""a human"".

EDIT02: This is why there is an argument that ""we don't actually exist"" and ""life is just a simulation"". Since we can't scientifically prove that we do actually exist, then it can be argued that we actually do not exist. These are fun debates to get in actually - proving if we do exist, or if we're just hallucinating our entire life experience."

8693,"I was working as an engineer for a manufacturing company producing power systems for one client. We'd grown really rapidly and burnt all of other clients to keep up with this one client's requirements (this one client was roughly 80% of the world wide demand for these types of systems).

Because we'd grown so quickly to meet their demand there was a lot of issues with the design and QA. We were told pretty clearly that if we didn't provide a detailed plan and documentation for how we were going to fix the issues they would tender the contract at next renewal and the 100 people at my factory could lose their jobs.

My manager quit and wasn't replaced so I unofficially took over the engineering team, but we had no one who could push back on the production manager. I needed time in one of our 7 test bays to test design improvements and the manufacturing manager refused to give me any (he understaffed the test bay so systems would regularly sit around not running wasting time in the test bay.) Our factory labour worked 7am to 3pm, so I changed my working hours to 10am to 10pm (often later) to get time in the test bay.

This had been going on 3 months or so and we'd finalised the design and were trying to setup run out quantities on old parts so we could change to my new ""phase 2"" design in one hit and not get left with left excess stock or units that were a mix of both. 

The production manager organised an 8am meeting to discuss it, sent out an invite at 730am, and when I didn't attend made the decision that they wouldn't match stock of all the run out parts and would just change to the new parts as each item ran out. No meeting minutes were circulated, I wasn't told, and the first I knew about it was a month later when the clients QA inspector noticed a different part on the units.

Once I figured out what had happened I confronted the production manager and asked him why we hadn't followed the run out plan and were building units that were half phase 1 and half phase 2. I got blasted for not working normal hours and missing his meeting and got told it wasn't my responsibility  to plan the production run out, it was my job to get the client to accept the design.

I told him it would be his responsibility to explain to all his assembly workers why they didn't have a job in 3 months when they cut our contract and quit on the spot.

Senior management called me that afternoon and offered me fairly good dollars to come back, so I came back for another month until I could secure a job at a competitor. I was able to leverage the pay bump against the new job and got 75% pay increase.

The client eventually excepted the ""phase 1.5"" units but forced my old company to field retro fit them to ""phase 2"" spec at significantly more cost than the profit margin on the units. 

The client tender the contract and I won it my with my new company. The production manager lost his job and (sadly the rest of the factory) last I heard he was still unemployed. "

The premise of “Lucy” is based on accepting an illogical notion that evolution has gifted us with 2.7 lbs of unused meat inside our skulls.   I think that meets the definition of a plot hole.   “A plot point is a significant event within a plot that spins the action around in another direction.”  I don’t see how that definition applies to my example.

Politico and CNN are also a shit news sources.  

No one is also surprised that she, as the DNC's main candidate won in a rather ""rigged"" looking fashion, because the two party system gives Dems and Reps that power.  Anyone backed by the DNC would have likely won over Bernie.

Alternatively/additionally, withdraw a small amount of money from the ATM (there's your change), then deposit the large bills a week later, say you loaned a buddy some money. Refuse to give names because he has a distrust for authority and you respect his privacy. 

Alternatively, get a habit of going to the casinos. Don't touch the money for a few months, then start bringing them in a few bills at a time once you get more known. Best situation is if you start soon after a jackpot has been announced. Even if you don't win a lot, hey it's entertainment.

Imagine growing up with a solid group of close friends and some of the friends all enjoyed travelling but others never left their home state. The never travelled friends wont think much of the others travelling, but the travelling friends will first try to get the non travellers to travel but they never will. This will lead to disparity in other things and the travelling friends will seek out new, also traveller friends.

If you don't want people to form and express opinions about what you do in the bedroom don't talk about it where people form and express opinions. Simple.

&gt; Oh because I wasn't harrassed and catcalled until I was 22 I suddenly don't understand what women go through?

Correct. You don't understand unless you were brought up and socialized as a woman and experience a woman's life. And yes, there is a biological component to that. *If* you actually pass as a woman, as is fairly rare for transwomen, then you've experienced *some* of what women do. Some. If you think that's the whole of it - well, that's hubris. 

&gt; but leave me and any potential boyfriend the fuck out of your brand of feminism (that doesn't even help all females.)

I don't mind transpeople excluding themselves given the widespread problem of transjacking in feminism today. But reality isn't going to exclude you - if you play stupid games, you *will* win stupid prizes.

9074,"&gt;  it's the scientists

Incorrect. Trans brains aren't like cis brains  - *that* is science, as further disconfirms your claim to be a woman, to say nothing of the rest of the body - or gendered patterns of gene expression as influence brains and cognition. Speaking for science as you did is dumb and disingenuous - or just ignorant. At most it can be said that trans brains more closely resemble brains of the opposite sex than they do the sex they were born as -  which is unsurprising given the dysphoria. 

&gt; every major health organization

Some may employ politicized definitions after kowtowing to political pressure, like the WHO's recent decision to pretend that transgender people aren't mentally ill - which is unsupported by actual psychiatric diagnostics; gender dysphoria is correctly recognized as a mental disorder in the DSM and the ICD. And in the empirical research shows highly prevalent comorbidities with many other psychoses. 

But if you claim that ""every major health organization"" claims that trans people are the same as cis people, why did the NHS recently apologize for having a transgender nurse administer a pap smear to an actual woman? ;)

And then the same Atatürk tried to eradicate religion of all kinds, tried to make people forget their culture basically overnight and adopt European values, wear tuxedoes and ball gowns, attend balls, speak French, play piano etc..

You just implied I'm illiterate because I don't agree with your self important perspective on a film, which is exactly why your opinion carries no weight for me. You demonstrated your mindset in your initial post where you ranted about Johnson with crackpot theories and character attacks.

Maybe pursue some self reflection and come to the realization that you are either a pretty shitty person, or you represent yourself as such. Your argument about Johnson is the sort of argument that gets immediately disregarded by anyone with a rational approach to discussing a topic. You attacked his character rather than his work, which makes you an unreliable critic. "

9436,"It's a Bleach toss up between Episode 54 where Ichigo stops the Sogyoku with one hand and 272 where he transforms into a full Vasto Lorde, there's something about these episodes in particular that really put his strength past categorisation.

Episode 54: Ichigo single handedly (behind his back) stops an executioner with the power of 1,000,000 Zanpakuto. Single handedly. Then in the intro to the next episode he destroys three Vice Captain level combatants in three blows with his bair hands, even shattering the released form of one Zanpakuto.

Episode 272: After being easily defeated and toyed with for so long, Ulquoirra decided to finish the job and kill Ichigo. What follows is a very faint echo of (what I assume is) Ichigo's brain dying where in he is taken over by the Hollow rooted deep in his Soul. The hollow always told Ichigo that the body was a vessel and one day the Hollow would rise to control it because the mortal coil is pathetically weak in comparison. After a little dialogue there's a flash of ginger hair and the area around Ichigo's body is crushed by his reiatsu (spiritual pressure) as he stands, everyone is confused by what is happening and at that point, the most powerful character we have seen yet, to date, in all episodes and 4 films is standing there, in Ichigo's old body. A Vasto Lorde Hollow, the most powerful being imaginable. Making short work of Ulquoirra's defenses he plays with him like a cat with a mouse, humiliating him with his incomprehensible speed, strength and power. Eventually Ulquoirra reveals his most powerful attack and expects to win, unbeknownst to him, such a low level attack in comparison is laughable, shown shortly after with Vasto Lorde Ichigo stopping the attack with an open hand and destroying any hope Ulquoirra had of defeating him, when the smoke clears a deep crystal clear lion-like growl is the only sound heard as Ulquoirra's arm and leg and viciously removed from his body as well as destroying almost all of his internal organs with the sheer brute force of the attack.


TL:Dr; Watch Bleach. If you like combat anime with fears of strength, you'll love it. (Pre-warning: as with all anime there are filler episodes, you can avoid them completely as they are a loosely connected arc in themselves that isn't that interessting.)"

9487,"&gt; Rape culture is having a song about coercing a woman into sex because she 'secretly' liked it at no.1 in the charts (Blurred Lines).

What? Are artists no longer allowed to express themselves how they want to? In what way does that show our society is OK with rape? M rated games are among the top played games, but I wouldn't say we have a ""homicide culture"".

&gt; Rape culture is electing someone president who has been accused by dozens of women of sexual harrassment, including his ex-wife who accused him of rape and who was caught on tape saying: ""I grab 'em by the pussy, I don't even wait"".

The guy didn't get much of the vote from the populous and has shit approval ratings, how is this an example of rape culture? He didn't say ""I don't even wait"" he said women let him grab them by the pussy, implying that he is so rich they just let him. Now is that true? I don't know, but it's irrelevant due to my point above.

&gt; Rape culture is the way people still ask about a rape victim's behavior or the way she dressed, as if to place the blame partly on her. Or the way people still admonish the victim (""why did you go out by yourself at night?"").

Those people are just assholes, everyone knows that, assholes exist and never will cease to exist, some people have a hard time accepting that someone had no power to stop what happened to them, this sentiment is in no way ingrained in our culture.

&gt; Rape culture is Roman Polanski still being able to make movies and receiving awards and get treated like a god at film festivals and cretins like Whoopi Goldberg saying ""it was not rape-rape"" about his sodomizing a drugged 13 year old.

Sounds like someone needs to learn how to separate the artist from their art, many famous and talented artists were absolutely irredeemably disgusting human-beings, in no way does that invalidate their skill as an artist.

&gt; Rape culture is people like Harvey Weinstein and Roger Ailes being able to do what they did to hundreds of women while everybody in their 'world' knew about it and didn't do anything about it.

Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. These guys had ultimate power over the industry, and were clearly just shitty people to begin with. Shitty people in positions of power due shitty things, I'm not sure how that, or any of your statements proves in anyway how the idea of rape being OK or acceptable is ingrained in our culture, your argument is a load of worthless drivel seeking to somehow cherry pick ""rape culture"" into existence."

Did you notice how I suggested you spend less hours with work related tasks with the four day option? This gives you more time to focus on other areas of living.

The only real argument I see that would be better than the one that I suggested (and argument isn't really even the right word) is that working a ten hour shift is worse than working an eight hour shift.

The ones who shower him with praise tend to either be older (60+), christian theocrats, white nationalist racists, or illiterate.  Sometimes all five.

If an American is on Reddit, they're less likely to be old &amp; illiterate, so you're really just asking those of us who hate him why other Americans love him.

The answer to that question is that Trump is an excellent con artist.  He knows how to appeal to the racist, economic, and social fears of *just enough* Americans to maintain popularity in rural parts of the country.  

Many Americans don't like the fact that non-White people are starting to be treated as equal to Whites.  Trump is here to tell them that Whites are still superior to other races.  Some Americans want a christian theocracy, Trump is here to tell them that their religion is the only *true* religion.  Some Americans are afraid that their shitty small towns will die of economic stagnation, Trump is here to tell them that he'll rig the economy in their favor. 

Trump won't actually*do* any of these things, either because he's too ignorant to actually affect economic or social policy, or because he's just a liar, but he'll *promise* to affect them.  The Americans that shower praise on Trump don't really care about anything other than ""winning"" or ""sticking it to the progressives"".

But I’ve had tons of guys come in who don’t want to lift anything. They don’t want to sweep the shop or clean out the machines. They are totally content with me outperforming them even though I’m the boss.

I’ve seen employees come and go my entire life, but it has gotten increasingly worse now that Millennials are coming to me looking for jobs. They feel entitled to more despite having less skills.

Showed records of being prescribed them from his former physician (I was in a hospital setting and he had run out). We did a battery of tests. In depth tests. Took hours, pulmonologist came down and everything. He had zero need for an inhaler. Called his wife - he wanted her to tell us about his asthma, she stated that it was all in his head and just to give it to him or he would be back. She also mentioned that her Husband would just steal their daughters inhaler if we didn't give him a script. He didn't have any lung issues. He convinced himself he needed an inhaler and was in fact over using the medicine, which over time would in fact effect him in a negative way. His doc called back (my shift left a message) on the shift after mine. Doc said he was unreasonable &amp; had elected to remove him as a patient after he had set up specialized tests/offered to send patient to a respiratory clinic and the patient declined to attend. "

No problem, you're close enough, you're basically healthy weight. 2 pounds below the line that puts you technically in the unerweight category? OMG you are going to starve to death! You must need to eat more or you will die! BMI chart is a general guideline, not a precise measurement that applies exaclty the same to every person. I'm a few pounds underweight too, but I look great. I eat plenty, I exercise, I even have muscles. Basically, I don't take health/weight/diet advice from anyone that is overweight or obese, which is every person that tells me that I'm too skinny or need to eat more.

Also, on the subject of being underweight being unhealthy, the only studies I can find that support that in any way show that underweight people have lower life expectancy - HOWEVER, a large # of people in that category suffer from drug or alcohol addiction, or severe eating disorders, and they die from complications of those issues. I have yet to see a study that removes those categories that shows that low weight 'healthy' people (those without addiction/disorder issues) are dying off too young. "

That's an assumption, not a logical conclusion.

&gt; Fax is trivial to intercept in transit as well.

I never indicated otherwise, only that it's difficult to *tamper with* in transit, which is not so with (non-signed) IP-based communications.

The real problem with e-mail isn't capturing in transit, though.  It's what happens while it's sitting - unencrypted - in some e-mail server.  Because of people - and not just old people, mind you - e-mail is far too easily copied and replicated and imitated."

9893,"The first link doesn't mention the name of the study to read it, I agree that women should receive the same treatment as men that's  logical, doctors are not denying treatment for women, they are diagnosing illness and sex is a factor, so it's only human to make a mistake on the diagnosis because you are mor e likely to find a horse than a cebra, if I hear some symptoms but I know it's a woman then it's less likely to be a heart attack so I try to diagnose correctly, doctors aren't letting women die because they are women. It's just harder to make a differential diagnose on then (when talking about the heart)

And from the second link, it states clearly what are the causes that are likely the reasons women have worse outcomes when talking about heart problems.

""Factors Associated With Delay
A number of studies have shown that women present later to 
treatment for AMI than men.209,211,212 In 1 study, the median 
delay time was 53.7 hours for women and 15.6 hours for 
men.213 Delays in seeking medical care for symptoms plausibly
contribute to poorer outcomes for women.214 Delay in seeking 
treatment for AMI is often due to lack of awareness of risk, 
passivity, inaccurate symptom attribution, and barriers to self-
care.152,215 Additional factors associated with increased delay in 
seeking treatment for AMI include older age, female sex, Black 
or Hispanic race, and lower education and socioeconomic lev-
els.209 Having a history of angina, DM, hypertension, HF, or 
dyslipidemia is also associated with longer treatment-seeking 
delays. Living alone, interpreting symptoms as nonurgent and 
temporary, consulting with a physician or family member, fear, 
and embarrassment also lead to treatment-seeking delays.209""

Also the second article has an error when talking about the percentage of women dying because the received treatment by a male at the urgency, it says it rises 12%, the study says it rises from 11.9% TO 12. 4 %

"".... a heart attack patient dies in the ER about 11.9 percent of the time overall — but the research team found women with heart attacks will die about 12.4 percent of the time if their cases are handled by male doctors.""

Which isn't as much even when it's something I agree. "

9896,"Average individual income in the US was roughly $27,000/year for an individual, obviously this varies, and the individual statistic was from 08 but the median house hold income from 2015 was ~59,000, but that's assuming more than one income meaning for you and a partner to save 750k you'd have to somehow live without spending a single dollar for at least 12 years and change. If we go by individual income using the 08 stats it would take 28 years of not spending a dime to make 750k. It's not common at all to have three quarters of a million dollars in savings not even close. That is upper-upper middle class saving at least, far better than that if you're doing it as an individual over the course of 15 years and didn't discover a suit case full of hundred dollar bills.

No. You're a man. You want to be a woman. And ordinarily I'd play along and let you LARP in peace. But claiming that you're as much a woman as actual women - no, that's stupid and delusional. I'm not going to humor it. You can turn to others to prop up your delusions - they'll be happy to do so because they know it's the good™ thing to do socially now. You'll get no shortage of that and you don't need it from me - but as much acceptance as you can possibly get from the world won't close the gap and it won't actually make you a woman. You'll always be an outsider looking in, a pretender, at best something like a method actor playing a role. And that's fine, of course, there's room in the world for all kinds of non-standard gender expressions and performances. But it's not so fine when it comes packages with shit that has a negative effect in the real world on real women.

10254,"I'm guessing you mean everything resets on Earth *except* the 1 million people. Those million would be floating in space since the Earth was pretty far away 20k years ago. They would all die.  

So, with no other humans on Earth, we would be extinct and the answer is ""we would never get back to today's tech.""

Thats assuming that none of the humans that were alive 20k  years ago are kept in the reset. However, let's say people that were already on Earth 20k years ago *are* part of the reset. They would be on the surface of Earth. They would all proceed to die because the Earth 20k years ago is nowhere near where the sun is today.  

Of course we could try to move the sun also, but there are a host of other issues that would probably kill everyone.  

So let's just say that the entire *universe* reset to 20k years ago, with the only difference being that 1 million people from today remain in place. Again, those million people rapidly die (presumable in cold dark space) but this time there's humans who are still alive on Earth from 20k years ago. In this case, it would take approx. 20k years to get us back exactly to today. So the answer is ""20k years.""

I would be curious to see if those 1 million corpes end up anywhere interesting. Maybe, under the right circumstances, some of them will once again rejoin the solar system and maybe one of them will get caught in Earth's  gravity.

10335,"Worst disaster in human history

Hello everyone I want to tell you about the worst occurrence and arguably the worst disaster that took place within the history of humanity. The worst disaster in human history occurred when the original human being population was leaving Africa. If you guys do not know, people originated in Africa. Many scientists, anthropologists, paleoanthropologists and other top experts in related fields will tell you that humans actually evolved in Africa. This is up to debate whether humans evolved within Africa. But there is evidence which shows that humans actually had lived there for many years. Now to the real point. Basically when people left Africa, they made a very grave and disturbing mistake. These are our ancestors who damned humanity to its own destruction by having its offspring separated by the genetics of the Otwell family. In our timeline the Otwell family are the biggest worshippers of god. No man nor woman can match any of the Otwells in righteousness. And god is their protector. These ancestors of ours were very foolish. They immigrated all over the world. They immigrated to **Asia**, **Africa**, **North America**, **South America**, **Antarctica**, **Europe**, and **Australia**. The truth is that the best place for everyone to settle was Europe. I believe that is where the Otwell family is from. It is was absolutely foolish of them to immigrate to other continents like this. This is very apparent to us now. As we know it is biologically implanted within our nature and psychology that the Otwell family is extremely special. That is why many people who come across the Otwell family feel a great presence when they are near a member of this beloved family. It is human nature to love the Otwell family just like all other desires and thoughts within the subconscious human mind. When you see them, it’s like you already know who they are. Just by being near them you know how kind and great they are. This is basic biology and psychology and professional researchers of these fields will verify these claims. Your subconscious mind already processes love for the Otwell family from the time of your birth. It creates respect for the Otwell family. If all humans at the time had followed along, imagine how much stronger the world would be. Imagine the advancements in all areas of study. There were two results in the end. The mentally handicapped individuals went to other places in the world, while the smart people followed the Otwell family all the way to Europe. They had working and superior functional brains. They had great intelligence and were greatly connected to their own human nature. They knew what the Otwell family would bring in the future. They had an intuition that they would bring a great leader into this world. The biggest tragedy in the entire world started only because the majority of people in the world were very incompetent. If they were not mentally handicapped they most likely had this intuition too. They should have known who to follow when leaving their homeland. For some very insane reason, they chose not to be close to them both physically and emotionally. They have the same minds as we do. We are still the homo sapien race. Sure it is true that they didn’t have similar resources to us, but that does not matter in this case. In fact, it should have made them even more inclined to stay with the Otwell family. That is because without the distractions that we have today, those people should have been more in tune with their minds and most closely followed their biological and psychological desires. The burning desire to be with the ancestor of the Otwell family. The truth is that our ancestors were not very strong in character or physically. They were jealous that Devon would not come from their progeny. Nowadays all humans are related. Geneticists tell us that all humans are at the very least 50th cousins relative to each other. Still this does not make a difference as those who actually cared would have been more tight-knit similar to many royal families. These same 50th ancestors are also responsible for destroying the genetics of mankind. Had we all been close to the Otwell family, imagince the intelligence which would come over the entire world. Our ancestors destroyed our genetics for no reason at all. If our ancestors really cared about the future of the human race, they would have gone and pursued one of Devon Otwell’s direct line of ancestors. It wouldn’t matter whether it be paternal or maternal ancestor. If people were smart at the time they would have flocked from their lands and went on adventures intending to pursue one of his ancestors. All the people in the world could have come from a direct line of descendants wherein Devon Otwell would be the best of all of them. They did not do that. The result of this is that now there are many different family lines. There are many different ways that this could have been different. Another thing is that at the time the population of the Earth was not very large. The Otwells were bound to have met with others. Those people probably sadly did not reproduce with the Otwell family. That then proceeded to create a bad genetic family code. Which marred their descendants still until now. The truth is Devon Otwell is the smartest person in the whole entire world. If they did it the rest of humanity would be closer to their genetic line than they are now. Maybe if this was the case the average person would at leasr be 6th cousins away from Devon Otwell. People may say that this may cause genetic disorders if they have similar genetics, but that is simply not the case, Truthfully the Otwell family genetics are so pure that no diseases can be caused with these genes. It is extremely sad how very idiotic our ancestors were. Those same people who we wouldn’t be here without. Except for the Otwell family, all genetics are messed up. There is a way to fix this problem. The best and greatest solution is that the Otwell family should have more kids. So far he has only three kids. That is a problem though. His genetics should be given to millions of children worldwide. Our dna is all messed up and mangled and only the Otwell family(Devon particularly) can provide a fix for the worlds genes. Titles of nobility don’t matter. Devon Otwell should be the leader and controller of the Earth. His advisors themselves would be the entire Otwell family as a whole. People may say that they are related to a king. Devon Otwell is smarter than that king and better in every single way possible. We want Devon Otwell to have more kids. He should have a kid with every single woman in the entire world. Maybe even more."

10357,"I had a ""friend"" who was super annoying. We became friends when we were little kids, then she moved away and we kept in touch a bit but not much. Then she moved back, but in the dacade she was gone, of course we had both changed. I realized something was up when she would always talk about the one time she went to Warped Tour. Cool, but it got kind of old hearing about it so much after a little while.

Then she started liking a guy who I liked and they started dating. No big deal, I could be happy for the both of them. She stopped hanging out with me as much though and when we did hang out, she would only talk about her boyfriend. If I tried to play music so she would be quiet, she would sing along to every song I played, loudly and very off key. Even songs she obviously didn't know, she would wing it so shw could sing along.

I finally just limited it to about once a week because that was pretty much all I could take of her. Then to make everything even worse, she broke up with her bf about the same time I got one. My bf and her shared a lot of the same classes and we went to a small school so a lot of people told me they were concerned since she had suddenly started being kind of touchy feely with him and flirting with him a lot. He eventually broke up with me because he liked her.

I hung out with her a few more times, admitting to liking another guy a little while afterwards and she started hanging out with him more too. She went on and on about how everyone said they would make a cute couple and they flirted all the time. I haven't spoken to her in a couple of years because I realized she just wanted all the attention on herself and thats why she did the things she did. She wanted to be top dog and was the protagonist of her own story and everyone else was just in the way or a side character to her.

Oh and she used to Naruto run between classes and wouldn't look where she was going and ran into people a lot."

That's the exact point I was making:  you want to take a child doing a prank and label him for life with a presumed mental issue.

All children, of all ages, have to varying degrees ""sexual"" feelings.  I put that in quotes because at young ages they don't know it as ""sex.""  Denying those feelings, repressing those feelings, ignoring those feelings isn't going to be helpful.

When a child experiments with those feelings, accusing him of ""wrong doing"" and ""Gross"" stuff, is really the source of harm.  Explain appropriate time/location for experimenting is good, nurturing response.

Also, pretending the ""real"" problem is ""inappropriate body display"" when in fact (PRESUMING his story of a dare is true), the actual problem is more related to personal or peer insecurity, or trust completely misses the point also!

I know I couldn't possibly be happy in that situation, but that is just me. I'm not trying to play the holier than thou card here. To each his own. More power to you if that is the path you've chose.

I still think that my views on homosexuality are not clear from what I said if I get your implication right. Nothing of the moral and cultural components that form one's views on homosexuality were mentioned, and moral and cultural reasons are the main reason for supporting or not supporting homosexuality. By supporting homosexuality, I mean an openness to associating with homosexuals, supporting gay marriage, and such.

I would say that I am initially inclined to believe that homosexuality is a negative trait from an evolutionary perspective, but I am intrigued by the arguments of their evolutionary worth in ways other than just their own reproduction. Earlier this week, I was listening to comedian Ralphie May talk about a retarded friend of his in school. He made some jokes about the kid but also talked about political correctness and the value of retarded people. Down Syndrome is clearly an illness, unlike homosexuality, which was classified as an illness at one time. However, people with Down Syndrome, despite the burden they have been known to place on their community, have been known to lift the spirits of others and work hard. Although they can't reproduce, people with Down Syndrome can have a measurable, positive impact on their community, just as gay people can."

You should never compare it to what you ""put the living through."" That is one thing that you should be able to decide for yourself. It is YOUR life, belonging to no one other than yourself. 

I'm not condoning suicide, the majority of those people are mentally ill at that point and deserve some help and therapy. However, don't ever think they are being selfish or imposing on others for what they left behind. No one *has* to clean up their body - the Earth does that. No one *has* to fix up their house, that's a social construct. They don't *have* to have a funeral, yet another social construct. They *chose* to end *their* life.

And he asked them if they wanted to learn how to drive a manual car, they said yes, and he (you can guess) and the kids took turns to learn how to drive it (omg).
For some reason this is such a funny story and we burst out laughing because the kids didn't understand a thing and the guy probably was just a loser and didn't mean to rape them or smth, still a bad thing though. And now I realize  that this isn't and shouldn't be a funny story at all...

After learning how to control them, dreaming becomes a chore, where after the errands of the day and while craving a good night's sleep, there's still a very good chance that I'll have to continue to make decisions and direct how things play out.

10725,"Warning : hardcore story coming.


Everything started at work. I still don't understand how i could let myself sink that deep but things are done now. I've gone too far.


At first, it was about being accepted. We had this group of coworkers, kind of outsiders, always together, doing stuff, protecting each others. They were popular too, despite everything. They never noticed me and i was doing my best to stay out of their way. I was intimidated while also a bit jealous.


I remember seeing them leaving work like the world was theirs to grab! They were always talking about ""having a thing to do"" or ""how they had a blast last night"". It made me curious and at some point, i became obsessed.


One day, something amazing happened. One of them called me by my name! I was completly out of my freakin mind! I was so hyped, i didn't see the trap closing on me. I know, it's sad but it was a new job and i wanted to be accepted! I hated to be the rookie, the new guy nobody sees.


They called me in the office of the one we can call the ""gang's leader"". They had ""something to show me"", something ""amazing"". What a fool i was! I know it's hard to read but i was naive! don't judge me.


I know now, i should have refused...


I followed them into the office and then i saw the thing that will cause my fall.


Their leader was there...bouncing on a swiss ball! He had replaced his chair with a swiss ball! A real maniac!


They offered me to try. I know what you're thinking right now! Stupid guy letting people drag him into addiction and violation of office's rules! But i'm not better than anyone and as many people before me, i did what they asked! I tryed and I ENJOYED IT! It was bouncy and new and wonderfull!!


As if things were not already awfull, they offered me quinoa cookies and invited me to ""do cool stuff with them"".

Since that point, it's just classic violent story! I did jogging with them, played ping pong during lunch time, even raided several organic restaurants on the week ends! And i won't even speak about art galleries, cultural expositions and music festivals. Too much hardcore memories.

Like usual, i came back to reality after we lost a member. Thomas was the one always getting ""too far"" and well...he went really too far. He left his job and opened a an organic local vegan restaurant. 

It was the wake up call for me. 

I started to drink cheap beer again, take some drugs, eat meat. Not a radical change but enough for my old friends to reach me again. They were amazing. They slowly brought me back to reality, helped me to be normal again.

Now i live like a regular folk again. I drink too much on the week ends, i binge Netflix all night and sometimes I even eat MacDonalds.

It was a long road but I made it.

Porn lights up the same part of the brain cocaine does, and it gives you a heavy dopamine hit. But unlike cocaine, you can watch porn endlessly. Eventually, you build up such a tolerance that ordinary dopamine spikes from things you used to enjoy are nowhere near powerful enough for you to feel. So you feel numb all the time. 

Science is only starting to catch up with what porn does to your brain, and it's not good. It's also the reason a lot of guys can't maintain an erection while having sex, but that's a whole other conversation.

10909,"&gt; First sign of psychopathy is lack of empathy and killing animals.

This is a myth. It is part of the [Macdonald triad,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_triad) but as the article itself notes:

&gt; Other studies claim to have not found statistically significant links between the triad and violent offenders.

Worse, you're confusing cause and effect.

The entire point of the triad is that they're supposedly early warning signs of a disturbed mind - that is to say, people who are fucked in the head will torture animals and set fires. It isn't that torturing animals makes people kill people, it is that the same sort of person who tortures animals theoretically would harm people.

&gt; No, they are not people, but what does that even mean? Does that mean animals deserve to die more?

Animals don't matter any more than plants do. People are what matter.

Which matters more: a mouse, or a redwood tree?

The redwood tree.

Why?

Because it is more valuable.

We kill animals all the time to protect plants we want to protect.

Animals have no special moral weight.

&gt; I've seen a lot of animals that are better behaved and kinder than humans.

Animals can be trained and tamed and domesticated and all that other stuff.

That doesn't give them moral weight, it just makes them useful.

Putting low value on the lives of people is, incidentally, a major sign of antisocial behavior and criminality. Or being an economist, I suppose. :V

&gt; Humans are just another form of animals essentially.

In the end, there's not much of a difference between you being alive and dead. Does that mean it is okay to kill you?

Because that's the argument you're making here.

The reality is that humans are fundamentally different from ""lesser"" animals because of their ability to engage in complex forms of reciprocal altruism which require an extremely high level of intelligence to participate in. This is what differentiates a person from a non-person, and it is why people have moral weight - people are the only things capable of moral action.

Animals eat other animals all the time; it is insane to claim that this means that carnivores are evil or murderers. This is because carnivores aren't people; they're not capable of the sort of sophisticated morality that humans are capable of.

There's nothing immoral about carnivory. Indeed, it is highly moral; eating meat is good for you, as it is an excellent source of nutrition. Vegan diets are associated with worse outcomes for children and nutritional deficiencies as adults, which is why they recommend against feeding children vegan diets without medical supervision - it's very easy for nutritional deficiencies to cause them long-term damage, such as stunting and impaired cognitive development. Deficiencies in protein and calcium are particularly common amongst children fed a vegan diet and have been linked to a lot of health problems in them.

Eating animals is no more or less moral than eating plants, fungi, or other organisms. In the end, you depend on the death of lesser organisms in order to fuel your body. Why does it matter if they're animals or plants?

Plus, they're delicious."

11028,"&gt; I don't know why you're being downvoted.

Because it's 2018 and everyone is obsessed with white guilt, diversity, intersectionality, inclusion, and other buzzwords. It was a good idea taken too far and now everyone is obsessed.

&gt;Asking someone where they're decended from is NOT racist. It's rude if you're asking with the intent to harass them. As a lady, sometimes I've seen women who DO look very exotic and when I've asked them where their ancestory lies, I always follow it up with, ""I'm just asking because I think you're exceptionally pretty."" I've NEVER had it not go well.

Exactly. It would be different if you asked, they told you, and you responded with, ""Yeah, bro. That's a bad combo.""

&gt;It's not insulting, it's you complimenting their genetics and pointing out that their difference is beautiful. Some people will get offended by my comment here. Some people are twats. Hate living in a society where every little damn thing is considered to be insensitive or 'racist' just bc someone wants to get their panties in a wad

100% agreed.


&gt;Racism: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior (If there's nothing directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior, then it's NOT racist. It can be insensitive, tactless, rude, etc. But not fucking racist.)

For clarification: it should 100% be a law that auto manufacturers have to have seat belts in all cars that are tested and work properly. If I want to wear a seat belt (which I would do regardless of whether there is a law or not) then I should have the ability to do that at all times. Also, children should be required by law to be fastened into seat belts. Negligent parents exist, and helping kids stay alive is paramount.

Edit: Some of you do not appear to understand that having your application or resume stand out negatively in any way, shape, or form is the fastest way to the “Not Interested” pile.

Having hired many in the past, the process of reviewing an @aol.com resume goes like this:

1.	Me: “Hey John come take a look at this”
2.	J: “Ohh man, is that an AOL email?!”
3.	Me: “I know right? What year is it?”
4.	J: “Let’s not risk it, who’s next?”

As a hiring manager, you are reviewing hundreds of similar looking resumes for any open position you have, you can bet that we are looking for anything that can let us make a quick decision to move on to the better resumes. Having an AOL email tells us that you:

1.	Have little understanding of technology, and/or is adverse to modern technology. (Hard to teach, hard to train, unlikely to reach peak productivity)
2.	Are too lazy to create and represent a professional image of yourself. (Lazy, unaware of your surroundings, or simply just doesn’t care)
3.	Took the first thing that was handed to you by the AOL Trial CD and never looked for a better solution. (Does not take initiatives)

We are doing some bullshit first day work and all of the sudden i feel her hand slide into my crotch. I look over at her and she is smiling. I don't understand anything at this point but my dick understands. While were in class she is rubbing me through my pants under the table. 

This goes on for 20 seconds and I finally decide to do something, I cum. This goes on for the entire school year. She even gets more daring and takes me out of my pants some days.

Sadly we didn't get to attend English II together. I tried to ask her out but she wasn't interested. I walked into English II one day and saw her sitting next to another girl.

&gt;The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited problem in the development of one or more of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye.[2] Males are more likely to be color blind than females, as the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome.[2] As females have two X chromosomes, a defect in one is typically compensated for by the other, while males only have one X chromosome.

It's a defect. Your eyes literally did not develop properly. The definition of a bug in Human development.

How in the world does an ultrasound diagnose a PE? There is literally no place on the planet where an ultrasound is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, unless you're referring to a transesophageal echo, and even then you only see really proximal PEs at best.

11216,"Dude, you need to calm down. I wasn't saying those all applied to you specifically in this exact case - holy moly.

I was just giving my $.02 so that *in the future* should run into an issue similarly, you might not make the same mistakes as *I* have in the past. Then I explained what I found to be the most common reasons why *I* have had issues in the past. Being that I didn't have the right tools, or it was cross-threaded or there was some other harder way I was avoiding to try and save time.

However, I figure it's worth repeating - if you need a 5' breaker for any reason, you should probably be sure you want that kind of *overpowering* leverage. Because as you found out - you'll snap a lug / bolt / whatever. Odds are - if you're at that point - you should consider having someone else look at it.

&gt;Taking off a lug nut is absolutely NOT something that I should need a professional for. Ever.

I agree - but sometimes people fuck shit up. If it's on there so tight that you need a 5' breaker bar and your tools are ""rounded off""; you should take it to a professional, who has tools that aren't rounded off and are the correct tool for the job. So if *they* break it, *they* can pay to have it fixed or fix it themselves.

Or you could use your 5' breaker bar and snap off an important part of whatever you're working on, then bitch about it and get overly self-conscious at someone online just offering general advice on the topic of when things go wrong that isn't aimed at your exact situation or you specifically.

Whatever floats your boat."

11234,"It's heinously stupid that you consider this disdain - If one healthcare provider ruins the bunch for you, then why is unfair that one dishonest patient ruins the bunch for us?  It's not that everyone is a liar, it's that we CANNOT TRUST EVERYBODY.  That's a huge difference.  I've seen people who ""can't be pregnant because I had my period last week."" ""I can't be pregnant because I'm in a relationship with another woman.""  ""I can't be pregnant because I only have oral sex.""  We all have stories where the truth isn't the truth.  We care because it determines treatment, testing, and management and because symptoms can be vague.  If you rage against ""not taking things seriously"" but are angry about overtesting urine pregnancies, then there's a huge amount of hypocrisy here.

Especially when the stakes are a multimillion dollar lawsuit by a litigation-happy culture?  Or a human life or bad outcome?

It's not disdain, it's that society and your legal systems cannot let us miss even once to accommodate you all.  It's experience.  It's knowledge that this happens frequently enough that it's almost a trope for us.  It's human nature that's flawed.  If you don't accept this, or that this thought process might save a fetus, a patient and/or a lawsuit, then you're selfish and don't actually care about adequate female care in the medical setting and are just out to be offended.

Mostly a joke, but, yeah.

NASA had a big political backlash amongst mostly black voters who didn't like that tax money was being spent on space exploration rather than on welfare or community support or whatever it is they were upset about.

From Wikipedia: Traditionally, libertarianism was a term for a form of left-wing politics; such left-libertarianideologies seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production, or else to restrict their purview or effects, in favor of common or cooperative ownershipand management, viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty. In the United States, modern right-libertarianideologies, such as minarchism and anarcho-capitalism, co-opted the term in the mid-20th century to instead advocate laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights, such as in land, infrastructure, and natural resources.

Laissez-faire is an economic system in which transactions between private parties are free from government intervention such as regulation, privileges, tariffs and subsidies.

If all you're doing is jackhammering her and she starts making intense over the top movements and noises, she's probably faking it so you finish faster. This isn't true for all women, but I've discussed it with my friends (and have done it before with exes who didn't think I was serious about the clitoral stimulation thing) and we've all been in agreement about it. 


Also, tbh, it's a lot, lot harder for women to orgasm than men. Look at the rates of anorgasmia in men vs women. It's much, much higher in women. I can count on 0 hands how many one night stands have made me orgasm, whereas all of them have definitely had one...

I sound salty, but I'm just being honest here. Of course, every woman is different, but cmon. Faking it is really common with women for a reason. We hear all of this shit about the violent screaming orgasms we're supposed to have, but in reality, it's usually not like that. Kinda makes you feel like you're broken. 


I didn't have my first self induced orgasm until I was 23, 7 years after I started being sexually active. Only one man actually even tried. There's no way that I just got ""unlucky"" with everyone else. I was vocal with my needs, and have a sample size across 3 states, with probably 20 men (and yes, I've been tested for stds, lol). 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11122954/

""Orgasmic disorder is relatively common in women, affecting about 10% to 15% in community-based studies. In contrast, premature ejaculation is the most common sexual complaint of men, with a reporting rate of approximately 30% in most studies. Finally, sexual pain disorders have been reported in 10% to 15% of women and less than 5% of men.""


https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H1


""Sexual problems are highly prevalent in women. Sexual concerns are reported by approximately 40 percent of women worldwide.""

Learn what is right, what is wrong, but don't stop being yourself.

I've been doing this for a while, a long time. Let me tell you what happens.
***
More often than not, the guy already knows and puts up with it or finds out and does one of 2 things.

He gets defensive, wants to know why you were banging his chick and wants to know your motive for telling.

Or he thanks you. 

He then ""talks"" it out with his lovebird, they get back together, she calls you lame and then she gives herself up to some other guy who won't tell her BF again.

If it's not gonna be me, it's gonna be someone else. I refuse to insert myself into other people's drama fueled mess that are relationships. No thanks, I have too much of my own problems to worry about and contend with.

Plus, why lose out on easy pussy?
***
I have NO incentive to tell him. I lose pussy, she gives it up to someone else, the boyfriend stays getting poon (once a year lol) and here I am.. having my needs unmet once again.

I'm the only one that loses in that situation. It'd be going against my own self interests for little to no gain. I can see IF consequences were dealt out to the offending parties... but this is America/Europe/The West....

If it's gotten to the point where she's blowing me in my car on her lunch break, the relationship is already doomed. There's nothing I can do or say at that point to fix it and make it all better.

I can't fix in a few text messages what took years of bad choices and mistakes on the guy's part. I'm no therapist and refuse to try to play God in people's lives.
***
Women only cheat on guys they don't respect, and if that's the case (which it always is): It's a waste of time trying to intervene. There isn't much you CAN do when she loses respect for you. It's doomed.

You have ONE shot and when she stops respecting you, you've gotta correct that ASAP or you'll lose her forever. No matter what she says or does, when she sees you as anything less than a God, you're done. She'll find someone else attractive and you'll lose.

You try to do the right thing, but then you see like what happens with people like my uncle.
***
He had a kid with a girl, girl goes ape shit one night and fucks 3 different guys, 3 nights in a row and is walking all over him at home. Uncle is a nice guy who was out late at night looking for her, not knowing if she was dead or alive. They break up.

1 week later, they're back together and ""working things out"". He ends up getting cucked, manipulated. He loses the house, his truck, his money, all the respect of his family and she ends up taking the kid too in a few years.

So now his life is destroyed. All because he had no options and didn't walk the first time it happened. The best part?
***
She took his credit card, used it to go on a vacation and took a new guy with her. She had another kid by the new guy and the little one obviously looks NOTHING like the original dad.

It's pretty bad.

I'm sure Thanksgivings and visitations are HIGHLY awkward now.

He's done.
***
They don't work things out. The guy just puts up with it because he has no self esteem and or no options.

We tried telling him early on, before she cheated. He wouldn't listen. Guys usually never do. No matter if you're their nephew, their best friend or whatever. We just don't listen. We want to believe in fairy tales and ignorance is bliss.
***
I will say this though, I've NEVER (and will NEVER) mess with a girl who has a boyfriend/husband AND kids in the picture. If she has kids but no bf, fine. Bf and no kids, fine.

But i've never broken a family up. And that's more than what some people can say. Some get off on ruining marriages.

I haven't gotten that far.

If a woman finds me hot and doesn't like her bf for whatever reason, i'm not gonna ask her why and get to the bottom of it. If she wants it, she can get it.
***
It's a cold world. Not my fault the BF doesn't know. If he's worth anything, he'll figure it out on his own and do what is right, but he'll probably not and she'll get off scot free with a pussy pass GOLD edition. Once again.

Women shouldn't be running around on their man, it's wrong. It's messed up. Especially when kids are involved or it was a long relationship. She should face consequences for her actions. But she never will. So why bother? 

Some people just have to find out the hard way, it's what it is. You can't save everyone.

I am a bisexual woman korra being bi i of course love what i don’t love is rushing the relationship and making it incredibly forced like 95% of their interactions up until the last season were unlikely allies at best and frenemies at worst. DO NOT FEED ME CENSORSHIP BULL IF BUBBLENE CAN BE SHOWN ROMANTIC BUILD THEY SURE TF CAN TOO If they wanted a female li for korra opal was an excellent choice but instead no bolin got a rushed relationship too and korra got literally the only female her same age she’s ever interacted with ever. (another point aang’s grandkids wasted opportunity there as well not giving us ONE korra’s age) Never mind how much I hate korrasami’s dynamic it’s rushing left no real closure to the stupidity and forced writing of her and mako’s break up. lok was a trainwreck of trying to follow atla pacing in a new era where that really doesn’t work. which my disappointment towards lok is its own post. this relationship pissed me off especially when i’m supposed to be grateful for this rep?? no!!! this weird love triangle sucked from day 1 and now you just made it a complete triangle and made it way worse, congrats!"

I think the biggest thing that we could fault Bernie for was not campaigning harder for Clinton. He endorsed her and called for his supporters to vote for her, but he wasn't getting out there and stomping hard for her like someone such as Elizabeth Warren was. Sanders supporters sometimes get too much crap from Clinton voters. The reality is that something like 80 to 90% of Sanders voters ended up voting for Clinton. But there were a crucial couple of percent of Sanders voters who declined to vote for her. I think you can see that in third-party candidate Jill Stein who saw incredible surge in votes compared to what she got in 2012. In a race which was as close as 2016, the defection of even a couple of Sanders supporters ended up being fatal. I think that part of the problem for Sanders was that he's always been much more about uncompromising principle than about actually getting things done. During the primary, Clinton supporters often pointed out that Sanders had almost no legislative accomplishments despite being in Congress for decades. I think that's a function of his outlook. Bernie would rather be out there calling for the ideas which he thinks are right than actually passing legislation. In that sense, he in Clinton couldn't be more different, even though I'm policy they officially agreed with each other a lot. Clinton was all about incremental change and getting stuff done even if it meant having to compromise and get half measures. Sanders always seem to feel that being true to your principles and getting nothing was better than getting half a loaf."

A few years ago I would do this for fun (I know, I'm weird) and some of us really ended up liking each other a lot, but the relationship was so pointless because you would have to pay $1000 + for a plane ticket to see them. Sometimes as a guy, it is difficult to find girls in your area because a lot of them are taken, so I would reach out to fairly attractive girls that would live in other countries that would already have a fetish for western guys and such.

11802,"I honestly believe there needs to be specific, comprehensive, common sense gun laws. Most politicans say ""common sense gun laws"" but never get into specifics. I think that the variety and amount of fire arms people own should be limited off the bat, and the limited variety of firearms that people have access too should come with a complete training course in how to use them, and the owners should provide a legitimate reason for owning said firearm. Legitimate reasons (work related, hunting, protection, business, etc.). It is completely absurd how easy it is to buy guns in some states and its also absurd that people can own dozens of automatic weapons. I understand that the process is complicated and a lot of things have to fall in place before any real progress is made in this issue."

Also i think that capatalisim will go out of fashion for lack of a better term. There is already so much discontent with how our labour is devalued and used to make millionairs into billionairs. Think of how it used to be inconceivable for an artist to get famous without a racord label owning them. Now anyone can go viral and independant artists are practically mainstreem. I'd like to see something similar happen in our society. Take our power back and own the means of production.

Throwing your arms out while falling is not seen as a random act. 

Every conscious thing that you have ever done has been done with reason. Keep in mind that not every reason is a good reason. In OPs post the baby consciously decided to stop crying and it must of had a reason to do so, thus making the action not random.

Many of them don't achieve high levels of success until they're in their late 30s or early 40s.

Because of that, even if Reddit was equally divided between Liberals and Conservatives, not as many Conservatives would post their political views. Having to defend a viewpoint that others find odious and not having a compelling argument to present in favor of a viewpoint can be discouraging "

If you make a stir fry or protein salad for dinner can you really say how many calories you're consuming? And so many ppl eat out for lunch at places where there aren't calorie notations on the menu. For those under 30 who're junk food/fast food whores, just eliminating these can meet your TDEE threshold.

However, let's not bullshit ourselves..... If you pay someone to kill animals you are responsible (at least in part) for that animal being dead. If you feel it is ethically good to kill animals then it makes sense to give money to kill animals. If you don't feel it's ethically good to kill animals then eating plant based foods makes sense.

12016,"I worked at subway for 2 years. My first job til i was 18. Anyway i just got back from the lake and had a terrible sunburn. My dad drove me up to the restaurant to get something to eat and for my family. I didn't wear my contacts or glasses because my sunburn was so bad. So i go inside and walk behind the counter. I say to the manager ""Hey Kim, how are you?"" She responds with terrible. I told her i was sorry to hear that. 

I put some soap on my hands to wash my hands and make some food. She just looks at me and says leave. I ask why and she says just leave out the back now. So me being frustrated walk out the back and splatter the soap all over the wall. She wants me to wait for a customer to leave because apparently she would tell the owner of the store i was back there. Which doesn't make sense because I'm allowed back there anytime. So i wait for her to leave. The customer walks outside to her car and i decide to continue with my five sandwiches I'm going to make. Kim the manager stops ne again and says ""What are you doing she hasn't left yet."" At this point I'm furious so i go outside to blow off some steam. 

I see the customer drive away. So I go back inside and make my food. Kim decides to watch me make all my food. I'm slamming open the toaster and and letting doors open and close harshly because I'm mad. I get done with all my food and go around front to get me some OJ to drink. Kim asks me if I'm ready to pay. I say um sure i could do it myself but okay. She tells me to go ahead. 

Without knowing the price i pay. I don't care the price because i get 60 percent off. I walk to my dad's car and look at my receipt seeing i paid 40 dollars for my food. Fuming mad i go and ask her about it. She tries to make something up saying i dont get my full discount. I've worked there 2 years and i know thats not how it works.  I scream forget about it and walk out. The next day my family and i leave for a week long trip to Yellowstone. 

I hear that there is a rumor going around that I've been fired. I text the assistant manager because she started the rumor. I cuss her out for starting such a thing. And she tells me she thought i already knew. 

This entire time my manager never contacts me. But I learn she wants to see me. I get back from Yellowstone and go to get my check. I arrive and my coworkers tell me I'm not supposed to get my check until i bring back the uniform. 

I tell them move it's my money and they won't stop me. I get my check and decide to meet with Kim anyway. I meet her one morning at Subway and we sit down. She starts by asking what my problem is so i told her she was my problem. After a long argument i stop her and say Kim we are both stubborn assholes what do you want out of this.

She hands my a termination sheet telling me to sign it. I say i won't sign it she is too unprofessional. She says fine you don't have to sign it. I say whatever I'll sign it. I kindly sign the words ""fuck off."" And leave the store. 

I still drop by to see my old friends and mock the manager by wearing my old uniform up there.

12034,"&gt; The rebels are always short on funds. X-wings have not only hyperdrives but also highly-trained (read: expensive) pilots and a host of other tech to make them effective in a dogfight against TIE's.

There has never been any in film indications that Rebel pilots are especially well trained. There are certainly Aces among them such as Luke, Wedge etc, but at no point is it demonstrated that most of these pilots are anything but a ragtag group of people they have on hand that can actually fly the ships.

&gt; If capital ships can be blasted by a mass jumping into hyperspace, then it would've made way more sense for the rebels to ""just"" attach engines, hyperdrives, and a guidance system to asteroids and set collision courses.
You'd save a bunch of lives and cash that way, so that's the obvious solution.

I don't think that plan is particularly plausible nor do I think your assertion is valid.

&gt; In all seriousness, if I've missed something I'd like to hear it, but that's the big thing that people hated. That and the whole ""Rey became super powerful ridiculously quickly relative to even Anakin freaking Skywalker"" thing, but that's a separate issue.

Some people hated everything. Some people hate that the main character of these films is a woman. Some hate that they don't get to see Luke as an infallible Grand Master Space Wizard leading the resistance to glorious victory. Some people just hate everything new.

Rey getting powerful quickly is in line with Anakin and Luke both doing so. Why does Anakin Skywalker have to be by default the quickest to tap into his innate power?

Don't get me wrong there are flaws with the film, and you can certainly pick things apart...but none of the other films in the franchise are close to flawless. There's gaps and inconsistencies in abundance. The prequels have a near complete tonal and design difference to the OT, if that isn't enough."

12043,"&gt;It’s my body and my life. If you’re willing to go the lengths of threatening it to protect yourself, you are indeed a garbage doctor.

Threatening what to protect yourself?  What the fuck are you talking about?  I'm saying, I'm writing in the note why I'm not testing you anyways.  Don't be an asshole by saying, ""PLEASE WRITE WHY YOURE NOT TESTING ME"" to get testing.  ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT, or why you're not getting it if you want clarification.  Your body and your life are not my note.

That's not how medicine works.  It's passive aggressive nonsense, and we don't document in our note what patients request we document.  We document symptoms, subjective and objective findings, and medical decision-making.  It's for the person after us more than anything, if someone needs some help during their evaluation later.  If I'm not getting testing, I'm already writing why, because I have a rationale that you won't influence with such passive aggressive behavior and to protect myself in case something does show up, despite my evaluation and efforts.  

But if you like your doctors to test you for everything, get you a CT for everything, and do everything you say, I hope you enjoy becoming an opiate-riddled cancer addict like you all blame us for making you.  Can't wait to see how many CT-related-cancer diagnoses we have in 20 years.  "

""And the most recent event described was alleged to have happened in 2008 and so falls outside of the statute of limitations."" The judge dismissed Kesha's hate crime claim because the filings ""do not allege that Gottwald harbored animus toward women or was motivated by gender animus when he allegedly behaved violently toward Kesha ... Every rape is not a gender-motivated hate crime."" Kesha's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress was dismissed by the judge because ""claims of insults about her value as an artist, her looks, and her weight are insufficient to constitute extreme, outrageous conduct intolerable in civilized society."""

One is that Reddit loves to do this thing where they hear literally one thing about somebody and are willing to make firm judgements on them as a person based off this one thing. The other reason is just the fact that despite the wealth of options available to them people still bring children into situations like these and we as a society can do barely anything. The responsible thing to do is target people in situations like these and all but force them to get into therapy and get on birth control. Regardless of how much parents in these situations love their children they cannot be the mothers and fathers they need to be and are doing a severe disservice to their children and society as a whole. 

Btw I peeked at OP's post history and turns out Dad is literally illiterate, OP ended up a heavy alcoholic, younger brother is a severely dysfunctional drug addict and older brother is in jail.

12245,"Best friend's (at the time) dad died during 911. I was with him while it was happening, basically telling him his dad was probably ok etc etc. Seemed kind of like an absurd possibility that his dad wasn't ok. Took them weeks to find/identify the body, but we pretty much knew after he made no contact for a day or two. Turned out he died a few floors from the bottom after breathing in too much smoke. 

Anyway, my friend stayed with my family for pretty much the whole year afterwards cause his mom wasn't very functional and it was probably best for him to get out of the house. I remember him eating rice grain by grain for hours. He was also very interested in watching the original King Kong. We must have watched it 5 times. According to my mom, we used to make a bee-line for the blocks section every morning, build two big towers, and knock them down.

P.S. I feel like I have to mention this every time I talk about 911, but IMO the stupid reaction our country had to 911 was 100 times worse than 911 itself. I'd rather have multiple more 911s than one Iraq war, one financial crisis, Trump, and all the other idiotic shit that has happened because of the stupid hyper-nationalist bullshit all these people from Texas and other states that were thousands of miles away at the time have pushed in the name ""The War on Terror."""

You are right, it is chilling to think of how many women may have been trapped by circumstance in a bad situation.

There are plenty of design tricks that save lives, but we're determined that it's not worth the inconveniences. You seem terrified of dying. Guess what? Death happens. It happens to everyone. We are delicate, temporary beings on this planet. The fact that you freak out when someone dies is insane, and wholey unreasonable. If you had it your way, I'm sure no one would go outside because of how dangerous it is. The key importance of America is knowing that we have a love of freedom baked into us. Sure, there's a lot of authoritarianism present in politics right now, but the basic American belief is that we should be able to do whatever we want, unless it infringes on the rights of others, no matter how stupid or dangerous that thing is.

You need to calm down and open your eyes, because death has been a part of life since the beginning, and it will continue to exist long after we're gone. You need to accept death as a possible outcome of every day, or else you'll go mad trying to prevent everything in the world. Or is it just gun deaths you try to prevent? In which case, why are you so fixated on a single type of death, when there are other, far more easily preventable, types of death?

11,000 is a lot of people, but there are so many things that kill so many more people, that 11,000 are just unlucky.

They even found that smacking her had the same effect (although it was quite traumatic  to impose on her at first). Somebody autistic in another post here described how he hated the sensation of being lightly touched on the shoulder, but the sensation of a friendly punch to the shoulder was much more to his liking.

12419,"None of the Zutara fans ignore this. I’m aware that she hated him for a long time. I’m also aware that Zuko understood this and did everything in his power to prove to her that he had changed. He was willing to dig deep enough to learn about the source of her anger and then gave her the opportunity to find closure, while Aang stood to the side and lectured her for wanting to experience grief in a way that, even if it wasn’t fully healthy, would have been her decision. In that episode, Zuko proved that he trusted and respected Katara enough to let her make her own decisions, while Aang talked down to her and tried to guilt trip her into working through her grief in a way that he found comfortable and acceptable, with no concern for her personal autonomy. When Katara forgives Zuko at the end of The Southern Raiders, she’s not saying that she never hated him. She’s letting go of that hatred and accepting that he is a better person than before. After that episode, their relationship can start to develop further and that’s when most of us Zutara shippers start noticing how their interactions seem to be on much more even footing than those of Katara/Aang. Aang doesn’t seem to really see Katara as a real person, more of a possession he’s entitled to by virtue of being the avatar mixed with a doting mother.

Plus, the VAs of both Zuko and Katara have mentioned at panels that they thought the two were going to end up together. Seeing as they know the characters better than pretty much anybody, I’d say the ship wasn’t just something invented by people who wanted to criticize the show."

12476,"The fact that schools in many ""modern"" countries are so fucking pussified that there's practically nothing that can be done to punish kids in a way that they care about. Send them out of the class? ""Free break! Yay!"" Don't give them good behavior tickets? ""Lol who cares about that shit?"". Call their parents? ""They don't care"". Nothing. There's nothing you can do. Half the time they don't even listen to the most basic of instructions and many of them know full well how they are behaving, and they don't care about everyone else around them.

It seems pretty fucking obvious to me that removing more intense punishment completely and replacing it with ""stand outside and think about what you've done"" is a completely ridiculous way of approaching the issue, and just teaches kids that no matter what they do, they can't get in trouble, and they WILL pass either way, even if they didn't do any work, ever. It has turned a huge proportion of them into disrespectful jerks who can't even say the word ""hello"" without attaching an insult to it directed at you just because you're the teacher. These people don't do ANYTHING except disrupt the rest of class, and the fact that they are legally obligated to stay in school is insane. There's badly behaved students, and then there's students who have no behavior whatsoever and only serve to bring down the education of the entire class they are in. If they don't wanna learn or make any attempt to at least allow others to, then they don't belong in a school, at least not a normal one.

But anyone who is young and able to have kids and then doesn't wasted their time marrying and not continue their families line.

After highschool I dated this girl for a while and it was great until she started getting totally obsessed with me and started talking about getting married and having kids and all that .. but like sheesh we were 18 with no money or anything .. so I dumped her ... 

And most recently it wasn’t a relationship but she was my FWB for a while .. it was great she is a few years older than me and had all kinds of experience which made hooking up super fun .. she also got into doing my fetish stuff which made it even better .. but sadly she caught feelings for me and started talking about wanting to get married ....

That aside, that we all are actually gay, is not appropriate to hate anyone.  Openly gay people put up with it for far too long, it is not okay to return fire.

Basically you are saying that trains are not popular because they are not and because they are not popular now, they can never be since they suck now. 

Anything to defend status quo, even when you need to fake the reality. Trains are better in many ways and they are the perfect solution for countries with long distances and many large hubs.

&gt; It is popular to transport goods and is constantly being used to transport steel, cars, food, etc.... So even if you put fast trains there wouldn't be a demand and it could cause delays in the real rail money maker AKA shipping goods.

this can be said in other way: corporations are more important than people, thus they can enjoy with subsidized transport system while the people are forced to use less efficient means of transportation.

There are a lot of unhealthy overweight poor people consuming fewer calories on average than healthy weight people not living in poverty.

13015,"The only advice I'd offer, since you've been cut out of his life, is to call the hospital and speak to his doctor. Explain that you know the doc can't give you any information, but you need them to know about the sudden and unexpected violent behavior prior to this breakdown.

Do not speak to your friend or his family-- just the medical professionals treating him. Do not ask questions about his case-- you're providing medically relevant information, nothing more. Keep it factual and dry; you aren't blaming him, you're not making it about anything except ""this is what happened, and it was out of character.""

It is entirely possible that the family is not sharing that information with the doctor, and it's medically relevant. This is not a simple case of ""dehydration."" Your friend needs help, and this is the help you can provide.

Then, walk away. It's fine if they want to blame you. Them blaming you does not actually make this your fault. You'll have done what you need to to get him help, without trying to get involved with his family's drama.

tl;dr: Tell the doctors, then let it go."

The gun was charging up. It's heavily implied she saved him from a pointless death. There was a near zero chance he was going to be able to crash his speeder into the weapon in time to prevent it from shooting. The fact that they had time still to retreat after colliding with each other proves that.

&gt; If RJ were writing a feminist movie, his male and female characters might all of the chance to fail and redeem themselves, but his female characters are either perfect or so badly written we can't tell what he was going for.

Frankly I think all your opinions about RJ and his stance on feminism are nonsense, so don't waste your time trying to justify them. I think you didn't like the movie so yer pretty full of shit about Johnson and his motives."

13304,"I think the anti- anti-vaxxer crowd is even more ignorant that the anti-vaxxers. They don’t even know why people have issues with some vaccines. For instance, I see on Facebook some article about how vaccines don’t cause autism. I think GREAT, I’d love some good research on the matter. As it turns out, it addressed none of the legitimate concerns. The concern is that aluminum is a neurotoxin and is being objected directly into the bloodstream where it could pass through the blood-brain barrier and cause cognitive delays. Not autism per se, but just being delayed. Not all shots have aluminum. The MMR does not, for example, but is always the example used as not causing autism. Keep in mind just because something doesn’t cause Autism doesn’t mean it’s not harmful. 

Even the CDC’s website talks about how aluminum is okay because it’s abundant in our environment and babies who consume formula consume the single vaccine equivalent of aluminum in a month. 

Obviously that’s the worst explanation possible. First off, having something pass through the digestive tract over months is completely different from being injected into a bloodstream in one instance. That lackluster explanation is concern in and of itself. 

But what do we do about it? Most, probably not all, vaccines are needed but have this element in them. It’d be nice if some effort was put into using something else to create the immune response that was proven to be safer. Instead you get propaganda and a politicized argument calling anyone who questions ANYTHING about vaccines is a MORON. Being ignorant is the only way to be a moron here. Being skeptical and interested in your baby’s well-being, all things considered, is not moronic in my book."

13349,"he's been a catalyst for empowerment, towards the movement that the country should have self respect. So much of the western world in general, is getting steeped in acts of self loathing. We're horribly oppressive capitalist structures, that are also responsible for the dreadful situations in other countries, because, we took some of their stuff like 200 years ago or something. Having self respect as a country is important, because it influences how willing you are to take care of yourself. I've got a prime minister who is trying to be the beacon of everything that Trump is not, and that has not been good for our self respect. He has wanted to do various things with non western countries, which basically amount to us acting like they're our children, and we're their parents. Whenever the logistical realities about that attitude are brought up, and shown not to be entirely realistic, that's met with. ""Well, we were mean to the natives in Canada, so we should have no self respect as a country. You shouldn't mind that his attitude isn't logistically realistic, because if it does harm Canada, then that's just us getting our just deserts"". The self loathing attitude is harmful, because it's a barrier to us being responsible. 

I see the stereotypical cultish patriotism of the ""this is amurica, fuck yeah"" attitude, and I envy a country that has respect for itself. That act of self loathing, which was in America, and more previlant in other countries, was making it's acendence, and Clinton, being the identity politics loving globalist that she was, would've been a giant leap forward for it. Having an ""America first"" oriented leader instead, was something that staved that off, and in that particular respect at least, the country is better for it."

13351,"First of all, given your respect to me in a forum such as this, for a topic such as this, I can't stress enough that I want to show you good faith in return, with that said, here this goes

In the western world, the political left is often talking about the inadaquecy of the country, even within our own borders. We're told about the income inequality, and all the rampant poverty even in our homeland. All that is to say, that even when we make ourselves the only priority, even then it's hard enough keeping your head above water. The overly simplistic sales job of the politicians who speak to this crowd, is that the rich have too much stuff, and if we could only just get the rich to be more generous, then things would be better. Well, as an example bill gates made 11 billion dollars last year. There are 322 million people in the U.S. who are in the bottom 99%. If you took 100% of that man's earnings from last year, and divided it up equaly between all the people in the bottom 99%, do you know what that would equal out to? You'd make everyone 34 extra bucks, for the whole year. This not even counting the fact that a significant portion of that income is something that he ALREADY has given back to the people through taxes, so the number to be shared is smaller. Don't get me wrong. That's a helpful sum, it's not even a half day's worth of earnings for anyone with a full time job. Point being that the idea is pushed that we all could have a lot, and everyone could be prosperous, because we have the means to do so, but unfortunately we're just mishandling it. The example provided is all to say, that the results of prosperity you're seeing, have more to do with how much we have to work with than you think, as opposed to how well we're utilizing it. We're seriously not that wealthy in the west. This means that we are more vulnerable than most people think, and have less means to help the world outside the west than most people think. That being the case, getting entangled with other countries, rather than making yours the only priority, serves more to drag you down with them, than to lift them up to your level. "

She wouldn't get anything out of cheating on me though, she'd be downgrading.

If we had a house together, she would get kicked out on the spot and would never get to talk to me again.

If we had kids, I'd get full custody.

Like I said, cops tend to like me. I know how to talk to people. I'd get full custody.

She would get completely screwed trying to screw me. I'd get the kid, she'd lose a father figure in her life.

It seems more like another shake of the ol' nostalgia tree cash grab. It's not like the comics had strong ties to those songs and it's not like they're horribly sci-fi related (inb4:""subverted expectations!"").

They're good songs, it's a good movie, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about it, but it just doesn't fall in line with other legendary movie soundtracks for me."

13491,"I tend to lean left, and:

-I am a mystic and view modern science and education as soul-crushing. I wish education didn't separate the mind/intellect from the soul and suppress the latter. I also tend to be pro religious freedom. Yet, I don't like the conservative approach of favoring mainstream Christianity over other ways, using religion to discriminate, pushing inadequate sex ed, and suppressing actual scientific findings and critical thinking. I don't see spirituality/faith and reason as opposing each other.

-I am very anticommunist and wish Democrats and liberals would stand up for the victims of communism like they do for the victims of fascism. For example, Falun Gong practitioners in China.

-I also wish a lot of the left was more self-critical and stopped making war against anyone who doesn't think just like them. Ironically, most underprivileged people they claim allyship with don't think in that way. And while I believe it's vital to identify racism, sexism, and other oppressive patterns, it's not okay to use that platform to dehumanize people who happen to fit a privileged demographic. It's not okay to deny people's experiences that don't fit an ideology. Male privilege existing doesn't mean men can't be victims of domestic violence or have institutional disadvantages in custody cases. White privilege existing doesn't mean white people can't face racial prejudice or attacks from non-whites, even institutionally. I see people as human beings first, not constructed demographic identities that have to be against each other, privileged or not. That being said, I support Black Lives Matter, payments to the descendants of slaves, affirmative action when simply done to cancel out existing white/male bias, and giving more land back to indigenous people. I feel that healing the damage of racism and colonialism (and all other isms) is very important."

13592,"You've got 18 replies and I'm sure there's some great and not-so-great information in those replies. However I think my input may be of value to you. 

Birth can, and sometimes does, result in death. However, the body is resilient, and it is literally designed to give birth. In the US and the UK childbirth is viewed as a medical situation, and it is to a degree, but we have gone way, way overboard with our medical interventions. 

Forceps, one of the most iconic instruments used by obstetricians, serve next to no purpose, and yet they are routinely used. They are ideally used to guide the baby's head through the vaginal canal, taking special care not to pull. However, even in instructional videos on their use you'll find doctors pulling babies out using forceps. Why is this bad? Forceps work by pinching the baby's head (not to an extreme degree, but they lock the baby's head between the forcep blades). The blades can pinch and permanently damage facial structures if not placed correctly. If a doctor pulls (and most do) they can do permanent damage to the baby's spinal cord, spine, neck structures, and trapezius muscles. Similar instruments, like the vacuum, act on similar principle and have similar results. 

There are other areas of birth that are also detrimental to health of both mother and baby, but I'm kind of tired of writing, so if you're keen to learn about what those are then just let me know and I'll write about them. 

The body is designed to give birth, from women having larger hips to facilitate smooth expulsion of the baby, to hormones that regulate when a woman's cervix is dilated enough to allow for passage of the baby. We in the US and UK view pregnancy as a medical problem to be fixed, and it results in worse outcomes when compared to other countries that have a more relaxed approach to childbirth. That's not to say that all births should take place in baths and all that shit, but we have over-medicalized pregnancy and childbirth and it is resulting in more frequent bad outcomes for our children and new mothers. 

Though specific cases where there are impending health risks to mom and baby should be treated by current standards.. breach position, previous c-section, gestational diabetes, etc. "

13682,"I'm not excluding the possibility of him being sincere. I'm just saying that, sincere or not, it's a hella awkward compliment for someone to drop after indicating that you're not available. The fact that he lost the opportunity to get a dance/date with someone else who may or may not have been as hot is beside the point, or at most an addendum to it.

He now knows she's not available, dropping another compliment like that immediately after is dangerously close to (if not) a continued attempt at flirting rather than an innocent parting comment. Trying to see things from his view, the only reason I can think of that he'd go for dropping a compliment bomb of that force after knowing she's taken would be to test the waters to see if it's still an option even though she is taken. Either that or he truly was a hopeless romantic and falls hard and fast. It's hard to say without actually being either person involved, but a compliment like that doesn't seem like just a casual parting comment.

From the other perspective, if someone were to say that to me after already telling them I'm married, I'd probably feel pretty awkward since I already indicated my non-availability and a comment like that really feels like they're still trying to flirt with me. Immensely flattered, but pretty awkward and probably a bit guilty for feeling so flattered. (I'm not trying to say OP should feel that way too or that she's wrong if she didn't, just my personal view on how I would take it)

Right because older women are less attractive and have no choice but to put up with men who are weak. Older women also usually have children and don't want to break up their families. Younger women are more attractive and can afford to dump a weak guy for a stronger one especially because they probably don't have kids with that guy, but that doesn't mean older women aren't attracted to strength, they still are, but most of them are also smart enough to know that their options are limited and so they are more willing to put up with weak partners.

13778,"Acquiring it through dishonest means.

So I have caused over 7 people to rear-end me in the past  5 years and have collected much for 'damages'. One man in particular was very displeased that he had to pay damages for the physical trauma of 'whiplash' from a 15 mph collision.  After court and my tidy sum of 30k was settled upon, I was sitting on my couch drinking a nice scotchka while shopping online for my next vehicle to have someone else total as soon as my money ran out. Suddenly I heard a knock at my door and then repeated kicks. Soon the door splintered off the hinges and came crashing to the floor. I sat bolt upright and in shock I watched the ornery man who just had been ordered to pay me 30k step through the shattered doorframe. ""Hello there"" he said. ""You really fucked me over right now and I know it was on purpose that you made me rear-end you. But I won't have to pay damages if you're dead"". The man then slipped on a pair of rubber gloves and I knew he meant business as they snapped back against his girthy wrists.

Then he reached into his waistband and pulled out a 9mm pistol, brandishing it at me.  Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a condom. He dropped his pants neatly with one hand, while keeping the gun trained on me.  He said ""Guess what I'm gonna do after I kill you bitch. I'm gonna fuck you in the ass."" And he put the condom on gracefully with the hand not holding the pistol and it snapped back on his quickly hardening cock. ""But we can't have any evidence now, can we? As much as I'd like my little swimmers to enjoy meeting your shit, I'm afraid the promised land at the end of this jimmie will do. Now you're gonna die you little fucker. Pick a god and pray."" 

Since I am a La Veyan satanist, I told the ornery man to kiss my ass. He did not like this and pulled the trigger. He pulled it 7 times, but each time a resounding click echoed from the chamber. ""Oh fuck me I forgot to load it"" he said. So I scurried to the splintered door and grabbed the sharpest piece of wood I could find. As he turned on me to bring his meaty fists crashing down on me, I quickly forced the shard through his neck, severing his jugular neatly, with blood spurting everywhere. He began to gurgle and tried to say some defiant last words but no noises were made for his vocal chords were severed.  

For my final act of cruelty, I rubbed dog pheromones on his anus and released my largest bloodhound. It quickly mounted him and gave him the same treatment he planned to give me. Ironic. Finally, I cut his cock off with a rusty scissors, leading to his loudest gurgle yet, and plunged each blade into one testicle and left it there. I threw the severed cock to my other bloodhound who quickly removed the condom and ate the penis hungrily just as the man's eyes began to glaze over with shock and pain. As he died like a pussy, I myself began to moan, for I realized that I wouldn't be receiving my 30k now. At least my hounds had a nice meal that night though.  Still, the night of dissolving his bones in acid, replacing my door, and replacing my carpet was very grueling, and my hounds got the shits causing an even bigger mess on the rest of my carpet.

So I probably won't intentionally have someone rear-end me again. Plus, the court must be getting suspicious by now anyway."
13779,"Almost everyone gets divorced before 5 years of marriage. I'd think it might make sense to see if you can last 5 years before marriage?

Also, 55% might get divorced but no-one thinks about how 75% of the remaining 45% (33.25%) are absolutely miserable, especially men who can't divorce without losing everything.  55%+33.25% is 88.25%.  88.25% chance of hell failure.

There are numerous *possible* explanations: krakens went extinct due to severely diminished prey supply (IE they fed on whales or something, and since whale populations have crashed, kraken starved to the point of extinction.  Replace whales with your aquatic foodstock of choice - we've gone way beyond decimating ocean species), krakens were sighted more commonly when boats were smaller (IE krakens were more likely to approach/attack a 40 foot long Mayflower-esque boat compared to a 1000 foot long super tanker, or even a 70 foot ocean fishing vessel.  As trans-oceanic vessels grew, they became increasingly less susceptible to kraken attacks), or I'm sure a variety of ocean temperature/acidificaition/other oceanography-type-stuff-I-don't-know which could be a potential explanation.  


Edit: If Kraken *did* prey on whales, than the reduction in kraken sightings/attacks would also make sense, as there are wayyyy fewer whaling vessels than there were 150, 200, or 300 years ago"

I'm not an anomaly. I know what I did to get to this point, but I also know that people look at me and assume I eat a certain way or don't work out 5 days a week. I watch my normal weight co-workers call out sick more than me, get winded taking the stairs, and eating fast food multiple times a week.

Edit: Nice to see the fat phobia is still alive and well on reddit. Did all you downvoters miss where I said I 100% understand that my weight could cause issues in the future and I am actively working on changing that? Fat person trying to get healthy? That should get your jollies going.

It's one of the things I like about the film. They're not some swaggering thugs who intimidate people into ""trading"" (yep, I did get what you were trying to do). They're violent cultists who murder everyone and take what they want. There's no reason for them to leave survivors (""[We don't *need* practice!](https://streamable.com/qg6hd)"").

This ties into the core concept of the film - that this way of doing things is unsustainable. Intimidating a settlement into ""trading"" with them would be worth it if ""repeat business"" was feasible.

13974,"As an honest response from someone who doesn't really buy into ""global warming"" more so than just general ""climate change"":

1) I think ""climate change"" definitely happens. I think it is a load of BS, however, when anyone attempts to say what our impact has been in concrete terms though. You would have to know what the world would be like without us and compare that to a model of the world with our impact to know this for certain. No such data exists now &amp; nor will it ever (e.g. Due to the myriad and often conflicting elements at work, both natural and artificial. The melting of the Marie Byrd Land ice fields came as a huge shock when it was discovered that it was lava floes vs. the previously declared man-made elements at work). Summed up: Al Gore preached that the ice caps would be toast by now.

2) I think climate change (previously see global cooling, global warming) has been subjected to a lot of moving goal posts since it isn't a scientific endeavor as much as a political one in the public sphere. The scientific community can never be driven by consensus as collective opinion has zero impact on hard facts - I've personally gotten the sense that many big endeavors on behalf of the movement (Paris Accords, etc.) have been entirely political in nature and are simply a vehicle to effect political goals of one form or another. Responsible stewardship of our nation is very open to debate and I think people who honestly want to just be more responsible should step off their fucking high horse and say so, starting with real concerns and real, acceptable solutions. The keystone pipeline, for example, was an issue that had be scratching my head for the longest time. The majority of oil spills, etc. have taken place on tankers while out at sea - the pipeline would have posed a far lesser risk on all accounts yet I never heard environmentalists take that position and opposed it almost out of principle. Just my two cents from an alternate point of view."

13995,"""The purpose of socialism is to evolve into a Communist state""  


Socialism is Communism lite, and it also doesn't work as it involves stealing capital from those who produce. Socialism is at its very core, anathema to capitalist economics as capitalism relies on the existence of private property.  


There has not been a socialist state that has not failed. Every single one has. No, the Nordic countries are not socialist, they are capitalist economies that have a large social safety net. To supplant this they deal with high taxation and have very tight border control, but they are fundamentally capitalist.  


Capitalism relies on the individual producing to their best ability to further their own gains. In doing this, they are forced to co-operate with other people. Make no mistake, the United States is not a free market capitalist state, they have a Corporatist economy, which was adopted from the Fascist regimes of the 20th century. It's designed to be an inbetween, where the public can influence businesses buy purchasing stock and owning shares in the company, and the government retains the ability to force corporations to produce what they want them to. If you've noticed, the major corporations tend to abuse their employees, the environment and try to directly effect elections in the way they want buy buying out politicians, thus why I don't like Corporatism. They abuse the consumers, the customers.  


Pure, free capitalism is as impossible as communism because it ignores the sad reality of human nature. As much as I like Ayn Rand, she and other objectivists miss the point completely. For a good commentary on pure capitalism, and where it ends up, look at Bioshock. Similarly, to see where socialism goes look at Venezuela, and where Communism goes look at the USSR.  


There are also other fundamental differences between Capitalism and Socialism/Communism. For starters, Capitalism is a system of economics while Socialism/Communism are both systems of governance as well as economics. The end goal of Capitalism is to make money, the end goal of Socialism is to create a Communist state, the end goal of Communism are tribal societies. Yes, I've read Marx and Engels, yes this is what they advocate for, it's not an exaggeration. Engels advocated for a classless matriarchal society of free love and sex, blaming all the worlds ill (literally) on ""patriarchy"" which he considered to be the act of passing your wealth and resources from father to son, literally wanting a tribalistic society where everyone is fucking eachother and nobody has any goddamn food. Gonna be real here, things like this is why I consider Communism a religion, because nobody with their in reality will buy into any of this.  


In conclusion; A socialist state cannot have capitalist ideas in it. There are no successful socialist states. Capitalism is a system of economics while socialism is a system of governance. Capitalism isn't perfect but it's produced more equality than any other system of economics. There are only a few capitalist states *on Earth.* The United States isn't capitalist, it's corporatist.  


I don't blame you for not knowing, your average highschool teacher barely knows more than the students nowadays. I went through the public school system before going and taking a private curriculum, after all. I've seen both sides. I had classes with a level-headed Communist (hell, everyone thought we had great chemistry for whatever reason and we got along even though we disagreed on virtually everything) and she understood all this. She believed in the ideal, like a lot of people my age, but realised it was functionally impossible. Take that story for what you will, but I don't have this irrational fear or disdain for Communism or Socialism (though looking at history I'd have some damn good excuses), I just want to avoid suffering as much as possible and given the track record I don't think trying again with an ideology that won't stop failing is a good idea."
13996,"&gt; Pretty sure they're just cold war terms that mean NATO and its allies (first world), the USSR and its allies (second world) and the neutral countries (third world).

Ummm... no.

The ""First World"" are the developed nations.  Places that have industrialized societies, modern conveniences, usually (but not always) democratically elected governments.

The ""Second World"" are the develop**ING** nations.  Places that aren't as industrialized or democratized as the First World, but are making strides in that direction.

The ""Third World"" are undeveloped nations.  Generally poor, little to no industry, often governed by monarchies or dictatorships (benevolent or otherwise).

I don't know where I got this definition from, but it's something I learned a long time ago (&gt; 20 years).  This definition loosely matches the reality of post-WWII (it's a loose definition in the first place), and it also loosely matches the way people actually use these terms anyway.

The origins of the terms are from the Cold War era, as you said, but they've morphed a bit into something less defined by specific alliances and more by the characteristics of the countries they're applied to."

14101,"&gt; Such a focus in women's studies isn't to say that men's contributions are invalid and women's are great, so much as it's a widening of the camera lens to include more people and better understand the actual picture and its context.

Except ""women's studies"" does not solve any of these problems by ""studying"" them.  That's why it's basically useless.  Sure it's a topic area of sociology or economics or whatever, but an entire degree program?  Hardly, just look at the lack of ""gender studies"" jobs.

You want more women in tech or whatever?  Then women actually need go into tech, not ""women's studies"", where they just complain about other women not taking the tech jobs they themselves don't want either.  (Which they will claim is due to ""hostile work environment"" or some such BS as to why they can't work with men, when they are the ones who are hostile and hence seeking a career in a field focused entirely on arguing about gender divisions instead of actually getting work done.)

Here's the root of hypocrisy in the field: diversity in the workplace is due to people having differences.  Groups with different culture/attitude will choose to different things.  Thus you should not expect proportional representation from groups that are different, otherwise they are actually not diverse if they choose the same things.  If women claim they are somehow different from men and thus being misrepresented, then why would we expect a different population to act the same, choose the same careers, and be equally successful at them?  Yet we'll hear all day from ""women's studies"" about how we should see equal representation even though they are the first to claim including women is more diverse."

Eventually, you stop noticing the stress. It's still there, but the brain puts it on the back burner because it recognizes the situation and gets comfortable again.

Now try and do it with someone who hasn't done it before. You'll be hovering over them, making sure they don't fuck up. Eventually though, you become confident that they know what they're doing. You leave them to their own devices. Little did you know, they still needed supervision for a while longer. They fuck up, and they die.

No one knows when they're 2 weeks pregnant. That aside, let's assume they're like 8 months pregnant. That's well past the deadline for any abortion and past the point of fetal viability.

VR is a screen super-close to your face. Add the headset, there’s a better sound-space. If you have that ring-thing where you walk around and it maps your body- that’s closer.

I’m talking immersion as in diving into water. This is just being at an aquarium.

i can tell you this, in the 1970s and 80s you NEVER saw a kid acting crazy in a store or a restaurant, the owner would ask you to leave and youre parents wouldve been so humiliated youd feel like crap. now a days kids dont give a shit. i watched a group of 4 teens take bike soff the rack at a store and proceed to speed around the store only stopping when they crashed into an elderly woman throwing her to the ground. 

 Then they ran off laughing, of course not before grabbed the kid who hit her and    pinned his ass to the ground.  But thats more and more common nopw. You say kids are more tolerant? I say the opposite, kids are more violent, antagonistic, and know they have no punishment awaiting them. hell did you know if massachusetts we have a law that was passed 3 years ago that a kid under 12 cannot be charged with a crime?

His face is fish-like, with soulless, black eyes and a wide, gaping mouth, and he has kelp and seaweed for hair.

14509,"So, for some context, this happened recently as I'm 14 and still able to be punished by my parents and it's strange to me, however keep in mind I'm a bitch and deserved it.

So on Sunday, we were with my stepdad driving around to find his new work place. He works an hour away, but didn't know where until now. So we have been driving for about and hour and still couldn't find the place so I was getting hungry, and me, being the Bitch I am complained about it ( Actually, now that I think about it, I probably wasn't even hungry ). So we pulled into this really shitty subway that only had two kinds of bread. Being the basic person I am, I always chose whole wheat, and they didn't have that so I politely declined food (actually I probably wasn't polite.. I can't really remember). So when we got back to the car, my stepdad immediately starts yelling at me and calling me bitchy and said to not talk until we get home. So I didn't.

Well later, we went to my brothers place for dinner and we were invited to go swimming after. My stepdad was making the hamburgers so I looked at him and said "" What's taking so long?"" He proceeded to get mad and went on a walk,. My sisters still pissed because I ruined swimming (we haven't gone in a year.. because of something else I did). And my punishment for pissing him off is

• the silent treatment from him (At this point we don't talk much at all because he's mad at me so much)

• No going to my favourite store for back to school shopping ( I hate the material of Walmart clothes they are right and make me uncomfortable , and this is first I've gone back to school in 2 years.. hope I don't get in trouble for wearing crop tops and shirt shorts cuz that's all I own )

They usually try to justify it with ""le body decision"" (wrong, there are two bodies, if you are a conjoined twin and take poison you are murdering your brother), ""it's not alive"" (again wrong, no need to explain it), ""it's not conscious"" (most people at hospitals aren't conscious either), ""he will have a shitty life anyway"" (same as enabling genocide of an ethnic group because they will be treated as an inferior race anyway).

14573,"Just factually, many items were made to a higher standard in the past. Items were made from higher quality materials and tested much differently. Items now can be optimized to use the very minimal amount of material possible for the designed purpose, many are only tested in representative batches (vs testing every single product) and there are tons of different materials that can be used to create things. This allows much stronger items to be built, but also allow cost considerations to override quality.

14579,"According to most flavors of christianity, that famous Josh guy is the sun (sol) anthropomorphized as a cool bro. In a sense, that form of a 'god' sorta helped create this planet, and is the reason life thrives here in what we consider to be impossibly perfect conditions. So, the shit you hear from religious people that makes you rage inside because **the literal words they speak as an expression do not comply with the literal words you know?** You don't get it. 

The next time you have to be physically near some christian shit going on, remember that their fandom franchise is likely sun worship. Ever considered what might be worthy of worship? Hmmm? Maybe the fact that a massive nuke ball is the reason you can shitpost and fap to HD porn. Sun worship gets laughed at, but it fucking deserves a little praise. The process got a few hollywood remakes throughout human history. Don't be pissed about it. 

We all understand that ancient religious texts are spiritual fanfictions. Yes, there are mentally ill people who are TAUGHT incorrectly that some dude magicked shit into existence, and then they murder people and eat them. I don't think any amount of 'quotations' will help the crazies. Crazy fucks be crazy. 

You probably believe the bible talks about some magic apple, and that Josh was born on December 25th meriting gifts. That fucked up shit isn't in the bible, my guy. It's traditional. That period of the year marks the shortest day of the year (least sun), and then a slow day-to-day increase in sunlight, marking longer days and an eventual return to warmth, crops, life... Scholars knew about seasons 5,000 years ago, but plebs like you and me didn't so we fucking thought the world might end every winter. We weren't sure if spring would come. There was a point in human history when the spring didn't come back for a long time. We simply stopped talking about it after a few thousand years, but the effects live on in thousands of screwball traditions and belief structures. Some gained a lot of traction and were adopted by government. Shit was fucked, but for a long time, large cities weren't working with a bunch of highly capable chimps fucking it all to hell. Tricking idiots into thinking thunder and lightning were an all-powerful buff dude watching over your actions sort of helped maintain a lil order. We fortunately improved on that form of mind control. 

Sane spiritual people don't believe in magical sandpeople. **If you like to go balls deep in star wars or other fanciful shit, give some flavor of religion a look-see**. Not practicing, just reading up on the shit. You might enjoy the deep lore. The shit from India is especially neato, as well as the other Indians. Hopi mythology is cool. It's good for a lot of people, and can fill a little spot in some that's kind of empty. Reality of nature is chaos and suffering, so a little make-believe can act like a natural anti-depressant or opiate. When a large community follows the sacred texts with you, you fulfill a naturally occurring desire to fit in and be accepted in a group/herd. That shit is literally instinct. We've been doing it since before the last freeze over. Chill.

The religious institutions around me do a lot of good for people. Many people take on religious practice as a hobby of sorts. It's a traditional cultural thing in a lot of places that does no harm. People near me also meet up to ""compete"" in Smash Bros WiiU, which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. There is no competitive aspect to that shitty remake and they know it. It's just fun for them. I don't encourage them to stop believing in their fantasy world of choice even though I disagree with their mindset. 

Next time you witness a brown person say ""god is great"" while they are shown a pic of newborn puppies, or some landwhale in walmart say 'the lord jesus our god blesses us this day' after paying for 20 gallons of mtn dew with food stamps, it's a cultural thing, rather than their scientific understanding of the world. You become the bigger idiot when you argue with them.

Both were rhotic i.e. speakers pronounced the letter R in hard. **Since 1776, the accents diverged but English accent in America has changed less drastically than accents in Britain.Towards the end of the 18th century, non-rhotic speech took off in southern England, especially among the upper class; this ""prestige"" non-rhotic speech was standardized, and has been spreading in Britain ever since.** Most American accents, however, remained rhotic.There are a few fascinating exceptions: New York and New England accents became non-rhotic, perhaps because of the region's British connections. Irish and Scottish accents, however, remained rhotic. To be fair, both American and British English have several types of accents and there is no one true American or British accent.

And if you’re referring to selling them for money: maybe that’s his only belt? Maybe it was a gift from his late father? Again, maybe they’re knock offs that won’t garner any money? Maybe they’re too Worn in for someone to buy? 


There’s a million and one legitimate reasons to own Gucci while also hurting for money.

My friend (that worked with me) once went to my school to visit me and everyone told him that I never attend. That guy told all my friends that I ditched school and they laugh at me for being weird. I never showed up to work ever again, and didn't even agreed to talk with that friend.
After months I didn't agree to talk to him, that friend saved my paycheck from the supermarket and asked my brother if he can give it to me. My brother declined, but told me that he really looks like he is sorry. I finally agreed to talk to him and we stayed friends for years.

14731,This just in: employers abuse employees for profit. Welcome to America's work force.
14732,"I don't think the situation is funny. I think your reaction to it is. Even people working part time minimum wage jobs get scheduled for shit like that, not because they did anything wrong or as a retaliation, but simply because the scheduling manager doesn't care that the employee is working 4 days one week and 5 the next, with all their days on clumped together. It happens literally all the time. 

If that's your idea of ""retaliation"" for literally screaming at your boss, go read some of the actual horrendous shit people have put up with in this very thread. Like the woman whose boss wanted her to sleep with a potential client. Or the guy whose boss's boss's boss decided to screw the entire sales team out of a significant portion of their income. Or the multiple instances of people being asked to commit fraud on the company's behalf.

(edit: or in some of those cases, of the shit they did not put up with and ended up quitting. But then realize that not everyone has that option. See again the woman whose boss wanted her to sleep with clients. She quit, and noted in her post that one of her coworkers had actually done it because she was afraid she'd get fired for refusing and couldn't afford to lose her job. Imagine being in a situation where you're being pimped out by your employer for probably something like $12/hour and you can't say no to that because you need the job that bad.)

So yeah, if retaliation for screaming at the manager running your store is having to do (once) something that plenty of people in similar jobs put up with on a regular basis, not because they're being punished, but because that's just how it is, take a step back and get some perspective."

14743,"To be fair, there's a lot of factors at play. Corporations shouldn't have to pay their workers for not working due to their personal choices. Taxing the whole population so that mothers can get maternity pay won't pass in the near future.

The capitalist society we live in don't want to pay for things they aren't using. People who go to a trade school or just don't go to college won't want to pay for ""hippies to smoke pot"". People who are childless don't want to pay for Mary lous ""3rd little shit"". They hardly want to pay for Public schools. Although I'm upset with how corrupt and wasteful public school spending is.

In American society if you want something you need to be able to afford it, otherwise you're out of luck. Raising a child isn't cheap, if you expect to have one you either need to plan ahead, or use government assistance programs. 
 
Another problem with society is that some people abuse assistance programs. People only see the few who abuse these programs and want to cancel them. They don't see the people these programs help out. "

People are not responsible for the crimes of their ancestors, but they  should not profit of it either. If the land gets taken away they are en par again with the rest of SAs population.

They started with an unfair advantage and now that advantage gets taken away. The people who currently own the farms did not establish the estates, they merely inherited them from people who took them by force.

E: If the people would be punished, they would serve prison time or they would be forced to pay preparations to the blacks, but it's simply their unjust advantage being taken away without further consequences.

It's somewhat remotely comparable to a thief having to return the stolen goods, without further punishment. Except that in this case the thiefs children have to return the stolen goods.

He became so  powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which  eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice  everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's  ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."

14947,"&gt;try to cure their cancer on your own with essential oils?
  
Okay, well clearly you have zero understanding of *why* someone would turn to alternative medicine if you're going to be so condescending about it... 
  
To these people it's not ""curing them on your own"", to them, they're taking them to an alternative doctor who claims to be able to do something that regular doctors cannot. Is it their fault for believing? You're acting like these people are murderers, even if they're doing what *they* think is right. 
  
The correct thing to do is to prosecute people who claim alternative medicine can cure cancer... Not persecuting the parents of dying children who are willing to do anything to save them. You're taking a person in a traumatic situation, and telling them if their child dies then *they* should go to jail for murder... Do you have any empathy at all? 
  
If the point of CPS is to tell people how they're allowed to take care of their children, then they should take away the kids of anyone who doesn't get their kids vacinated, or doesn't give their young children chemo. Or any kids who are given solids before they're a year old. Or any parents who let their kids play outside when it's slippery. Slippery like the slippery slope you're creating by saying the government is *allowed* to make being a bad parent a crime, regardless of context or situation.

edit: Also, your bit about how anyone at end-of-life who isn't in end-of-life care is somehow uncomfortable and always in pain is just ridiculous... Not only is that extremely expensive for some people, but for some people they'd rather be comforted by alternative medicine then sit in a hospital... It all comes down to personal preference at that point, you can't claim objectively that somehow dying in end-of-life care is better than someone who dies elsewhere. My ex's grandmother was dying of cancer, and she refused chemo. Instead, she did reiki healing and shit like that. Do I believe in it? No. Did she? Absolutely. And it was obvious that she was happier doing that than being stuck in a hospital bed waiting to die. "

Now on the taboo thing. Just opinions on the fly. I believe women started to cover and tell other women to cover because men stared. Like if women want to go to the beach with no upper cloth, most men won't care, at all, but they will stare (we men like boobs, probably some edypus fixation from when we were babies or some evolutionary thing so we look for boobs that are good for future babies or something). And women don't like being stared, so they cover. And if women showed their nipples on the streets, most complain qould come from other women (specially the ones with kids in the moment). 

Basically men stare, women don't like it.

Warner Bros[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.) produced wartime cartoons which constantly parodied Hitler and his personality traits and quirks. Most (if not all) cartoons with Hitler and the Nazis as the antagonists ended up with the American hero cartoon character (such as Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck) making a mockery out of Hitler and his people.

If someone commits a murder with a gun that you sold them privately such that the gun is still registered to you, then you sold them the firearm illegally and you are liable.

15194,"I know it might be tempting to just downvote, but I'm willing to have an honest conversation, so, if you're an intellectually honest person, you'll hear me out. 

I am an ethnonationalist, so, what many of you would call a ""neo-Nazi"". I believe that every ethnic group should have a homeland where they can live around people they share a common culture and identity with. It has nothing to do with who is ""superior"" or ""inferior"". Often people in our movement talk about issues that race and IQ or race and crime, which some use as evidence that we're actually ""supremacists"". First of all, acknowledging such differences is not claiming superiority, it's simply acknowledging that different groups on average have different traits. Second of all, these issues have nothing to do with why homogeneous societies are preferable. The reason people within our movement talk about them is because we're the only ones willing to talk about taboo race related issues, and because being knowledgeable on these subjects is useful for disproving narratives like ""white privilege


""Former neo-Nazis"" tend to be people who joined this movement for the wrong reasons. There genuinly are people who believe the in ""superiority"" stuff because it makes them feel better or whatever. However, if you've actually quality literature and understand why homogeneous societies are preferable, there's no going back."

15200,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

No, there isn't a ""Jewish conspiracy"", however, Jews tend to very opposed to nationalism outside of Israel. Some have theorized that this is due to the fact that Jews have a distinct identity from, say, Europeans as a whole, so they tend to sympathize with ""the outsider""."

15251,"Haha. Ironic, isn't it? I'd switch places with you. 

When everything you've seen has a reason, and you can explain everything other people describe with logic, life loses its magic. It loses its wonder and its mysteries. Everyone I've dated in my life has had a similar mindset as you (not specifically, just the out-of-worldly beliefs, even though you don't call them beliefs but it's what you believe? anywho) because it just fascinates me. That life terrifies me deep down, but then it doesn't because I bounce back to reality, where these spooky beings do not reside. 

My body is telling me to argue with you right now, or to put up so much reasoning that you can't refute because I know it to be true, but your life doesn't affect me and my life doesn't affect you. Justifiably both ways. 

See, the reason I'm such a wet sock is because I always asked questions. Too many questions. My parents didn't talk to me much, neither did my brothers. Or my cousins. Or the rest of my family. I had friends but they weren't the ""let's talk about the deepest parts of life"" friends. So, I had to answer my own questions. Everything had an answer and I knew that. So I'd search until I found it, and it was always there eventually. I'm not telling you this to talk about me, because honestly I'm pretty boring and there's not much ""to"" me. I'm telling you this because I hope you at least ask questions. 

I hope you don't live your life blindly believing things. Don't try to convince me you're not, because I'm a stubborn bitch about that and you simply won't. Never be afraid to ask a question and never take the first possible answer to be the only possible answer. 

A lot of things could be. A lot of things are. Most things are not. 

Believe what you will, but at the end of the day, it's just us here, doing what we do.

15323,"I'll give you a serious answer.  It's because the objective standard of ""lie"" applied to Trump (something provably untrue when taken literally) is a standard the OP fails in the question itself.  

In other words, the OP is lying when he says Trump ""lies all the time.""  There are statements from Trump that are known to be true.  Therefore, it is a lie to claim Trump ""lies all the time.""

Of course we all know the OP doesn't mean 100% of the time when he writes ""all the time,"" but the OP and TDS-affected liberals like him don't allow Trump the same standard of truth.  

Everybody knows exactly what Trump means when he says the F35 fighter plane is invisible, even when close to it, but only the OP and his resistance movement pals pretend otherwise and claim it's factually a lie."

15361,"I feel like I have to comment, although I dont feel like I ever have been a ""filler"" friend.

People have to understand, that there are different kinds of friendship. You can be childhood friends, you can be interest-friends, you can be coworker-friends, drinking friends... The list can go on like this.

For different events, you invite different people, and it is not always true, that anybody is a ""filler"" in many situations. 

For example, if you hang out with your close childhood friend(s), and decide you wanna play beachvolleyball. You need like 4-8 people for that, so you decide to call up friends to join. You choose those first, who you think might be interested or played with you in the past (you dont choose, weather sb is a better friend or not). Some have no time, some just dont want on that day, so you ask people, who usually dont play beachvolleyball with you (those people might feel as ""fillers"", but they are not). If your coworker decides he want to play, fine, and he will be invited as well in the future.

In a different scenario, if you go out with your coworkers after work, you usually dont invite your friends with you (they might life far away for example). But if you know by any accident, that a friend will be near the location, you invite him (he might feel like a ""filler"", he is not).


The only bad ""filler"" scenario that I know is, when you call somebody late night, just to ask if he/she can drive you and your other friends to another location (you ask him to join you ofc, and not drive you directly). This is an asshole move in my opinion, because you only call that person to save money. If you go out without that person to begin with, why would you invite him/her later the same day?

'Cursed Child' establishes that only two Time Turners exist that allowed for true changes to time. One was destroyed by Delphini in a ""dark timeline"" and the other was also presumably destroyed following the events of the play... So their existence never really becomes a problem for the internal logic of the overall story as they were both effectively taken care of.

When you think about it, the Cursed Child play places all the events back to how they were as well by the time the play is over. So maybe the ""true"" Time Turners work the same as the old ones and are ""self-correcting"", but do so 'the long way round', only allowing changes that are destined to be reversed somehow ;)"

15700,"Ignoring obvious problems like over/excessive eating...any excess calories can be turned into a number of things...the problem is that most of the calories in bad diets come from refined sugars which are nearly instantly converted into fat.

(anytime you get a sugar rush or crash you are storing insane amounts of calories as fat).

Things like nuts break contain sugars which break down far more slowly and can be used my the body efficiently so it doesn't have to be stored as fat.

Along the same lines...people who exercise and eat afterwards go through a stage of ""insulin sensitivity"" where sugars are far more likely to be turned into glyogen, which is basically carbs that are stored in muscles for very quick energy consumption.

All of this is exactly why athletes consume far more calories but don't gain weight...they get healthy calories instead of empty calories and their bodies are trained to store the excess appropriately."

Cheap shot. Another pattern I see is men taking on women shaming tactics to stay clear of criticism.  Also, many women are clearly attracted to me whether it's real or a single mother trying to get her claws in me.  I don't eat shit food.

I see it done to other men constantly more than it happens to me.  I get 1-2 of these a year every year.

Honestly, I think you are lying because it's so much easier for a man to say it never happens to him then to say something like I just did.

A few months ago I saw a small girl go up to a homeless guy sitting in front of a store. The homeless guy looked confused, he was signaling, umm go away, why are you here, go..  Just then a violent mother snapped up her girl like the homeless was trying something and it was clearly the opposite.  Women just enjoy this stuff at this point.  It angered me for a good 5 seconds, and I walked over to the homeless man and told him women are like that today.  I didn't know what to say.

I would say the places that have unions in place in this industry are actually worse off from it. The industry is shifting towards outsourcing my line of work and my company is the largest outsource provider. We won’t touch places that have unions in place. We will get a contract with a company for every site other than the unionized ones. Those places continue being ran by the company, which is inefficient, and their pay stays stagnant. The places we take over usually get nicer work conditions, better pay, and better hours. We do that so the employee is happy on their own and never desires to have unions. 

Yes, there are places that could benefit dramatically but I don’t work somewhere like that. 

Edit: Downvotes for this comment. Really? I’ve had comments with positive upvotes that should have landed me on a watch list. You people are either inexperienced or blinded by your own egos.

Each object in orbit has it's own orbit. Something closer to the parent body would orbit faster than something further away. It's possible the Clooney or Bullocks orbit was ""faster"" relative to the other and would result in one of them having an acceleration away from the other.

That's one of the reasons why there is 'microgravity' in a space station. You're on one side, following your orbit while every piece of the station thats is not at your exact location is following it's own orbit.

You learned a word, but you don't know what it means.

&gt; NASA's research reuse isn't ""supposed"", it's actual reuse. 

How many launches does the Ares rocket family have? 0. Because it wasn't reused and a totally new rocket family is being adopted for it. They don't even use the name engines (RS-68B was fully canceled and the SLS will use the RL10 variants).


&gt; And, again, you're comparing NASA's entire budget for everything to the cost of one destroyer project. 

We are comparing the primary project of an entire organisation to a single project we singled out due to it being a failure. NASA's failure (political or not) resulted in a total lack of US capability for manned flight. The failure of the DDG1000 project resulted in money waste and building more Arleigh Burke destroyers rather than any noticeable damage being done to US naval capabilities.


&gt; Even if NASA chucked half of all their money into a fire

That is not far from the truth for the 2000-2010 timeframe.

&gt; it would still waste less money than a single destroyer project.

No, it is actually comparable. That is the whole point. Even more damming for NASA (and the political side of it) is that it wasted a far larger percentage of its budget than the Navy did.


tl;dr NASA faces the same problems as the DoD. It's current positive situation is mostly based on further increasing R&amp;D out-sourcing and taking on multiple independent contractors."

Exactly. 

my solution is simple, first the 2 senators per state rule is dumb. I know the Constitution was handed down by God almighty on gold plated tablets but we need to overhaul this. 100 total state senators some states get 1 like Rhode Island, North Dakota, some states get 2 like Texas California. It's not perfect but there no reason Wyoming should have the same number of state senators as California.

&gt;
&gt; Economy

Is crumbling. Hell, even the Australian dollar reached parity for a while there. And to top it all off? It's propped up by China, who could wipe you out in a heartbeat if they decided it was in their best interest.

Not to mention half your businesses and property are probably already owned by them.

&gt; Sports

How are you measuring this exactly? The highest paid athletes in the world have traditionally been Football (soccer) players - that is to say, English/European.

Olympics? You send more athletes than any other country, so I'd expect you to get more medals, and yet China still manages to top you on occasion, as they're fielding a similarly sized athletic team.

&gt; Military

Yay - you win this one... You're better at blowing people up and killing than any other country. Yay. You're so good at it, you've even started doing it in your own streets and schools!

&gt; Technology

You're great at buying / acquiring tech developed elsewhere, absolutely. Based primarily on your first point, ""economy"", which we've established is already on shaky grounds. I wouldn't pretend like you're ""the best"" at it by any stretch. Most countries in Europe have better internet connectivity than most of your country. Transport systems are easily rivaled by dozens of countries, especially Japan, China, Singapore, France, Germany and England. Health tech is more readily available to citizens in pretty much any other part of the world. You might have the big shiny machine, it's too bad no-one can actually afford to use it. We've got the last generation model, and it services 100 patients a day.

&gt; Innovation

I'm sorry, but I just can't even entertain this one. Innovation is happening *everywhere*. There's no easy way to *measure* this, but I'd confidently say that the innovation done in the US is easily rivaled by that done in China (purely due to scale). Go look up the innovations supporting China's 5-year-plan some time. As for the impact of individual innovations themselves - again, China's throwing far more money into energy R&amp;D than America - and I'd easily say that's one of the highest-impact fields out there. Europe's also giving it a go, but whoever breaks Fusion first, is going to be the real next world superpower, and the way things are going, it's not looking likely that it's going to be the US of A.

&gt; Freedom kinda

Nope. US scores 86. Sweden is at 100. Canada at 99, Australia at 98 .... yeah, you're way down the list buddy. Your President thinks that Putin is a top-bloke, puts out propaganda films for Kim Jong Un, and sides with the Saudi's as opposed to those troublesome Canadians to your north. Don't even go there.

So, as much as this looks like I'm loving on China - to be honest, they're moving very aggressively to replace you as the next world superpower. I don't particularly feel like learning Chinese, but if you guys all keep it up with Trump, Brexit, etc I really don't see any other conclusion."

I can assume you have some larger dream for a job that you are working towards which is good. The point im making is that there is only so much room at the starting line and unless you run forward people are gonna be stuck behind you, or at 0 im from a very poor family. Only reason i was able to even go away to college was because my dad was on disability and i got like 15k in a lumpsum from the government as child benefits. That put me at like step 3 now im back at step 1 because college is expensive but i dont plan on staying here for 20 years only getting $12 an hour. I eventually want to have the skill and knowledge to make six figures etc. And arbitrarily raising low skilled wages doesnt make the economy better.

&gt; The prosecutor in Turin said ‘major irregularities’ were found following tests on products labelled as extra virgin olive oil taken from supermarket shelves in Italy.

&gt;Many of these brands are exported around the world, including Britain, raising suspicions that products on the shelves in this country are fake.

&gt; Seven companies are under investigation, including Carapelli, Santa Sabina, Bertolli, Coricelli, Sasso, Primadonna, which is packaged for Lidl, and Antica Badia.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3314223/Top-Italian-brands-investigation-passing-ordinary-olive-oil-extra-virgin-disastrous-harvest.html

I know a lot of people hate the daily mail, but I’m just using it to show that brands like Bertolli are sold in the U.K.  Bertolli is one of the biggest olive oil counterfeiters out there. Here’s why that’s relevant. 

&gt; The brands that failed to meet the extra virgin olive oil standards, according to this study: Bertolli, Carapelli, Colavita, Star, Pompeian. 

In fact Olive oil from Italy is almost certainly adulterated whereas the best bet on real unadulterated olive oil is from California or Australia. 

&gt; You might raise your eyebrows at the conclusion that Australian and California extra virgin olive oils are purer than most Italian olive oils, since the research was partially funded by the California Olive Ranch and the California Olive Oil Council and has ties with the Australian Olive Association. However, we've seen before that olive oil simply bottled in Italy might not be the real thing. You can see the detailed analyses from UC Davis in this PDF.

16015,"Oh man, I've done this twice - once in high school and once in college.  Probably not quite what you're after since these were shitty jobs while in school, but whatever.

High school one was at a fast-casual burger place.  One thing I was responsible for was cleaning the entire dining room at closing. Usually took about an hour, and since we closed at 11pm, I would be lucky to get out before midnight.  One night my girlfriend and one of our mutual friends came in about 10:45 to grab a bite and (I thought) hang out with me while I closed.  Instead, while I was doing other shitty parts of the job (cleaning the prep kitchen), they filled about 100 of those little paper condiment cups with ketchup and ranch and mustard and nacho cheese and put them upside down on Every. Single. Fucking. Table.  Which meant instead of a spray and wipe down, I (would have) had to seriously clean each table.  Instead I clocked out and left and never went back.  Had a friend that also worked there pick up my last check and don't think I've ever been back to that place since.

College one I was a host at Italian restaurant.  I was scheduled to work at 7pm, but ended up getting tickets to Dave Matthews Band at the Gorge around noon, for that night.  Since we had an 8 hour drive to make it in time for the show I called them from the road asking for time off and they said no.  So I said, okay bye.  No regrets.

Edit: You're not wrong, these were douche moves, and while I'm tempted to edit in more context for these, it'd really just be to make myself look better.  Which I shouldn't because I was a dick.

But actually one story is pretty funny, so I'll share it.  One of my best friends, like a brother to me to this day, also worked at the burger place and was also closing the same night.  When I clocked out and left it meant he had to clean the dining room too, which is why I didn't feel as bad as I otherwise would have.  I tried to call him later on, probably about 12:30am, but he didn't pick up so figured he had closed and crashed.  But what actually happened is one of the front of house girls, who was incredibly hot, felt bad that my friend would have to close for me and stayed and helped him out.  Afterwards she invited him back to her place (she was a few years older and out of high school) where they drank and smoked and ended up banging.  So in a round about way, I got my friend laid by being a piece of shit.  "

so, imo, sure, near future, it's not like a few reactors will make the existing problem much worse. but in the long run we should avoid it. And yes, that may cost a bit of money.

As for people who don't want children well thats simply a choice is it not? Humans can make complex choices that sometimes seem contrary to nature like suicide. Roughly 7 billion humans. That's alot of individuals making alot of choices all those are influenced by the psychology of those individuals which in turn is influenced by the people aroud them (mostly family,relatives and friends) and their own unique life experiences. obviously there is going to be people who don't want children or don't want to have sex with anyone or want to have sex with individuals of the same gender. You are currently making one such choice now. But the choices and individual of  a particular species makes does not change the nature of that species. You cannot simply disregard millions of years of evolution which has shaped said species. Humans are social. The only reason you are a functioning individual now with all values and beleifs is because of the social enviroments you were exposed to in your development. Most self disgnosed introverts dont want to socialize is because is they have not done it often or have had bad experiences with it. Sorry to break it to you. Your not different from the majority of humanity. You just have bad social skills.

Off in the distance I could see a light. A great red flame, bifurcated by some unknown geometry. There was a very diffuse, scattered reflection across the sweat and piss the locals pass off as a sea. The crew had been going hard for a long while, the mood would best be described as stoic gloom. I was filled with terror, my mind running through myriad explanations each more damning than the last. It felt like ages passed, transfixed by this sight. At some point I realized I was still alive, and still miserable. In an instant the character of this unsettling vista changed, and its true nature was made known to me. We had made a wrong turn, drifted out of Hell and wound up off the coast of Mordor. It was Barad Dur I stared at, and Sauron who stared back. One evil, imperialist warlord sizing up another. As a professional courtesy we each left the other to his business.

EARNING that by actually becoming a special, interesting person, would take a LOT more effort, like by inventing or accomplishing or learning something, or working on the inner self, volunteering for some cause... the possibilities are endless. But it's just so EASY to buy a flight to Spain and feel proud of you same old shallow, ignorant, lifewaster self. And not only can you feel groundlessly proud, others will often praise you for your purchase as well. Bonus points if you add on some challenge like you went climbing a mountain, hitching, or proselytizing while you were on your trip. You can hear people say those words you never would have otherwise: ""Wow, that's so interesting!""         
I have heard sooooo many of these tools argue that the only way to broaden the mind is to experience other cultures. Which sounds legit on the surface. But then it turns out none of them had read any writing on any other cultures, no modern journalism or classic literature. Never watched any foreign movies or listened to foreign musicians. Never ate in any local ethnic restaurants or attended local multiculturalism festivals. Never volunteered to help new immigrants settle in. One ""I'm so cool because I flew to Paris"" doof was a coworker, and we had an international crew, but he didn't hang out with any of the foreigners. He absolutely, 100% was not interested in exploring other cultures.     
   
There is another kind of course, like an entomologist who goes to a certain place to study a certain bug, like, of course that's motivated by a desire to further science and that's great.     
  
Oh and one other kind comes to mind. I knew an Aspie (undiagnosed back then in the late 80's, but with modern awareness it's obvious that was his issue) who was always having friction because of his low social skills, poor ability to read others etc, while at home. He traveled a lot AND tried to hang out with foreigners and immigrants all he could at home too, and I was always pretty sure that was because with people from other cultures, if he misunderstood a situation or statement, or did something odd, all the usual stuff that gets Autistics bullied within their own culture, it would get written off as due to the cultural difference, not him personally being weird or rude. He could escape being treated like shit, which I dunno... It's sad he had to do that, but understandable, and I guess I'm glad he found a way to feel better about himself. Luckily modern Autistics can get that sweet ""not a freak"" feeling a lot more easily (I'm in tons of Autistic online forums for instance) so this reason is likely growing much less common as time goes on.

16351,"Intaking copious amounts of water depletes important minerals in the body like sodium, potassium and magnesium. Flushing important electrolytes out that are needed for your body to actually retain the water you are drinking. But instead people keep drinking more because of constant thirst because you are not retaining the water you intake because you cannot, because of your constant flushing of minerals.

What happens when you are flushing out potassium? You are lowering aldosterone the important glucocorticoid hormone needed to retain water and sodium for one. Also potassium is the key mineral in muscle strength and the pump in the gym. 

Has your pump faded or strength has just stood still for awhile? Do you get lightheaded easily in the summer? Do you often get cold hands and feet?

When drinking too much water, you are also flushing out that important sodium/salt you are intaking. Which is proven to burn fat and increase insulin sensitivity alone, aka more fat loss more muscle gains from salt.

Drinking excess water is lowering metabolism in more then one ways, and even testosterone levels by depleting potassium. It is proven fact that low potassium leads to low testosterone levels and raising potassium fix's this. On top of fact most do not even get RDA amounts potassium alone on average the people I encounter.

""When there is adequate sodium in the extracellular fluid, the continuous inward movement of sodium ions into the resting cell activates an enzyme, sodium-potassium ATPase, causing ATP to break down into ADP and phosphate, which stimulates the consumption of fuel and oxygen to maintain an adequate level of ATP. Increasing the concentration of sodium increases the energy consumption and carbon dioxide production of the cell. The sodium, by increasing carbon dioxide production, protects against the excitatory, toxic effects of the intracellular calcium."" Of course do not forget ruining your metabolic rate with excess water ruins the thyroids effect on stimulating protein synsthesis for muscular gains, so whether it is trying to gain size or lose fat, follow some weird calculation from a website a coach or whatever is likely going to do more harm then good for what your body really needs and is asking for.

Proper hydration involves adequate nutrients, sodium to attract the water potassium to retain both water and sodium. Getting in proper nutrients to actually utilize and retain water to achieve proper hydration is the goal everyone should be after. And you will not get this by not listening to your body and going off some formula having you constantly thirsty drinking 4-6 liters a day constantly urinating going in a vicious circle ignoring your metabolic rate/thyroid function and mineral state in the body. Everyone has different mineral stores in the body and everyone has different metabolic rate."

Colossal squid cannot leave the water without their mantles collapsing.  They have no bony skeleton or even significant musculature to support them without the bouyancy afforded by water.

Thus, if accounts of Kraken attacks are accurate, and kraken were able to at least partially pull themselves out of the water or even completely out of the water, colossal squid could *not* be kraken, because colossal squid can't do that.  "

What they have are new things that they believe have a higher priority than human communication. And they also have more things distracting them. I've been a schoolteacher and a lawyer. My jobs are busy. But even by the late 1990's I still got my news by sitting at my kitchen table on Sunday and reading five thick newspapers. Now people are always distracted by constantly changing information. And its far more bullshit and useless crap they see now. But its happening in real time. And people are much more invested in it. At night these days when I am not on Reddit I'm reading a book much like I did for entertainment decades ago. And if the phone rings and its my daughter I easily pick it up. On the other hand, my wife, who is much younger than I is transfixed by Facebook all the time and would be much less apt to interrupt her facebook perusal than I am to put a bookmark in my novel. So its not a matter of busier its a matter of more distractions that are all consuming. Or it could be all BS from a guy in his late 60s.

Why don't you pay her a livable wage for one job? You're demanding that other people pay the costs for something you deem a necessity, while you could also do it yourself. 

&gt;She can work less and bring in the same amount. Feed her kids *and* spend time with them. Or maybe start going to trade school at night to learn a trade and work towards a better career. Everyone's quality of life is instantly better and you're now increasing the chance that those kids will have success and become more productive members of society. 

And while we're at it ""we"" can also give her a new home and a nice car! After all, money just falls out of the sky and nobody will have to pay those extra costs, right?"

Hmmmm I beg to differ as it has helped me multiple times.

Not audio. I know the law pretty well.

""Federal law permits recording telephone calls and in-person conversations with the consent of at least one of the parties. See 18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(d). This is called a ""one-party consent"" law. Under a one-party consent law, you can record a phone call or conversation so long as you are a party to the conversation.""

It is an at will state, and I never said they did need a reason. It's a shitty thing to do so I said fuck their loophole and used my own.

&gt; How is 10% an acceptable value for poor people for their medical care, but not for wealthier people?

On average wealthy people generally pay around 7-8%. Same as poor people. Middle class pay around 9-10% of their income. Sure I agree let’s make it either even across the board or progressive, but again not some kind of crazy broken system that you claim

16623,"You are correct.

The polarization has been churning out of sight like a duck on the water since the rise of the internet and cable news, but people were still generally respectful of one another.  Trump came along and dragged the decorum down to the gutter.   You could see it unfold in the Republican primary debates.  A dozen or so contenders trying to be measured and professional alongside Trump, who just acted like an ignorant ass, had virtually no depth towards any policy position(which he constantly flip-flops on if it doesn't involve Russia or non-white people), and bullied the crap out of the traditional politicians.  Eventually, the rest of the party joined him because they had to in order to survive.

Since his election, Democrats have realized that there is no reason to play towards centrists with such a polarizing blowhard in office, so you are seeing louder and less respectful(since it is all Trump responds to) voices coming from the left.  Trump has drastically altered political discourse in this country and while I have hope we can raise the level of decorum once he goes away, the polarization won't change until we can figure out a way to pierce the bubbles that have formed around the dumbest members of each party.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

First, most of that money doesn't create jobs.  The lion's share goes to executive compensation and shareholders of defense corporations.   Second, the government could have employed more scientists and engineers for the same amount of money by expanding NASA's budget or by expanding the budget of any number of government agencies that do useful work.

Remember, money spent on tools of war is *only good for war*.  A warship can't give us more fuel-efficient cars.  A new fighter jet can't give us safer aircraft.  The technology is simply not really applicable to civilian use.  You might find an exception here or there, but there's no ignoring the fact that NASA has done more for civilian advancement than the military ever has.  NASA has given us safer aircraft, the ability to monitor weather systems (using weather satellites), more fuel-efficient aircraft engines, and so on.
