1,So you don't stand by your beliefs if there's money to be made?
2,Or don't get a puppy. That's the problem you had. You wanted a puppy to raise and oogle. How many of those raffle losers got another dog there? I'd wager not many. How many older dogs are left there to die? You are exactly the entitled American that the person above you is talking about. 
3,Nigeria
4,I see you post to a certain subreddit and therefor your opinion doesn’t matter. Stupid prumpthf supporter
5,Religious people have the moral high ground?Absurd. Cunt. 
6,Lmao.  Instruct LE to do what now?  Bro they will shoot if the suicidal person goes for a suicide by cop.  Telling them what to do will have the same effect as telling the tide not to come in.  You think they are just going to sit there when a suicidal person comes at them with a knife because the 911 caller told them not to shoot?  
7,"I predicted the ending, because that ending is normal for today's movies, That movie was great but have seen couple of similar incidents in movies and TV shows I figured that out easily.

Edit- Hey I hate myself already for predicting don't hate me more by down voting, I was like what worse can he do, then the thought came to my mind &gt;! I'd kill his wife if I was making the movie to make it dark, turns out that's what happens!&lt; and I myself kinda ruined the movie. "
8,"I want social consequences for this, you racist."

10,The fuck 
11,So you are saying it’s a choice? 
12,"Well, you tried"
13,I laugh at everything. If you can't laugh at a rape joke then the rapists win. 
14,They let anyone take that role nowadays 
15,this is why programmers have no friends
16,"If Russia gave us Trump, then thank you Russia. Russian people are awesome and their women beautiful by the way."
17,"You done got whooshed. 

Edit: I know they’re making a joke I thought the poster above them was too you can stop with all the downvotes. I get it I’m an idiot. "
18,"No gore, no porn, no death, its just weird looking teeth. "
19,"I guess, I just don’t find them amusing. I’m not trans myself but It could never get a chuckle outta me. 

Edit: I’m being downvoted bc I don’t find it funny? Oh the humanity :’( "
20,The previous government of France is literally called the socialist party. Europe is socialist. Americans seem to use the word differently from everyone else. 
21,Well I was *trying* to have a conversation with someone who apparently didn't know what a carbohydrate is. 
22,r/thanosdidnothingwrong
23,"It's been a while since I've tried researching, but I'm pretty sure they have ties. This is mostly referring to the greater problem of powerful politicians, lawmakers, and former/current white house staff being associated with human trafficking."
24,Testing by blood is fairly inaccurate.  Seeing lesions and culturing an open one is more so.  
25,[deleted]
26,I was with you until that last paragraph. You just seem kinda hateful tbh. 
27,"He could put it next to his ""Biggest Douche in the Universe"" award."
28,The irony is deafening
29,[deleted]
30,Build the wall. Basically keep being a badass making America great. 
31,"Or, OR, crazy idea here — you can just use a new towel every time. Boggles my mind that everyone doesn't, honestly. Once you've used a towel, it's not clean — period."
32,Yup. Google it. Im not your finance professor. If you can’t understand the true cost of workflows my reply won’t help you. 
33,"I happen to enjoy not slathering myself in dead skin, bacteria, and mildew after every shower."
34,"You're proving the point of ""us against them"" policy that's just shitty and proves you're a shitty human being yourself  edit: I see a lot of people not being able to see the fucking analogy of the previous comment and mine. If you call a supporter of person A a garbage human being be prepared to be called a garbage human being for defining others based on a person they voted for. Jesus the irony is strong. It's politics - you support someone's decisions, not necessarily their life choices - at least that's what it is to most people. "

36,This
37,Wow. That's insanity. Why do you think teachers are such radical activists? We've all seen the clips on YouTube of the indoctrination. I've always wondered why
38,Maybe you should teach girls not to send nudes in the first place rather than punishing all the boys for what a few did. I'm glad you don't work there anymore. You sound like one of the counselors that everyone hated when I was young
39,fucK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOTHING FUKING WRONG WITH ME
40,"Maybe, but are plenty disturbing. But its very different a man being raped by other men and a woman being raped by other men. Not more or less, but different. "
41,"Dude you're way too wound up. You said she has ""serious issues"" based on her hygiene habits. Since when do people get shamed for wanting to be cleaner? You know who has serious issues about wanting to be clean? I do. I'm severely ocd about how I clean myself and it's a living hell, so just fuck off you fucking condescending dick."
42,"Dude I'd take Nixon or even Reagan at this point. At least they were competent and didn't make asses of themselves every time they opened their mouths. A dog turd in a shoebox would be a better leader than Trump. Hell just an empty seat would probably be better than what we have now. But if you voted for Trump, I have 0 animosity towards you. That's democracy, you can vote for whoever you want even if they're an idiot or just an ass in general."
43,They also have 6 month waiting periods
44,Everyone's a racist to an unimaginative child with little life experience.

46,"Did you seriously think you were the only one to feel that effect of a drink drunk by hundreds of millions just because no one told you?

I bet you didn't tell anyone else ejther, because no one asks."

48,"That's the opposite of that subreddit, don't bring in your own politics into a fun thread."

50,"Yeah, Sweden kinda went from best looking European country to 'de fuq happend'"
51,"Careful , you are reaching Gnosticism and that is dangerous ."
52,"Works for one of my friends who's originally from LA. Worked for one of my other friends pretending to be from LA. Probably helped that he's relatively good looking though.

Also, you're a cunt. :) Just felt like saying it."

54,say it with me - traps aren't gay
55,"Note that ~~state capitals~~ major cities (jeez, yall happy now?) are generally the worst our country has to offer. I think SF is 2nd on the homeless number. It's not great."
56,1
57,I smell fragile masculinity sweaty... masculinity bad numale good 
58,"That's... literally how you're supposed to do a wedding. Not really a ""nice touch"" so much as ""how everyone does it all the time unless they're actively trying to be different"""
59,white people. 
60,It's not our fault you're scared of government regulation.

62,"&gt; This remembered me of one day

It *reminded* you of one day."

64,Well i have read others here describe is as darkness. And silence. That was my experience as well. Have u experienced that elbow thing? Hostilebanon?
65,"Modern role? The Queen and her family are still very involved in politics and veto legislation more than you realize (it isn't disclosed publicly when they do it, they can basically veto before a piece of legislation even goes up for debate)."
66,NASA in general is a shitshow right now. [Check this out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pva3kUU7TS4) Eye opening video for me.
67,"Don't want to insult you or something, but you've to be really, really ugly to get turned down for a date.

Only really hard downturn for me was always fat (not overweight, I mean obese) / double chin. Or maybe really a deformed face like you had bad accident."
68,"Don't America not have unions though, probably why the dude is complaining."
69,"Coding isn’t difficult, a monkey can do it.

Naming fluff words won’t make you any more credible. Also, most developers don’t use algorithms or touch big O. 

P.S. I’m purposefully being super sassy here. No one simply *does* HTML+CSS anymore. Its some framework integrated template + preprocessor(mainly sass). Also, HTML+CSS is difficult as fuck so I have no idea what you’re saying."
70,Why do you assume it’s a man?
71,So the trans person didn't get the job and you're triggered now?
72,Pretty much anything the POTUS does. 
73,"I would say that's unfair to introverts who can't control how their social anxiety manifests. Doesn't make them predators. If someone is a bad culture fit that's one thing, but that shouldn't be the basis of a character judgement. 

How does your method account for unconscious biases around age, weight or race?"

75,"Not on a national economy level.  Can't happen.  Make it less profitable to do something and less of it will be done.  You going to 'bargain' for all doctors to charge less?  You will end up with fewer, less capable doctors then.  High ability people will enter other fields instead.  

Going to make pharma R&amp;D less profitable?  Drug companies will do less of it then.  They'll spend their money on other things instead, *more profitable* things.

You can only bargain on a micro level, because a business only has to maintain an average revenue.  Low for one can be made up on others.  On a national economy level there's no way to make up the slack.  "
76,"I had to look this guy up.  Saw his face, I still don't know who the fuck this guy is.  Is he like the 123 kid of this new generation of wrestlers?"
77,You forgot the 64oz (1.8927059 L) diet Coke
78,We are already there...
79,Responses to my comments are only allowed between 9 and 5. Reported.
80,Oh I'll add another one: People were not as materialistic and narcissistic back in the day either.

83,I don't see the connection.
84,"Yes and no, depending how you count them. Do you count suicides, do you count respiratory diseases that are worsened by vehicle emissions? It's a similar potential for danger, is what I'm trying to say."
85,"I don't know... I mean. Honestly, some of these rules make sense to somebody who has a child who gets crumbs literally everywhere anytime he eats something crumby.

He will take four crackers and bite into all four of them stacked up. Creating this monstrosity of crumbs on the floor any time he eats crackers. He also bites small, bites small, bites small, bites small, then puts the whole palm of crumbs into his mouth.

It's gotten to the point that if he sits in the living room eating crackers, or pringles, or whatever, there will be a huge pile of crumbs on the chair, floor, leading to the kitchen. I've actually screamed at him about it a few times because it drives be batshit insane. Now I tell him he has to eat one cracker at a time, and he's more careful about not leaving a pile of crumbs in the living room.

And I mean I say goodnight to my son every night and good morning to him every morning. I do consider it rude if he doesn't say it back.

Lastly, my son used to like taking an entire spoonful of whatever he was eating and shove it in his mouth. To the point that I seriously worried about him choking because his cheeks were literally puffed out with food in his mouth. So I had to continually tell him to take smaller bites and not overfill his mouth.

I wonder if I'm going to be on a Reddit post one day when my son is bitching about how crazy I was when he was a child."
86,That makes it ok.
87,How is it clever?
