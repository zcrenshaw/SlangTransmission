6,"And it's totally played for laughs, with the school talking about what a loser the guy is, not at all about how the girl's privacy was invaded. She doesn't appear bothered by it in the least and continues for two more movies with her plan to start a sexual relationship with a nerdy American loser, because that's what all foreign girls want.

Those movies came out when I was in college, and I recall laughing at them. I am ashamed. "
7,"There is nothing wrong with it, but it's pure cheese.  You could slap it on a slice of bread and turn it into a grilled cheese sandwich.

8,"Life’s a learning curve and unfortunately we all have some guilty memories to look back on. Sucks but such is life and things come to pass.

9,"I saw some videos of that in youtube. Holy shi t that's so disrespectful.

14,"That is fucking fantastic, and also a reason why there are places where drug dealers get more respect than police. Either one might shoot you if they think you really deserve it, so you go with whoever gives more back to the people."
15,That movie works if you go into it assuming it's set in the Star Wars universe (a couple galaxies over) and they're all Jedi. Charlie taught them to use the force and it's never mentioned. 
16,"In WWII, troops found there to be a shortage of adult beverages  at the frontlines.  With no great way of transporting beer to them. The British RAF had an idea to fill their spare fuel tanks with beer and drop them off at the frontlines.  This was a great way to transport large quantities of brew (around 90 gallons per flight) but the altitude also kept the beer cool en route! "
17,"You are either malicious or extremely ignorant. 

I'm not going to go into deep historical disscusion with you because something tells me it'd be pointless, but humour me this: 

Why would Serbia, a tiny nation that just fought 2 wars to get rid of ottomans, militarily and economically depleted, want to poke the biggest bear at it's doors? There was no chance of winning the war even if it's allies France and Russia stepped in. It was basically assured destruction of Serbia. 

Serbia lost anywhere from 16% to 27% of it's entire population in ww1 (for example US lost 0.13%). 

The assassination was done by Bosnian organization, as it's name even says, made up of Serbs, Croats and muslims who had pan-slavic ideology. 

It was supported by part of Serbia's military intelligence officers core (the leader of which was executed by Serbian court for his role in the assassination AFTER it was clear Serbia will be on winning side of ww1, because he was deemed to have in part caused such horrific loses to Serbia). 

Serbian goverment did NOT want a war with severly stronger opponent (Austria-Hungary) at that time because it was clear it had no chance of winning. It did everything it could to prevent it. 

As much as I dislike it, for people reading this, Wikipedia is your friend, read about this point of time in history and draw your own conclusions. Kafkamazov couldn't be more wrong or biased."

20,"Those who act out the ""sensual stuff"" that you like, work under the exact same appalling conditions as those, who act out the ""rough stuff"". People have different fantasies, the industy doesn't care, the same actors/actresses all work under the same directives and none have better conditions than others. You are not protecting anybody by outlawing specific types of ""stuff"".

Cleaning up the industry is a major task, and probably not even possible, but declaring that some ""stuff"" worse than other is not helping anybody."
21,Definitely play Tales. That is a highmark in story telling from telltale. 
22,"I think people just enjoy having or losing control. It's about power.

Just like any other kink, if it doesn't affect anyone, it's fine to have it, and you shouldn't be shamed for it. that would only lead to bad things."
23,"That is really good to hear. I've been clean for about 4 years and I remember American friends struggling to get or afford it.

It is free here in the UK. It makes staying clean so easy because there are no withdrawals while on it and also no high so you return to normal. Getting off it is awful though I was in withdrawal for weeks even after tapering down."
24,That's a whole new level of pettiness. What kind of guy sees a woman holding a door open and gets annoyed? Humans are odd creatures.
25,"To clear this up a bit, the Remastered Star Wars films were fine. They just cleaned up the original FX without adding or changing anything. What OP is referring to is the Special Editions where they added and replaced shots with late 90's CGI. Those were repeatedly updated over the years and are an abomination."

72,"The Nazi plan for Eastern Europe involved mass extermination of Slavs on an enormous scale. “Resettlement” of the Jews was just the first stage in the plans for Europe. Slavs were also considered a “negative cultural influence”. As a result, their numbers would be reduced by exterminating large fractions of the population, and the rest would ideally be the most “Aryan”, and could later be “Germanized”. In Poland, 85% of the population was going to be exterminated. Same in Lithuania. In Russia at least 50%. Same in Estonia and Latvia. In Ukraine 65%. In Belarus 75%. That is not including the populations planned to be enslaved. Or the population planned to be literally dumped in Siberia. Or the populations that were planned to have lower status than those of German “Aryan” culture, and be half citizens. The Soviets were, of course, a terrible dictatorship. But everyone can realize that the Nazis were going to be many times worse if they had won. The only reason the extermination toll of the Nazi isn’t in the dozens of millions is because they lost the war, and literally had to stop. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost)"

79,"The Imjin Wars themselves are really intresting.

The diplomats from Korea and Japan would constantly doctor documents from Hideyoshi and the Korean King. This stalled the war since no one knew what was going on.

When the Japanese arrived the Court promised General Yi Il the finest graduates. Expecting military academy grads, he found a bunch of scholars assembled. General Shin Rip was promised the Northern Iron calvary that was stationed at the border, but got inexperienced Seoul Calvary instead. A Korean officer deserted and led a raid that killed a Japanese general so the Joseon Court had him executed for desertion, before deciding to pardon and promote him. The messenger arrived right after he got beheaded.

Also a conman persuaded the Ming Emperor and he had a lot of commercial, diplomatic, and military experience against the Japanese and do was a appointed as the Ming representative to Koreans and the Japanese. He also doctored communications so fighting had to stop since no one knew what was going on"

83,"Most Roman slaves had really shitty lives, just like their southern US counterparts. Forced to work on big farms (latifundia) until death claimed them, only to be replaced by another human being acquired cheaply. 

Some slaves had better positions serving at houses and being an ancient version of a butler.

Select few slaves were very educated and put in managerial roles, either by private families or composing the bureaucratic apparatus of post-Augustian empire.

But do not idealize the Roman slavery. By far most of it was as awful as you would imagine. Slave revolts happened often.

The position of slaves improved as the Roman empire stopped expanding as the territorial expansion means a constant influx of slaves, keeping the price down.

Killing a slave was declared homicide only quite late, during Antoninus Pius in 2nd century AD. "

I even explained to him that I was really a guy and it was a joke that (now) was not funny. He either didn't believe me or didn't care. I blocked him. My family eventually stopped subscribing to AOL, but I kept the screen name when I used AOL Instant Messenger. Every few years I'd go through my block list and remove people I didn't think would be an issue. That guy though, I kept him on my block list for more than a decade before taking him off the list. And to be totally honest, I was just a little worried that he'd see that I was back online and would ask me to suck his dick again.

153,"I have two: 

• My mom had a husband between her first husband and my dad (who she’s been married to for 23 years). I found out by those online white pages with some random dude’s name was listed as someone who was a possible relation. I mentioned it to my parents in passing saying it was super weird and they agreed but didn’t say anything else. 

The look on my mom’s face bugged me, though. 

I looked up court records from then county she lived in at the time and found divorce papers. 

She admitted it later, saying she felt ashamed (for various reasons with her ex). Her first husband was 10 years older than her and ended up dying while in prison for various things. I never judged her though and she has her right to keep secrets; my dad knew, and that’s what mattered. I was just nosy and felt betrayed at the time. 

• Speaking of how long my parents were married, until last year, I thought my parents were married a year more than I was old (so they would’ve been married 24 years not 23, since I’m 23). Apparently they got married two months before I was born. 

My parents are super against premarital sex and went off on me when they found out I wasn’t a virgin (called themselves failures as parents, etc.), so this one hurt way more because it felt really hypocritical. 

Both of my parents got married at 18 to previous spouses and were parents by 19, *and* they were pregnant when they weren’t married (I wasn’t planned). 

On the bright side, I finally got to see my parents’ wedding photos. My mom looked so beautiful. "

Also can’t help but notice anytime anyone says this to me in real life I’ve asked them when they suffered from depression.

163,"It’s not the best movie ever, but it isn’t as bad as everyone makes it out to be on Reddit. Sure it’s a borrowed plot that’s been used before but it’s far from the first movie to reuse another movies plot.

The world they created with Pandora is awesome and even if it’s Pocahontas 2.0 it’s still a cool twist with it being on an alien planet. And it helps that the planet is visually stunning. Plus there’s a lot more going on outside the movie that you don’t really get to see unless you see the extended editions.

Overall it’s not a horrible movie, far from it really. I just think people expect to much of it just because it did so well in theaters.

166,"Despite the terrible subject matter, it is still known as a major breakthrough in cinematography. It was the first time many different types of shots were seen that became common storytelling tools. Things like fading in and out, altering the iris or changing focus on a shot, still shots, wide establishing landscape shots, and a ton more. "
167,"This is the kind of anti-consumer bullshit big companies want people to think as part of their ongoing war against class actions.

Yes, in the short term, the primary beneficiary of a class action suit is often the lawyers (and full disclosure, I am a lawyer). But that's because the amount at stake in an individual case in a class action is often not worth the cost of pursuing litigation for the claimant or attorney.

Without class actions, companies can get away with nickel and dime violations on large groups of people that in aggregate are a huge benefit for them. Why not do something unethical if it is going to make you millions of dollars, but the negative impact to your victims is so minor that you know it isn't worth the cost of them suing you over?

The threat of class actions is the only defense against this kind of behavior, and class actions are the only way to obtain any kind of compensation for the victims. The continued erosion of consumer rights to class actions is a *very* bad thing, and people spewing garbage opinions like ""class actions only help the lawyers"" is part of the problem.

Also, most of the above is only true of typical class action cases, like ""oh they advertise 16 oz of peanut butter but they cut it down to 15.5 and kept the same price to make more money"" kind of class action. Not true of a situation where women were being sexually harassed, raped, pimped, assaulted, and stolen from by their employer. That company should be torn to pieces."

170,"That's still basic stuff. A lot of music theory classes involve analyzing baroque counterpoint, writing baroque-style counterpoint, types of cadences and when it's appropriate to use them. 

You have to be able to look at a chord, identify the tonic, and then identify chords within that key in the piece of music. There's different musical forms to study, chromaticism, suspensions, appoggiaturas, and rules for voice-leading. Then there's fun predominant chords like the augmented sixth and neapolitan chords.

Music theory is as broad a subject as any. Being educated in music theory also changes how one listens to music. After I took music theory classes, I was able to identify mistakes in music that I would not have otherwise noticed. Things like the uses of parallel 4ths/5ths or direct octaves occur much more often than I realized before, and I miss the days where I was ignorant of the rules of voice leading. 

Overall, I would not recommend it to anyone who isn't truly interested in it. It generally has a devilishly difficult learning curve for those new to musical analysis."

That's a direct criticism, obviously that person doesn't think it's gross, and tbh I don't think it's gross either, it's a natural bodily thing that turns the person on. No need to make them feel gross for having that interest.

2. Being aroused =\= wanting to fuck them... You do realize that getting aroused by someone who is attractive is kinda normal. If they had incestual relationship then maybe you could comment. Still rude to criticize someone for something they're obviously not open about and not exactly secure about.

3. Um... Are there more comments there? I saw your replies, obviously I'm not going to include 4 or 5 more links for that... Your replies don't justify your initial comment. All of them are sitting at negative votes for a reason.

There's nothing transphobic about it. Heterosexual males aren't attracted to trans folk nor to other men. The thought of being with a transgender person or another man is gross to them, because they're heterosexual. That isn't a phobia. It's reality."

I took her up on it and she told two of her friends. So over 2 quarters I had three girls blowing me in exchange for a ""pass"" grade without attending the class.

A few years ago, wife (now ex) decided (without even bringing it up to me) that we were moving back to her hometown. Just up and took a job, found a place, told me I was coming... Initially I refused, but didn't want to leave my son.

After almost 2 years in her hometown, shit got so unbearable with her I just up and left. But I didn't really have anywhere to go, and still wanted to be near my son. So I found a place in this middle-of-nowhere town, had a job in the city but could hardly ever hang out with coworkers because I lived so far away.

After about a year of that, I quit the job I had because my pay was declining (heavily commission based) and I couldn't afford to live in my house anymore. Immediately after finding a new job, I was evicted from that house, and spent the next 2 months (April-June of this year) living in a shitty motel near my new job, and just lying to my colleagues about my living situation.

Now, I've finally got a new apartment... I adopted my ex's dog after finding out she was keeping him locked away in the basement... I recently got a raise at my new job... and my ex and I are finally signing the divorce papers this weekend. So, I'd like to think I've just about reached the end of the tunnel.

It's also going to incite violence - Armistice Day (11.11.18) is frequently mentioned as some sort of day of reckoning, and I fear we're going to see nationwide mass shootings as a result of this. Ironically that might be the final nail in the coffin of the western church.

Scams like this show us exactly why we should have been explaining the inherent dangers of the internet to our elderly parents and relatives. This just goes to show how easy it is to take advantage of the elderly and isolated, especially once their minds start to wander. The entire incident has made me genuinely question whether my parent is able to take care of themselves, which is a difficult thing to face given that we're in different countries. I blame myself for not being a better kid and protecting them from this:

Please, please help save our parents from this vicious cult.  I don't know what else to do other than share what I've found and beg my fellow redditors for help.

If I were to suggest a hashtag for this, it would be #SaveOurParents.

The best spell you could get from the scroll was Wish. I used a healing spell on him, and then somehow prevented the incarnation from attacking for 1 turn so my sorcerer could use the scroll and cast the spell. The sorcerer rolled a 100, used wish to kill the incarnation, we were all on our last limb and he saved our characters, and the DM has promised to take us to lunch if we somehow beat this lvl 1000 monster with all spells being played by the DM without losing a single character.

From Colonel Kanatzhan ""Kanat"" Alibekov ( known as Kenneth ""Ken"" Alibek since 1992 – is a former Soviet physician, microbiologist, and biological warfare (BW) expert. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the Soviet Army to become the First Deputy Director of Biopreparat, where he oversaw a vast program of BW facilities.) and his reference to the Soviet weaponization of the Marburg Virus a.k.a. ""Variant U""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Alibek

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_biological_weapons_program#Marburg_virus

""Dr. Ustinov was forty-four years old. Alibek recalls him as a fair-skinned man with light-brown hair, ethnically a Russian. He had a wife and children. Alibek thought of him as a good guy and a talented scientist, easy to talk with, receptive to new ideas. Ustinov had been doing basic military research on the Marburg virus, studying its potential as a weapon. The long-term goal was to see if it could be loaded into special biological warheads on the MIRV missiles that were aimed at the United States. (A MIRV has multiple warheads, which are directed at different targets.) At the time, the Soviet biological missile warheads were designed to be loaded with strategic/operational smallpox virus, Black Death, and anthrax. The Marburg virus had potential for weaponization, too. Marburg is a close cousin to the Ebola virus, and is extremely lethal. Dr. Ustinov had been wearing a spacesuit in a Level 4 hot lab, injecting guinea pigs with Marburg virus. He pricked himself in the finger with a needle, and it penetrated two layers of rubber gloves.

Nikolai Ustinov exited through an air lock and a chemical decon shower to Level 3, and used an emergency telephone to call his supervisor. The supervisor decided to put Ustinov into a biocontainment hospital, a twenty-bed unit with steel air-lock doors, like the doors of a submarine, where nurses and doctors wearing spacesuits could monitor him. He was not allowed to speak with his wife and children. Ustinov did not seem to be afraid of dying, but, separated from his family, he became deeply depressed.

On about the fourth day, Ustinov developed a headache, and his eyes turned red. Tiny hemorrhages were occurring in them. He requested a laboratory notebook, and he began writing a diary in it, every day. He was a scientist, and he was determined to explain how he was dying. What does it feel like to die of Marburg virus? What are the psychological effects? For a while, he maintained a small hope that he wouldn't die, but when his skin developed spontaneous bruises he understood what the future held. Dr. Sandakhchiev's cryptograms to Alibek were dry and factual, and didn't include the human details. Alibek would later learn that perhaps twice Ustinov had broken down and wept.

Alibek was frantic to get help to Ustinov. He begged the Ministry of Defense for a special immune serum, but bureaucratic delays prevented its arrival in Siberia until it was too late. When Ustinov began to vomit blood and pass bloody black diarrhea, the doctor gave him transfusions, but as they put the blood into him it came out of his mouth and rectum. Ustinov was in prostration. They debated replacing all the blood in his body with fresh new blood -- a so-called whole-body transfusion. They were afraid that that might trigger a total flooding hemorrhage, which would kill him, so they didn't do it.

ALIBEK did not know exactly which strain of Marburg had infected his colleague. It had been obtained by Soviet intelligence somewhere, but the scientists were never told where strains came from. The Marburg virus seems to live in an unknown animal host in East Africa. It has been associated with Kitum Cave, near Mt. Elgon, so the Soviet strain could have been obtained around there, but Alibek suspected that it came from Germany. In 1967, the virus had broken out at a vaccine factory in Marburg, a small city in central Germany, and had killed a number of people who were working with monkeys that were being used to produce vaccine. One of the survivors was a man named Popp, and Alibek thought that Ustinov was probably dying of the strain that had come from him. I have seen a photograph of a Marburg monkey worker taken shortly before his death, in late summer, 1967. He is a stout man, lying on a hospital bed without a shirt. His mouth is slack, his teeth are covered with blood. He is hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose. The blood has run down his neck and pooled in the hollow of his throat. It looks spidery, because it's unable to clot. He also seems to be leaking blood from his nipples.

The final pages of Dr. Nikolai Ustinov's scientific journal are smeared with unclotted blood. His skin developed starlike hemorrhages in the underlayers. Incredibly -- the Vector scientists had never seen this -- he sweated blood directly from the pores of his skin, and left bloody fingerprints on the pages of his diary. He wept again before he died.

Ken Alibek is nearly hypnotic when he speaks of these things in his flat voice. We sat around the kitchen table as if we were old friends sharing a story. A gray light shone through the kitchen window, and I saw the red flash of a cardinal near the Patricks' bird feeder, almost a flicker of blood. The dog noticed a squirrel, and started barking. ""Go get him, Billy,"" Patrick said, rising to let the dog out.

Dr. Ustinov died on April 30, 1988. An autopsy was performed in the spacesuit morgue of the biocontainment hospital. If this was indeed the Popp strain of Marburg virus -- and who could say? -- it was incredibly lethal. It produced effects in the human body that were stunning, terrifying. Alibek says that a pathology team removed Ustinov's liver and his spleen. They sucked a quantity of his destroyed blood out of a leg vein using large syringes.

They froze the blood and the body parts. They kept the Ustinov strain alive and continually replicating in the laboratories at Vector. They named the strain Variant U, after Ustinov, and they learned how to mass-produce it in simple bioreactors, flasks used for growing viruses. They dried Variant U, and processed it into an inhalable dust. The particles of Variant U were coated to protect them in the air so that they would drift for many miles.

In late 1990, Biopreparat researchers tested airborne Variant U on monkeys and other small animals in special explosion-test chambers at the Stepnagorsk plant. Marburg Variant U proved to be extremely potent in airborne form. They found that just one to five microscopic particles of Variant U lodged in the lungs of a monkey were almost guaranteed to make the animal crash, bleed, and die. With normal weapons-grade anthrax, in comparison, it takes about eight thousand spores lodged in the lungs to pretty much guarantee infection and death.

Alibek said that by the fall of 1991, just before Boris Yeltsin came to power, Marburg Variant U was on the verge of becoming a strategic/operational biological weapon, ready to be manufactured in large quantities and loaded into warheads on MIRVs. These warheads are sinister things. Ten separate cone-shaped warheads, each targeted on a different location, sit atop a missile. Special cooling systems inside each warhead keep the virus alive during the heat of reentry through the earth's atmosphere. ""If we can land a cosmonaut to earth alive, we can do the same with a virus,"" Alibek explained. ""We use parachutes."" The biowarheads are parachuted over a city, and at a certain altitude they break apart. Out of each warhead bursts a spray of more than a hundred oval bomblets the size of small cantaloupes. The cantaloupes fly out a distance and then split in overlapping patterns, releasing a haze of bioparticles that quickly becomes invisible.

Variant U never became part of the Soviets' strategic arsenal, which was stocked with Black Death, Alibekov anthrax, and powdered smallpox. (Never less than twenty tons of weapons-grade dry smallpox was stockpiled in bunkers.) But it seems quite possible that when the Russian biowarfare facilities fell on hard times and biologists began leaving Russia to work in other countries, some of them carried freeze-dried Variant U with them, ready for further experimentation. Variant U started, perhaps, with a monkey worker named Popp, but its end in the human species is yet to be seen. ""

She was on her way to a sex party, and invited both me and the other passenger who got in to go, but said that guys have to pay (I forget how much it was but neither of us were even a little interested.)

I really do believe she got off on horrifying people. She'd get so animated on Montel when she'd start crafting these elaborate stories. I remember one particular story where she told a mother her missing daughter was in some seedy city (Vegas or Reno I wanna say?) walking the streets. 

This mother was obviously prepared to do anything to get her daughter home safe, so she hung on Sylvia's every word and after the show went immediately onto the streets of the city canvassing for her daughter.

It eventually played out that a Jane Doe, who had died and been discovered years before that Montel show, was identified as her daughter. 

What gets me is that neither Sylvia nor Montel ever apologized. They just always acted like it never happened. Just to start the next Wednesday show telling us how accurate she was and how she'd solved so many crimes. Depraved. "

They showed the numbers in cm and kg but I did the conversions and the first girl was about 5’4” and 125lbs *before* the magic diet food. When they revealed her weight the whole audience loudly reacted. They showed close ups of her slightly soft tummy while the audience gasped and video clips of her enthusiastically eating noodles, bean cakes, and chips.

It was during the caliphate of Abu Bakr that many hufadh were dying and he realized that in order to preserve the Quran it would have to be compiled into a book.

692,"&gt; So based on this, could it be possible that the stories of great flood events formed around the same time by coincidence?

Its possible, but there's a much more reasonable explanation - At the end of the last ice ages, there were multiple areas subjected to extreme flooding as ice sheets retreated and glacial dams failed resulted in glacial lakes (which could rival any of the Great Lakes in size) draining and causing massive flooding.  There is evidence for this occurring in the pacific northwest of America, multiple parts of China, the Middle East, and Europe, all within the same general time frame (simultaneously, if you look at it from a geological perspective) of 15000-7500 BC.  

You are correct that the annual of flooding of rivers was both a major concern and a necessity for early settlements.  In the Mesopotamian valley, Shanghai River Valley, Indus River Valley, and Nile River Valley (Also known as basically everywhere earliest civilizations are known to have existed), annual flooding was a necessity.  In, for example, Egypt, (as well as the various Nubian civilizations), the annual flooding was strongly associated with religion.  This was also true in the Mesopotamian valley.  I would assume it was also true for the civilizations along the Indus and Shanghai rivers, but I know less about them than I do the others.  

And yeah, the 'Silk Road' is *ancient*.  A lot of people associate it with Marco Polo and the Middle Ages, and assume that the 'Silk Road' reffered to one continuous overland trade route from China to Western Europe, but that isn't accurate in really any sense.  The 'Silk Road' was a collection of various trade routes that spanned from Southeast Asia to Western Europe, but also included trade routes that went from North Africa to Sub-Saharan Africa (primarily via the East Coast of Africa.  Ethiopia, for example, possessed a thriving civilization that engaged in significant trade with Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cultures.  ANd that's not even getting into intra-African trade, where there were trade networks that covered the entire continent), as well as up through the Caspian Steppe.  Some of these routes weren't established until the European Middle Ages, but many of the routes pre-date any known civilization.  There are some theories that suggest one of the key drivers of civilizations being established where they were - North Africa, Middle East, Central Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and China - because of the existence of trade routes, as opposed to trade routes existing because of the civilizations.  At any rate, there is strong evidence establishing the existence of many trade routes that would later become part of the 'Silk Road' existing prior to 10,000 BC.  

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692448/pdf/3MCUHHPNJEJGKRFT_354_33.pdf
That paper outlines some evidence of a trans-Middle East trade in bitumen going back to at least 10,000BC, with some evidence suggesting trade occurring up to *40,000* years ago.

https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6462233.pdf
This paper argues that the engagement in trade by homo sapiens is one of the reasons we out-competed neanderthals!  That's how *ancient* trade networks are!  They also site evidence of complex trade networks spanning as much as 1000 miles for trade in things like ivory, seashells, and obsidian.  They cite evidence from Aurginacian cultures which appear to have engaged with each other - those cultures are generally thought to have existed from 40,000 BC to ~28,000 BC.   There is evidence to suggest that, even this long ago, there were trade routes which spanned from Eastern Spain to the Middle East.  

But yeah, its a complete myth that prior to 'modern' times, people were generally stationary.  In reality, even if most of the population generally stuck to the same areas, there were absolutely people who were travelling hundreds, if not thousands, of miles to trade with neighboring cultures, to explore, and to establish new settlements.  If anything, prior to widespread adoption of significant agriculture, people were *more* likely to travel and interact with others, particularly cultures which were highly nomadic and followed seasonal migration patterns of herd animals.

Also how would Dumbledore plan on Neville killing Voldemort? Harry did it because he got lucky and became the Master of Death. How would Neville have defeated old Voldy?

Months later, OP heard in a local news story that that twin brother, who turned out to be some schizophrenic psycho, had killed someone. In the article it said that the guy killed that person because a few months earlier, he had witnessed some kind of divine creature that had told him to do so.

763,"So I think the general thought is that the ""sons of God"" was what the angels were referred to in the book. The word nephilim is assumed to come from the Hebrew word ""נ־פ־ל"", which basically means fall (and I think it's pronounced nephil, but could be wrong). I think the ""-im"" part of the word is supposed to signify that the word is a plural, which would make the word translate literally to ""the fallen"" or ""the fallen ones"". This is why, when Genesis 6 says that the Nephilim were children of the sons of God an daughters of man, it's saying that they're half-man, half-fallen angel.

Also, I think that when it says ""they were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown"", it doesn't actually mean that they were mighty men. I can't remember where I read this, but I think the original translation of ""mighty men"" somehow signified that they were not only powerful, but big, as in giants.

I came out of a steep turn (feeling my own wake, booyah!) and right as I leveled out, there was a Seneca about a quarter mile ahead of me, directly converging. He was slightly above me and descending. He passed so close over the top of me that I heard his engines over my own engine. I don’t know if he ever saw me. 

* Taking off from SNA in a Cessna right behind a 737. I was turning out for wake turbulence avoidance, but I hit a bit of one of the vortexes and got about 50° of uncommanded bank at about 100’ AGL. 

* On about a mile final, reached for the throttle to pull it back and ended up with my hand on the mixture knob and tried to pull it back. I didn’t press in the button so it’s not like I would have pulled back to ICO, but it was definitely an “oh shit” moment that reminded me to pay attention. "

Most kids and their parents really appreciate it, but occasionally you get a kid who has been coached and you have to gently deprogram them. We’re not spending $80 on trashy jewelry for your dads girlfriend. 

Anyway, an officer I work with had a heart breaker a few years ago. Generally we don’t buy gift cards or things that require lots of batteries. We have a bit of leeway though, which can be a very good thing as evidenced here. The child in question wanted a gift card for Steak and Shake. That was it. All the money for Steak and Shake. When asked about it, it turned out that he had figured out the price of a milkshake during their Happy Hour and figured he could get one a week through the end of the school year if we’d get him the gift card. He was 9 and looked 6... he ended up with a pretty decent gift card. I hope he was able to use it the way he planned!"

For a rich country, far too many citizens are fat, unhealthy, and barely literate. Not to mention your whack issues surrounding health care, abortion, religious fundamentalism and guns.

955,"Today the Legislative Assembly of my home state West Bengal passed a bill to officially change the name from ""West Bengal"" to ""Bangla"".

The main reason behind this is that East Bengal is no longer a part of India and has been the sovereign nation of Bangladesh for decades.

 The federal government as well as most state governments are renaming place names in order to remove the vestiges of our colonial past, since the name ""Bengal"" was given to this region by the British Raj.

The original endonym ""Bangla"" was anglicised into the name ""Bengal"".

In Bengali  language ""Bangla"" is both the name of the language and also the geographical region. ""Bengali"" or more accurately ""Bangali"" is also the term for the majority ethnic group of this state. Most non Bengali people are unaware of this fact , so they started trolling the Bengali state government and its chief minister (she is also actually pretty stupid and is hated all over india) for being so stupid that they named their state after their language. 

This Escalated quickly into heated debates between Bengalis and Non-Bengalis. The opposition political party of the Bengali Legislative Assembly started accusing the government of diversion politics in order to distract the common population. Then media jumped into the frenzy worsening the situation. More this nation wide debate is going on whether we should change colonial names or not."

1004,"Thing about the remastered version is that every single thing except for the obvious CGI is a huge improvement.

There were hundreds of edits in each movie, but you barely notice any of them because it's not so straightforward. They re-cut scenes to make them paced better and added establishing shots. Lot of exterior shots of the death star added TIE fighters so it gives the impression of a highly active military installation instead of a lonely outpost. They added more stormtroopers to some scenes so it looked like there were more than five guys manning the thing. Some rebel soldiers were freakin cardboard cutouts, when you see it you can't un-see it. 

The only thing worth criticizing is the CGI stuff you're meant to notice, and it sure deserves the criticism. For one thing, it looks so out of place in a movie from the 70s, it's not congruent with the rest of the movie at all; just because it's an old movie doesn't make it look outdated so long as it's immersive and consistent, take something like Labyrinth or Dark Crystal as a good example of that. They steal focus too, most of them looking like wacky cartoon characters.

Really think it wouldn't have gotten any of the criticism if they had left that stuff out and stuck with the cinematography improvements."

We are second in the world in terms of missing people and common graves, only after Cambodia. We had labour camps until the Yankees came here; all of the airports and highways that Franco took pride in developing were built by prisoners. We had systematic torture as the tool of repression of choice until the 80s, and it's still in use whenever deemed necessary.

Nearly everybody here has a story of a missing or murdered family member. My great-grandfather and his pregnant wife disappeared in 1936 and we haven't found yet where they are. My grandma had to travel to Germany in her 80s to get some DNA tests done in hopes her parents had been transferred to a KZ at some point. Now we have conclusive evidence that their remains are under a rubbish tip that was built after the war, thus making it virtually impossible to find them and give them a proper burial. And yet we had the (literal) heirs of the very same people who killed them in office until yesterday and now that somebody dared to give us a rest they are trying to get in the way and stop the funding of what for us is the only path to a true reconciliation. 

Just, no. Yeah, Stalinism was a hell of a drug, but communists ARE better than fascists. So are socialists, anarchists, liberals and republicans and so was the legitimate government of this country that we are still struggling to rebuild. "

Also, I think a single male even today would have a REALLY hard time adopting. "
1063,"That koalas are fucking horrible animals.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.

Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.

Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...

Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.

Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).

When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.

This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?

Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.

Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:

Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.

An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.

1091,"Interesting fact.  I managed an athletic footwear store for 20 years.  Unfortunately, mismates and singles are something that happens.  Employees screw up when selling a display shoe, dumbasses occasionally steal a display shoe, or the biggest cause: when a shoe is transferred between stores, someone forgets to pull the mate off display.

In the good old days when the company was small and more freewheeling, we would sell 1/2  size mismates for 50% off, and full size or more mismates for whatever we could get.  Otherwise they were  completely worthless.

Later, some one at the home office came up with a system  where we could enter the size , side and style of mismatches and try to mate them up with other stores.  

That continued until I left the company.

Any shoe that was not mated in 6 months were sold to a guy for $1 per shoe. 

No one ever knew exactly what he did with them.

Mismates and singles are a huge loss for shoe stores.

Also notice, when you shop at Foot Locker, Finish Line, Dicks, and other chain type places.... the display shoes are Lefts about 95% of the time.   This is by design amongst the companies because it keeps someone from stealing a right display shoe in one store and a left display of the same shoe in another store.   Most stores use 8.5, 9, 9.5  (mens). And 7.5/8/8.5 ( for womens) as displays when possible

Also, in almost ever shoe store if you listen you will hear the term “drags”.  Drags are shoes that were brought out for a customer, but the customer did not buy, and now they need put away.

Another shoe store term is S.W.A.T..

So that is why when you ask for the Black Jordan Shoe in a size 10, and  the salesperson brings out a different jordan or a different black basketball shoe to show you because they did not have your size in the shoe you wanted.  Believe it or not, this works about 45% of the time.   Most managers straight out forbid an employee to come out of the stock room empty handed.

1105,"Typing.

This was probably back in 1999 or 2000 or something, I was taking dual enrollment classes at a local community college while in high school. I used the computer a lot, I was already a bit of a nerd, but I was of two finger hunt and peck school of typing at the time, and I figured I'd learn how to type for real with this class, it would be an easy A and I'd learn a useful skill.

Well we had to use this really fucking awful ancient typing program, we could only use it while in the ""typing lab"" and couldn't do assignments on our home computers, and the program would penalize you more for backspacing to correct an error than if you just kept typing and left the error which drove me nuts. I hated the experience and started to fall behind on the assignments. I just could not learn to type using the method they were teaching and it was extremely stressful for me.

The class grade was based on your completion of all the lessons in the program. You were to save your progress on the program to a floppy disk which you would turn in at the end of the semester. So I figure fuck it, I'll cheat. I open up the save file on my floppy in a hex editor and the format is easy enough to figure out, I go into all the lessons and give myself reasonable passable error rates and times on all the lessons and mark everything as completed. 

I figure I'm golden, so I go into class on the last day and try to load the modified save file into the program to show the professor I had completed everything, but the program starts spitting errors.  I guess there was some kind of checksum in the save file or something I didn't account for when editing the human readable data, and my file didn't work. We were supposed to have a backup file saved somewhere locally or something I think, but since I'd legitimately completed less than half of the lessons that didn't help me either.

So I failed typing. Dual enrollment, great AP scores, lots of advanced math, language, history, pretty good all around grades, awesome SAT score... and a fucking F in typing of all things.

The funny thing is I had an office job that summer that involved a bunch of manual data entry for a company that was trying to convert from some ancient proprietary database to Microsoft Access and I had so much typing to do I just sort of naturally learned how to type on my own. 

Then in an afternoon I figured out a way to convert from their old database format and import into Access that somehow their entire IT department couldn't figure out. I showed it to my friend who was doing the same job, we figured out a way to divvy up the imports on a daily basis that made it look like we were still doing it manually, and we spent the rest of the summer getting paid to dick around on the Internet and play Tribes."

1125,"I don't get tired of him. He can annoy the living heck out of me, but even when I do get annoyed, we end up laughing. He makes me feel appreciated for the things I do for him, and I appreciate the little things he does for me. We moved in together for the first time in May and while I was excited and confident to do so, it's also a bit of a test for couples and I think we found our groove pretty quickly. I love that I get to snug up to him in the mornings and that I also get to spend my downtime with him, each of us doing our own thing but nearby. The night of our first date (we stayed out until 3:30am and he was leaving with his family for vacation at 5:00am) he left for a week and he was all I could think about. I had had crushes before and dated before, but I was giddy that whole week just waiting for him to get back. He met me in our office on campus and I was almost worried that I had over-hyped in my head what I had felt between us but then he kissed me and everything melted away. He's truly my rock. I fell in love with him early in our relationship, but even now he constantly reminds me how much I really, really love him. I've been struggling a lot lately with everything I've got on my plate and he's been so supportive. I had a panic attack (my first in a long time) and despite the fact that I had never told him what to do if things like that happened and as I was blubbering telling him to leave because I didn't want him to see me like that, he just held me and rubbed my back and talked to me and told me he would never leave me. He surprised me with flowers the other day when he got home from work. He always says thank you when I cook or clean or anything like that. I'm head over heels in love with my best friend and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. The other night we just binge watched the 9th season of Archer and drank a bottle of wine and it was so much fun. No matter how I'm feeling, he's the one person I always want to talk to. 

There's a lot of reasons. But I will say I thought I had been in love before...but it wasn't like this. It was a shell of this. Love isn't just the things that make your heart turn to mush, it's the ability to work together and take care of each other and be in it together. My ex and I wanted really different things. My man doesn't stand in the way of what I want, he wants to be there with me through it all and I want to do the same for him. I'm so proud of everything he accomplishes. He's just the perfect guy for me. 

I had been thinking about it before this moment, but we said I love you for the first time on Valentine's Day. We agreed no gifts. We had lunch at the pub on campus and he handed me a card. He had signed it ""Love, Sushinightmare's boyfriend"". I looked at him and said ""love?"" He had pulled out his laptop while I was reading the card and as I looked up, I saw on his computer a website he built all about how much he cared about me. He told me he loved me, and I told him the same. Sometimes when I'm having a crummy day I still look at that website because it instantly cheers me up. But after that moment I knew I was in deep with him. "

 All the antibiotics I had to take to get rid of the Lyme have left me with horrible acid reflux and stomach ulcers 

A couple years after the Lyme was cured I thought I had it again but got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis which messed up my joints, and started in on my liver and the stuff around my lungs. My rheumatologist says autoimmune diseases are sometimes triggered by a Lyme infection. 

My mother claimed Lyme disease for well over a decade. All the doctors and tests are wrong I know I have it blah blah blah. She didn’t and never has. She’s a professional student white woman who hangs around with rich white women. She’s into all the hippy ask the universe stuff. One day I had enough of her fake Lyme disease and I told her that the universe was listening and that’s why I got it. It figured she must want Lyme in her life. Probably with a shut the fuck with your lies or I’ll punch you in the face thrown in. 

I hate the lying about having a disease or condition (glueten free...which she claims now too) because is the latest big new thing. It hurts the people who actually do have the condition because no one believes them"

It's a combination of sulphur and curry is the best way to describe the nostrils' experience huffing this.

1251,"While am sure that an east v west war would have been long bloody and brutal I don’t think it would have been as one sided as you mentioned. The Russians benefited heavily from lend lease and it a conflict broke out all of the food, weapons and vehicles would have stopped. In addition while the Soviets may have had a much larger land army the allies had a lot of practice with the whole large scale strategic bombing thing, not to mention nukes and the US with its vast amounts of food and production infrastructure. The US and British navy’s were the strongest in the world and could definitely make sure the soviets could nit invade England, which would be pivotal in defeating the western allies. I know you were talking about land battles but in war so many different things are interconnected it’s not like the western allies would just not use their air power to air their ground battle. So while it’s impossible to say for sure who would have won I’m confident in Saying that with all of their ww2 advantages plus no shortage of Germans who hate the soviets and re willing to fight the war wouldn’t have been one sided in favor of the Russians. "
1252,"The US did prepare Alaska in response so to some extent it worked.

The largest operation the US did in Alaska during WW2 was probably the construction of the port of [Whittier AK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittier,_Alaska) and the accompanying Alaska Railroad spur &amp; tunnel to provide transportation and defenses to Anchorage - which was a major point of air traffic.

Whittier gave the US two oceanic ports with quick railroad linkage to Anchorage, and was hurried in semi-secrecy at the beginning of the war (it was started just a few months prior) under semi-secret construction.  Reasons for the selection of Whittier as a defensive port is that it is nearly a perfect base against aerial attack.  The port is surrounded on 3.5 sides by tall mountains, and with average rainfall of nearly 16 inches per month it is perpetually hung with low cloud."

1274,"At lunch in elementary school the teachers who supervised our lunch loved flexing their power over us grade schoolers. When the lights were off, that meant we weren't allowed to talk. Usually this was done for the last 5-10 minutes of lunch (for whatever reason) but sometimes they'd keep them off the entire lunchtime so we couldn't even talk to friends, etc. If you were caught talking you were brought to a separate table with others who talked and were made to stand against a wall during recess, which happened right after.

Anyway, every Friday we had some elementary school version of open mic night that we could sign up and perform for. My friends and I would go up and sing song parodies that we wrote ourselves involving frogs (don't ask). The lights were off, meaning we couldn't talk while others were performing. Fine. However, I went to check the sign up sheet and saw we were next, so I went back to our lunch table and told my friends that it was our turn. BOOM. Immediate missing of recess for all of us.

So, not only does that have me incredibly salty, but what's the point of not allowing kids to talk during lunch? It only made those of us punished bitter, and I feel it was for only their benefit of not dealing with kids, instead of anything worthwhile."

Whilst safety/reliability is a major concern, often times an FAA penalty is far cheaper than grounding planes for a non-safety related repair, so they'll just eat the penalty and keep flying as usual. 

Also, planes tend to be actually cleaned (beyond the trash/spill cleanup that happens briefly on turns before between deboarding and boarding) every 72 hours or so to minimize ground time.

After our last lecture, I somehow got the balls to go up to her and ask if she wanted to go out for dinner sometime. She said that it was unprofessional but I decided to write my number on a piece of paper anyways and give it to her. (I was actually awkward as fuck and was 100% sure I fucked it up.

Three weeks later I got a call from her unexpectedly. We went out for dinner. We ended up being in a relationship for a few years. I never had any other class with her as an instructor or TA. However, she was a TA in the school for a course and was friends with a lot of the professors and TAs in other courses ... so I got a lot of exam questions and answers ahead of time for courses that her friends were teaching or TAing.

But she goes through so much hell and persists in spite of it. After everything that's happened to her, losing her children one by one, being humiliated, she still finds her way to the Iron Throne.

My single favourite aspect of GoT is the narrative arc of Cersei clinging and clinging and fighting and fighting to hold onto a dream that is an ever-shrinking island. What she's fighting for gets smaller and smaller and yet she rages relentlessly against the dying of the light.

She's not a traditionally ""strong"" character, but she's definitely one. Her pathological blindness to anything but the preservation of her family is what gives her strength, and at the same time the reason she's failed. "

She opened up the bag and was sharing it with some of her grandkids(myself included), when all of a sudden she blurted out, ""Oh I didn't realize there were ni**er toes in here I haven't had those in ages."". You can imagine my shock as the nicest person in my entire family who strived to respect everyone and taught me all about tolerance and accepting others in spite of any differences, uttered one of the most nonchalant and casually racist comments I had yet heard in person.

1411,"I was almost killed by a wannabe gangster, that's a nice story that always gets my family on edge when i tell them. 

Basically, I was walking home from my dead-end pizza job back to my house. I've talked about this a few times on Reddit, but basically, i live in one of the two housing authorities in my town and each one has a rival gang in it (They're basically wannabe Bloods and Crypts). A few months before this happened I was almost robbed by one of the girls who lived at the other authority, what I didn't know was that she was basically the ""main hoe"" of the main gangbanger there. Tl;dr, she tried to trick me into opening a bottle of wine for her, i grabbed the wine to take it into the kitchen to get the opener, she pulls gun, and I stare her down for a second or two before knocking her on the head with the bottle, Police are called and i had fun with the legal system but a camera saved my ass from anything serious. 

Anyway, i was walking home and i guess one of the guys decided that i needed to be dealt with because I noticed someone was following behind me. He had his hood drawn up and he was walking a decent ways behind me and he kept his hands in his pocket. I was keeping an eye on him and i pulled out my phone and pretended to call my work to ask if anyone was still there because i had forgotten something. So i took a few side streets to see if he was following me or not (he was) and I made it back to the store and walked inside. We called the police and they showed up and took a statement and left and i assumed that he had left to because of the police. My friend insists that he drives me home, but i declined as i had my knife on me (stupid, i know, but i really hated having people go out of there way for me since it was like a 10-minute drive out of his way due to traffic) and that i'd be alright. 

About five minutes later i'm getting somewhat close to home and i pulled out my phone and saw his reflection behind me. So being the idiot i am i whip around and put on my best Kratos impression and very loudly, but sternly yell ""What the hell do you want"". Mind you, i'm a very tall and very built man, so that would be rather intimidating to most people. 

I guess i spooked him because he just turned around and darted in the other direction. Luckily the police caught him a few days later for breaking into someone's house. I heard through the grapevine that he always carried an illegal gun around and that he was going to kill me to become a ""full"" member of their little wannabe club. "
1412,So she’s post-op?
1413,"I was committed to a mental hospital for 6 days because a therapist feared I'd kill myself. I was picked up right from her office by police and sent to the hospital where I was told I would stay until a doctor deemed it safe for me to leave. I was 23, and having your entire life flipped upside down and being told your stuck in this hospital with some crazy people is terrifying. Obviously these places today are meant to help people, but it's a scary feeling just being dropped off and told you can't leave and must take medication they give you. I met some great people there, but the first couple days were probably the scariest thing to ever happen to me."

Minimum wage is suppose to allow a person to live at a minimum standard of living. Literally, that's its purpose. People have no choice but to use fast food as a way to live because they can't afford the time or the cost of any training since they have to work multiple jobs. 

With that said, we can't just double the minimum wage across the entire country instantly. The issue should worked out in a way that doesn't bankrupt companies.

I stopped posting because someone commented saying they were related to me and had been dying to see me naked for awhile. Really fucked with me. 

The reason I deleted most of my posts was actually because of my jealous ex while we were dating. He originally encouraged my exhibitionism. We started out really experimental sexually and were having lots of fun. That all stopped when I was getting more positive comments than his posts were. Turned into massive jealousy. "
1573,"I realized it was real love when, despite our differences and the obvious reasons we shouldn't be together, it still felt right. Even though we fought and she wouldn't open up to me emotionally, I could see how amazing of a person she was behind the scars. I realized that what I felt for her was unlike what I'd ever felt for another person in my entire life, even though I shouldn't have. After she broke things off because she ""needed time to heal,"" I got myself to totally forget about her and move on. 3.5 months went by, and she came back into my mind at full force, and I totally fell for her over again. I knew it was real love when I hadn't seen her in months and I still dreamt of her. So I went to her house to confess my love to her and to see if she was ready to try again. 

She was with a guy, and she showed me that she never actually cared for me, despite everything she said when we were together. I loved her like I've never loved before, and allowed her to hurt me worse than I've ever hurt before. Now dating feels empty. "

that's when i explained to them the only two things that are certain in life.



edit1 - i'd like to clarify, a polar pop is $1.02 with taxes. we don't have pennies anymore, so it's a dollar for one, $2.05 for two (w/o rounding it comes to $2.04). essentially, these two older ladies (whom i knew were from out of town due to their accent) didn't know how taxes worked."
1604,"I personally think it is important to remember that the books of the bible are not all-comprehensive.  It is actually quite possible that the so-called ""Law of Moses"" existed long before Moses, It just isn't talked about until Leviticus.

Even fast food places and coffee shops. Some do require you to buy something first, but that's a minority of establishments from my experience. The businesses just keep them running for customers, but non-customers can use them as well. I think having available restrooms is better than people pissing on the street tbh"
1617,"I was with a guy who I suspected of cheating. He had been in AA at that time for 25 years and enjoyed going to meetings to help others and for the comrade. He began going a lot more often than normal and me being a suspicious person anyway began to think he was doing more than going to meetings. One day this guy was messing around with his phone and asked me to take a look at it to see if the phone had navigation on it. We sat at the dining room table him across from me. I thought, this is my chance. I went straight to his text messages and bazinga. Hit the jackpot. This guy had been sending love messages to an old girlfriend, texting one of his ex wives, sent several messages to some women from AA and one in particular message that was very cringey. His message to her was, he wanted to get to know her but he's shy and warms up quickly. He asked her if she wanted to get 'coffee' with him. No response from her. 

I began reading out loud all the messages and of course he said they didn't mean anything. I told him to pack his shit and get out. He did. Never saw him again after that."

1629,"Actually much of the language in Jonah is hyperbolic in the same way. Many scholars believe it is an outlandish tale to convey a deep truth like Jesus' parables or like pointed comedy sketch. 

You can see this in places such as when they describe the city of Ninevah
&gt;Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, three days' journey in breadth.
Jonah 3:3 ESV

The circumference of the city would have been massive beyond any city in that day. 

Another example is that everyone in what is most likely the most powerful city in the world, the ruler of the greatest world power they know of repents from one speech at the first hearing. 

Much of the examples and stories in Jonah are setup to convey a more profound story. The trouble is most of us get caught up on the if these things **could** have happened that we miss what it is saying.

Any copper pots you buy now will be sealed or plated with something like tin on the inside, with copper only used on the bottom for better heat conduction.

It's not really unsanitary though, since copper is inherently anti-microbial and being a pot, it gets pretty hot.  Incidentally this antimicrobial property is why the other dude below you says that you shouldn't make bread in copper bowls.  It fucks up the yeast."

There is, quite literally, hundreds of different schools of thought when it comes to understanding and interpreting the Bible. Some people think the entire Old Testament is metaphorical, others pick and choose which stories are literal. Some people I know actually think the whole thing really happened. 

Sure some stories have a resemblance of a moral lesson, but it’s always muddied or doesn’t quite line up. Tbh, I think it’s mostly fantastical garbage written by self-centered fame seekers and self-righteous zealots. And I’ll skip the reading comprehension course, thanks. "

Instinctively, my knee pumped upward and my arms jutted out in front of me as I very nearly started running for my life...and then I slowly sank back into a normal standing position as I realized no one else was reacting. It was just some people setting off firecrackers for midsummer, but my assumption, hearing loud little pops like that in the middle of a city, was ""mass shooter.""

1704,"I learned about 10 years ago that Case Western Reserve University was so named because the Cleveland area was reserved for inhabitants of Connecticut to settle. It had been part of the old colonial claim of that state, so the US government made that concession in exchange for CT dropping its western claim.

1716,"The justifications are funnier, such as ""there was a really tight archway called 'The Eye of the Needle' that a camel could barely squeeze through"" and ""camel is a thick type of thread"".

When a book is telling you a story of a man who grew up and lived in poverty that is also God, that frequently talks about the moral problems surrounding wealth and avarice, I think it's easy to call that metaphor relatively cut and dry.

Literally [two chapters later](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A41-44&amp;version=NIV), a poor old woman is singled out and praised by Jesus himself for putting in less money than anyone else, but more of what she actually had."

He tells me to *Stop!*, in a very authoritative tone, then berates me for ignoring him. I protest, saying that I needed a lid. He listens to not a word, insists that I start cleaning NOW. So, I do. I scrub the rusty wire rack shelves in the fridge. With the open container of ranch dressing sitting at the bottom of the cooler, collecting flecks of rust. Which perfectly blend into the dressing.

1730,"Well, it’s important to note that the difference between homosexuality and pedophilia is that while both are innate sexual preferences, the latter is extremely harmful to its participants. I don’t see sexual interaction between adults and children ever becoming accepted, nor do I think it should. 

But to try and answer your question — no, I do not believe pedophiles should be allowed to use sex toys/dolls to satisfy their urges. Some itches simply should not be scratched, regardless of how much desire one has to do so. The answer to those with alcohol/drug addiction is not to produce a synthetic equivalent that has none of the negative side effects involved in real abuse. Instead, they practice self control and discipline, hence the success and prevalence of both AA and NA. I tend to think that pedophiles should have access to similar institutions that offer moral support and guidance, while being very clear in preventing further misconduct. 

The potentially negative consequence of that mentality is that you’re treating an innate preference as an affected addiction, which it’s not. There’s also a subliminal implication of guilt attached to those seeking genuine help, which is never a good thing. Additionally, some things can be so hard-wired into one’s biology that no amount of counseling will make a difference. In these circumstances, I hope medication will one day become an option.

It’s a very tricky situation, and society has an incredibly long way to go before true progress can be made, but even honest conversations like these are a step in the right direction. "

1738,"/u/itoldyousoanysayo pretty much nailed it. There's a reason the (general consensus) 'age of adulthood'/age of consent is 18. Women didn't start puberty until 17, 18 or later. If you look at [historical data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty#Historical_shift), menarche (when you start getting your period) started shifting downward noticeably after 1840 and *rapidly* after about 1950. They've recently 'had to' rewrite the book on what precocious puberty is. The DSM-III had puberty at 10 considered a disease requiring medical intervention. Now it's down to 8 years old.

Once I watched a film using active 3D glasses it felt 'real' and passive 3D has never been the same and now I actively avoid it during cinema screenings (even though I don't have to pay extra for 3D films)."

Genesis is basically ""and on the sixth day; man!""

Garden of Eden described as ""when the Lord God made heaven and Earth"".... you may remember from Genesis that Heaven and Earth were before day-6. 

They're not contradicting each other; they are describing the same ""event"" and what you describe as ""Garden of Eden experiment"" most certainly *did not come after* the description in Genesis. 

Why do Bible criticisers take everything so literally from the Bible? It is, and has always been labelled as an anthology book of metaphors and teaching. It's not a book of ""christian facts"" that you can just take one line in isolation.

1762,"About 11 years ago when my sister was about 6 months pregnant. My daughter was 8 at the time and loved spending time with her “fun aunt.”  We were all going gonna play mini golf but needed to take separate cars. My daughter wanted to ride with “fun aunt” but my sister lied to my 8 year old and told her I said she couldn’t ride with her. Sister then told my daughter “if your mom is going then I’m not.” Then called my 8 year old a liar when daughter told me fun aunt said all this. Stood there in front of us and swore she never said it. My 8 year old was crying, wondering why aunt was calling her a liar. To this day sister denies saying it. Later sister’s husband told me she in fact did say it and the only reason she didn’t want us going is because she wanted to smoke. She smoked cigarettes all throughout her pregnancy. Nephew was born early and low birth weight and was in NICU for 3 weeks very sick, all because she smoked during pregnancy. 

Tl;dr:  Called my 8 year old daughter a liar and made her cry all because she wanted to smoke while pregnant, and her son was severely low birth weight and sick when born due to her cigarettes. "

1773,"Checking my thoughts often.  I tend to become mired in my own negative, anxiety-ridden thinking and I have to ask myself if I am reacting to situations or am I being proactive.  If I am reacting, then I try to think of ways I can be proactive.   Usually I just need to relax, calm down, refocus and think more positive.

It can be difficult.  I really only started but I am seeing amazing results.  Sometimes, when I am not sure what I am feeling or thinking (my mind feels cluttered), I will write in my journal which seems to help me clarify my thoughts.  I was really depressed a month ago but I am getting my life back on track and it feels great!

As a woman, I feel we might be more drawn to big questions or big issues.  It's a definite fact, according to research, that money alone tends not to be as big a motivator for women. That could be partly societal, of course."

1787,"I work on a couple cooking shows that go on YouTube (very high play count stuff). There is a full cooking/prepping crew (3-5 people) you don’t see.

Everything is pre-measured, planned, and etc. We jump cut anything over about 15 seconds of cooking. There is no way you can keep up at home. For example: cake icing “hero bags”. In the wide shot, you see the talent handling an icing bag but there is an insert that blocking the contents from coming out. Then there is a cut, a tight shot of a perfect smile and eyes on the snowman cookie. It’s because off camera the professional cake decorator is actually squirting it on. 

Our talent is also reading from a teleprompter (which is run by a teleprompter operator). The script has been thoroughly streamlined and edited, including what seems like impromptu laughs, sighs, giggles. 

The recipes are real, but never are the talents “Mom’s redbeans and rice” as they say on camera. I don’t exactly know where they come from, but they are not “family” recipes. I can say that if you play and pause- you will get a proper meal. 

If there is a way/method/tactic that allows more efficient filming and execution the reduces risk of reshooting a shot- I assure you, we exploit it.

Our usual production crew floats around 20-25 people and the main content distribution company is filming these about once a week, filming 3 episodes a day in 12 hours.

I record the dialog, it’s an easy gig (granted I’ve been in sound for 20 years and specialize in the very large and complicated productions that nobody else wants [live and high risk]). The humor on set is a completely different structure than for regular civilians. For example, the DIT guy (his only job is to copy the video and audio memory cards), we’ve been doing the same Airplane quotes for months. I really only get to hang out with him at lunch and at the end of the day when I dump audio. "

1849,"Ohhhhhh you are speaking my language. so few dancers are ""perfect."" It always seems to be a feet or knees issue, and they're rarely addressed. My parents put me in gymnastics as a consolation prize when I had to quit ballet for similar reasons you mentioned! I had bad turnout that was never corrected. They just kept advancing me, which meant knee surgery at a young age. My ankles were flexible, but all my dance teachers (and my mom!) thought they were huge. Ballet is more serious than gymnastics when it comes to body alignment and composition since turnout is involved, one small thing gets huge and ignoring it perilous.  With your feet, have you tried therabands to stretch them with? There's also some torture foot stretching box contraptions I've seen online, but I always stretched feet myself on my athletes because I wanted even pressure and didn't trust the box.  


I'm pretty sure I got the job at this world class gym because of my concern for body composition, proper dance training, and preservation of the athletes bodies because I lived the dark side of those things.  When the owner asked what I'd like to see at the gym that they didn't currently have, I told him a ballet barre. I started a week after and there were full length mirrors and a barre that went the whole way down the wall. My job as a coach began more as a ballet instructor for the team, then team selection, choreography, and and generally floating between levels to address form issues from bad habits. We had a saying ""Practice makes permanent"" which meant if an athlete had huge form breaks on a skill, they didn't practice that skill. We walked it back to smaller pieces one on one until they were fixed enough to practice the skill again. Another fun thing that came of it is we were able to do high level choreography in floor and beam routines, stuff most gyms skipped because they were too deduction risky, but judges and audiences love it."

1880,"Worked on an Australian cooking show. Time limits are real. But often the judges come out at different times and taste test the food as it is being cooked/prepared as it is often too cold by the time they get to the ‘judging’ on tv.

Also, as the actual ‘tv’ judging can take place hours after the food is prepared, generally straight after the food is cooked the judges will take a plate out to eat, and then while the beauty shots of the finished food is being filmed (we called it food porn) and the crew is preparing for the next shot or having lunch or whatever, that’s when the judges or producers will prepare their scripts and scores and whatever else their going to say for whenever the filming ‘judging’ takes place.

But ever since the divorced he was never the same person. Born into an unfortunate life and probably on the verge of suicide for every waking moment of his life... He still doesn't get why I hate him. He doesn't get how much I don't want to be who he is. I don't want to be an obese failure that seems to think it's okay he did everything he did just because he's not an alcoholic anymore.

Dad. This is for you. You did this to yourself. You ruined your own life. You don't deserve to have me as your son the minute you chose the bottle before me. I may have been an infant at the time, but you gave me up nearly a year before I spoke my first world.

I'm sorry to my *older* sister who saw the chaos of it all. You experiences such hate, anger, and furry just because you had the conscious for it. To my sister, you are a beautiful person. You just were dealt a bad hand from the start.

Please... Everybody. Don't give up... I think of suicide every single day. Yet for whatever reason I find a reason to hold on. Find yours. Find your ledge. Find the one stupid thing you grasp onto and hug for all dear life because for the love of the fucking God I don't believe in........

It's yours.

Love yourself everybody. For yourself and for me."

1895,I totally understand that. It’s awful that your therapist thought it was remotely okay to make that remark. It would fuck with me too. I’ve had professionals tell me if I made more suicide attempts they’d have to refer me to another professional because they didn’t seem to be helping me and didn’t want to lose their licenses. That I can understand and respect. That’s an effort to save a life while still looking out for their professional wellbeing. But what your therapist did is the exact opposite. I’m sorry that happened to you.

I had just marathoned some scary movies IRL, and was having a nightmare where I was being harassed by some demon, and I remembered that dark entities feed on fear, so if you aren't afraid, they lose power. So in the dream I started repeating ""I don't believe in you, you can't do anything to me, I don't believe in you"". Then the demon lost power and I woke up. 

So, way different story than what everybody else is telling, but it's the most impressive thing that's happened to me."

1909,"I mean it depends on where she is in her process if it would help. At the end of the day I do it because it arouses me, my answer was really as to why I probably do it. I wouldn't recommend it to her, though. That would really be inappropriate in my opinion. If she ever does it, she needs to do it 100% on her own volition.

I recommend journaling, if she's in counseling or therapy she could ask about EMDR (which can really help but can be an upsetting process and MUST be discussed with a counselor/therapist, I am not a doctor so I can't personally advise it), and maybe learning self-defense (though this isn't for everyone and sometimes it can be upsetting to some with PTSD/PTSD-like symptoms, this one is really iffy to suggest in my opinion along with rape-play.)

Part of what has helped me throughout my journey with PTSD has been my confidence in being able to handle myself, EMDR can be extremely helpful but also very upsetting in the moment, and journaling is just objectively good. If she wants to get better she's going to have to explore and find what works. I've just found what works for me and I'm functioning well. Journaling can get those pesky thoughts out on paper and help you focus.

•Also, you can consume lots of calories even in small amount of food.
•Eat less often during the day(only thrice strictly in 24 hours) and after large intervals. This is bound to make you overdose.
•Lift weights so that proteins stay as muscle weight.
•Don't drink water before the meals.
•If you get thirsty in between meals, drink whole milk instead of water.
•Use bigger places to get your food.
•Add cream to your coffee.
•Eat proteins first and vegetables last.
•Stop smoking.

Here are some energy-dense foods that are perfect for gaining weight:

Nuts: Almond, walnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, etc.Dried fruit: Raisins, dates, prunes and others.High-fat dairy: Whole milk, full-fat yogurt, cheese, cream.Fats and oils: Extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil.Grains: Whole grains like oats and brown rice.Meat: Chicken, beef, pork, lamb, etc. Choose fattier cuts.Tubers: Potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams.Dark chocolate, avocados, peanut butter, coconut milk, granola, trail mixes.

You can add sauces, spices and condiments to your foods to make it easier to eat more. Base your diet on energy-dense foods as much as possible.

Lift Heavy Weights and Improve Your Strength

To make sure that the excess calories go to your muscles instead of just your fat cells, it’s absolutely crucial to lift weights.

Go to a gym and lift 2–4 times per week. Lift heavy and try to increase the weights and volume over time.

If you’re completely out of shape or new to training, consider hiring a qualified personal trainer to help you get started.

It’s very important to lift heavy weights and improve your strength. This will help you gain muscle mass instead of just fat.

Combining a high calorie intake with heavy strength training are the two most important factors.

That's because your body has a certain setpoint of weight where it feels comfortable.

Whether you try to go under your setpoint (lose weight) or over it (gain weight), your body resists changes by regulating your hunger levels and metabolic rate.

When you eat more calories and gain weight, you can expect your body to respond by reducing your appetite and boosting your metabolism.

This is largely mediated by your brain, as well as weight-regulating hormones like leptin.

So you should expect a certain level of difficulty. In some cases, you may need to force yourself to eat despite feeling stuffed.

At the end of the day, changing your weight is a marathon, not a sprint. It can take a long time, and you need to be consistent if you want to succeed in the long run.

2053,"For sure, all of this has occurred to me. What gets me is the lack of available sources to corroborate what I assume are likely scenarios. This isn't some random event in the far-flung ancient past happening in remote mountains somewhere without literate scribes and historians. This is perhaps the wealthiest man of the medieval era, traveling with a cohort of thousands and thousands, through densely populated regions to the heart of Islamic civilization on a several years long journey, and building a mosque every Friday while he was at it. The impact of this journey on the historical record of the time is enormous, and yet I can't get a straight answer on what their level of economic sophistication was, or even an educated guess based on something solid from contemporary writing.

Your mummification has failed if you have enough moisture in your body that you rot from the inside out. The few mummies preserved in this gruesome manner are really fascinating.

2063,"I love the full story of Vlad Tepes III, or Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Impaler, or as fictitiously popularized by Bram Stoker, Dracula. His story is fascinating and only really available in full in books. Simplifying for brevity's sake: because he was the only one to answer a pope's call for a crusade, Vlad was put in a position where he and his army had to single-handedly push back a vast Turkish army to the Danube, not have reinforcements arrive (no one responded for the call to crusade), retreat through his country implementing early guerrilla tactics and scorched earth policy burning his kingdom's fields and poisoning the wells to weaken the invading army. After a night attack on the enemy's base where Vlad led his strongest soldiers in a strategic calvary attack on the commander's position, he, while unsuccessful in his assassination goal, disrupted the army and hit the vizier's tent. The sultan pursued Vlad to a pass where he encountered a grisly sight: Vlad had impaled 20,000 people, some report not only men, but women and children. Accounts report: ""the sultan was seized with amazement and said that it was not possible to deprive of his country a man who had done such great deeds, who had such a diabolical understanding of how to govern his realm and its people. And he said that a man who had done such things was worth much."" Then the Turkish army retreated from Vlad's land. [Edit to add: Vlad led his people to victory against an army poised to overrun Europe. His actions with his Forest of the Impaled can be credited with saving Europe. The second line of defense, the Hungarians, had just undergone serious losses at the hands of the Turks, so Romania, Hungary, and likely other countries could have been captured and annexed. So basically he saved Europe as we know it.] That's just a small part of his life, but he's so much more than a bloodthirsty guy from Transylvania --there was brutal, cold, calculating, revenge-driven fervor in his actions. Though the story goes he could leave a golden goblet in the streets and no one would steal it--because he would find them, and execute, or worse, impale them. Propaganda pamphlets about him were some of the first materials printed on the first moveable type printing press after the Guttenberg bible. Yet people in Vlad's home region still view him as a hero. History is metal. "
2064,Also think about there day to day lives are like. Simple and probably pretty bland. They didn’t experience a lot in life. Remember the first time you saw porn? Shit almost made me go blind.

2066,"25-year-old Julius Caesar was captured by Cilician pirates in 75BCE. This wasn’t unusual because piracy was a massive thing across the Mediterranean Sea at the time, but Caesar’s behaviour kinda was.

Caesar being Caesar refused to mind the pirates, despite their bloodthirsty notoriety. When they immediately demanded a ransom of twenty talents (this roughly translates to $600,000 in today’s silver value), Caesar was offended. He gave them all a good bollocking and demanded that they raise the ransom to fifty talents, which they agreed to.

He would tell his captives off if they kept talking when he tried to sleep. He wrote poems and speeches which he read aloud to them. When they didn’t like his stuff, he would get offended - again - and repeatedly threaten to have them crucified upon his release. He liked to insult their intellect and mock them.

The pirates eventually received the ransom, thirty eight days later, and Julius was released. They were probably relieved to see the back of him. That is, until he returned almost immediately with back up, captured them, and had almost all of them crucified as he had promised. He then retrieved his fifty talents of silver and promptly left. Class prize act, that man.

2067,"You may be cool, but you'll never be ""Emperor King"" cool"
2068,"This right here. 

In middle and highschool I was a fairly outgoing person and would try to make friends with pretty much anyone and everyone. I often wore cute, put together outfits (I was kinda my grandma's dress up doll, it was fine for school) and a bit of makeup.  Of all the groups of people I approached, the guys playing magic were the most hostile and straight toxic. 


The self proclaimed ""gangsta"" and ""cholo"" people were kind to me and always gave me hugs, the girls loved my hair and accent (I think sincerely) and were hella sweet to my face at least, the more skateboarding crowd who played hacky-sac were more stand-offish but quickly were warmed up to me and one girl drew pictures for me all the time. We had a JROTC program that spent a lot of time together who invited me to hang out sometime. Even the tight-knit band group seemed to like me even though I wasn't in band. There was hardly anyone I wasn't able to befriend at least be friendly with. I was pretty insecure so I wanted everyone to like me. 


But the damn nerdy kids. 


They mostly flat out ignored me. They teased me because they thought I was dumb when they did talk to me, which made me more nervous to speak to them so I stopped coming around.


One time they sent their most quiet guy to ask me to a school dance to, I guess set me up to talk shit about and hate me for ""a reason"". I knew because they thought I didn't notice they were spying on us as he asked.

No one had asked me yet, he didn't seem too bad, I wanted to get to know him so I said yes. They pushed me away long before they did this so I never came back around to see if they changed their opinion but I actually became good friends with that guy (I didn't date in grade school) and to his surprise, played a lot of my favorite game, Gears of War after school. Not to mention my mom is actually a gamer who started with EverQuest ages ago and moved to World of Warcraft and plays whatever in-between. He was shocked to find this out and mentioned it constantly to me.


I always hoped they learned a valuable lesson and changed their opinion about me but more likely still thought I was a stupid whore, which they called me under their breath in the smallest voices, like I couldn't hear them. They didn't have the guts to say it to my face, I guess. Suppose you can't win them all, ya know. But they were hands down the meanest group in my entire school. I rarely felt so humiliated as when they were ragging on me for no reason I could figure."

2073,"[Thats not all Japan did. ](https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/01/20/375820191/beware-of-japanese-balloon-bombs)

&gt;Just a few months ago a couple of forestry workers in Lumby, British Columbia — about 250 miles north of the U.S. border — happened upon a 70-year-old Japanese balloon bomb.
&gt;
&gt;The dastardly contraption was one of thousands of balloon bombs launched toward North America in the 1940s as part of a secret plot by Japanese saboteurs. To date, only a few hundred of the devices have been found — and most are still unaccounted for.

I know the lines are pretty poorly-defined and so you could technically make an argument like that no matter how over-the-top some offensive stereotype might be. If all Indy female sidekicks were like that, then yeah that's kinda misogynistic, but if they switch it up, that seems ok to me"

I was always awful at math in HS. Was barely scraping by with C's and low B's when I was lucky. So many other people just seemed to get it. Math wasn't difficult for them. They seemed to know how to do every kind of problem instantly, and could understand the lesson *before* the teacher even taught it.

I'm a music major, and in theory, it's the opposite. I can breeze through the class with no issues, basically already understand the material, and get easy A+'s. Meanwhile, many of my classmates struggle with the most basic concepts, just like how I did in math."

Back in 2004 when the game came out, 100g was a huge deal. The most expensive thing you would ever buy in WoW was probably your epic mount skill for 1000g, and that was weeks/months of farming.

Nowadays, Blizzard allows you to use gold to buy game time, which allows us to assign an actual exchange rate to gold. Currently, 320000g is worth about $15.

2131,"Amusingly, I love Die Another Day. It's probably my favorite ""campy"" bond movie. It's just so over-the-top with the bizarre gadgets, overly-dramatic characters, and ridiculous but inventive set-pieces that I actually have a lot of fun watching it. A hovercraft chase through a minefield? Come on, that's actually a clever idea for a chase scene. And a car chase through a literal ice palace that's melting around them, the sun as a weapon, a hand-to-hand fight in a room with random lasers of doom, an invisible car, a battle between two gadget-loaded spy-cars, a villain with diamonds embedded in his face...

I found out from his son on the first night of the funeral. 
That son died the following year, also of heart complications. 
It’s weird to think about. Every funeral we have had in this family was done in the same building in the same town on the same reservation. 
Most of my uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces and nephews that didn’t make it, all of them were buried in the exact same way. Casket is always in the same spot. It’s like attending your own funeral every time. I remember seeing Charlie staring at his father (whose skin was this sickly pale purple-blue-ish color). And I remember seeing Dawn (Charlie jrs sister and Charlie Srs daughter) staring at Charlie in the exact same spot.

I was never the Bible thumping type, more the libertarian/neocon sort. Read some Ayn Rand, Grew up with Reagan, that sort of thing. Thought Communism=Socialism, Capitalism was the way to human freedom, etc.

Then the Bush-Cheney administration got elected. 

I was never a fan of W. He seemed a dimwit who only got to where he was through nepotism. But I honestly thought those around him- Cheney, Powell, etc- were competent enough that this numbnut couldn't possibly screw things up that badly.

Boy, was I wrong.

So I end up going from 'Well, its early in the presidency, they are still getting their bearings' to 'honestly, they have a plan', to 'it seems like they made some mistakes here and there'. And then it *really* went downhill from there.

Eight years, watching and reading the news. I am a history and politics nut, I am a little obsessive about staying up to date about current events. And so as the unmitigated shitshow of the Bush-Cheney presidency continued, it became harder and harder to excuse and explain what a colossal fuckup it all was. The invasion of Iraq was especially egregious- I am a veteran, and I know you never, ever start a second front in a war unless you have the first front defeated, and we haven't truly defeated the Taliban even now 17 years after 9/11.

But it was really Katrina that did it for me,in the end.

I watched the news, read the reports online. And really, at some point, a rational human mind has to consider the fact that maybe this isn't incompetence, maybe it isn't politics- maybe these people just genuinely do not give a damn about these US citizens because they are black and don't vote Republican. 

I spent a year or two completely re-evaluating my political compass. I read a lot of wonkish stuff from both sides.  Over a decade later, I am a registered Democrat who voted for Bernie Sanders in the Dem primaries, and gritted my teeth and voted for Clinton for president ( I have a lot of issues with her, but there is no way this nation would be the dumpster fire it is now if she had won).

So yeah, that was a pretty big change for me.

They wouldn't let him near enough the window for me to hand him the handset. They were hackles up, front legs braced, dripping saliva snarling at this person. I told him to try the neighbors and the dogs wouldn't let him near the neighbors house either. He eventually got backed off the whole property. Never seen them behave like that before or since...

I am aware of a situation in which the official report a woman claimed to be raped in the military and sexually assaulted in front of several people, by one person. All of the ""witnesses"" denied that and thought it was pretty much in possible for her story to take place as it was in an incredibly public setting.

The guy accused of rape denied it, and made accusations that they had slept together in the past when he was drunk but thought this story came from him denying her advances while sober because he ""only found her attractive while drunk."" 

The girl wrote xyz, in her report, and I heard her tell the story to her coworkers as ABC. In a different setting, with significantly changed details. The story she told people not tied into the legal process was that she had woke up being raped at a party. 

Her official statement said she had been raped in a military facility in front of several people while on duty. I reported what I was aware of to the people who would need to know.

The guy who was accused of rape went to jail for  years, and was removed from the service. "

Women who worked in a factory in New York during WWII. They used radium to create glow in the dark watch dials. The watches were used by soldiers in the trenches. They used radium because it glowed. And the girls straight up LICKED THE PAINT BRUSHES WITH RADIUM ON THEM TO GET THE PAINT BRUSHES FORMED INTO POINTS FOR WRITING. That's how they were trained to do their jobs.


Radium destroyed the bones of the dial painters. Mouths had to be wired shut, entire jaw bones came out during dentist appts, leg bones straight up disintegrated. The Radium Girls helped create OSHA. The employer knew the radium was bad, but well... money makes men stupid. So they told the girls it was fine. The girls would purposely wear evening gowns to work and sprinkle themselves with the radium powder so that they sparkled in the dark on their dates at night. Back then, people thought radium in small doses was healthy. *sighs* The employer even went so far as to lie on the death certificates or make sure there was a lie on it so that they could not possibly be at fault for the deaths of the girls. 

The bones of The Radium Girls? They are STILL glowing in their graves today because radium has a half life of 1600 years. Terrible way to die.

The women were raped before death. The children had acid burns. Evidence of torture was evident. Those are facts.

* that I was crossing the lanes (it's midnight and was raining hard), and 
* that I was speeding (he had been riding my tail the entire time to the point where I couldn't see his headlights behind me.  I'd slow down to let him pass; he didn't; so I sped up and he stayed right on me) 

He never turned on his lights.  He said he'd let me go this time, but before leaving he asked me if that was where I lived.

He's at his desk one day on his computer when he goes to readjust a bit and goes a tad too far causing the joystick to get caught in the forward position underneath the desk.  The wheelchair begins scooting itself under the desk, it has a surprising amount of torque.  Realizing that he is about to be crushed he starts screaming for help.

Fortunately his roommate was right next to him and managed to get to the emergency shut off, though he still ended up with fractures in his ribs.

The reason they don't mess with tourists is because tourists are bringing tons of cash flow into the country and one bad story would be enough to heavily impact that flow.  There has been murders in the past 2 years that were gang related, but these occurred mostly in places tourists aren't going and the victims were not tourists.

Jonah isn't a lone actor in this story...he is a symbol for the vocation of Israel to be a flagpost for God's glory in all of the world. Jonah's reluctance to do god's bidding is a microcosm of the problems Israel has in fulfilling its vocation. 

Jonah is really a metaphor for the story of Israel...getting swallowed by the whale is a way to communicate exile. This is a national story told as a narrative about 1 lone actor.

The principle behind TOR is secure enough, any node on the network will only know the content of the package if they are the intended receiver and that part will work. What FBI et. al. do is side channel attacks + sybil attacks (and quite possibly others), so instead of attacking the content, they look at the pattern, they try to get you through browser vulnerabilities, they try to get you through javascript etc. And they will get you.

2752,"Hey man, don't be too hard on yourself.

The reality of life is that the person you are at the age of five is not the same person you are at fifteen, and twenty, and twenty five. People grow and change, and they meet new people and their interests expand and evolve.

You don't have to be friends forever to have had a good friendship. Being friends for life isn't mandatory and being friends for a long time doesn't guarantee that you've got a friendship in the future. You don't owe anybody your friendship, it should be a gift given freely and shared with pleasure.

Yeah, your old friend was probably somewhat unhappy as the two of you grew apart and you moved on to be friends with other people - I felt the same when a friend of mine from childhood ascended into the 'popular' group in highschool.

But the truth is that she was never out to hurt me, she'd just changed and so had I. She got an opportunity to get into a better position socially and, while I missed her and I did feel a bit abandoned for a while, I also understood that this was the way of the world. Time passed, I met other friends, I forged new relationships. 

We bumped into each other in the pub one christmas maybe ten years after we both left school and you know what? It was really good to see her, and it was good to hear what she'd been up to, but I realised it had been a long time, a very long time since I'd missed her. And I also realised that, if we'd have met there and then for the first time as adults? We probably wouldn't have been friends.

So go easy on yourself. One of the most excellent things about our teen years is that we are permitted to make mistakes, we're all just learning the ropes of adult interaction for a few years. We do the best that we can and sometimes that means that we reflect back and can see our mistakes as a part of the bigger picture."

&gt; 
&gt; When you prejudge someone, are you more prone to prejudge based on race, culture or national origin?

I'd say definitely culture. National origin means fuck all which is why Europeans tend to rib on Americans for thinking theyre Irish, Italian, German or whatever. Because we view our nationality as a function of culture and not genetics. Here its only the racists who tend to equate ethnicity with nationality so as to ""disavow"" black/brown/asians from being ""truly"" of x nationality. "

And to add to that, Assyria does eventually destroy Israel and carry off the people as slaves.

2774,"The reason behind God barring Moses from entering the Promised Land is kinda ridiculous to me, but hey that’s OT Yahweh. 

Numbers 20:8-12 “8Take the staff and assemble the community, you and Aaron your brother, and in their presence command the rock to yield its waters. Thereby you will bring forth water from the rock for them, and supply the community and their livestock with water. 9So Moses took the staff from its place before the LORD, as he was ordered. 10Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, where he said to them, “Just listen, you rebels! Are we to produce water for you out of this rock?” 11Then, raising his hand, Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, and water came out in abundance, and the community and their livestock drank. 12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron: Because you did not have confidence in me, to acknowledge my holiness before the Israelites, therefore you shall not lead this assembly into the land I have given them.”

Basically Moses tried to make a power move in front of the rebellious Israelites instead of giving the credit for making water flow from rock to God and he disobeyed God’s orders (hit the rock with his staff, didn’t talk to it). I mean, technically Moses did wrong, but that’s some petty shit IMO."

[2.] ""The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself'

On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.""

Mathew 22:37-41 NASB

Also, just so you understand:

""All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.""

2 Timothy 3:16-17

Do not encourage throwing out scripture.

Nine hours later, just before docking, crap is piled higher than the rim in all the toilets, all the restroom garbage cans are full of used toilet paper, floors and walls are filthy, water everywhere.

2846,"Some guy did a full martial arts routine in the crosswalk at a stoplight. 
I was at Denny's and this dude was not paying for who I assume to be his date's meal and she got pissed off. He laughed at her as she got up to leave and told her to fuck off. She stood there and he just kept eating. Finally he laughed again and told her to 'get the fuck on'. Right after she walked out 'I'm the Man' started playing on the radio and he just kept eating. 
Also I watched a guy take a shit on the ground outside IHOP. "

It wouldnt really have effected my job but a nice fan of mine sent me a link to a website which was basically a guy saving and building doxing profiles on like hundreds of girls.

Saving all of their pictures and then had information that was slowly trying to build their location, social media profiles, real names, etc.

They didnt have much info on me yet but it looked like they were planning on blackmailing all these girls, myself included, once they had enough personal info.

Creeped me out and that was the end of it. "

2859,"I had been friends with this girl for several years throughout middle school and highschool and even after that until she did something that annoyed the shit out of me. I had told her one day that i'm a camgirl. She had a lot of questions which I answered honestly and she didn't really mind. 

A little while later she asked me how she could start doing it because she was in desperate need of cash and I gave her the talk about it, I told her the pro's and the con's (and sometimes the con's are really terrible). She apparently decided it'd be to much work, and then followed up by asking me if she could borrow several thousand dollars from me. I told her no, I couldn't afford to loan that much, and at that point could hardly afford my own debts. She quit talking to me at that point, and occasionally messages me only to ask for money. I cut her off after that...considering that's the only thing she cares about now. "
2860,"That's good to hear! It's a long story, thanks for asking. It happened last year. We were best friends since high school, for 11 years. We've helped each other out and did a lot for each other over the years. I trusted her so much. More than my own family. I was planning on making her my power of attorney.

Her mom has a lot of mental health issues (somewhere along the lines of cluster B personality disorders, from what I could tell) and I think she started developing them, too. She can't tell the difference anymore between someone trying to help her and someone that will hurt her. Distorted sense of reality. Lying and hiding stuff. Can't see the red flags when you meet people and get to know them. Started doing risky behaviors like driving while openly smoking weed (in a state where recreational isn't legal) and being promiscuous.  She started getting rebellious. 

Essentially the communication broke down. I couldn't say anything to her without her being offended or bringing up totally unrelated subjects. The nail in the coffin was two things: my grandparents offered her a place to rent out, but they didn't trust her boyfriend and said he couldn't live there too. So she freaked out and started insulting them and saying they were out to get her. (If you knew my grandparents, you would know that it's a crazy accusation.) Also she and I were supposed to work on a project together. I didn't have the tools and resources to do it, so I backed out. She called me unprofessional, said I was making excuses and acting cowardly, and was completely not understanding that I just didn't want to do a bad job. I was fucking pissed. Also, she insulted my boyfriend at the time. She insulted everything important to me.

So I ended it that night. Last I heard, she was still acting childish and that (now ex) boyfriend of hers treated her like shit. And now she's dating a married man. My life is boring compared to that. I work my jobs and my friendships with people are fun and easy going. I have a new best friend, a guy this time. We love to cook for fun."

2863,"It's worth pointing out that the neighbors who called the cops were three black women, and that the victim was a Laotian 14 year old. The white cops believed the only other white person there, rather than listening to a group of black women or caring about a naked, bleeding, unable to communicate Laotian child."
2864,"Yeah when I was renting my parent's basement apartment they would wander in whenever they pleased. I didn't mind them coming down to visit but I just wanted a courtesy knock. They would always forget to knock and couldn't understand why it pissed me off. 

When I was getting ready to move out they kept telling me I could stay there longer. I explained to them that part of the reason I was moving was to get some privacy. The look on their faces when they realized they were losing their rental income due to it was priceless. "
2865,"I'm from Minnesota. I had a roommate in college from India. He didn't get anything right clothing wise. Being too cold is not like being too warm. Too warm is uncomfortable, too cold hurts. I don't think people understand that until they feel it."

You hear everything, but by far the the most poignant, and the ones that have stuck with me are the wishes from the Children in orphanages and foster care.  The young girl who only wanted ""her Brother's leg to get better"" and the little girl who asked Santa to ""make her parents love each other again."", broke my heart.  When I go to these type of functions, I know I am going to hear something that is going to make me cry later, but Santa still needs to say something that might make the child feel a little better without making any promises.

It's definitely polished enough to use as an every day OS. I personally prefer it to Windows 10 which tries to sell you stuff and take your data more than it tries at being an operating system. 

As far as development goes it heavily depends on what you're coding. For C i would use it every day over Windows. All jet brains products are available for Linux which should give enough support for most languages.  

The only thing you can't really do on Linux as well as on Windows is anything that requires Microsoft Office. No open source suite comes close to what Office offers.

2885,"I was told this by one of the former presidents of my fraternity when I got elected president and I’ve told this to everyone who has been president or wanted to be president after me: 


Becoming in charge of a bunch of people is going to cost you friendships that you had with them, and it is a very lonely and thankless job. There will always be people unhappy with the decisions you make, and sometimes your former friends will feel betrayed because you’re not going out of your way to benefit them. Sometimes you will have to reprimand the people you thought were your friends, and they’ll hold it against you. It sucks, some of them will stick with you through it, but you’ll feel really isolated. You’re doing everything you can to make sure things run well, but they all see you as the bad guy because you’re enforcing rules and punishing people for their actions. "

2888,"How to get in to college. Neither of my parents went to college and for some reason I figured someone would basically hold my hand through everything - “——, this is how you figure out where you’d like to go.”, “——, this is how you apply to those colleges.”, “——, this is how you get the scholarships that you’re surely smart enough to deserve.”, so on and etcetera.

Instead, no one held my hand and by the time I figured out that I had to send applications, there was really only time for a nearby community college and a small college nearby. And of course, I’d be going to the first one that replied back positively, thus beginning my descent to this uneducated, forever-working, useless life I lead....

One day annoying student decides to cheat on my friends test by getting a friend to send her the answers. Her friend had a different version. My friend then blatantly sees that she put the answers to the other version on her test. My friend pittied her and gave her a second chance to redeem herself. She failed the second test. She then told mommy that my friend had intentionally given her a harder test to ""watch her fail"". She left out the part where she was given a different test in the first place because she cheated on the other. So mommy comes into school, screams at my friend and the principal for being unfair. She then gets the mouthful of what her daughter had done, and CONTINUES to scream about how what happened was ""unfair"". Principal gets deputies to escort her out with a write up in hand for her daughter for 10 days suspension and a note that says getting caught cheating automatically kicks you out of any honors society's, clubs, and potential scholarship money from certain organizations. All of that could have been avoided if rich gold digger student hadn't tried to worm her way out of ONE bad grade. She later passed that class with a D."

2917,"Was just talking about this yesterday's in the other creepy story thread. Her name is Colleen Stan. 

She wasn't kept in the box for the entire time, however. It's even more fucked up than that.

She was kidnapped while hitchhiking in May of 1977 by Cameron and Janice Hooker. She thought they looked safe to get a ride from because of Janice and their infant child in the van.

They kept her in a box for 22-23 hours a day, only letting her out to be molested and sexually assaulted. Janice didn't want to do bondage for Cameron anymore, and this was their compromise. Initially, intercourse wasn't allowed, so she was forced to perform oral sex on Cameron and sexually assaulted with ""instruments"", and the Janice and Cameron would have sex.

In January of 1978, she was forced to sign a contract giving herself into slavery to Cameron. During this time she was told daily that Cameron worked for ""The Company"" and that ""The Company"" would kill her and torture and kill her family if she fled or told anyone the truth. Eventually, she was allowed to help around the house, garden, and even go jogging without supervision. Despite access to a phone, neighbors and relative freedom, she didn't flee. 

In 1981, she was even allowed to visit with her family. The first day, alone. The second, with Cameron posing as her boyfriend. She didn't say anything. Her family thought maybe she joined a cult because she was wearing homemade clothes and acting unusual.

After this visit, Cameron decided she had too much freedom and she went back into the box for some time. The timeline here gets a bit wonky, as it says for the next three years in most sources, but it doesn't quite fit. Anyhow, it was probably at least two years.

After this time, she was again given freedom, and even took a job as a housekeeper at a motel outside of the home.

Janice eventually told her that Cameron didn't work for ""The Company"", but claimed it still existed. Colleen fled. She called Cameron from a bus station and told him she was leaving. He apparently burst into tears over the phone. 

She went home to her parents, and said nothing. She even stayed in contact with the Hookers, calling them periodically over the next three months. She kept quiet because Janice had asked her to and wanted to give Cameron a chance to change and be a good man. 

After about three months, Janice turned in Cameron and reported him to the police, accusing him of murdering another hitchhiker shortly before they kidnapped Colleen. 

Janice was given full immunity for her testimony against Cameron. 

Cameron wasn't due for parole until 2023, but due to his age and health was given an early hearing in 2015 that was denied. His next parole hearing will be in 2022.

Like, in American Idol, I've heard that the producers have a hell of a lot of input into who gets through auditions, what the judges say on camera, etc. I think the logic is that, at the end of the day, there's still a TV show to make, that has to be both entertaining but also legit.

I wonder of part of it also is to be the 'every man' and keep the judges a bit closer to Earth. Like, to a record producer who's heard every type of singer (good/bad) under the sun, they could pick apart someone and reject them, but to the average audience, they could sound 'good enough' and also be pretty/entertaining/interesting enough to want to have on at least a couple of episodes, even though they'll eventually get eliminated. With the cooking stuff, if could be a similar thing of, ""This isn't a 5-star kitchen like you're used to, and this dish is good enough for them to continue.""

I watch a lot of Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmares/Hotel Hell, where he rejects basically everything that's ever cooked for him. I know that this is probably 90% just for the drama of the show of ""OMG everything is so shit! WTF?!"", but he's also a guy that is used to 5-star food that he cooks himself, goes to the best restaurants, etc... so of course that $10 chicken/pizza/pasta tasted like shit to him... but, for a $10 dish, was it probably actually okay? Sure, it could be improved, but his pallet is just too refined to give an objective opinion."

Ha, I'm of Chinese descent, though my mum doesn't cook that much. She has a story of when she worked for her uncle's Chinese restaurant up in Darwin, but. Some white guy asked for peas in his fried rice, kept sending it back.

Uncle wasn't happy about that. Ended up walking out of the kitchen, and tearing the white guy a new one in broken English. 

Except...well, he had the cleaver still in his hand. As you do when you're a Chinese cook. It's welded there. Just forgot about it. 

White guy was very, very quiet after that.

Don't ever ask for peas in the fried rice.

That ended when I was cooking dinner at my ex's house, and saw just how annoying and tedious it is to always be looking for the right knife, and how many had to be washed at the end.
&gt;
&gt;As long as a knife is sharp and cuts well, you really only need 1 or two. No need to make things complicated.

Exactly. I think half the reason you end up switching out so many damn knives is because you have to keep hunting for a sharp one, because no one wants to maintain a dozen slightly different knives. Every time I've seen someone switch a knife out of a knife block it's because the one they've got is blunt, not because it was impractical for the purpose.

If you're starting out, spend big (relative to your budget) on a really, really good chef's nice, and that's 98% of your knife use right there. I use mine (I've got like three of them) for everything from chopping huge chunks of meat, slicing onions, dicing chilli, and mincing garlic (a garlic press is one of the most repugnant tools out there...) Something that lets your knuckles clear the cutting board, and you're golden. 

Hell, one of my favourite is a Mundial 5510 - a 10"" food service knife. The kinda thing you'd use in a commercial food factor kitchen (it's even NSF certified!). It was like $40AU. Good steel, good grip, nice profile. Had that for - gosh - nigh on twenty years now. Doesn't look fancy, of course. Looks the business, however. Made in Brazil...by Germans!

The final 2% can be handled by a 3"" paring knife, for any really fiddly work you may do. I hate the cheap Victorinox chef's knives, but their little parers are damn good, and they're like $7AU. 

Buy a diamond or ceramic stick for sharpening - as well as a steel for steeling. 

Finally, if you graduate to a bit more advanced cooking, you might want to get a boning knife. Again, I got another Mundial. Like my 5510, got this one from a hunting shop for like $25. I use it for boning out legs of lamb ('Straya!)

If you need a cleaver, find a Chinese grocer and buy the biggest, heaviest one you can. Yes, it's ""cheap"". But the Chinese perfected the cleaver a thousand damn years ago. Crack bones with it.

No, you don't need a filleting knife, unless you're out on a boat and have a lot of fish to clean, or you eat fresh, whole fish every damn day. Every chef on the planet fillets with a chef's knife. You'll eventually start referring to a filleting knife as ""that useless floppy knife"". 

5-6"" paring knives are kinda in the no-man's-land between the short parer and a chef's knife, and you'll end up using it for stuff you can use the chef's for. 

Carving knife? Chef's knife'll do, unless you eat a lot of bony roasts. 

Carving fork? You should be using tongs, anyway. Save the juices.

Oh, and for god's sake, unless you really, really, REALLY know what the hell you're doing, DO NOT BUY THOSE $700 HIGHLY-SPECIFIC HAND-FORGED DAMASCUS CARBON STEEL JAPANESE KNIVES that each are made for one ultra-specific task, especially the ones that are harden to like 63 Rockwell C, unless you like keeping your knives in an oiled, velvet-line box. Those things are just wank factor only."

What it really means is if the customer (in the abstract) doesn't buy your product, it's not because they're stupid, or unable to see quality, or whatnot. It's because, in one way or another, you're not doing what you need to do to sell your product, or you have a bad product.

He also enjoyed getting to know other patients kids and would creepily stare at any kid with a school uniform.   
  
My dad would purposely make me stand well away from him and not talk to him because of how creepy he was behaving. We looked him up on the web and it turned out he had been done for pedophilia.

Like how the first sergeant from a prior unit tried to deny me re-enlistment by basically falsifying documents, and how she and my new boss were best buds and there was that time I called her a cunt where he could hear it. There was also the untreated depression and alcoholism that may or may not have been related to my duties. There is also the bit about my wife getting sick and needing ever increasing levels of care and the military just not giving a fuck about that, but in the end, those are just excuses. The ""sounds like you aren't the type to follow orders or listen to your superiors, ie exactly not the type for military service"" really nails it. I was kind of a rebellious criminal type that decided I need to get my shit together before I got myself in some real trouble and I thought the military was the responsible thing to do in that situation. It worked out in the end, but I just wasn't a good fit for military service. Too much independent thought and the tendency to voice my opinions.

3000,"Uncompleted scenes still end in a paycheck. Or they split it into two shoots. I've redded during a scene and still got a callback from said company. Truth is, the bigger a name you are, the more freedom you may feel you have since you lack pressure to prove yourself as a selling point for scenes. This is a very real, but mostly internal, concern for a lot of models.

My guess? A lot of BDSM sites have trouble finding true blue masochists. And a lot of girls doing model calls for shoots are professional adult performers, but this may not be their choice of shoot. Pay can be good - one shoot would cover all my expenses for a month. To live the high life, I only had to work a couple days a month (although since you work as a private contractor, 1/3 or your income is forfeit to taxes). That being said, I am BDSM lover first and a performer second. I have no issues calling red and didn't hang my career hat on modeling, so my case may have been different from many many adult models.

Companies absolutely schedule their shoots depending on who sells best and is easiest to work with. In a pain based industry, that can be a tricky thing to navigate."

Besides being hot, high-speed, and stressful, the long hours on your feet, bending, stretching, and lifting are hell on your body. You work unusual hours, often early in the morning or late at night and most likely have an inconsistent schedule that completely destroys your circadian rythym. And on top of (and partially because of) all of that you only hang out with other industry people, most of whom do drugs or drink.

Just for the record, the best chefs are actually potheads. They usually like to drink, but not so much that they shake or come in every day with terrible hangovers. They're creative, hungry, and usually pretty fun to be around. Sometimes they're lazy but most of those wash out before long. 

The worst are alcoholics. They steal liquor and box wine (I was had one chug a bottle of sweet vermouth when I wasn't looking) and occasionally have too much and become unsteady and dangerous to their co-workers. There's nothing scarier than watching a shit-faced drunk playing with knives and fire in a cramped, hot space full of other lunatics that are also playing with knives and fire."

As we got closer we saw that it was in the middle of this ancient rusted iron fence. We tied our horses to the fence and found all these Revolutionary War Era headstones and a bunch of empty graves.

3113,"I once stole a couple hundred wheat pennies from my dead grandfathers collection...

It wasn't for drugs, I was like 8 and thought it was just a jar of pennies. Over the next year, I kept finding them as I was cleaning my room and my mom would give me two pennies for them.

My grandma did sell off most of his collection, but everything that remains is in a box under my bed."
3114,That is some victim blaming ass mentality.
3115,"I have no problem talking about it, heh. My apologies for a long-winded rant, but it should give you a good idea of why I stopped talking to my sister and why I don't go out of my way to visit my mom despite the fact that I pass her house about a dozen times each week taking my son to and from training. It's a 45 minute drive each way from our house, and my mom lives 5 minutes from the soccer complex he trains at.


Before my sister's initial arrest, I'd cut off contact so if they were to be at a family gathering and her boyfriend would be invited I simply wouldn't bring my kids or show up. I have 3 sisters and they all knew what was going on and why, and though it upset my mom that I wasn't willing to budge on it she learned to deal with it. My daughter is now 19 (tomorrow), and my son 13 so they're old enough that they've formed their own opinions of the guy. I told my mom and sisters that he's nobody I want my kids to be around due to his history of drug use and stealing, and I couldn't believe they were willing to put up with it.


My sister is a good person outside when she's spun. She's always had a job, saves her money (how we were able to get her a storage locker for 9-10 months), supports herself and her boyfriend who will only do odd jobs or paint houses for pay under the table, and she tries to be a good mother. Her boyfriend, however, is 54 or 55 (my sister is 38) and cannot get a real job for fear of wage garnishment for one of his other 2 kids he refuses to support. He has an arrest record a mile long with drug, theft and child support charges (brags about having SEVEN DUI charges), and has stolen and sold their family groceries and his own son's piggy bank and xbox 360 + games more than once to get drunk or high.


When my nephew was born, his dad left the hospital immediately after the birth and took a cab to a nearby bar where he proceeded to run his mouth and get his ass kicked and sent to jail for public intox and other charges. When being booked that night, he had active warrants and ended up spending 6 months in jail for failure to pay child support, failure to appear in court and something else. Model citizen and father.


I'm 41 (tomorrow) and don't have the desire to deal with people like that. This isn't a depression issue, and I honestly don't even think about it unless I have to. I only posted this because you asked, and perhaps some of this is relatable. It's not anything I'm getting off my chest, just a full disclosure of why I cut off contact. I just threw up a wall and refuse to budge and my wife and kids all agree it's for the best. My mom and stepdad tried to do the same, but my sister will go MIA if they don't let her boyfriend come around so they cave and despite hating the guy they act like everything's cool so they can see their grandson.


Like I said, I'm too old for the shit so it's whatever for me. I work full time, my son plays academy soccer and trains or plays 12 months a year for his club and ODP teams, often 6 days a week, and I referee 25-30 weekends a year (youth through collegiate matches) throughout the midwest so it's easy to forget about extended family drama and just worry about my wife and kids and my own busy schedule."

3273,"Honestly, the most important thing I learned by reading the program source of the BAS, is people should not fucking touch the BAS...

Another RTU had common issues starting in spring, supposedly. I was working at a different building. When I came to this building, I asked why the outside air damper was manually forced to be set to 10% open. I was told ""It was drawing too much outside hot air and people in those officers complained"". But the problems still occured during the mornings. Turned out, the program had kept the cooling stages off if the outside air temp was less than 65 degrees, and the damper could be opened more. That program would loop every few seconds, see the damper open 10%, tell it to open more (but couldnt, because it was set to force 10% manual mode), then wait a few seconds, and loop again (but surprise, its only ever going to be 10%...). If they would have set it to auto, instead of thinking they were smarter than the system, it would open the damper, letting outside cool air in, or it would see it opened to 90%, still not cooling enough, and turn on a compressor stage.

Now I yell at people when I see them at the BAS workstation.

EDIT: The reason the problem only occured during the mornings, is it skipped the economizer section of code if the outside air temp reading was greater than 65 degrees."

&gt;“Thus far mutations in about eight genes are known to cause obesity in humans. But these mutations account for under five percent of the obesity in our society, and certainly are not, by themselves, responsible for the current obesity epidemic, since the mutation rate in these genes could not have changed dramatically during the past twenty years,”

TLDR; Obesity generally isn't caused by genetics, but it can be.

3301,"One of my employees is from Cambodia and lived through this. One day there were some people who were sick and so I stepped in to help out on the line, I ended up working beside him all day. We started talking and he told me most of his life story. I thought I knew about Pol Pot from history books and movies etc., but I had no idea about the scale of the atrocity nor the depth of what can be done.

He grew up in Phnom Penh so right away when the communists started killing people they specifically focused on the big cities because they thought they were better than the farmers. They were educated so they were the first to go. If you had glasses you were killed. If you had a long nose (sign of potential French background) you were killed. If you had money you were killed. My employee spent an entire year in prison when he was 16 just for being from the city. They would routinely put him in a hole filled with water for most of the day - the level of the water was so high that he would have to stand on the tips of his feet in order to be able to breath. When he was let out he was put to work. They would be forced to farm for 16 - 20 hours a day. If they made it through they day they would be fed. If they worked slow they would not be fed. If they didn't work, they were killed. 

Everything belonged to the state. All of the fish, all of the animals and all of the people. One day one of his friends fathers caught some fish to feed his family - they were all so hungry all the time. His son, being a good little communist, told the local police about his dad stealing the fish from the country. They publicly executed his father in the town square - the catch here is that it was the son who was forced to do it. 

I listened to his stories, and it saddened me. They I saw the reactions of others around me, no one believed him. His own son doesn't believe his stories of his past. People around here just cannot believe that something this bad could be done by people. I think that is the worst part of all of the terrible things that we as humans do. We choose to forget what we are capable of and repeat the past mistakes because of our ignorance. Just think of how many countries have faced this: Germany, Russia, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Congo, Algeria, Canada (first nations), Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Zanzibar, Guatemala, Bangladesh, Burundi, North Korea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and now Syria.

3329,"If you are in the US, law school is an expensive proposition, in both money, time, and effort.

Pay for lawyers is very bimodal. You either go to the big law firms that pay 6 figures off the bat, or you work in a small or mid sized firm earning a modest income.  

As you can imagine, there is no free lunch. Getting into big law firms as a fresh graduate pretty much requires you to go to the top law schools with fantastic grades and internship experience (or similar). These law firms are literally buying your time and you work long, arduous hours.  And I mean *long*.

Law school is actually pretty practical and sets out the skills you will need as a lawyer. It is basically a whole lot of reading comprehension, analysis, and then writing an essay on your views of what laws apply and how.  This is basically what we do all day. Even trial advocates.  This surprisingly applies in virtually all law schools across to world, (as I've been told) for both Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions.

Before you go into law, I **strongly** recommend that you try some experience at a law firm as an intern, since you will need it anyways if you proceed. A lot of it will be minor clerical and research work regardless of which practice area.  Not many lawyers actually get to argue cases before the court , if that is what you are looking for.

If you are outside the USA where fees are more affordable or can be done as a bachelor's degree, then it is less pressure. But it still stands that good paying firms = good grades and school.

A few minutes of digging I found at least three highly upvoted threads referencing it. So it seems like it's a very well respected idea in your community. And that's just a few minutes worth of digging like I said. There's probably dozens more, but the fact there's a single one and it's positive is already enough to indict your cult of being absolutely baseless in their beliefs. It's insanity. 


&gt;You just present your tired talking points without any LOGIC.


Yeah, when you ignore 90% of my post I'm sure that would be the case. What about your mental gymnastics I pointed out? Or the comment I cited that displays the levels of critical thinking (absent) on display there? Or the blatantly false information I cited? 


&gt;Logically, how can you make any claim of ""your entire group thinks this way or that""? Logically??


Because I cited evidence of EXACTLY that being the case. Plenty of it. There was no missile that was shot at AF1. But that doesn't stop any of you from inserting head into sphincter and pretending it actually happened anyways. 


What happened in August? Answer me that. Go ahead. I'll wait. I mean you're just going to ignore any points I made in favor of trying to be dismissive due to not being able to actually respond. It's a pretty transparent tactic. I hope you know no one will actually trust your fraudulent attempt to dismiss real problems. You probably think you're really clever though, and that's the problem.

The couldn’t find anything to eat besides a snake they shot so when they came across a black village that didn’t speak English they tried to buy a chicken. The language barrier was too much and one of them ended up throwing money on the ground before walking away with a chicken. Later as they were cooking it the sheriff pulled up and told them that a villager had ran to the police station saying someone stole a chicken. I guess this one spoke a little English. The sheriff told them those people had no use for money and that he’d have to take them to the station. One of them asked what was the crime and all the sheriff said was “ wanting chicken”.

3346,"There's a widely perpetuated myth that the whole of Africa was uncivilized and savage before they were colonized by the Europeans that really bugs me. There were plenty of highly developed city/states, kingdoms, and empires that had established manufacturing and trade practices already. These people weren't living in mud huts, they had well planned cities, roads, and grand buildings and structures.

They also were already actively trading with countries like Portugal, and even Britain who had merchants describe places like the Kingdom of Benin as being full of noble buildings ruled over by a powerful king. There was already relations and trade for with the West for hundreds of years, and they thrived, until England intentionally burned the entire thing to the ground and ~~invaded~~ colonized by force. This is a fairly common theme with African Kingdoms prior to colonization. 

Don't kid yourself for a second and think that colonization was the thing that brought western goods and exchange of ideas, that existed for hundreds of years prior to colonization. Nor was colonization in any way really mutually beneficial at all. It was one country, getting greedy and wanting ownership of another country's natural resources and then deciding to take them by force - often from civilizations that were already thriving, on a continent that was home to global hubs of learning like Timbuktu(or you know, Egypt and stuff) was at one time.

You have to talk these customers down, because being aggressive solves nothing, and simply refusing just means they will call back.

Fun story: a coworker got a call with a customer saying they had been promised a ludicrous amount of things that weren't within the scope of what could be given, nevertheless available. He reviewed the notes on the account and asked the caller a few questions before leaning back in his chair and stating ""ma'am, I promise you none of those things were offered to you.""

I think it's because in a text, a period at the end is unnecessary; the fact that the text ended serves as the close of the sentence. So having a period to end the sentence at the end of the text comes across as FINAL.

But I use periods on reddit 100% of the time, never even considered to do otherwise. I think it's because texting is a back and forth, and you expect the other person to respond. On reddit, there's no real expectation that the other person will respond to you."

So the first major thing that controls our sexual experience is hormones. Once my body started running on estrogen *everything* changed. The way I experience arousal went from “oh I’ve got an erection guess I’m horny” to this amazing experience. It starts as like a warm feeling in my gut that slowly spreads throughout my body. Slowly getting stronger and stronger till it’s like electricity running through my whole body. The same thing happened with orgasms. They went from the basic short dick-centric ones to full body ones. When I come it’s like waves of pleasure running through my entire body. It’s honestly like black and white vs colour. 

In terms of the surgery itself, they just put the analogous parts back where they should be. The glans becomes the clit, the penile skin becomes the labia, the scrotal skin becomes the canal. And believe me, the nerves work hahah

In terms of sensation/functionality, I’m just like a cis girl. The pleasure nerves are in my clit, and the canal itself just has touch nerves, so penetration only feels good when I’m in the mood. And well I usually need to play with my clit to finish.

Now, you're talking about logic and rationality. What's more likely? That somehow one of the most heinous videos on the face of the planet mysteriously disappeared and no one thought to make a copy of it, and this depicts events of a 70 something year old lady skinning a child, or someone made the claim up?


Your entire group rejects any logic-based thinking and you guys ALWAYS side with what you WANT to be true as opposed to what actually is. I can say that as a generalization and be right 95%+ of the time. If you guys actually applied any rationality to your cult, it would have crumbled before it ever started. 


&gt;that the presence of crazy people in a broad movement does not necessarily mean the premise of the movement is crazy?


This is not a broad movement and is *primarily* crazy people. You guys are currently LARPing about a missile fired at airforce one. The source? Your own asses. Why? So you can ""explain"" why this thing that didn't happen, happened, and you get to pretend someone is trying to kill Trump because ""muh deep state"".

&gt;Q confirms our suspicions that embattled FBI Lawyer Lisa Page is indeed in the Hyde Park, London photos that Q previously dropped.


&gt;This is further confirmation of Q. That Q team has access to the cameras were the photos were taken so, therefore, there is a level of cooperation between the UK and USA on the investigation into the election rigging by Obama's Admin


Here's a random quote from a comment on your board. What's this in reference to? An indecipherable blurry picture. You guys *make shit up* whenever it's convenient. That's not logic. That's insanity. 


&gt;I think it's already happened. Q didn't say the world would know the truth in July just that it'd be when the world learnt the truth i.e. history looking back will point to this month that the FISA report first unveiled the epic level of corruption, Lisa Page, etc.



Look at your mental gymnastics here. Every single Q prediction fails unbelievably hard (What happened last August? Oh yeah, nothing). And you guys scurry like rats to justify it somehow. You're not remotely looking for anything true. You're looking for what you **want** to believe. Pretending it's anything more than that is dishonest and makes you a liar, too. "

At undergrad it's like this most places:

40-50 = 3rd.(lowest pass). 50-60= 2:2 (or lower second). 60-70 = 2:1 (upper second) and 70+ is first class.

At individual modules these may be shifted to say D, C, B and A.

Masters vary more on style but often work on 50-60 = pass. 60-70 = pass with merit. 70+ = pass with distinction.

This can change in places that have a purely exam based curriculum. But that's not so common as far as I know."

3491,"I agree the two professors would feel differently in the instant it happened.

Meanwhile, if a guy student tried to tell the administration that a female professor touched him, he'd be laughed outta Dodge. 

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, the outcomes for the student's and professor would be much more severe/problematic for the male in either situation because of the  victim mentality only being associated with females in sexual situations. In both cases the victim is the professor, not the female, which seems obvious but many of these situations are not handled that way. In the same way, that the student should face the same fate, but they won't because of the difference in mentality you pointed out.

I try to find good tv shows for them to watch on low volume (or to at least put on something other than the news) so the rooms aren’t ever too quiet. Sometimes if patients don’t talk or just say gibberish, I just talk to them about random stuff, like asking them if they think the countertops a couple chose on some HGTV show are ridiculous too, or I’ll ask them if they’ve ever lived in a house by the beach or something, even if they don’t talk back.
Sometimes I try to guess what music they’d like and I’ll put my Spotify on, or if they’re all ornery, I’ll play a zen station or lullaby renditions of songs so they’ll be able to rest. 

Sometimes, I just make stuff up and go along with their stories if they’re really confused and nothing else is helping, like they’re refusing to eat, so while I’m feeding them, I’ll tell them that I cooked them the meatloaf/spaghetti/potatoes that they like the best, so they’ll definitely want to finish them up before they get cold, or I’ll tell them I snuck them an extra special snack and we have to hurry and eat it before anyone else sees that they got the best piece/last pudding cup/whatever. 

When they get all agitated and try to get up in the middle of the night to “turn off the stove” or something, I just tell them I already double checked and it’s off and they relax, or if they keep trying to leave to “check on the kids,” I make up a place that the kids are that sounds fun, like on a camping trip or at Disney World and I’ll make up stuff they’re doing there if they keep getting worried about little things (“I got my dinner! They don’t have dinner! I have to bring them mine!” “No, that’s yours! Besides, they’re cooking hotdogs over the campfire, remember? They can’t eat spaghetti at a campground!

3573,"My freshman year, about 6 years ago, I came home to find police tape marking the set of city stairs that short-cut a path to where I needed to go, and ones I trek often. Not thinking anything of it, I walked around the tape. 

Later on, I found out that a bicyclist cut off a dude in a car and the car followed the bicyclist a few miles to the end of the steps, hit him, got out and slit the dudes throat. The car drove away, leaving the bicyclist bleeding out on the steps. 

The victim ended up crawling up the steps, I’d guess about 50 concrete steps up the side of a hill in the city, and knocked on my neighbors door for help. 

As far as I know, the victim survived and the other guy was caught and found guilty for attempted homicide. 


Edit: “He told the jury that he spent a week in the hospital, where he received 21 stitches, 14-15 staples in his head and a blood transfusion, as a result of being stabbed in the head four times, once in the back of the shoulder and getting his throat slit.”

He told me he used to be more of the mindset that they’re kind of common, just because it’s something that gets brought up so much online (see reddit), and I was telling him about the the 2-10% stat when he explained that he’s really changed his mind after working in the DAs office, and thinks is likely much closer to the 2% figure than the 10 because of what he’s seen. 

His main job right now is listening to the phone calls between the people in jail and the people they call on the outside. In this instance he’s talking about rape and DV cases: He said it’s super super common that a guy will call up the girl (typically they have some sort of relationship, which is supported by stats that most rapes are perpetuated by non-strangers) and tell her that she’s ruining his life, and that he loves her and she needs to take back her statement or else he’ll be stuck there forever and won’t be able to see her again, etc etc.

My dad grabbed a crow bar and scrambled outside to see what was up.

A car had started slowly following my sister while she was walking and had followed her all the way up to the bottom of our drive.

Thankfully nothing happened to her, but I'll never forget hearing her screaming for my dad.

After a jh track meet last spring I went to another coach’s house to have a few drinks and chill by the river. After a while, I left, stopped at a convenience store on the way home, and got back to my trailer at about 1 am. When I opened the door I immediately cut on the lights and someone jumped up on the other side of my couch directly in front of me. It was a dude in all black and a black beanie, unshaven, a little bit shorter than me, but thicc. I threw the monster can that I was holding at him and slowly backed out the door. He began apologizing and telling me how he was homeless and that he was sorry but I left the front door open and he had just come in out of the rain to sleep for a while. I just kept watching his hands while I walked back in, went to the fridge and gave him a bottle of water, and told him to get the fuck out. Immediately I called my friend that I had been drinking with and told him everything that happened and then I noticed muddy footprints under the window. That bastard had broken in through a window after all. So I went outside to see if I could catch where he went and out walks my neighbor from two trailers down ... This is where the story gets fuckin crazy. My neighbor says he called the cops already because he heard someone screaming for help, and helps me look around the trailer. We find a big ass knife by the window that was broken into, and then my neighbor looks in his pocket and says oh shit this must have fell out of my pocket and yup he had a hole in his pocket. Cop shows up and I talk to him and describe the guy and then proceed to get zero sleep before work the following day (trying to control kids in math class on a Friday, yay!). Fast forward to Saturday morning when I wake up; I have this thought out of nowhere that my neighbor had looked like the “homeless” guy that had broken into the house. I end up moving out of that trailer to another house a couple days later and the night after we moved out,with some of my shit still in there, my old landlord calls me at 4am. He says, “the trailer is on fire.” 

Story already long, so rest of the long story short. My neighbor had been the “homeless” dude he had just run home and changed real quick and come back out to talk to me (it was fuckin dark outside ok, and I had just had a very traumatic experience). He had broken in to burn that shit down not to sleep. Apparently he had used to have been on the police force in my town but got let go for mental issues. I did a photo lineup and shit and the detective fucked some shit up and the dude ended up just leaving town. After the fire the cops found a bunch of cigarette butts on the ground by the window that had been broken into, and I don’t smoke. My neighbor had been watching me sleep on my couch at night when he wasn’t breaking in trying to burn that shit down I guess. "

She wasn’t even accusing anyone specifically, since the rapist was a complete stranger - even if she *was* lying, she wasn’t hurting anyone! She suffered a horrible crime and instead of helping the cops decided she deserved to be punished and did whatever they could to hurt her more. The cherry on the horrible cake is that the subsidized housing they threatened to get her kicked out of was being provided because she was a child abuse victim who aged out of the foster system.

**Typographical reasons**

-	Since CS was modeled after handwritten characters from comic books, it flaunts many conventions that make for fonts that are considered ""good"". 

-	Its proportions are weirdly inconsistant. A ""good / proper"" font has an internal logic or ruleset which applies to its lines and curves. Comic Sans seems to wing it with every letter. 
-	Also its kerning (the distance between two characters) isn't consistent, which makes it harder to read. 
-	Speaking of readability: CS used for long texts is difficult to read. Which isn't really CS's fault, because it was designed for short speech-bubble-like text blurbs. 

**Social reasons**

-	CS was historically used to introduce whimsy to otherwise boring websites. People inexperienced with web design may have thought ""Hey, these web sites are pretty dull, let's spruce it up with some human touch. I guess I'll use the one font in Dreamweaver that looks like a human wrote it"". Thus began the association between bad websites and CS.

&gt;Shaw died on 8 January 2005 while seeking to recover the body of Deon Dreyer.

&gt;Shaw recorded his dive with an underwater camera, which allowed researchers to determine that he suffered from respiratory issues due to the high pressure. Shaw ran into difficulties when he cut loose Dreyer's harness and the body unexpectedly began to float. Shaw had been advised by various experts that the body would remain negatively buoyant because the visible parts were reduced to the skeleton. However, within his wetsuit, Dreyer's corpse had turned into a soap-like substance called adipocere, which floats. Shaw had been working with both hands, and so had been resting his can light on the cave floor. The powerful underwater lights that cave divers use are connected by wires to heavy battery canisters, normally worn on the cave diver's waist, or sometimes attached to their tanks. Normally he would have wrapped the wire behind his neck, but he was unable to do so; the lines from the body bag appear to have become entangled with the light head, and the physical effort of trying to free himself led to his death. Three days later, both of the bodies floated up to near the surface as the dive team was retrieving their equipment.

He had a website http://www.deepcave.com/pages/5/index.htm that is still up and running. It links to his future plans, and it is surreal to read that his dive to recover another drowned diver would be his last. Eerie to know that he was going to do other things, but unable to fulfill those future plans. May he Rest In Peace. "

3786,"Sort of.  Surface area grows exponentially with the radius of a sphere.  4πr^2  So the surface area of the earth is 4 * 3.14 * 6,371^2 or 510 million Km^2.  Low earth orbit (LEO) goes out 2000km above the earth.  The surface area of that sphere would be 880 million Km^2 or 70% larger.  You can think of that as there being 70% more room for things at the edge of LEO as there is on the entire surface of the earth.  Never mind the fact that you're also able to position things in three dimensional space.  There's just a lot of room between things in general.  Worrying about 60,000 things being too close together in space is very similar to to your single hive of bees scenario for that reason.  When you start to get above LEO as mentioned the area increases exponentially.  It's not long before you're talking about a scenario akin to single bee somewhere on the earth.  Especially since as you increase you apogee further increases to apogee require more minor increases in velocity.

The caveat of course is that all these things are moving very incredibly quickly, and by the nature of orbital mechanics on a long enough timescale two objects with differing overlapping orbits which aren't perfectly resonant with one another will collide.  Even in a very simple example which seems naively like it should be fine, where you have two craft orbiting right beside one another at the same speed, the craft will want to effectively swap places as their orbits take them from one side of the planet to the other.  This means that a catastrophic kessler like scenario could actually make certain orbits more risky for long term space based installations. 

That being said there would be very little risk in passing through those orbits, and satellites installed at higher orbits than the debris cloud would be minimally affected.  It would only make permanent installations within the debris zones more dangerous and even then only minorly so.  Considering the over all cost of satellite infrastructure to begin with however it's likely even this minor risk would be enough to effect some degree of change.  It's just not the doomsday scenario some people expect it to be."

Romans 12:19 - Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ""It is mine to avenge; I will repay,"" says the Lord.

The center of the fire looked like glowing electricity, 5 and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, 6 but each of them had four faces and four wings. 7 Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. 8 Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, 9 and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.” – Ezekiel 1"

Now there were all ages in the group, from little kids to grandparents. They had found a ""tame"" ""wild horse"" and we're petting it's nose and wanted to all get a group picture with it. I saw it, spent a micro-second taking the pic, and convinced everyone to disperse, slowly and quietly.  
  
They found a moose. It wasn't tame. Everyone, including me could have died.  
  
Afterwards I got them together and explained things and everyone laughed about it. Then a couple of them stole landscaping rocks and put them in their backpacks, and everyone took off on their tour bus.

I also think as a society we handle paedophilia very poorly, as, even if a paedophile has done nothing wrong, is labelled as scum and gets comments such as ""you need to die"". There is no help for someone stuck in that situation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying paedophilia is in any way right, I just think we should try to offer support where we can to help people who quite frankly must suffer with that attraction.

For awhile I had a client who knew my doc appointment dates and would hit me up that day always wanting to buy the lot. Which was a pretty penny, considering it was for his personal use. Anyway at the time I was a 16 year old 90 lb blond hair white girl going to grimey places in New Mexico to sell these things and buy my own drugs. This customer treated me as such sometimes and, even though he usually had the money for all of it, would offer up stuff like My Little Pony pens and pencil sets. Clothing he'd steal from Hollister (specifically for me which is weird because he never hit on me and I never wanted it). Expensive hair products. All of this stuff new. The thing I thought was most amusing was a bottle of pepper spray, that he spray painted pink ""for me"". He spent a good 15 minutes trying to tell me that he worried about me and that I needed it. Looking back I kind of appreciate it, because he was one of the few clean cut and nice people I ever sold to. Never tried to hit on me or screw me over.

4067,You can't compare the horrific slaughter of the Rape of Nanking to the bombing of Dresden which was a legitimate military and industrial target. The Allied planners didn't plan those raids to kill German. They were to destroy German factories and railway stations that were shipping materiel and troops to fight the war. 
4068,"this is really not the case and is being upvoted because redditors *really* like the theories that go against mainstream historic ones
even when they're complete bullshit

Austria-Hungary was an empire that expanded its rule over Bosnia because it couldn't have oversea colonies and it very much wanted to rule over most of Balkans. Serbia accepted all the ""harsh terms"" to avoid being invaded except allowing Austria-Hungary to install physical control in the form of Austrian police force over it. The government of Serbia didn't organize the assassination of Ferdinand and was all but prepared for a war after being exhausted fighting defensive wars for decades against Ottomans and later, Bulgaria trying to expand over Balkans. Serbia very much didn't want the war and didn't even have enough weapons and uniforms to fight it while the military expenditure of Austria-Hungary at the time was one of the highest in the Europe at the time and was growing in the decade before the invasion which isn't expected for a peaceful progressive country trying to remove the need for terrorism in their colonies. 

  Even if going by the justification that some secret support in the Serbian government to the Young Bosnia movement of people trying to fight colonization was enough to justify invasion of Serbia the two points that must be acnowledged are: 
1. Austro-Hungarian empire was 100% pro-war at the time and was a product of 2 centuries of strong German nationalism seeking to expand it's power and compete with colonial powers in the Western Europe 
 2. Serbia did literally everything in it's power to avoid being invaded.

 It would be like a British person in Crimea killing the next moderate presidential candidate and Russia sending Brittain the ultimatum to give virtually all power in the country to Moscow and Britain accepting all to avoid being attacked except allowing the Russian police to rule the country and after Russia going in a full annexation of British isles people start blaming Britain for starting the war because there is some evidence that mi6 supplied weapons to anti-Russian Crimean rebels. Except not really because Bosnia didn't have an Austrian majority while Crimea does have Russian one

I see a lot of people add seasoning at the beginning of cooking because they want the food to absorb the flavour but in my experience and from what I learned from an amazing head chef is to add a little at the end instead. According to him a lot of people who add seasoning at the beginning of the cooking process often add more later because they can't taste it or they ruin it because they add too much. He also told me when making stir fry with rice I should squeeze half a lemon over the rice and lightly zest with the lemon.

When the Reconquista took back the land they were brutal to the Jews, anyone with Moorish blood, Christians who'd converted to avoid the Jizayh...basically unless you were a 'full blooded' Spaniard you'd probably have been better living under the Arabs.

There are a few recorded instances of him likening Lafayette to a son, and even a few accounts of him crying in later years when Lafayette was brought to mind (the Barbé-Marbois account I mention above, and other incidents include tears following Lafayette's visit to Mount Vernon in 1784 when he was mentioned and when Washington discussed his friend's imprisonment in Prussia and Austria in the 1790s).

4099,"Humans instinctually do not kill other humans. If two hunter gatherer tribes had to fight over, say, a nice patch of berries then they wouldn't be trying to kill each other. They'd mostly just yell, throw rocks and shit, and hope the other tribe backs off. 

In WWI there was a funny example of this, IIRC, where two opposing troop columns ran into each other on a march. Everyone, of course, hurried to prepare for battle... by dropping their rifles and scrambling for rocks to throw. Y'know, the natural instinctive reaction. 

The reason soldiers train with human-shaped targets rather than bullseyes is that military analysts found out that it was the only way to get more than half of the army to actually pull the trigger. By making pulling the trigger at a person a knee-jerk reaction, they managed to increase kill rates.

In modern war, though, I'd say outright brainwashing plays a factor. War is no longer a series of even battles, it's both sides considering the other side inhuman vermin that must be wiped from the face of the earth. Because if you make your soldiers think the enemy aren't people, you increase the effectiveness of your army. Because they'll pull the trigger when you tell them too."

I had taken two other AH courses, and they had both been big lectures, with two big tests and group presentation to make up the grade. I figured this class would similar, just memorizing famous photographers, dates, learning about the significance of a few pictures. It ended up being more of a philosophy of photography class. Totally blew my mind. I don’t even think we even talked about a single specific photographer. It was super interesting, but it totally went over my head at times. 

One topic we delved into: a critic of potography once said that art used to have a special “aura” that was lost once photography was invented. If you wanted to see an artwork, you had to be standing right in front of it. You could look at drawings of it, but that would be a different artpiece, you wouldn’t truly be experiencing it. The moment the first successful photograph was taken, that aura was lost, because now the artwork had the potential to be reproduced in an honest and direct way. For example, you no longer had to travel to Greece or Rome to see their architecture, someone could take a picture and bring you exactly what it looks like. The experience of seeing art was ruined, the magic, so to speak, was lost and art wasn’t special anymore. I think we actually went over on classtime that day because we were in such an in depth discussion. The class overall really opened my eyes to the impact photography has had on the world. Pretty interesting stuff, definitely did not get an A"

""In the late 1920s Yakov [Stalin's eldest son] began living with Zoya Gunina, the daughter of an Orthodox priest. When they told Stalin of their intent to marry, he flew into such a rage that Zoya fled the Stalin dacha [home] in terror and Yakov, in a state of nervous collapse, attempted suicide, shooting himself with a pistol. The bullet entered his lung and not his heart and while Stalin’s second wife bandaged him and called for a doctor, Stalin, according to one version, walked away, dismissively stating, 'You couldn’t even do this properly.'""

Eg ""its OK to rape a girl if you took her on an expensive date"" ""it's OK to rape a girl if she changes her mind and withdraws consent"" ""it's OK to rape a girl if she flirted with you"". Teenagers from 14 up were given these statements and most statements had around 30% of respondents agreeing. They split it by gender of those who agreed and  always just a bit lower but still over 20% of girls agreed. I genuinely think it's some of the fucked up porn shit that's so easily accessible. So much out there with people in what looks like genuine pain. Not about the females wants and pleasure. I know some people enjoy S&amp;M but that's consensual and safe and always the ability to stop. This is shit that that girl has no say in what is happening to her.

And then of course is te fact that the industry keeps you poor, so you have to keep at it. "

4205,"My mom left my dad for much the same reason. She had little education or job experience, no money of her own, was distant from family. But she chose to divorce my dad because his continued drug abuse meant they almost lost custody of me. She struck out on her own, went to drug counseling and cleaned up, got a decent job, and so on. Dad had visitation but disappeared when I was 9. Only difference was that I was well aware of everything going on except the visit from CPS - apparently I had been interviewed and everything. Maybe I was too aware of my parents problems, but reading stories like yours makes me grateful for that knowledge. I got to make my own well informed opinions about my parents early on."

4210,"Kind of. The problem is that it is insidious. Taking sexism instead as a parallel: if a woman goes the silent and confident route, she is at minimum she's asked why she can't be ""nicer"". If she is kind, they overpraise on the kindness instead - _and take it for granted_.

Asians face a similar issue. What might typically divorced of context be a good trait (hard working, professional-oriented career choices, etc.) could mean when Asians deviate, they need to over-compensate to signal that they're  breaking the stereotype. Your reply is a pretty spot-on example: reaching straight for the ""doctor"" stereotype is part of it (I know you don't mean it, but it's such a good example). 

We don't avoid racism _because_ we're model minorities, but rather __that is the racism__; in that we're _typecast as model minorities_ who work hard, are perpetually content and polite, and have no drive beyond supporting their families. Hence, office dynamics results in asians who do the tedious work (hardworking), who picked on more because we are expected to not stand up for ourselves (polite), and to be passed over for promotions (no drive). 

TL;DR it's not aggressive type of racism, it's the insidious type."

4215,"I mean for WW1 Italy had a *defensive* alliance with Germany/Austria-Hungary. Both were attacker. 

Italy spent a chunck of the war as Neutral, up until France/UK promised them some Austrian territory where they was an Italian minority. 

Germany more or less spitted in the face of what the Italians demanded. 

So it's not really a surprised that a somewhat neutral country didn't join the side of a war which promised it nothing, and chose to side with those who offered it something. 

In the case of WW2, They were beaten and in a state of civil war when they ""changed side"". Can we say that a beaten country is changing side ?

4228,"Me and a friend visited Paris when we were 19ish. We were down on the Métro and my friend decided to get a bottle of coke (other beverages are available) from a vending machine. The bottle dropped from the top of the machine to the bottom, and for some reason he decided to immediately open it rather than waiting, of course it started spraying everywhere, all over everything and everyone on the platform.

He got it under control and had the lid semi-screwed back on when the train arrived, we debated waiting for the next one to get cleaned up but thought fuck it. Hopped into the carriage and sat down, at which point he DROPPED IT (bearing in mind the lid was half-on), and it proceeded to start pinwheel spraying coke all over the inside of the train, up the windows, everywhere.

A guy sitting opposite us watching this unfold handed my friend a tissue, obviously to clean his hands up since he was dripping, but instead my friend decided that it was for cleaning up the mess, and dropped the tissue onto a very deep pool of coke where it became immediately saturated.

The two of us just sat there for a second, covered in coke, and took in what just happened. Tissue man didn't say a word and just looked out the window for the rest of the trip."
4229,"During the first world war, the British men were promised improved living conditions once they were back home (most people in the UK lived in slums and were paid a pittance).  Once the war was won, they returned home and the Upper Classes fucked them over (as usual).  The men were very bitter but were powerless to do anything.

When WWII broke out, the men were still alive - their sons also knew what had happened to them - so there was a real distrust between the officers and the regulars.   This time the men told the officers that they would be returning to Britain with their weapons - if their living conditions were not improved then those weapons would be turned on the upper classes.

So after the war was won, the men returned home with their weapons - the country was broke - but the upper classes knew that they couldn't back out of their promises.  That is why the UK is such a nice place to live - all because we threatened to kill the upper classes - who says violence doesn't solve anything - violence is the only thing that gets things done!"

roll a 20 sided die, take the number, move the decimal of your gayness stat over to the left by 1 (ex. 12 -&gt; 1.2, 0 -&gt; 0). Once you have that stat multiply it by the number you rolled, the end number is your earned point score. That is how you calculate it.

However, if you converted multiple people, then you get an added bonus of adding all of your points that you would've gotten, and then divide it by 0.45. 

Now, once you have done that, you also have to take in your total tax rate for points, so you must tally up all your points, and all the points to have received from yo homies, and the ones you have spent on ya homies, and subtract 12%. now, write it all up in paper, (the Gay Corp ^^tm accountants do not accept digital filings) and fly to scotland, go north to Urquhart Castle, which is the secret base of Gay Corp ^^tm. and go to the receptionist and give the paper over, but before you can do that he must verify your identity, he will have you go into one of the Gay Corp ^^tm gaydar chambers, at which point he will turn on the machine and vigorously transform into the loch ness monster and ask you for tree fiddy."

I called back a few times and it either rang or went straight to voicemail so I did what I thought was the only pertinent thing to do in that situation, I called the cops for a welfare check.

Now consider all the areas where buffalo wings just come in a limited quantity: the ONE grocery store in town only has a couple packages of frozen wings that aren't in high demand.

Think of all that, and your daily share of wings might come down to like 36 wings a day. Of course, that many wings aren't being produced or eaten in a day, but it isn't surprising to think there are tons of wings to go around. Remember: every time someone eats a chicken breast or a plate of chicken nuggets (more popular foods), that's two wings in circulation. 

I'm not an expert when it comes to chicken economics, but chickens are such a widely-consumed food around the world that there must be uneaten wings just piling up at Fort McKnox."

I talk to incredibly racist people and they'll tell me why they feel the way they do and how their experiences shaped their beliefs. I talk to people who have became so passionate about one subject that it has taken over their lives. I speak to people who would be considered the dregs of society. The people no one speaks to. If I get a day with a lot of these customers it's a bit like spending the day on AskReddit. Sometimes I feel like Louis Theroux.

Isn't that the point of police chasing him? "
4721,"Three years ago I was walking around my neighborhood when I faintly heard the words ""HALT !""  ""HALT!"" coming from behind me. I stopped, removed my headphones and turned around just in time to see a police SWAT team in full body armor sprinting toward me. When the SWAT leader caught  me,  he stretched out an arm out and  roughly tapped my shoulder.  Apologetically he said ""Sorry we were looking for someone else"" that is I think he said those words as I was distracted by the assault rifle pointed in my direction.  Following the ""apology"" the SWAT team jogged off to resume their their search and I walked off to finish my exercise 

Later in the morning, I googled  the local news and discovered  the man they were looking for fatally shot his friend yesterday morning .  Subsequently he drove to and robbed my neighborhood's  24 hr, E/R clinic before running off into the night to hide. Sunrise he emerged from hiding to carjack a SUV at a location very close to my SWAT encounter.   Predictably, his life after the carjacking involved a car chase, a deliberate ramming of a drug store and a final suicidal gunshot to the head.

Now when I walk that path, I think about how different things might have turned out.  The police could have easily killed me or the carjacker could have.  In fact he was probably watching me as I  walked.  Perhaps even as I talked to the police. Though what I found most off putting is the fact that the police stated  the carjacker had a strong case of self defense for killing his friend. None of the events that transpired needed to occur"
4722,"Yup I remember those.  Mostly from people on the internet though (circa 2001), I don’t think I’ve ever met a person where I’m from who actually used those words.

""Dark Summit: The True Story of Everest's Most Controversial Season"" by Nick Heil. The story of the 2006 climbing season when 10 people died.  The controversy is over a climber who chose to go solo rather than as part of a group. He got into trouble and stopped near the Green Boots body.

 Everyone has a bias, but we can evaluate what words on a page literally say and determine whether or not they are true or not true, or contradict etc.

Polio was the real killer, my mother said that during an outbreak, everyone stayed in their homes, afraid to go out and mingle with other people. I remember seeing kids with pronounced limps as a result of having had polio. Not only was being sick so much painful and uncomfortable and often deadly for children, but it was challenging for parents as well, especially mothers who really weren't able to keep jobs outside of the home. With several children who were in various stages of illness, mothers simply didn't have time to hold down a job.

1 Timothy 2: 11-15 (NIV) -  A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.

We're 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, number 4 in labor force, and number 4 in exports.

We lead the world in only 3 categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined, 25 of whom are allies.

We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right! We fought for moral reasons, we passed and struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, and we acted like men. We aspired to intelligence; we didn't belittle it; it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and we didn't scare so easy. And we were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one—America is not the greatest country in the world anymore.

4966,"I dunno, this seems like the sort of thing that was written by people in the 40's before anybody really knew anything about Egypt.  I mean, Hapi was the god of the Nile, but the Nile itself wasn't a god, nor was Hapi one in the same with the Nile River.  Heqet had the head of a frog, but wasn't actually a frog herself.  And frogs weren't considered to be her.  They were just frogs.  And I don't know of any deification of lambs in their religion.  I mean, Khnum was ram-headed, which I guess is kinda close.  

The only one where this kind of holds up is the sun.  However, Ra wouldn't be the god in question.  Ra drove the chariot that dragged the sun across the sky, but the actual physical disc of the sun was Aten.

I've seen this theory put forward in a way in which it says that each of the plagues was attacking something that an Egyptian god stood for, rather than ""killing"" one of them, but that doesn't work either, because Egypt had a god for basically every aspect of their world and society.  So everything bad that could possibly happen would fall under the watch of *some* god, so it's not something to read too much intent into.  And anyway, the really heavy hitters of Egyptian mythology-Amun, Thoth, Osiris, Anubis, and Horus-don't correspond to any of the plagues.  I always thought it was kinda funny that the god of the Israelites would strike fear into the heart of Egypt, and yet be too timid to fuck with their strongest gods."

This happened 4-5 times in a row. I had been in the interview for an hour and had only fully answered 2 questions.

I mean, the guy started a war and overthrew a monarchy because the girl he wanted wasn't interested in him - the only reason he was successful was because the Targaryen rule was already failing and the king was both psychotic and stupid.

Chance's are that if Lyanna Stark ended up deciding to go through with marrying Robert then there would have been no war, Rhaegar would have ascended the throne shortly after, and the Targaryen line would have rebuilt it's strength since it seems that Rhaegar was well suited to become king - he was popular among the people and seemingly was a solid leader. Not to mention that he was part of a generation of Targaryen's that was finally starting to shake the insanity caused by Centuries of inbreeding since that tradition was finally coming to an end. It seems likely that Rhaegar would have put a complete end to it since he was seemingly the first Heir-Apparent to marry outside of the family by marrying Elia Martell. "

&gt;Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka said to the people of the People's Republic of China: ""The Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself. Further, the Japanese side reaffirms its position that it intends to realize the normalization of relations between the two countries from the stand of fully understanding 'the three principles for the restoration of relations' put forward by the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese side expresses its welcome for this""

&gt;Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru, in a speech in the Japanese Diet, said: ""As we have made clear previously at repeated opportunities, the Japanese government and the Japanese people are deeply conscious of the fact that the actions of our country in the past caused suffering and loss to many people in neighboring countries. Starting from our regret and resolve not to repeat such things a second time, we have followed a course as a ""Peace Nation"" since then. This awareness and regret should be emphasized especially in the relationship between our countries and the Korean Peninsula, our nearest neighbors both geographically and historically. At this opportunity as we face a new situation in the Korean Peninsula, again, to all peoples of the globe, concerning the relationship of the past, we want to express our deep regret and sorrow""

May 25, 1990: 
&gt;Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, in a meeting with President Roh Tae Woo, said: ""I would like to take the opportunity here to humbly reflect upon how the people of the Korean Peninsula went through unbearable pain and sorrow as a result of our country's actions during a certain period in the past and to express that we are sorry""

January 1, 1992: 
&gt;Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, in a press conference, said: ""Concerning the comfort women, I apologize from the bottom of my heart and feel remorse for those people who suffered indescribable hardships"".

I, as a prime minister, would like to once again express a heartfelt remorse and apology to the people of your nation"".

January 17, 1992: 
&gt;Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, at a policy speech on a visit to South Korea, said:. ""What we should not forget about relationship between our nation and your nation is a fact that there was a certain period in the thousands of years of our company when we were the victimizer and you were the victim. I would like to once again express a heartfelt remorse and apology for the unbearable suffering and sorrow that you experienced during this period because of our nation's act."" Recently the issue of the so-called 'wartime comfort women' is being brought up. I think that incidents like this are seriously heartbreaking, and I am truly sorry"".

August 11, 1993: 
&gt;Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, at the first press conference after his inauguration, said: ""I myself believe it was a war of aggression, a war that was wrong"".

August 23, 1993: 
&gt;Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said in a speech at the 127th National Diet Session: ""After 48 years from then, our nation has become one of nations that enjoy prosperity and peace. We must not forget that it is founded on the ultimate sacrifices in the last war, and a product of the achievements of the people of the previous generations. We would like to take this opportunity to clearly express our remorse for the past and a new determination to the world. Firstly at this occasion, we would like to express our deep remorse and apology for the fact that invasion and colonial rule by our nation in the past brought to bear great sufferings and sorrow upon many people"" .

September 24, 1993: 
&gt;Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said, at the 128th National Diet Session:. ""I used the expression war of aggression and act of aggression to express honestly my recognition which is the same as the one that the act of our nation in the past brought to bear unbearable sufferings and sorrow upon many people, and to express once again deep remorse and apology"".

August 31, 1994: 
&gt;Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said in a speech: ""Japan's actions in a certain period of the past not only claimed numerous victims here in Japan but also left the peoples of neighboring Asia and elsewhere with scars that are painful even today. I am thus taking this opportunity to state my belief, based on my profound remorse for these acts of aggression, colonial rule, and the like caused such unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people, that Japan's future path should be one of making every effort to build world peace in line with my no-war commitment. It is imperative for us Japanese to look squarely to our history with the peoples of neighboring Asia and elsewhere. Only with solid basis of mutual understanding and confidence that can be built through overcoming the pain on both sides, can we and the peoples of neighboring countries together clear up the future of Asia-Pacific.... On the issue of wartime 'comfort women,' which seriously stained the honor and dignity of many women, I would like to take this opportunity once again to express my profound and sincere remorse and apologies. With regard to this issue as well, I believe that one way of demonstrating such feelings of apologies and remorse is to work to further promote mutual understanding with the countries and areas concerned as well as to face squarely to the past and ensure that it is rightly conveyed to future generations. This initiative, in this sense, has been drawn up consistent with such belief""

July 1995: 
&gt;Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said in a statement: ""The problem of the so-called wartime comfort women is one such scar, which, with the involvement of the Japanese military forces of the time, seriously stained the honor and dignity of many women. This is entirely inexcusable. I offer my profound apology to all those who, as wartime comfort women, suffered emotional and physical wounds that can never be closed"" (Statement by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama on the occasion of the establishment of the ""Asian Women's Fund"").

August 15, 1995: 
&gt;Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said in a statement: ""During a certain period in the not-too-distant past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly those of Asia. In the hope that no such mistake will be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humanity, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology"" 

June 23, 1996: 
&gt;Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in a press conference: ""Hashimoto mentioned the aspects of Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula such as the forced Japanization of Korean people's name and commented ""It is beyond imagination how this injured the hearts of Korean people"". Hashimoto also touched on the issue of Korean comfort women and said ""Nothing injured the honor and dignity of women more than this and I would like to extend words of deep remorse and the heartfelt apology""

5092,"English saddles now have a safety catch to prevent the rider from getting dragged if their leg gets caught. The metal loop the leather stirrup straps attach to have a little hinge. When you clean your saddle, you're supposed to make sure it's clean and works properly. If you grab the stirrup strap and pull towards the back, the hinge opens and the strap pulls off. There's also stirrups that have a hinge as well. Getting your foot caught can be lethal. Not just the danger of breaking your foot, you can dislocate or break a hip, or get trampled or kicked by the horse's back leg(s). 

I caught my foot on the post of a gate and would have broken my hip if the stirrup didn't pop off. The stirrup strap pulling off allowed me to rotate my hip so I was kinda sitting side saddle as I got through the gate.

Religious disputes are ugly. At the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 6 different religious authorities claim rights to the building. The compromise that has lasted for hundreds of years is that ANY change made to the building must be approved by all 6 groups. And they enforce it, a fist fight broke out in the early 2000's when an Ethiopian monk moved his char a few inches further into the shade. The ladder was probably left by some masons repairing a portion of the structure and holds no significance whatsoever, but nevertheless all of the attempts (mostly illegal) to move the ladder have resulted in a lot of squabbling and the ladder inevitably being returned to its original location.

I later learned he was getting EMT trained so his contacts could call in him in an emergency to be the sober one to help out and attempt to keep a bad reaction or bad trip from going super south, AND he would routinely guide and assist his clients into rehab for harder drugs like meth or cocaine.

5118,"I would argue that the Germans should have won WWI. Not only were they (mostly) in the right, but this also would (probably) have prevented the rise of the Nazis and WWII.

Although because of this, the US would be less of a world power, and the British Empire might still be around (to an extent). Japan would not have received aid from the US after WWII, and as a result we would probably not have (as many) video games or (any) anime. The Ottoman Empire would (probably) still exist, and 9/11 might not have happened. The Iraq War would probably not have happened, and Europe would probably be a safer place than it is now.

We might or might not have seen the rise and spread of communism in the 20th century (although I think this is less connected to WWII, so maybe we still would have). Star Wars may or may not exist, given that the main antagonists were originally based on Nazis. The lingua franca might have ended up being German as they would have likely become the world’s dominant superpower (although if the British Empire were still around, it might be English like it is today). The Vietnam and Korean Wars might not have happened.

The Space Race probably wouldn’t’ve happened, or at least not between the US and the USSR, as the USSR may or may not have existed. The Moon landing, while still likely to have happened, might have happened at a different time and have been done by a different superpower.

Technology would likely be different, as nuclear power was first harnessed during WWII by the US in order to intimidate members of the Axis powers, which probably wouldn’t’ve happened.

Kind of strange how the outcome of WWI has all of these seemingly unrelated consequences. (Like seriously, if the Germans had won, we might not have anime. Like those things don’t seem even remotely related. Kind of funny, really.)"

My complaint over there is all the morons who vote for what they think the law OUGHT to be, so the top advice is often terrible and the post right under it corrects it and cites sources, but gets down voted through the floor because it doesn't make you feel good. 

Edit to add - THOUGH you're right that most posters there have NOT heard of the American Rule.  Folks, in the US, for most lawsuits the loser is NOT ordered to pay the winner's legal fees...  so even if you win, you owe thousands to your lawyer.  I know... it's not like that on TV...  but it is in real life.  There are exceptions - baked into statute -  but for the day to day stuff, you pay your way.

5220,"**TL;DR - Smoked a QP ($250) via blunts (1/8 min. Need 2 to catch a buzz) every 3 days.  Never sold.  Quit smoking.  Now, take 1 hit a year.  Higher from 1 hit than those blunts.  I honestly can't fathom how I smoked blunts.  It seems crazy to me.**  
  

Back when I was a pothead (mid 90s).  I would buy a QP for $250.  I would only smoke blunts (blunts with at least an eighth, not those joints rolled in a cigar wrapper),  it took me two just to catch a buzz.  If someone offered a joint or a bowl I would just laugh and refuse.  The QP would last for about 3 days.  I also never sold any.  
  
I don't smoke anymore (started getting paranoid, quit about 17years ago) but maybe once or twice a year I'll take 1 or 2 hits.  I get so fucking high off those 1 or 2 hits.  It seems like I'm way higher from those hits than when I smoked blunts.  It also reminds me why I quit (paranoid).  
  
I honestly can't fathom smoking a blunt with an eighth of weed.  Thats just fucking insane to me. Yet  I used to need 2 of those to catch a buzz.  I still can't believe how much weed I smoked and how much money I spent.

So once I did get served, I would leave a big tip (say I bought a $5 beer, I would give a $20 and say keep the rest).  Now whenever you need a drink, just make eye contact with the bartender.  They will skip everyone and take your order.  Also every other bartender will do that same, as bartenders alert the other bartenders as to who is a big tipper.  Now just tip $1 or $2.

5228,"That Pit Bulls are practically natural born killers.

My twin brother used to vollenteer at the humane society a lot, and would always go on and on about how out of all the dogs, the Pit Bulls were almost always the sweetest. They were the definition of timid, pretty big scary cats, bit once they opened up, none could match thier affection.


The sad thing is, because they were so timid, and often scared when people come up at first, barking is a natural reaction initially, before going to a whimper. But people mistake the initial bark for aggression, and don't even give them a chance from there. 


The stereotype has done nothing but hurt them. Not only are they the most commonly abused dogs, bit they have the biggest return rate, they get more of them than any other dog, and are the hardest to adopt-often having them there far longer than other breeds, which are adopted far sooner in comparison. 

Its really sad, no matter what, this dumb stigma always leaves them the short end of the stick. Its really quite sad."

At the same time, these companies also exist for profit, so make sure you're weighing everything with an eye to how they might be making themselves look good to get more customers.

They wanted to kill Guru Gobind Singh,  the leader of the sikhs at the time.  The sikhs told their leader to escape with his sons.   He replied that every one of them were his sons and was not going to abandon them or treat his sons differently.  40 soldiers, including the guru's own teenage sons(14,18), held down the fort.  They went out of the fort 5 or 6 at a time lasting a couple hours each taking hundreds of mogul soldiers each.  Both sons went out in different groups,  respectfully asking for their fathers blessing beforehand.  He watched proudly as they fought and eventually were killed.   When it was night and 11 remained,  the sikhs forced/ ordered their leader to escape with a couple companions.   They killed various watchmen as they escaped.  The sikhs dressed one of the soldiers like their leader when the battle resumed in the morning.  When the invaders eventually made it inside,  they realised that they had already lost. 

His other two young sons (7,9) were captured with their grandmother elsewhere after being betrayed by someone they trusted.   The sons were given an option by Aurengzeb, convert to Islam or be encased alive in a brick wall.  They didn't even hesitate with their decision and were bricked alive while they just chanted various war cries and religious mantras.

Mom and pop businesses though tend to be smaller scale and a lot more reliant on word of mouth for their business. So MBA techniques doen't work as well.

5306,"Here we go:

In high school I did the morning announcements with 2 other guys in front of a green screen every Friday on camera \- we chose the background. We were given a lot of linenency because this was in the early 2000s when technology was a little more simple. In the AV room, we controlled every TV in the high school of over 1000 kids.

When christmas was close, we were told ""don't do anything x\-mas related because not everyone celebrates it"". So the last announcement before the holidays the screen comes on and in the background their is a sleigh\-ride video and the 3 of us pop up and yell ""merry christmas!!!"" as loud as we can dressed in xmas costumes. Now again \- the school cannot turn this off, only we can. It just so happened that the superintendent was in the building that day, saw the video and freaked out. It turned into this whole ordeal and we were almost suspended for 3 days.

They stopped letting us do the announcements until there was a petition signed by the school to let us do it again because we were actually pretty fucking funny and most of the gags we pulled were innocent, like eating creamed corn out of the can in less than 10 seconds if enough cans were donated to the food drive. When they let us come back, they said we couldn't make jokes and we had to have a neutral background. So... we went forward with our plan.

When the announcements turned on for the first time since our near suspension, we had no background \- just the greenscreen. Me and the other guys just wore white t\-shirts. We read the announcements without as much as winking minus the ocasional moan. It would be like: ""today for lunch the school is servvv... *mooaaaannnn*.. ugh... umm... pizza! Servin*g pizzza*aaaa"". At first it was minimal but at the end of it it sounded like we were having a mini\-orgy. We read the last announcement, said goodbye and then started acting like the announcements were over and like we didn't know we were on camera. We stood up in our boxer shorts and walked off camera. After about 10 seconds, our buddy Scott stood up from under the table, wiped his lips off, took a big swallow and walked off of camera.

That time we were suspended.

TL;DR I pretended to get a blowjob on school camera in front of over 1000 kids."

It seems at least one of them wasn't having a good day either, because it starts charging me for no reason right in the middle of the sidewalk.

Also, **this is completely and totally illegal**. There is no plausible interpretation of this that isn't an attempt to solicit foreign support for a campaign, in clear violation of campaign finance laws.

In light of this smoking gun of blatant collusion, there's really no reason to give the benefit of the doubt to the numerous other shady or questionable connections between people in Trump's circle and people in Putin's circle. Putin wanted to help Trump. Trump publicly praised Putin and asked for his help, which was provided. Honestly, I think our media just isn't equipped to handle collusion that's so blatant. We are so accustomed to looking for hidden activities that when it's out in the open it's hard to accept it for what it is.

Let's ""imagine"" a scenario: A Russian agent has assumed the US presidency. Is there any action in Russia's favor he would have reasonably taken that Trump has not already done? At every available opportunity Trump has sided with Putin against American interests and the American intelligence community. 

The fact that he is unfit has never been a topic of serious discussion. He has effectively no knowledge of either foreign or domestic policy, nor any apparent interest in learning.

I must have been around 10 when my best friend and I thought it would be hilarious to call sex hotlines from the landline (didn’t yet have a cell phone). We locked ourselves in a bathroom and proceeded to dial about 20 different sex hotlines we’d found in a newspaper. It was super funny. We tried to make our voices male and older and got a few “I’ll tell your parents!” for our efforts until we figured out that not saying anything was better since it led to a “you’re a silent one aren’t you?”. We hung up every time we started to giggle, which was all the time.
Anyway, the visit from my best friend ends and we both forget all about it. A few weeks later my mom is freaking out over the phone bill and I realise instantly that the warning at the beginning of each call - that this call would cost X amount of money per minute - was maybe a big deal.
My parents sat me down and I just came up with the first lie I could. I told them we had just called random numbers, hinting that maybe they were African numbers or something. I thought I got away with this until I was like 23 when I told my mom all about it and she just said “you realise we aren’t complete idiots right?”

Meanwhile the ""professional"" Brits made the schoolboy error of putting all-bar one of their heavy-lift Chinooks on one boat. Which the Argentinians sunk.

We were just extremely fortunate that sinking the Atlantic Conveyor was a fluke and the Argie air-strategy was to shoot at ships that shot back (capital RN ships).

Had they thumped an exocet into the QE2 or any of the other RFA/Supply ships, the British land-invasion (operating on an impossibly tenuous supply line to the UK) would have been in real trouble.

I took the class anyway.    
     
Sure enough, there was only one other girl in the class, and we were harassed every day. The most ridiculous part was the teacher’s response. He was openly gay, you see, so his solution to the boys sexually harassing the girls was to sexually harass the boys who started it. I kid you not.   
    
I’d be down on the shop floor, getting tools. Some dipshit, say Alex, would say something to me. The teacher supervised us from the loft above (where we had desks, etc). If he heard Alex say something to me, he’d respond with, “Hey Alex! Your ass looks really great in those jeans today!”

I believe in God because I am convinced that the concept, as defined by classical theism, is justifiable. The same view of God was shared by different ancient cultures, Greeks, Jews, Chinese, etc.

5512,"I saw the aftermath of a train pedestrian accident once too.  In my case a homeless person was hit by several trains.  They had asked passengers to look at the ""police activity"" out the south side of the train and I was on the North side.  I thought, ""eh, I don't need to see that"".  Turns out that they wanted people to look out that side because the body, or rather what was left of it, was on the North side.

The train was moving slowly due to the investigation that was ongoing.  I saw the leg first, a few more car lengths down the track was the arm, I didn't realize what I as seeing at first.  Then we came up on the torso, nothing else attached, just a torso, no arms, no legs, no head.  That's when I realized that I was seeing the aftermath of the accident.  That happened almost 20 years ago and I can still see it like it was yesterday.  Very surreal, even when I think about it today.

The saddest part was that I looked in the news papers for a few days, I was curious to know who it was, learn something about the person.  In the end I found the article, it was less than a paragraph buried in the middle of the paper, mentioning that he was a homeless man that wandered on to the tracks in the middle of the night and was hit by several trains.  No name or any other information to put a human identity to the person.  I hope, if he had family they found out what happened to him. "

As a professional, if that curiosity/urge arises, you quash that shit.

You certainly do not express it in the ways this man did to you. Obviously, it's not illegal, assuming the student is 18+, but it's ethically bankrupt and absolutely takes advantage of the power imbalance.

I teach undergrad courses, and all the students in my care may as well be my children. Allowing any kind of sexual/romantic feeling for them to flourish would compromise the way I treat/grade them in class, as well as probably affecting the way I conduct the class as a whole, which is unfair to all the students.

I mentioned that I wanted a smaller wedding if/when i get married (which i would want anyway, not just for cost. I'm just not the type for schmancy stuff), and he gave me that ""oh, you silly naive young one!"" attitude telling me that my fiancee would be the one calling those shots. I told him i wouldn't want to marry a woman who wouldn't be reasonable or compromise when it comes to that sort of thing, and he gave me more of the ""oh, you'll see"" kind of response.

Screw that, my fiancee/wife and i would be a team. Big decisions like that should be made together. Honestly i wouldn't have much preference for a lot of the finer details, so I'd voluntarily defer to the bride for those, but the day is about both of us as a pair so we should plan it as such.

5665,"Sushi before was just a quick meal for people. Like how sandwiches were.

Before the 'artful' need to make sushi presentable and perfect, it was just fish on rice wrapped in what was seaweed wrap before. Preserved in oil, salted, or brined in vinegar.

Of course this was for people in the coast where fish was abundant. People in the land stuck with rice, grain, meat and poultry.

Overtime however, Sushi became popular in the decades.

I remembered my prof said that between WW1 and WW2, Sushi was served to dignitaries and diplomats as a way to showcase Japanese cuisine. This then caused more of the affluent western people interested in Asian Cuisine to get only the best, freshest sushi. Thats where the boom of Sushi Chefs started.

So the art of making sushi, already refined, became even more artistic. Which is why you see that 'real' sushi costs to almost 400-500 USD.

5704,"They had a lot of disagreements over what caused the disaster on Everest in ‘96.  When a massive storm hit while over a dozen climbers were still on the highest parts of the mountain, resulting in eight deaths, including 3 guides.

John Krakauer, who wrote Into Thin Air, was a journalist with a fair amount of mountain climbing experience (but none at this height!) who felt that the guides were more obsessed with getting their clients and themselves to the top of the mountain than with keeping an eye on them and turning them around.  He especially came down hard on a guide named Anatoli Boukreev for climbing without supplementary oxygen, which required him to ascend and descend quickly, rather than waiting around with his clients.  Boukreev wound up carrying two people back to camp, which Krakauer acknowledged, but also claimed that they wouldn’t have been in that situation if Boukreev had done his job better.

Boukreev wrote The Climb (along with a co-author) partly as a response to Krakauer’s criticisms, claiming that his plan to go down the mountain first meant that he could rest and get together supples in case assistance or rescue would be needed, while allowing the other climbers to ascend and descend at their own pace.  And he claims that decision was what allowed him to carry the lost climbers back into camp, while Krakauer was unable to assist.  

It was a really horrible tragedy, and I can’t do the books justice here, but they’re both totally worth a read.  It’s really unique getting two perspectives on the event that line up in so many ways but that end with such wildly different conclusions."

5712,"A lot of possiblw kidnapping/trafficking stories. Will get buried but Here is mine:

I was 9 and my brother 6, when we visited our uncle and aunt for Christmas/ New Year holidays along with our parents. On New Years day we decided to go to a very popular beach in the city. As expected it was packed and we found a place in the sand. While the elders stated to chat we kids got bored. So our dad gave us some
Money for a ball and we started playing. At some point out Uncle joined us. He kicked the ball  a bit too far and my brother went to retrieve it into a mass of people and never came back. After 5 mins or so my Uncle went after him and came back in cold sweat, informed my parents and Aunt and everyone just freaked out. After 30 mins of frantic search, the police were called and finally one guy remembered handing over a lost boy to a policeman just earlier. Before we could feel a semblance of relief the Policeman says i really hope its not a cooked cop! Apparently so
Cops sold kids to traffickers and wrote them off-as not found!! The wail my mom let out upon hearing that.. i will never forget that. The cop asked us if we went and looked near our car as kids tend to go wait there. We all but sprinted there and lo and behold there he was being consoled by the constable to whom he was handed over to. 
Every time we think of it, we have a shiver down my spine as to  how close we came to losing him forever. "

5730,"Yes.

But why?"
5731,Just a nuke’ll do ya
5732,"I really wasn't talking about eating out, but sure, we can talk about that, too.

For one thing, time is a factor. If someone works long hours, multiple jobs, or goes to school and works, they may be out of the house for 12 hours or more a day, most days a week. Making your own food requires time to shop for it as well as time to make it, on top of the ability to store it and bring it with you. And sure, a big mac meal is like $7, but a double cheeseburger is like $1.50. Jack In The Box tacos, a staple of the ""no money and no time"" diet, are literally two for a dollar, and it usually takes four to feel full, but four tacos is 800 calories. Which goes back to what I was talking about. 

A lot of poor people also work in food service, so this junk fast food is available to them for free, or significantly reduced prices. Note that you rarely see thin people working at Chicken Express. If you're working long, exhausting hours at minimum wage, you're not turning down free, already cooked food.

One hour is enough for a beginner to make healthy meals... do you understand how much time an hour actually is? Especially if it's an hour being taken out of sleep, or other necessary household chores, or childcare, or time spent with family, or the very little relaxation time that people living in poverty have? It's very easy to say ""it's just an hour"" until that one hour of watching Orange Is The New Black while eating a crappy store-brand pizza is the only time to yourself you have.

And like I said, it's not an insurmountable problem. But there are barriers in the way that you don't seem to realize.

For example, what about meal prepping? You can make a ton of food ahead of time and eat it all week! Yes, you can. With certain foods. You have to have the knowledge of what foods can be stored and how long they can be stored for. And if you're wrong, you get sick and miss work. You also have to have space to store food, and materials to store food in. Tupperware isn't free. Neither are plastic baggies. You also have to have the materials with which to cook large quantities of food. Kitchenware isn't free, either. Having this kind of stuff saves you money in the long run, but it's often a pretty big investment up front, and if you don't already own it and don't have money to get it, what do you do? Goodwill sometimes has it, but if you don't have a lot of time, nor the money to spend on unnecessary transportation, are you going to waste it on a run to Goodwill because they *might* have a functioning Crock-Pot for $10?

Same with bringing your lunch instead of eating out. You have to make a lunch, which takes time, even if you do it all in advance. Then you have to have a way to store the food all week. Then you have to have a way to bring the food with you and keep it edible all day. If you don't have a way to heat up food, it has to be something that is edible and not gross at room temperature. If you walk or ride the bus, it has to be something easily carried. How many options are there, really, for food that is cheap, quickly and easily made in advance, stores well for long periods of time, is easily carried around with you, and can be eaten at room temperature? There are a few (PB&amp;J notably comes to mind), but not many. 

Or even cooking in general. Cooking is a learned skill. But if you don't have money to waste on food, you may not be able to take the risk on trying new recipes, because if you fuck it up, or it turns out that you don't like it, that's a bunch of money down the drain. Then there are issues of taste to be considered - if you grew up eating nothing but garbage, healthy food doesn't taste good to you. You can learn to like it, but that takes time and experimentation, which costs money.

To say nothing of the mental processes involved here. If you have very little money to waste and very little time, this requires a shitload of planning. Meal planning, budgeting for money, budgeting for time, looking up recipes, educating yourself about nutrition, educating yourself about cooking, etc. It's a lot.

My point, which I cannot overstate here, is that these are not insurmountable problems, but they are difficult ones, and they compound each other. Maybe you theoretically have time to cook, but you don't have money to spend on transportation to and from the grocery store every week, so you have to limit your grocery purchases to things that stay good for a few weeks. So that cuts out milk and fresh produce. Just for one example.

When you're living in poverty, everything is a tradeoff. Everything you do takes time away from something else you need to be doing. Everything you buy takes money away from something else you need to be spending money on. So you have to prioritize. And it's not hard to see why healthy food can come in pretty low on a priority list."

5741,"In Sverdlosk there was an outbreak of anthrax about 30 years ago. People and tons of livestock died. 

The Soviets said it was a natural outbreak. 

Years later, Ken Alibek, one of the heads of Biopreperat, the Soviet BioWeapons program, defected and told the true story that is the type of shit you can't make up. 

In the anthrax factory they turned off the machines and removed the filters at the end of the work day and left a post-it note on the control panel that stated the filters (leading to the outside world) were removed and needed to be replaced before running the machines. 

The morning guy missed the memo and started up the anthrax factory, and I do mean FACTORY-SCALE, and before realizing what happened had let a ton of weaponized anthrax out and basically everything downwind died and it required quite an effort to try and kill any anthrax spores that escaped. 

Also, the Soviets were known to be fucking with weaponizing smallpox, and basically thought we had some crazy BioWeapons program of our own and were fighting an arms race against themselves. 

Also there were the smallpox samples recently found in an old lab. 

Basically anything the Russians did with smallpox is what scares the hell out of me. "

5751,"Honestly if you like the overall genre, SCP is a great time killer. Some if the stuff on there is really well thought out/original. Of course, some of it is pretty bad, but when you have hundreds of contributors that's just bound to happen.

Pretty much every SCP has a number assigned to it, and will have a designation of safe, Euclid, or Keter.

Safe means it can be fully contained without extreme measures, and should containment somehow fail, it shouldn't be too destructive. Can still be dangerous. The threat a bomb presents is roughly comparable, but some are much less threatening.

Euclid is dangerous as fuck, but it's being contained well. Some weird/unusual methods are likely to be required.

Keter is potential country ending or world ending levels of dangerousness. They are probably in Plan G in keeping it contained, and have been working on Plan H for a while because it's only a matter of time before containment fails."

5753,"Back in the late 70’s, my mother lived in California with my 2 year old older sister and her then husband who was a marine. One night while he was out having drinks with friends, my mother was asleep on the couch waiting for him to come home. A man broke into their home and raped her at knife point for 3 hours. My mom said the entire time she was just terrified that he was going to murder her and then my sister who was in her crib asleep upstairs. Afterwards, he cried and apologized. He explained that he had always been attracted to her. It was dark and she could not make out his face. She was able to convince him that she had been attracted to a man that lived near her, and remembered a man always watching her who lived around the corner. He basically gave up his identity, excited by the thought that she shared the same attraction. He left and she immediately called the police. He was never arrested, he fled the state and was MIA for years until passing away in 2016. He was a marine as well.

Is is the double use of recreation time that makes hunting guns less messed up? Or some other aspect?

But a guy doing Blue Steel in his mom's bathroom? Yeah, that's cringeworthy. He could be the coolest dude in the world, but that particular look is the male equivalent of a pic of a girl with her tits out doing duckface.

Honesty, you could also ask the same questions in reverse. Why do guys hate the dog filter, or duckface for that matter? Both are totally innocuous, so what if girls like them? Maybe the girl is awesome, why judge before you get to know them? (The answer is the same as the answer to your question: they're cringeworthy; there's an immediate rejection on a physical level.)"

This is coming from a truck guy. I've had a pickup for years, not for work or the stereotypical manly man stuff but it's super useful for various hobbies.

it hurt.

my Mom and i were there for 45ish minutes when the nurse comes to get me.  i am walking back to the exam room with her when i hear a comotion and look to the door...  a massive dude comes in holding a bloody towel on his forehead.  the nurse tells me to stay put and walks over to him and asks what happened.  

he pulls the towel away and his entire forehead flaps down over his eyes and nose.  he was under a truck working and the fanblade came off of the front of the engine and did not pop his skull but did skin him.

i went back to the waiting room and realized that a broken arm is not that bad of an afternoon."

5858,"Remember having to stay in hotels at various points in time during my childhood; never thought much of it as my family would chalk it up to “electrical outages” etc. we’d stay a week in a hotel before going back home. Being young, never made connections, even though police activity in our neighborhood during Hess “hotel vacations” would be nearly tripled. 

Turns out, my father had multiple death threats by patients against him; (he was an emergency room doctor), who had treated a severely beaten woman and a near death infant that had obvious signs of strangulation and abuse. Woman made excuses of “accidents” even though it was obvious her boyfriend was abusing both her and her child. She would come in quite frequently, but my dad drew the line when she came in with her near dead child, and reported the incident to the police. Several days later, we got calls at our home phone from the boyfriend threatening to kill us if my dad continued to report incidents, etc. 

He showed up to the parking lot of the hospital my dad worked at with a .38, and tried to get past security to shoot up the emergency room, fortunately, security had been buffed due to a similar incident a week or so prior, so he backed down from entering, though would wait in his car in the parking lot so often my father would require the security to escort him to his car every night. 

The guy was eventually arrested after tying to break into our home when we were away, and was found with several weapons on him, and a bunch of meth in his system. Even though we weren’t there at the time, it was my first experience with a home invasion/potential murder situation as a kid. Completely shattered my view of a innocent, secure childhood. "
5859,"That's right. I think his brother had just graduated if I remember right.

Turns out he lied about quite a lot back then. Supposedly he was an investor in a few of the really nice hotels in downtown Houston, and he was ""in"" with the Vietnamese mafia that supposedly ruled parts of the city.

He was a pretty charming dude, very charismatic, but most of us kinda took a lot of his ""stories"" with a grain of salt. Never thought he was capable of what he did, though."

5862,"I went to high school with two brothers, a year apart in age. A year or two after graduation the younger brother murdered the older brother and their mother the same night before fleeing across the country. He was caught quickly. It was my friend who found their bodies. Him and older brother were very close, and when he didn’t show up to work that day, my friend went by his house just in case and found the worst. 

He had smashed his mother’s face in with a hammer to keep her quiet and then shot his brother twice. I can never get over the type of horror my friend must have seen that day, but these days he is a damn positive person and successful in his business so I am very proud of him. 

Their names were Shelly and Daniel Tompkins from Lehigh Acres, Florida. The piece of shit who now sits in jail for the rest of his life is named Steven Tompkins. I give these names so anyone can look up the reports but I hope i am not being disrespectful to the memory of a friend. "

Hand bags are fashion. Which attracts guys. Look good in a dress guys might talk to you. Better fashion costs more. So the more expensive clothes/accessories should get you more guys right?  Plus Miranda and the rest of the plastics can act like they are better than everyone else in the highschool cafeteria talking about designer fashions. 

Concerning MLMs if you are in one you won’t call it at MLM you probably actually thing it’s a legit business/ side hustle. And when newly married college dropout stay at home mom posts about being a Beach Body rep she probably thinks people on face book see that as her being a successful career driven women despite the challenges of motherhood. (Hypothetical example that is grounded in anecdotal evidence of one of my friends) 

This is just my understanding of the ideas. I think it’s useful to compare behaviors that are essentially that same but just male/female. It’s ground us to under stand we are all human. "

5871,"I have this friend. An unbelievably beautiful, fiery redhead who played the banjo (and really any instrument you put in her hands) and could sing her heart out. She was a bee keeper and an animal lover. She loved her 3 dogs more than anything in this world though. See, my friend had a black cloud that followed her for her entire life but the last year of her life, was pure hell. Her husband left her and completely broke her heart, but she had her dogs so although deeply hurt, they were there to lift her spirits. She needed a change, and being the nature woman that she is, moved into a tiny little broken down cottage in the middle of the woods in the middle of no where. I didn’t get a good feeling when I heard how she would be living and how she was seriously isolated from the world; not a good place to be if you suffer from depression. Anyways, even though it was really rough living, she truly enjoyed going for long hikes, exploring the wilderness around her. One day she was out hiking with 2 of her dogs, they were just up about 20 yards ahead of her. They were just exploring and getting a feel for the land, when she heard a gunshot and the screams of her dog, she took off running and got over the hill and that’s when she saw a teenage boy stand there and shoot her other dog point blank in the head. As she laid there holding her dead and dying dogs, truly her babies, screaming “WHY!” this boy laughed, then walked to his home in the woods. She followed him there and his parents were not sympathetic at all, to put it lightly. She filed a police report and she with her one remaining dog set out to try to move on with their lives. 3 days after the massacre of her dogs, she was driving to town to pick up some stuff for the memorial she was having for her dogs, and of course she had her dog/remaining family member with her in the passenger seat. While on their way home The were in a tragic car accident, which left my friend pretty beaten up but sadly her dog perished. She was broken mentally, physically and spiritually. She didn’t know how to heal from this, but she thought if she could get some justice for her dogs and see this kid be held accountable for something than maybe it would be a start. So a few months passed then finally the day came for court. Not only was there no justice for her dogs, she was basically mocked for being so sensitive and made to feel like she was being a burden on everyone for wasting their time. Seeing that boy and his parents and having them make passive aggressive “apologies” was the icing on the cake and was too much for her heart to take. She had a few people come way out to her cottage in the woods to check on her and show her love. Some people tried to get her to spend some time away from that house and offered up rooms at their home. Sadly, she stayed put and lost her battle with depression and this hard life she lived. I can’t say that I blame her, but damn I hate that the world lost such a beautiful soul. "

5888,"Not a Gone Wild poster but i recently recognized someone I know irl on one of those subs, despite hiding her face in all her photos. I mean if you follow her socials and have seen her irl then you’ll immediately know. It kinda feels like she wants people to know because it seems so low effort. Example: In real life she has had short hair, she’d post selfies pretty regularly during her short hair run. She has a gonewild post where her phone covers her face but her hair and body are on display. Like, I’ve seen that hair so much on twitter and instagram I know it’s you man LOL. There’s a lot of other things but the hair pic really just gave it away. 


That being said I’m not gonna say shit. It’s her life and body she can do whatever she wants, more power to her. Hopefully she looks back at her own post history and find the ones that give her away cause she has like 5. There are people out there that are scum and would do more with info like this (blackmail).

I know it sounds counter intuitive, but schools in the south came under such scrutiny that they had no choice but to adhere to desegregation at higher standards than northern states. In fact several northern states were able to get out of bussing initiatives in several larger districts so in cities like Boston and Philadelphia you have a lot of schools that are ""mostly black"" and ""mostly white"".


Also southern food is pretty baller. Also blues music. Also there's a lot of the south that is really warm and welcoming and not really as racist as people think

That's not to say the south doesn't have racists, it's just a different experience than the racism I felt in the north.

I've encountered more openly racist people in rural parts of the north (Pennsylvania I'm looking at you). In the south people might talk behind your back but they never seemed to have an issue with me or my wife (interracial marriage)

5922,"TONS of stuff. I became a Christian after reading the entire Bible so I feel things are misunderstood and misrepresented. 

1) The Bible is not a book. It is a collection of many books written over varying times with different intentions. The style of books are different as well. In fact the New Testament is mainly a composition of letters. Ecclesiastes on the other hand is a philosophical reflection.


2) The Bible is NOT meant to be taken literally in all books. The Book of Job and Genesis are poetic truths meant to represent God. Within the Bible itself St Paul literally explains a story from Genesis in metaphorical terms (the story of Abraham and his wives).


3) Polygamy is actually the normal in OT. It's only when Jesus comes along that it becomes one man, one woman.


4) There are actually four different accounts of Jesus from different cultural perspectives such as Jewish and Hellinistic culture.


5) The Book of Revelations is essentially a coded message to a very specific number of Christians during a time of great persecution. They would have understood the content and what things meant whilst the Romans who read it wouldn't and so the Christians would be protected. This is also the reason it's so confusing and misunderstood by many because we're Essentially the Romans. I've done a lot of research but still find it tremendously confusing.


6) Some parts of the Bible are said to no longer be valid with the Bible itself. Be wary of anybody quoting from the book of Levicitus or much of OT for ways to please God because Jesus essentially rendered all that moot. 


7) Context is important. As an example the line, ""he who disobeys his masters will shall be beaten with many stripes"". This condones beating slaves right? In fact actual slave owners used to use it as justification for harsh treatment.


Wrong.


It's actually a message about hypocrisy. Jesus uses the example of a servant who is brutal and judgemental of others. Yet when the right and just master (eg God) comes back he punishes the cruel servant for being an evil person. So it is with followers. Jesus is very easy to twist because he used parables extensively. He even complains that his followers are thick because they don't understand his metaphors.


8) Most people including Christians have never read the Bible. They really should because without reading it properly you can be easily manipulated.


Thats just a few points that I have. Anyways I'll be happy to answer any questions folks may have."

5977,"You cant understand it without the Hadith. And also you cant understand the Hadith with reading 15-20 Hadith. This is Ahlal Sunnah Wal Jamaah. Means ""The Life and Words of the Messenger (Prophet)and His Followers""  And here the problem starts everyone who opens Quran think they understand everything.

So what's my proof? In Quran says ""**\[We sent them\] with clear proofs and written ordinances. And We revealed to You**  \[SAW\] **the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought.\]"" NAHL 44.** So shortly says ""We sent You (Muhammed \[SAW\]) to teach and explain to the people."" 

So here the wahhabi or modern interesting minded, or other maniac isis kinda Muslims disappear sadly. And they opend the Quran and said ""We understand It"" No you cant. Quran says you need the Hadith to understand It.

Let me explain you. Lets talk about 2 Verses. One says ""Kill unbelievers whereever you find them"" and the Other says ""Dont attack any unbelievers until they attack You, if they attack You, You, attack them to""

These 2 look like a contradiction right? But not actually let me explain

So some super geniuses read the first One and become isis minded. But on the Next, **NEXT VERSE,** you can easily see that It is about a war. Allah (CC) says ""dont let them run away for this war"" sorry for low english btw. But some bad people whoever they are, use these kind of Verses to make Muslims Isıs. But if you look at the Prophet's (SAW) Life you can never see Him attacking or hitting anyone except a war. Lets make it more clear after the Second one i said ~~Dont attack any unbelievers until they attack You.~~ After this Verse, a time later, once someone bring a news to my Prophet. He said ""Rome may make an army and may plan to attack Us."" My Prophet (SAW) took His army and went to the Romean orders. But there wasnt any army. Rome wasnt there, They werent attacking. Do you know what happened ? Muhammed SAW didnt attack. He (SAW) did not attack. If you look at the era of [Rashidun Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate) you can easily see He (SAW) had the power to get most of anatolia. But He (SAW) didnt. He (SAW) did not. Took the Army and returned back. Now tell me can you undestand without the Hadith and Life of my Prophet? (SAW)

You probably don't consider what you're doing to be victim-blaming, but you actually are. You're thinking of rape as something that is at all in the hands of victims to prevent and statistically you're very much wrong; rape is not usually random, it is perpetrated by people that already know the victim, and it's done in scenarios where the victim *rightfully* has their guard down.

6123,"Started dating this guy in Arizona. He was recently divorced and there were kids so his ex-wife and his stepson from his first marriage were still very much in his life. One day I was telling my sister about the issues with the troubled stepson and the first wife, both of whom have unique names. My sister got very confused. Finally we worked out that she had dated the stepson's biological father in Colorado several years earlier. The bio-dad had not been involved in the kid's life, and my sister had been trying very hard to get him to go visit his kid, and so had communicated with the mom (the ex-wife of my then-bf and her ex-bf) and the guy she had been married to at the time (the guy I was now dating). (And no, my sister never got the guy to stop being a deadbeat, which was part of why she left him, and it took the kid YEARS to turn his life around. And he still considers his mom's ex-husband to be more of a father to him than his bio dad ever was.)"

Literally every school kid in Germany for example is made aware of and educated about many of the Nazi war crimes committed during WWII and they do not try to bury the reality of what went on, whereas in Japan, a lot of the horrific Japanese war crimes during that dark period are still swept under the rug and are not part of the educational curriculum, so today's students and later generations after the war have little knowledge of them. Many Japanese would be shocked to hear what heinous war crimes many of their grandparents and great-grandparents were party to during the Second World War.  "

As he fell the guy started foaming at the mouth and going blue, while a senior lab tech informed us to not touch the guy and not risk causing any harm etc etc (guess they didn't wanna be liable too). Guy was clearly chocking so i brought another guy over with me to put the dude in the recovery position despite protests to not touch him.

A casting agent will invite this ""young nobody"" to their office, telling them they're a bright young star that the casting director thinks has great potential. Once the actor is there, the director suggests that they can get a part in a huge role if they ""return a favour"" usually sex, but even nudes. Sometimes they use this to blackmail the actor, forcing them into porn. If it's not used as blackmail, often times it results in no legitimate work. Even if it does, it's still exploitative. "

6261,"That's not all. Greece got into the EU and the euro to supposedly better it's economy with the common currency and open market between countries. Also to this day Greece had received many European Union investments both in the public sector and in the private sector to better it's infrastructure and become more antagonizing. 

But ofcourse guess what, the public money went into huge infostructure projects that often took decades to be finished costed 2-3 times more (somehow) and in the end they where never up to standards and where sloppy jobs. On the same line, in the private sectors many farmers, businessmen took many European investment programs to upgrade their equipment and such but since there was no check to see if they did use the money for their intended purpose the money instead became brand new Mercedes and BMWs huge ass pick up tracks, brand new house equipment etc. 

Ofcourse on thing that all those new Ana shiny items they bought had in common?  They where predominantly made in Germany!  So the plan is really simple. You keep loaning Greece money, they buy a shit ton of products from you (remember Germany's exports are HUGE)  easily with the euro and open to trade between you. Now you both have sold a gazillion cars, medicines, appliances etc but now they also own you interests. 

Not to mention the ridiculous amounts of money Greece spends in military vehicles which are all bought from USA, Germany and France ( we are at poverty yet each government will invest into brand new jets and shit)  and all that despite the fact we are in NATO because each time turkey makes an offensive claim or move against us Noone fucking cares. Seriously I don't see the point of being in NATO. Maritime law was updated some time ago to essentially double the distance from the shore that is a country's sea borders so that the USA can take advantage of new oil wells in Alaska. But when Greece announced that they would also apply the law like everybody else, Turkey threaten us with war and our ""allies"" in the NATO the Americans ""advised us against that"". Similar story with the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. 

You want your money back?  guarantee us that you will stop turkey from bulling us and we can sell all the army crap and easily pay you the interests but ofcourse that would be bad business for big arms companies in France, USA, Germany etc. 

We even had Trump recently essentially congratulating us for being good customers since Greece is spending the agreed percentage of her gdp on defence as it was agreed in Nato.

First time saving someone would be something relatively risk free. Some kid is about to get hit by a car. Freeze time, pick them up, return to sidewalk.

No one has any idea that I can freeze time. As far as their concerned, I teleported him or her to safety.

Now, the key here, is to act like I don't want the attention. I set him or her down on the sidewalk, and attempt to get out of dodge as quickly as possible.

The next time will be a little more risky. Stop a robbery or mugging. Man with gun threatening the life of someone behind the counter at a convenience store. Pause time, pry the gun out of his hand, hit him with the biggest thing I can find. Move to behind the counter with victim. Time unfreezes. Bad guy is incompassitated from a blow to the head. I have the weapon. I'm able to calm the victim while also calling the police.

6448,"&gt;Treated her with respect and never forced her to do anything.

Not in the books. He molested her on their wedding night (forced her to strip, and fondled her), and treated her kind of shittily at times, deliberately scaring her, not caring that she was a terrified 12-year old, being pissed she didn't love him or was 'disloyal' despite the fact that he was actively trying to destroy her family and she did not consent to the marriage. 

And it's not because Tyrion was a dwarf, or that Sansa was shallow and only wanted a handsome husband. In Sansa chapters, she explicitly thinks that she hated being married to him because she was forced and because he was a Lannister, not because he was a dwarf. She acknowledged that yes, he was ugly (he has no nose in the books), but she no more wanted to be married to Lancel Lannister than Tyrion. She was willing to be married to Wyllas Tyrell (who was disabled), because she wanted to be away from Joffrey and the Lannisters, and she thought the Tyrells would not abuse her (she really really really just wanted to get away from Joffrey and the beatings). And she also had some weird quasi-sex dreams about Sandor, who lacked half a face. The things Sansa wants in a spouse is safety, protection, and kindness (and not being beaten up all the time), someone who likes her beyond her claim to Winterfell, and Tyrion wasn't always kind to her and didn't make her feel safe and only married her so his family could claim Winterfell. The reader likes Tyrion, but Sansa is under no obligation to. He's still her enemy in the story at the time of their marriage. 

He was less bad in the show, but the fact remains that she was forced to marry him and he was actively trying to defeat her family and take her ancestral home for her families murderers. She owed him nothing, and it always annoyed me that the show acted like she should be more grateful. "

Superman being faster than the Flash in Justice League was the dumbest thing ever. Although I forget how old his character is, maybe he isn’t as fast yet. I know his characters speed has varied a lot over the many arcs told involving him."

Doing business with Chinese factories is a major hassle. Unless you're Apple, you don't own the factory. You're placing orders to a factory to make goods and hoping to make 30-40 points on the import. The factory has your requirements, your compliance needs and the cost you're paying them. The factory then tries to make as much as they can by shirking social compliance requirements and customer requirements.

I've placed purchase orders for faucets that were supposed to be zinc and received plated ABS. I've had factories ask which set of books they were supposed to show auditors. I know a few factories where the employees still can't leave.

But whenever I get asked something like ""who would you swap bodies with for a day"" or ""what would your X-Men power be"" (it would be shape-shifting), I always think about being a woman.

If I woke up a chick with the same basic qualities as I have now, i.e. Green eyes, brown hair, 5 and a half foot tall, I think the first thing I'd do is get accustomed to myself. Am I still skinny? Are my boobs big? What does my vaginas feel like?

Obviously I'd masturbate pretty soon so I could feel a female orgasm, and then maybe a few more times... I think my GF would have to get accustomed too. She's bisexual so it think she'd be cool with it if not a little freaked out!

Now the rest of the day depends on whether this is a permanent change, only for the day, or either and I don't know. In all of those situations, I'd get ready to go for a drive and get some new clothes- the idea of getting cute outfits and looking either casual, cute or hot sounds amazing! I'd get dresses, skirts, maybe a pair of heels to learn to walk in, cute shoes and anklets and jewelry... The amount I get depends on whether I know this is permanent or not.

I'd rely wholly on my GF teaching me what I need to know as a woman, and if it was permanent I'd probably get all of the period stuff taken out (because fuck periods and fuck if I'm ever giving birth).

OHH and I'd get makeup and paint my nails and my toes and probably wear lots of different outfits in a day... Man I could go on for hours about what I'd love to do as a woman 😅

6644,"If someone is doing both a gender reveal and a baby shower than it's just... a bit much. Ala, Pregnant Women are Smug.

Also, gender reveal parties started in the south and had really tacky reveals like ""guns or glitter?"" cakes. Combine that with gender reveal parties really taking off after transgender rights became huge and to some people it just seems like parents are making statements that they will not accept their child if its gender isn't what the expect.

Also there is no fool proof way to test a fetus's sex.

And I get down voted for saying this every time, but color coding infants so strangers know what they're genitals look like is just weird. I get that gender is an important social construct to a lot of people, but I tell you, it's a baby, it's not even a year old, he's not a ""ladies man"" and she's not a ""tease"". They're all infants. All they do is shit, scream, and sleep. And it's disrupting that so many people want to prescribe more motive to those actions than exist... because of what gender they think that infant is. "

For young kids, the ways OP mentioned are the only real way to get them to stop misbehaving, atleast in my limited experience with kids. 

For teenagers, who are 16-18 parents should start treating them more like adults. The teenagers should be able to do what they want with their money, for example. Parents can give advice, but shouldn't make decisions for their kids. Another example, what their kids are going to do when they finish high school. If your kid wants to do something that you don't understand, try to learn and help them do that, don't say it's a bad idea and I don't know much about it in the same sentence and then push ""better"" options onto your kids.

After they talk about how there is 12 heavens, each representing the 12 God's, a guy on YouTube by the name of ""True_Atheist"" will upload a video telling everyone that they will kill those 12 second-comings. Pay YouTube to get it to #1 trending, and pay some news stations to do a cover on it. When 2020 rolls around, every month True_Atheist will kill one the Second-comings. Everyone will get really really pissed. Use the Media to get everyone even more pissed, to the point where we pay the government to start a purge. A week-long purge. Eventually the purge will be year-round, and society will be in shambles. On the last functioning screens, monitors, devices, a message will be broadcasted.

6719,"~~The lucky ones~~ The smart ones. 

The lucky ones indeed. I'm not saying you don't know (I don't know your background), but let me tell you about the number of people with no prognosis I keep alive daily as a critical care physician because they or their families can't make the decision to let them die peacefully. Modern medicine lets me keep pretty much anything alive - but only in the sense that I can make your heart beat and your lungs deliver oxygen. I wouldn't consider that living, and most other people wouldn't either when hearing it described. EVERYONE jokingly says, ""If I'm ever in a coma, I expect your to put a pillow on my face,"" or something along those lines. But in reality almost no one understands what that actually means, and outlines it in their living wills. Even worse, fewer people take in to consideration how challenging a decision that is for a loved one. 

So what happens? Mom sits on a vent. Daughter #1 says this isn't what mom would want (having heard the above quote literally every person makes). Daughter #2 says we have to do everything we can for mom - that mom ""wouldn't give up."" So I end up traching &amp; pegging your mom. She doesn't get better. She develops an infection - a pneumonia or bed sore - a few months later, and still dies, but with a prolonged period of suffering. 

Everyone should discuss with their loved ones how they want to die, and then appoint someone who will actually respect that. It probably shouldn't be a parent. They can't be objective. Find someone who will make sure you aren't kept alive against all reason. 

At the end of the day, the majority of Americans DO die of heart disease, strokes (CVAs), or cancer. Don't be afraid of that. Be aware. Make a plan. Prepare to die on your terms, not someone else's. My wife isn't my medical power of attorney for that exact reason - my best friend from medical school is. He's the best person I know to make those decisions for me. Each of us needs to find that person who'll take care of us. "

You can call other discards to complete a set, but can only call the person behind you for three-in-a-row. You also need a Yaku, a set that holds value for scoring. A closed hand (never called a discard) always has one, and their is a long list of them. The first thing you learn is memorizing them.

I don't mind it too much if it's just a talking video cos if it's a talking video I wouldn't be watching it anyway, so it'll end up just being an audio commentary.

But would you rather hear said person's thinking sounds (like ""uhhh, erm, ahhhmmm"" etc?) I think cutting those out could make for a more coherent presentation of points.

Of course, it could be made much easier if the person just wrote and memorized a script, but a lot of video content 'producers' nowadays kinda just ramble on about their thoughts, with only a barebones structure to it.

6816,"It's not a choice, I and my bipolar meds are aware of that. But there is a choice in how you live your life with mental illness, and the choice I made was to wallow in it and use it as an excuse to stay stagnant. I shut myself out, I refused help, and more than that I refused to help myself in any way. I chose to be miserable because it was easier than to put in the work to be happy, or even put in any work at all. I wasted almost five years of my life defining myself by my mental illness, and I missed out on a lot of opportunities. I'm now playing catch up to everyone around me. I've lost contact with people I held dear, and fell in with people who hurt me but who enabled this lifestyle of pointing fingers at everyone and everything except myself as to why I was stuck. That included things like pointing at someone saying ""do what you can to help yourself"" and saying ""wow, I'm all fixed now!""

I'm not suggesting people throw out their pills and go do yoga for a magical cure to mental illness, but I am saying that maybe getting out of bed and not blaming everyone around you for your problems is a good idea. Maybe a better way to put it is ""I took responsibility for my own happiness,"" but that's not as good of a tagline."

6837,"From Wikipedia I quote:

&gt; Poetry is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Poems don't *have* to rhyme. Poems don't *have* to pay attention to feet or other metrics. But they definitely have to use *some* kind of aesthetic quality beyond what the words mean. Otherwise it's prose. Prose is nice, too. Most of my favourite books are written in prose. But it's by definition not poetry, and pointing that simple fact out isn't gatekeeping.

“But what about free verse?” I hear you ask. Well, it's a common misconception that free verse isn't bound by *any* aesthetics. It is, but it's not bound as strictly and not by any previously established means. It's definitely the hardest form of poetry to make, because it's really easy for it to come across as lopped-off prose badly written, but if you manage to pull it off the results can be quite striking. I dislike free verse the most, but many of my favourite poems are written in free verse. Do I make any sense?"

Abortions do not happen to pregnancies that are wanted, save in some incredibly tragic circumstances.  So no,  in a lot of cases a woman choosing abortion did not choose to become pregnant in the first place.  

Which kinda sets your paradigms back to ""You had sex so suffer""   Which is punishing a woman for having an active sex life, and indulging in one of *the* most basic biological functions imaginable.  And why? Because you, personally, don't think they should have that option, based on your own preconceived notions.

A woman who has a failure in contraception does not choose to be a mother. Yet you would deny her abortion?  Your own logic doesn't even hold up against itself.

7017,Our rescue started interacting with our other two dogs in small ways over a period of time. We have one hyper competitive dog that catches every ball we throw. The rescue began to emulate her eventually but generally she’ll run after the ball then look confused when she gets to it. Other times she will chase the ball and catch it but only carry it around for a minute or two. Balls and ropes don’t mean as much to her as squeaky toys or other toys that make sounds... She’ll play with them for about ten minutes but then systematically destroy them and then wanna cuddle. She’s the best!

7062,"The form exists in lieu of the more complicated gift tax. I've used it for my ""consulting"". What you have is a non licenced buisness. You are in no way indicating any illegal actions at the federal level. At the state level you may have been required to get a licence, but that's dependent on the state rules.

Otherwise you have still taken in money and if it isn't earned, it is gifted(, or capital gain, but that is a lower tax rate and should claim that if you can instead). Here you need to record who gave you the money. Then after so much money has been given by the same person that person must pay tax on what they gave you. Let's say I gave you $15,100. The first $15,000 is tax free for me to give you in a year. Mind you, you have $15,100. I would owe 18% on the $100. That means in order to give you $15,100 it costs me $15,118. That gift tax rate could be as high as 40% when we get into drug lord million dollar range.

This is why my consulting costs so much. I bring free samples and instruct you on the use of, origin, quality, and distribution difficulties. I will also consult about conspiracy, Netflix, and Gina from down the block. I've been known to consult pro bono, but people value my information more when they pay for it."

7099,"Rather than having a time limit for consent you should always make sure there's a way to immediately signal. 

Have two safe words. One for ""stop"" and one for ""ease up."" Because it's quite common that someone will find that things are too intense, or that the restraint has led to real discomfort, but they won't want to put brakes on the whole thing. A good choice is ""red!"" to totally stop, 'break character', pull out and take off restraints and gags, and ""yellow!"" to continue but less aggressively. Also to voice a request eg ""yellow, more lube"", ""yellow, untie my arms"", so people can be comfortable without interrupting the rolelay or spoiling the pace/mood, which is how it's often seen. 

And you need a nonverbal signal if someone is getting gagged in any way. This can be shaking their head side to side, short rapid noises like ""uh-uh-uh"", humming a rising and falling tone like a siren, or very rapidly blinking. No matter the situation there should always be a way to signal."

7108,"Or we could train dudes not to do this. The only problem there is guys inability yo get over the mere *possibility* that some men need to be taught this because they *feel* like it gives people the impression that they themselves are rapists. So because nearly every guy gets defensive when it's brought up, the onus of not getting raped continually falls on women, because some dudes are uncomfortable with discussion and don't want anyone implying they're rapists, even though thats *not the conversation that needs to be had*, but guys comfort trump women's safety, so the narrative will continue to be dominated by men who think that teaching men not to rape is patronizing (oh, the irony of *that* double entendre), and implies all men are rapists.

It's like saying we shouldn't teach sex education because it implies that men don't inherently know how to have sex. Some of them don't, and need to be taught. Same dealing with consent. Not all men know the specifics of consent and it should be taught. "

7150,"&gt;So often I hear people scoff at the assertion that people are ""buying drugs with their food stamps"".

Not scoffing, but it's a lot harder since they got rid of the actual stamps a few decades ago. How do you verify the card that the hobo is offering you has a full months benefit remaining on it? do you trust the hobo when they say ""trust me this debit card has 180$ on it"" or do you go to a grocery store with them and check the remaining balance before trading the money for the card? And if you didn't immediately spend the money on the card that hobo could go to the social insurance office they got the card from and have the card they gave you canceled and a new one printed.

You can't really sell those cards to randoms on the street corner, there needs to be a personal relationship with trust between both parties in the transaction or it's extremely easy for the beneficiary to scam the buyer."

7175,"The worst part about it is that most men will never, ever know. They discount it because they don't get this attention. Almost ever. So despite being the dominant voice in online social spaces, guys do not look out for this sort of manipulation, and don't condemn those committing it, or support the victims (male or female). A lot of the time you could get called a white knight (not common anymore), which is basically the fedora 'nice guy' version of a stalker, ""I will follow you around and keep you away from any guy (and keep you to myself),"" if you try to help. Truly that doesn't happen anymore, and if you are just trying to do the right thing, and the victim is asking for help, you shouldn't care what anyone else says. "
7176,"It really depends on the prof.  Usually intro and low level undergrad classes tend to be taught by professors who went to college to educate kids.  Once you get into the higher classes, it can be a crap shoot.  Sometimes, they can just be there to do research, and they are forced to teach a class.  They take it out on the students, don't put forth effort, and really shit on the whole process.

Remember, she is the head of the adobe classes. Picture the word i'm thinking right now, it isn't pretty. (by teaching online only, she was able to hide how unfit she was for the job)

My boss always setup the MCSE tests and such to give the students a fighting chance because the twit of a teacher couldn't figure out how to do it.

7202,"You said it right. I tried to love MFM, and while the hosts are very funny, they're not actually great about telling the story sometimes. It's better if you already have read about the murder itself than to let them tell you about it from the beginning. It's more like commentary than a story, but I don't know these stories.

7217,"World History Before 1500. Not quite a slice of humble pie, but more like a what the fuck am I doing with this course? I love history, and was stoked to learn more. The Paleolithic period! Nope, only a couple pages in the prologue. The Roman Empire and Ancient Greece! Ehh, okay, but not even a full chapter. The Crusades! Here’s a video. Vikings!!!! Here’s a tiny blurb that’s actually just an insert to a picture. 

It was damn near 90% Chinese history and the way they helped shape the world. Interesting, yes, but why the fuck do I have to memorize all the dynasties and two (!!!) full chapters on the Silk Road in a book that ignores the Maya and doesn’t even mention Charlemagne once. I aced it, but was damned disappointed. 

So what did I do? I signed up for World History After 1500., hoping for something different. Yay, another 850+ pages to read about the Chinese!

Went to drop the package at the gate of one of these homes, got asked through a speaker to come through and up the driveway and just leave the package at the door.

Sure thing, that's my job.

As I get there, a scruffy looking mid-40s man wearing an old sweater and jeans comes out, asks me what he'd have to do to get the package for free.

I said ""nothing.""

He said ""Let me blow you.""

I said ""Sir, I'm a man.""

Next I'm with a guy friend at the mall explaining this happened and he freaked out saying ""wow that's assault"" and etc. then we're driving back and he groped me twice once before and once after me saying what the hell.

Well, I often got handed things that were not the token, including a chewed-up piece of corn and a half-eaten biscuit. One monkey was fond of sucking just the guts out of a mealworm and handing me back the rest of it. That particular monkey liked to smear poop everywhere, and the tokens had a hole in the center. When she was first starting her training she shoved a turd inside the token and I felt a part of my soul leave my body because I knew if she handed me that shit-filled token *I would have to take it.* Luckily or unluckily, she had a tendency to stash the tokens in weird places around her enclosure so I was able to pick it up with gloves later rather than have it placed in my bare hand.

Edit: Islamic fundamentalist terrorism is terrorism conducted for the purpose of spreading Islam/destroying non-Muslims. This kind of terrorism applies to all other religions. Christians killing non-Christians for non-religious reasons does not fall into this category. Muslims killing non-Muslims for non-religious reasons does not fall into this category.

Example: Pulse shooting: terrorism
Rwandan genocide: not terrorism

Charleston church shooting: terrorism (Christian fundamentalism)
Gas strikes in Syrian civil war: not terrorism

This is not debateable; it is a fact of international relations. To claim that the Rwandan Genocide is terrorism is factually wrong."

Magic in the series is a very rare thing in a population sense, and dying out in the universe. What i felt worked really well was a huge amount of character development across the series. Idealistic youngsters become jaded and ruthless veterans with life long injuries they deal with. Pants on heads lunatics slowly get given back stories that show their decent into madness. Some baddies become goodies..... then baddies again. Men become gods and gods become men. It's not quick though.

7322,"#The Fall of Constantinople.

It's one that I look back to and it instantly makes me feel a sense of deep animosity. A large part of the Christian world fell that day. The Byzantines were greatly outnumbered, and fought valiantly and died with honor. 

The last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI, especially makes me feel sad when I read it. 

&gt;""Therefore, when he saw with his own eyes the evident danger threatening the City, and was able to save himself, he did not choose to do so, although there were many who begged him to, but preferred to die with his country and his subjects, or rather to die beforehand himself, so that he may not see his country captured and all the inhabitants either cruelly murdered or made captive and ignominously taken away."" - Michael Kritovoulos

Definitely inspirational for me. 

Here's an excerpt from his final speech. 

*""I can tell you that this city mastered the entire universe; She placed beneath her feet Pontus, Armenia, paphlagonia, The Amazonian lands, Cappadocia, Galatia, Media, Georgian Colchis, Bosphoros, Albania, Syria, Cilicia, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Palestine, Arabia, Judea, Bactria, Scythia, Macedonia, Thessaly, Hellas, Boeotia, Locris, Aetolia, Arcarnania, Achaea, the Peloponnese, Epirus, Illyria, Lykhnites, the Adriatic, Italy, Tuscany, the Celts, and Galatian Celts, Spain up to Cadiz, Libya, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Beledes, Scude, Numidia, Africa and Egypt.*

     *Now he wants to enslave her and throw the yoke upon the Mistress of Citie, our holy churches, where the Holy Trinity was worshipped, where the Holy Ghost was glorified in hymns, where angels were heard praising in chant the deity of and the incarnation of God’s word, he wants to turn into shrines of his blasphemy, shrines of the mad and false Prophet, Mohammed, as well as into stables for his horses and camels.*

     *Consider then, my brother and comrades in arms, how the commemoration of our death, our memory, fame and freedom can be rendered eternal.”-Constantine XI*

I feel such a sorrow for those Greek lands. Hagia Sophia, a beautiful architecture, marvel of Christianity, desecrated, and insultingly turned into a mosque. 

I look at those lands now, and the leaders like Erdogan. 

I don't have words for it."

Someone's about to write about time being the great healer.

First, I'm a bit drunk so excuse anything dumb here.

It's not.  You just learn to cope.  Had a god awful breakup.  found her cheating a week before marriage after 6 years together awful.

I'm happily married with beautiful children now.  I'm subjectively and objectively happier now than I would have been in that relationship.  

I still wonder what/how she's doing sometimes.  I used to look her up on facebook/google to check sometimes.  I don't anymore, it doesn't help.

The real answer is that in the beginning, it's about understanding that you have worth as a person.  He/she is not the only thing about that people value.  Also, it's ok to fucking hurt, and hurt for awhile.  

After a bit, you'll rationalize, you'll hate, you'll be bitter.  the bitterness comes back form time to time still.  But at your own pace, you'll get to be ok again.  

But it's not really time that fixes it, it's growing as a person.  

That doesn't help right now, I know, I'll never forget that fuck awful pain, confusion, and self-doubt.  Right now, you focus on putting some tolerable food in yourself, talking to someone, really anyone that you trust, and try to believe that you'll grow into the new life without the other person."

7536,"In 2nd grade, we had French fries at lunch. We had those trays with the 4 separate sections, one of which I filled with ketchup. I ate my fries, but still had about half the square full of ketchup, so went to throw it away. The lunchroom monitor (not my regular teacher, but the other 2nd grade one) made me sit back down and eat the ketchup, by itself. 

Now, I know everyone will say, ""No way would I have done that!"" But, I was 6, very shy and always did what the teachers said. If that happened today, or even a couple years later, I wouldn't have done it! I just sat and cried whilst eating ketchup with a spoon, though 😬."

7541,"To give context, it was the last major battle of the war. The remaining Japanese forces were making a desperate attempt to flee Korea at night. Admiral Yi could not let these invaders, who had raped and pillaged his nation for years, leave. Yi caught the Japanese navy, ready to fight using his longer ranged cannons as he had for the entire war. However, the Chinese Admiral decided to charge forward into close range combat and was quickly overwhelmed. Yi charged forward to save the Chinese admiral, managing to break the encirclement. The Japanese were losing moral and withdrawing. Yi would not, could not let them escape. This war which had dragged on for so long and caused Korea so much suffering needed to end that night. 

Yi personally grabbed the mallet from the ship's drummer to beat the drum himself, urging his ships forward onto the faltering force. The drumbeat pushed the rowers to row faster, to end the invasion once and for all. Japanese ships were blasted by cannon fire by the pursing Korea vessels, one after another. All that many of the Japanese could do was fire back with their bows and their early musket. One Japanese soldier fired at Yi's capital ship.

The drumbeat faltered. Yi was struck with that stray bullet. No one but his son, his nephew, and a loyal servant knew what happened. Yi said, ""The battle is at its height. Beat my war drumgs. Do not announce my death.""

One of Yi's sons quickly put on Yi's armor, grabbed the mallet, and beat that drum. No one else knew of Yi's passing as Yi's sons led the fleet as he did. The Japanese again managed to surrounded the Chinese flag ship, but again Yi's capital ship went into the frey and saved the Chinese admiral. As the day closed, the battle was over. Almost none of the Japanese forces got out alive. Even this battle, the battle that took his life, Yi once again was victorious.

The Chinese Admiral came to Yi's flagship, but only found Yi's son. The Chinese admiral shouted in despair, ""Even after death you saved my life."""

So we come back and sit down and the bartender immediately recognizes us and calls the whole staff to the bar says “it’s the killers”. Then they started laughing.  Obviously my friend I were a bit confused.  Apparently the woman did not make it home that night, and her sister whom she lived with, called the bar the next morning to investigate.  The bartender described how the whole bar staff theorized that we had done something and they collected video tapes with the cops from the surrounding buildings.  It apparently went kinda far.  Thankfully, she showed back up having visited an ex and turned off her phone for the weekend.   So basically, for a full day, these people thought my friend and I probably killed her.

7843,"The only thing PHP and Javascript have on other languages is popularity that just keeps snowballing and have caused frameworks to be created on top of frameworks which implement yet other frameworks, often fully intent on hiding most things about the original language in the process. However, it does not change the fact that these languages have innards that are rotten to the point where they literally cost millions every single day.

Sure, there are ways to try and hide many of those warts (otherwise, why bother with those frameworks?) but they are still there. Something as utterly basic as [equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation) are not done right. Many of the original decisions were made rather arbitrarily, often on a particular usecase which has since been horribly outgrown, and you end up with warts like 'true equivalence' (===), a strange parser which combines with a weirder error/warning framework that make it really hard to figure out why you sometimes get little more than a white page, and more of such nastiness.

Most of these things result in the unnecessary wasting of time when trying to hunt down problems (often encouraging printf()-style debugging) when in many other languages, it would take far less time simply because the language itself is structured in a far more sensible manner.

And because of all these points, I am very much in disagreement on the 'reliable' moniker. If something is a reliable tool in my toolkit, I know exactly what it does, why it is best at that and why it will eventually break. For PHP, its huge range of libraries and acceptance are its only pro; in all other aspects I consider it hugely inferior."

*But they brag about it and how much they cost*.

Yeah well I brag about how much FPS my rig can get and my temperatures, and my sweet link to Steam Link in my living room TV so I can pc game from my couch. People brag about their passions all the time

*But at least you'd probably brag about the bargain you got*

Maybe, you've got a point. But y'know, fashion is like most creative fields. Because the value of the product or service is subjective, price plays a laaaarrrggeee factor in the value the customer gets. A business may brag to its investors that they got ""an award winning illustrator at a £1000 a day rate"" because people assume that the high number means that illustrator creates shit hot work.

Basically, when it comes to people's spending habits in fashion, shit is a lot more nuanced and complex than simple insecurity. Because if one is judging them for that insecurity, then you kinda need to judge consumerism as a whole. Which is all of us."

I actually enjoy their Minisodes where they read listener submitted emails. They're kind of like the stories in this thread; usually not as well known, so it's more mysterious. "
7849,"Yeah normally I side with feminist stuff but I feel like here, the ""men who rape"" would be more appropriate. The example for ""not all men"" being a bad response would be when a woman says, for example, ""men harass me on my way to work"" and someone responds with ""well, not all men..."" when that was obviously implied. 

That's not so obviously implied when someone says ""I hate men""."

Source: I was an absolute unit from ages 11-15, and my family and “friends” didn’t hesitate to let me know. Now I’m borderline underweight and still dealing with body dysphoria and an unhealthy relationship with food at 27. 

My roommate, who didn’t give a shit about his body and let himself get morbidly obese, walked 12 miles today to jumpstart his diet for the same reasons.

But I do agree society’s gender standards are so unfairly skewed against women still when it comes to weight. My dad said Amy Poehler “got huge” today - he’s been 50+ pounds overweight for my whole life. Messed up."

While it feels like the dark walls of the room are closing in on me, it leaps forward as I run up the first two steps of the stairs and I imagine that it grabs my leg and yanks me down the stairs. I hit my chin hard on the edge of the step during the fall and I pummel down the stairs and turn on my back to realize whatever grabbed me is nowhere to be seen. So I worriedly get up, pain pulsing through my face, with sweat pouring through my chest only to run up the stairs and close the door behind me going into my bedroom. And spending the rest of the night in silence, trying to process and listen to see if there are any more noises that I hear possibly coming through the floor, knowing that my living room is directly below my bedroom."

She did eventually get through but it took about an hour and half for the whole process as I kept thinking this was some kind of role play to psych her out for this other guy."

I like her, I just really misjudged the movie.

Okay, I mean if you go hiking like, every  other week for a 30 mile escapade and its really your goddamn thing, I get it I won't argue with that. But I feel like it's usually just the safe activity, to describe yourself because you don't want to say ""I just watch Netflix when I'm not at work"" because that sounds really lazy but you don't have much else going for yourself. So, hiking."

We are known for having this “love our kin” thing, how can i explain it? We help each other in times of need. Most robberies are against wealthy people, these guys have a robin hood mentality. This is obviously a generalization but it applies to most of the country. You can see plenty of shitty stuff happening per day, mostly thievery and pickpocketing, but seeing a mass murderer? A serial killer? A murder at plain sight? That’d be national news.

That feeling you are talking about is such a specific but unforgettable experience.

7985,"I always try to forget this, but I swear I lived in a haunted house. I was 18 and living on my own in an old house. I had a roommate at the time and her and several friends all began to say how they had weird experiences and they thought the house was haunted. My roommate moved out. Then for a while it was just me in the house.

 More and more I started to have these feelings that people were in the house with me. The first time I was watching tv and I felt like I was being watched. It was very cold in the room suddenly. I turned my head and there was a very tall shadowy figure watching me. Once I looked directly at him he was gone.

Then one morning I heard footsteps clearly running up my steps. My door was closed and it was an old door and very hard to open, but it burst open. I was completely terrified. I felt something touching me it felt like someone was running their hand up my leg. I jumped out of bed. I grabbed my phone and called my friend it was 5 am, but I called her to come get me. She answered on the first ring which was weird. She said, something in her dream said, ""Wake up."" We were horrified. She came to get me, but I couldn't afford to move out so I kept living there.

 At one point again I was on the phone with a friend another time and my door to my room burst open again and it felt like someone was choking me. I was on the phone so my friend heard me gasping for breathe. I ran out again and called someone to pick me up.

Eventually, someone in my group of friends knew how I thought my house waa haunted. So they introduced me to this girl who could see spirits, a medium. I told her how I thought my house was haunted and how I felt spirits present there. I told her how I felt like I was losing my mind and I didn't know what to even believe anymore. She said she would come over to investigate.

She came over went into my house and ran out to the sidewalk and started crying. The first thing she did was give me a hug and said, ""you're right."" Eventually, I made enough money to move out. I think some friends really thought I lost my mind and I am not fully convinced I didn't.

 Worst part was a year or so later I saw the same medium in passing. I happily told her how I finally moved out of my haunted house. She said, ""he's still following you.""

Thankfully, I usually block out these experiences until I read your story and it all came flooding back. "

I liked this same sort of idea in the the Admiral Holdo subplot as well, between her and Poe. The series already set us up to root for Poe, and things usually work out for Our Heroes, and the film set the stage for the audience to dislike and distrust Admiral Holdo, so despite Leia's trust in her, it didn't even cross my mind that Holdo might be in the right and Poe in the wrong.

Then tax his coffin, Tax his grave, Tax the sod in which he's laid.

Famously, on the bus together, the ""happy"" couple have just run away from her wedding to another guy, they laugh while lovingly look at each other, then sober and just stare with increasing looks of anxiety and concern into the foreground.

Scipio Africanus is responsible for the destruction of Rome's only rival which caused Rome to be the unquestioned hegemonic power in Europe for the next 600 years.  

Charlemagne created the conditions that led to modern day France and Germany, and founded an establishment that would hold power in Europe for the next 1000 years.  



I'll give you Gustav, but even then, he helped end Hapsburg hegemony in europe, helped set the stage for the fall of the Holy Roman Empire and he is still known as the father of modern warfare.

In terms of lasting influence, while yes George Washington is important to Americans, it is very likely that someone else would have come along and achieved what he did given the circumstances. I think the lasting influence of those I listed, Gustav non-withstanding, will still be felt in a 1000 years, and while I still thing Washington's influence will definitely still be felt I feel as though he will be a rung below them in terms of overall individual impact on the world.

A ballistic strike would take about 30 minutes, and we wanted to able to respond in that time, and the only person who could do that was the president.

Thus, the weird and often concerning amount of power vested in a single man whom millions of ordinary schlubs thought looked and sounded good on stage or TV.

Of course it helped that he was friendly with many of the founding fathers (and every president up to and including Andrew Jackson), but he also took a ""victory lap"" in 1824-25, a crucial moment in American history. The Revolutionary generation was dying out, and with the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence approaching, Americans started to look back at their history and commemorate it. Lafayette was the last general officer of the Continental Army, and came to them as a romantic figure out of the nation's birth struggle. He extended his original more limited plan for travelling to the US at James Monroe's invitation, and ended up visiting what was then every state of the Union. He was the first foreign dignitary to address Congress (which is why his portrait and Washington's both hang behind the Speaker's chair in the House of Reps today), he helped memorialize the Revolution by such things as laying the foundation stone of the Bunker Hill memorial, and he tirelessly attended endless receptions and events held in his honor.

8147,"&gt; According to some, this song was written in France during the time when Louis XIV was facing a difficult and dangerous surgery.

&gt; In 1686, the King started to have pain in a very delicate area. All the best doctors were called to Versailles to investigate the King’s derriere and he was diagnosed with a fistule anale (anal fistula) which was possibly caused by too much horseback riding. The doctors tried everything they knew to do, but the King’s bottom still hurt. As a last resort, they called in Charles-Francois Felix de Tassy, the barber/surgeon. In those days, doctors didn’t cut on people – that was the domain of the barbers who also did small surgeries, such as tooth extraction, and bloodletting.

[...]

&gt; Even though the Palace tried to keep it quiet, word leaked out about the King’s condition, his impending surgery, and the “practice patients” who didn’t make it. All over France, Louis XIV’s loyal subjects were praying for their King’s survival. At the Royal Girls School in St-Cyr, a few miles from Versailles, Madame de Brinon, the headmistress, wrote the words to “God Save the King.” It was a prayer asking God to protect the King, and the girls of the school recited it every day.

&gt; After Louis had recovered, he scheduled a visit to the school. Madame de Brinon had Jean-Baptiste Lully set the words to music and the girls sang it when the King arrived. It became a tradition that each time the King would visit, the girls would greet him with the song, “God Save the King.”

[...]

&gt; Twenty-eight years later, in 1714, the composer Handel, who was living in London, passed through Paris and heard the song. He took it back to the UK and had it translated into English. It eventually became the national anthem that is now played at all events where the royal family is present.

8176,"Look, 

There are a lot of comments on this post about the dark side of the porn industry. Especially about the scenes labeled ""rough"", ""brutal"", ""rape"", etc. 

I've seen some comments advocating that this kind of porn should be outlawed, or made illegal here in the US.  It is for that reason I feel responsible, as a citizen of the US, to post my philosophical viewpoint, with the hope that people will really think about what a ban on this type of content means. 

The greatest argument against banning this type of content, in my opinion, is the act of censorship itself. Censorship is, inherently, bad. We in the US are a culture that claims to value freedom, and liberty. Censorship prevents freedom by definition, especially so in a secular society. 

Censorship also, agian in my opinion, fetishizes the censored material it seeks eliminate. The content still exists, but the people who seek it have to go to much more dangerous places to access it. Places where they are much more likely to get drawn into even worse censored material. 

This is the same logic as the ""marijuana is a gateway drug"" statements many of us got in health class. Marijuana in itself will not make you want to do heroin, but obtaining Marijuana puts you in contact with people who sell drugs, and those people might also sell heroin. Now you have access to heroin, while if you never purchased Marijuana, or purchased it at a legal dispensary, you would not have the access necessary to purchase heroin.

Please do not misunderstand me, I am not advocating that all the types of porn that are currently illegal be made legal. Quite the opposite. There are boundaries we have set as a civil society to protect those who cannot protect themselves. I think we all know the kind of stuff I am referencing without going into detail. 

Censorship of any kind will not eliminate the problem. It will worsen the burden on our society while simultaneously taking the problem out of the spotlight, so that the victims will have even fewer resources, and knowledge, to seek help. 

No one calls the police when their weed gets stolen. 

The best way to solve the issue at hand is to put the power in the hands of those that would otherwise be made victims. So before you write a letter to your elected official requesting that this type of content be banned, please consider what you, as an individual, can do to help eliminate this problem. It starts with education. The more educated you are, the more you can help educate others. 

TL;DR: Dont ban violent porn. Make porn less violent.

Thank you, and I'll take my downvotes off the air. "

8188,"Actually he would have made a lot more selling 2 ounces of blow... 

56 grams at $60 a gram would net $3360. Now if he cut it a bit, let's say he stretches it to 80 grams. That's $4800.

Now in blowjobs at $20 a pop, he would have to give 168 or 240 respectively. Over one week, that would be One every hour or 1.43 an hour. Without sleep breaks. As you can see, he would have never made enough money to equal what he could have made with cocaine.

You want to make money in porn? You need to have return users. You want return users? You need to up the ante as time goes on so your users don't get bored and move on. Want to up the ante? Eventually people are going to start to get hurt. Nobody is going to agree to stay when they're being abused and their health is at risk, but the users are getting bored. You need more extreme measures to keep them on.

So you go through with it, missionary is tired, anal is old news, telling the actor to just pretend to be subservient has already been done, you need to show some force. But now the actor is backing out, they never agreed to this, nobody did. You have to stop them or you're not making a dime. So you threaten them, it's your only option.

Maybe they leave anyway. Well now you need someone new and not a single person is agreeing to being treated like dirt, when they thought of the job they thought it was going to be a glamorous ride of being worshipped by thousands for their body, not being looked at like breeding stock. So you lie to them. You tell them exactly what they want to hear because you need someone to be the mindless meat on display while looking good while doing it, and doing it honestly isn't cutting it.

 Good news, it worked, your company is getting bigger as more start watching what you have to show, it seems to fill a niche they didn't realize they had. Bad news, they want more, and you need to meet demand. You ramp up production, you need more actors, but it's not quantity they're looking for, it's quality. You feel bad about what you did to get where you are now but viewership is down and you aren't about to jump the shark with some some smacks across the face and some coarse language, you need something new. 

Lie to some more actors, get them in the door and you can force them to stay with some blackmail. This vanilla stuff isn't going to work with the users but this new content isn't going to work with the talent, and tricking the users won't get you very far. And besides, work is work and these actors have to do their jobs. It's the only way to make money in this business, and you've talked to some of the other guys and they're going this too, you have to stay competitive.

And it just spirals from there. Pretty soon you have little more than slaves and a bunch of users who won't accept anything less than someone taking a beating so severe they throw up after the camera turns off. And it's all necessary because nothing else is going to keep this pyramid scheme going, you need to keep moving to push the money through your gills or you drown, because everyone else in the industry is doing it and you can't afford to give up an edge like that to your competition.

Everyone loses. The company fights to keep up, the actors are sick and injured physically and emotionally, and your users have deathgrips stronger than a vice because they've been along for the ride the whole time, just seeing it from the surface."

8292,"When Henry VII invaded England in 1485, he came to one town when the man in charge would not líder him in. The man told him he’d walk into the city ‘over his dead body’ essentially.  One of Henry VII’s allies was able to come and convince the man to let Henry through. 

Henry had to walk over the man’s belly just inside the gates so the man could keep his honor. "

8295,"Well I guess I finally have a reason to tell these stories...

1. This is when I was 10 - one night I snuck downstairs and overheard my parents talking in our kitchen about my fathers son. Confused and excited I asked my mom about it the next day, she wasn’t particularly happy that I was sneaking around the house but she spilled the beans. My dad and my uncle owned a large, fancy Italian restaurant in town during the 70s-late 90s (this ties into the second story). My dad was sleeping with a waitress (way before my parents met) and the waitress ended up getting pregnant. She had the kid, kept the kid from my father for reasons I may never know and he hasn’t seen him since. 

I tried finding my older half brother but my father doesn’t remember much and my only other lead was a family friend that recently passed away but even she didn’t know that much. I still live in the same town so I could be living within 5 minutes of my half brother or he may live halfway around the world and I may never know. 

2. As mentioned in the first story - my dad and his brother owned an Italian restaurant. Unsurprisingly there was mob connections and wise guys frequenting the place daily. Back in the early 80s some wise guy was drinking (along with other wise guys) in the bar portion of the restaurant after closing time. I don’t know the details but the wise guy threatens my uncle’s life and my dad overheard this while cleaning the kitchen. This particular wise guy was known for being a shoot-first-ask-questions-later type of guy and went through with most of the threats he’s made throughout his time in the mob. 

My father took the threats seriously and felt compelled to do something to hopefully save his older brothers life. After this guy leaves, my father follows him down to the port in the next town (the wise guy had businesses down there). The opportunity presents itself and my father walks up to the guys driver side window and shoots him. Like I said I don’t have all the details but the guy and his car ended up in the water right off the port and nothing ever came of it after that. 

I don’t want to get hate for these stories but I wasn’t around when any of this went down. I’m only 25 so before my dad met my mom life was a lot different for him, especially being an Italian immigrant with a rough upbringing. I don’t look up to him for any of his actions but I can’t hold anything against him. He’s old now and with plethora of health issues that he’s facing day in and day out. I won’t judge him and I hope all of you won’t either. 

Thank you. "

So they essentially tried to scare the Russians off from invading.

An hour and a half of shitting, showering, douching and then using fingers and toys of various sizes to get her anywhere close to being able to put anything vaguely like a dick in there... it kills the mood. We tried 5-6 times and only the last 2 times did it take what I would consider not a ridiculous amount of time to prepare for - I used to end up sat there doing all the toy and finger prep completely soft as it's not a particularly erotic experience.

Then getting to the actual act... you've still got to go slow which makes staying hard difficult, and by the time the other person has relaxed enough for you to actually go fast enough to even think about cumming they just want it to be over because they've had 2 hours of stuff being shoved in their arse, and I can't say I blame them. You're also covered in lube which then ends up getting all over the bedsheets, so you've got to strip the bed afterwards anyway.

The actual sensation isn't anything to write home about, either. It's exciting because it's ""naughty"" and ""taboo"", but as a sensation it's... meh. In my experience, once they're relaxed enough to actually take a dick properly it's not that tight either so you need to hammer away fairly hard to get close to cumming which takes a toll on them too.

8378,"Did you hear the latest /r/askhistorians podcast on Thermopylae? There are a lot of reasons for questioning the official narrative. For starters, the older story was that there were 1000 Spartans. Second, they never claim the stand was a rear guard. The first story was that they stood to the death because the oracle said a Spartan king must die to save Greece. Third, Thermopylae had been breached only a decade or so before by the same pass the Persians used. The Greeks who used that pass in the previous war were allies with the Persians. The Spartans knew about the pass, which is why they had 1000 locals guarding the pass. It's hard to believe the Persians didn't know about the pass from the start.

The historian on the podcast suggests a different narrative. The Spartans sent a token force of 1000 men because they were taking the leadership in defending Greece, but were only truly interested in defending the Peloponnese. They sent a king to try to make it seem like a serious effort, but they sent the 60-year-old king. They hoped this would inspire enough central Greeks to join them, but because of festivals, only a few actually showed up. The Spartans and other Greeks set up in the hot gates, while about 1000 Phocians were sent to guard the pass around. 

The battle lasted three days because the Persians were waiting for their navy, which was being held up by the Athenian blockade. They engaged in some skirmishes in order to *keep* the Spartans and their allies in the pass. On the third day, they went around Thermopylae. The Phocians likely betrayed the rest of the Greeks and surrendered. The Persian army attacked the Spartan army from both sides. The rest of the Greeks weren't ""let go,"" but rather ran. The Spartans stayed for reasons of honor and then immediately started with a narrative of the heroic defeat. By the time Herodotus was writing about the events, there were already many versions of what had happened that he needed to straighten out.

I don't want it to sound too pathetic. The Spartan army did fight to the death, which the rest of the Greeks can't say. They were out-numbered as this was the full Persian show army. But the story we know (according to this historian) is the Spartan propaganda to hide a crushing defeat."

Generally, as a professor is considered being in a position of authority over the student it is frowned upon, not to mention that universities care about reputation and generally can terminate for inappropriate or believed to be inappropriate behavior where circumstantial evidence is sufficient.

As he walks out the front door carrying garbage he sees her running as fast as she can across the parking lot.

8896,"Let's travel back to the early 90s, when the mall was the happening spot, and anyone who was even remotely cool hung out there. 

Now, picture a 13 year old teen boy, and an 11 year old girl. Both have been right asses to their mom all week in typical teen rebellion. Back talking, refusing to do chores, and embarrassing their mother in various stores and family gatherings. 

Now, these three people were at the mall one Saturday. It was packed to the gills, and the kids were seeing their friends, schoolmates, and crushes constantly. 

Mom notices this. She pays attention to the shifting tide of young teens, and chooses her moment wisely. 

She lets the two teens get ahead of her; about 20 feet or so. They're approaching a group of mutual friends. 

When out of the blue they hear in  voice; a voice that carried clear across the mall, and carried with it an undeniable slur of someone whose mental capabilities aren't all there.


""John! Jane! Wait for me! Why did you leave me behind? Don't  you love your mama? Kids, wait for mama!""

John and Jane freeze, then stare at one another in horror. Their mom had warned them that payback would be hell for embarrassing her, and the time to pay the piper had come.

They quickly looked at their mom. She was shuffling along towards them. One hand curled up against her chest, jerking in spastic movement. One eye slightly drooped. Mouth parted, a string of drool hanging from her chin. A foot dragging behind her, as if it were deformed from birth. 

John and Jane quickly look back toward their friends, hoping they hadn't heard her, or worse, noticed her. 

Unfortunately their luck wasn't in. Their friends had noticed. Not only had they noticed, but they were pointing it out to other kids the teens went to school with. 

After that day, John and Jane never embarrassed their mom again. "

One night they decided to take us out to eat at this very country chicken restaurant. They had stuffed/plush chickens all over.
I was about 13 and my mom’s cousin told us they do some really funny skit for birthdays. So my mom decided to ask the waiter and then proceed to tell them that it was my birthday. (This was around June/July and my birthday is in October.) 
Well, sure enough, they bring out a chicken hat, place it on my head and get me to stand up. They then yell at everyone that it’s my birthday and start to play the chicken dance on the loudspeaker. All the staff kept egging me on to dance it with them and my parents and everyone in the packed restaurant was laughing. My mom was also taking pictures and yelling super loud.

He did so much research into every player in the story (with Harper Lee as his partner!), that you know he has a right to editorialize and describe in detail situations he wasn’t present for.

9005,"This was the late 90s. I was the customer, not the dealer.

The first fucked up experience was my dealer didnt had connections but he didnt have cash to get my meth. I wouldn't give him the money until he had the drugs. So he took me to his dealers house. I walked in and there was 5 black guys standing around and two of them had guns in their waist. That made my heart race a bit. 

Another time I was riding with my dealer to a hotel room to make a deal with his dealer for an 8 ball of meth. Along the way he starts checking out these two girls walking down the road and said he would go back for them. So he drops me off at the hotel room and goes back to get the girls. About an hour later he walks in with a bag of meth the size of a softball and two girls who were clearly traumatized. They both asked to go take a shower. My dealer left me with the meth and the two girls and said have fun.  His dealer picked him up and they left. 

As soon as he left the two girls told me he raped them both and they needed to go home and one girl said I could have sex with her too if I took her home. Not being a fucking monster I let them take a shower and then I dropped them off about 2 blocks from their house. They were both 11-12 years old. I left before my dealer got back and I moved about 200 miles away the next day. I was too scared to report him to the police and I had to get away. I heard about 3 years later that he was arrested shortly after I left the hotel and he got 10 years for assault and drugs and gun possession.

So I haven't done meth in almost 20 years now. "

When we were in our early 20’s, my mom let it slip that my cousin was not my uncles kid. I guess my cousin is actually the daughter of an 80’s rock band lead singer. (Not saying who) My mom and my Aunt were basically groupies for this band, and ended up back at their hotel room a few times. My uncle raised my cousin like his own and no one knew. 

I told my cousin because I thought she deserved to know. It was the biggest mistake ever. I should have taken it to my grave. It shook my cousin and sent her into a deep depression. My aunt all but disowned me. My cousin didn’t talk to me for years. About 3 years ago we started talking again. But it’s not the same. She never tried to make contact with her biological father, and her relationship with my uncle hasn’t changed. I don’t know about her relationship with her mom, it has always been a bit strained, but so has her sisters relationship with her mom, and she’s definitely my uncles kid. 

I really regret telling her. It messed her up bad. "

No dealer could ever be considered a Saint, (unless they come through on that 4am call)
but the fact that many do strongly draw the line there, rather than supplying far more damaging substances, which would be far more profitable, is at least something.

So many of them (I've got dozens of numbers saved in my phone book) are just regular lads, trying to put enough money away to get on the housing ladder, get a leg up in life, make some decent money and get out asap. They are not total dirt bags, they are not violent thugs, they are not monsters. They are just regular Joe's, taking advantage of the seemingly endless damand.

Where they will be in 5 years? I don't know. Likely better off than me, if they manage to keep their heads above the water, and good fucking luck to them, I say. While government sanctioned drugs like alcohol and tobacco continue to take thousands of lives per year.

Stuff You Should Know also did an episode called ""How Junk Food Works"" where they talk about the millions upon millions of dollars that, for example, Lays spent finding the perfect time to fry their chips so that the decibel level when you bite into them maximizes your response associated with fresh produce.

Fast/snack food companies spend so much money engineering their products to hook into as many evolutionary cues as they possibly can to encourage you to overconsume. For some people this ends up being addictive. Big Macs and Coca-cola aren't that far off from cocaine.

I know it is comforting to think most women in porn are the Sasha Grey ""I'm doing this to explore my sexuality!"" pseudo-intellectual type, but the reality is it is a sleazy industry that preys on the poor and suffering. I've had the unfortunate ""pleasure"" of meeting a guy who ran a cam site, and for real he's in the running for the biggest pile of human garbage I've encountered in my life. People make excuses for this industry all the time, but these people are fucking horrible. And not only are they horrible, they *know* they are horrible and don't give a shit. So you wouldn't even get the pleasure of insulting them to their faces. They view other human beings as sacks of meat they can exploit, they know they are like this, and they mock anybody who has the audacity to tell them this is a bad thing

On Oahu, King Kamehameha’s army managed to form a sort of 3-way attack that surrounded his adversary’s army and reared them to the Pali cliffs (look up a picture). Slowly, King Kamehameha’s army went forward and forced his enemies to fall one by one down the steep cliff.

Another battle with an adversary of King Kamehameha involved a defeat and an escape on the Big Island. The losing army (adversary of King Kamehameha) went inward and got hit with the ashes of an eruption. Many passed and some got petrified in the way they died; women with children in their hands, men sitting; basically Pompeii. "

9192,"After the First World War, Germany had to pay the victors a huge amount of money that it couldn’t really come up with. Realizing they were not going to be payed, the French occupied an area of Germany called the Rhineland in which much of the country’s industrial capacity was located. In 1936, a little over 2 years after Hitler came to power and about 3 years until WW2 in Europe would kick off, German troops marched into the Rhineland to reclaim it with orders to immedietly pull out should the French resist. The French choose to leave, giving the Germans the green light to annex more territory.

France could have said no, and WW2 would have probably been averted."

In many cases, it's simpler to let a man have his way with you than to enrage him and possibly cause further harm or even death. *Of course, not every sexual encounter between a man and a woman is an abuse of power dynamics,* but you had better believe there are many, many cases of ""blurred lines,"" and this is the very reason why we need to have an open, educational dialog about consent, and what women experience, in terms of sexual dynamics between men and women.

After a while it emerged that the person I was speaking to (a) went to my school, (b) did drama class with me, and (c) was actually a friend who I hadn't seen in almost 20 years. 

He lives in the USA now because he went off to do his doctorate there (in maths, obviously), and we lost touch.

Basically, the US was afraid of the Japanese seizing Hawaii and getting a large cache of US money they could use for whatever purpose. They exchanged money on the island with over print currency and declared the currency only valid on the island, so the money supply was ""isolated"".

Actually, the US (And probably other militaries) have issued nonstandard currency to troops for a long time over concerns related to logistics and counterfeiting. Soldiers are a good way to launder fake bills into the economy, and money is dangerous and expensive to move.

Today they issue [Pogs](http://www.mccoy.army.mil/vtriad_online/05142004/Pogs.htm), basically paper cut outs. They issued similar colored notes for troops in the Pacific.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

Yes they do. Everyone runs the risk of toxic ideas ruining their perception. You think good Police Officer's don't have to go to work and risk being shot at every day because of some perceived wrong that someone else experienced? 

That's the whole problem with these kinds of identity politics. 

Trying to group yourself in with every other trans person is insane. You're sitting here saying that a comedy from the 90s is ""transphobic"" when I've argued very clearly why it's not transphobic. Heterosexuals do not want to kiss other men. The thought of it is gross to them. That's not a phobia. 

Now you're saying that Ace Ventura Pet Detective is toxic and dangerous to trans people. It's not. It's an old comedy. Do you think Police Officers watch these kinds of movies and make a fuss about when they're portrayed as silly? They laugh right along with it. That's something most people do.

In the Britain the gap is 28.6% across all jobs (unweighted), 9.3% when you factor in seniority, 2.6% when it's the same company, and .8% when you factor in seniority, company, and job role but it's only full time pay that's taken into consideration, the gap may well be larger in part-time roles.

It also doesn't account for a variety of other factors like Holidays taken, and Childcare, but both those things for instance would lean things further towards closing the gap. (Men take fewer Holidays, and men are necessarily less affected by childcare.)

9458,"Yeah, the UP is super unlikely to ever become its own state, and if it ever did, it would have a very hard time functioning. For one thing, the population is basically that of a medium-sized city but spread out over an absolutely massive area. There are no real cities (just a few large towns), and the economy mostly relies on logging and tourism from other people who live in Michigan. Farming is basically impossible because the winters are so long and harsh and the ground is so rocky, so most farmed goods would have to be shipped in from the lower peninsula and Wisconsin, driving the cost of living up. Education would also be a problem, considering the UP only has a few colleges and many yoopers end up moving downstate to go to the bigger state schools. Since they’d now be living in another state, this pulls money away from the UP’s economy. In theory the UP could open some new colleges, but they don’t really have the $$$ necessary to do it. "

9518,"That's a super popular formula. Pretty much any movie that develops into a 3 part franchise uses that formula. The first movie is made as a self contained story. It does really well. Then they get green lit for 2 more. So they make the second movie be a cliffhanger for the 3rd. This is, in part, why so many trilogies end up sucking. You can't watch 2 or 3 without each other. They will always feel incomplete because they're basically 1 movie stretched out into 2.

A very recent version of this, albeit a little bit different on the ""trilogy"" part of this, is Infinity Wars. They're able to get away with it a bit more because they have 20 some odd movies that build up to this one so we're all definitely invested in the characters. But Infinity Wars and whatever the title is for part 2 that comes out next year is basically Empire and Return. After both movies are out for dvd or netflix, you'll never be able to just watch one without the other.

Other examples being the Star Wars Prequels. X-Men 1-3. The Bourne Trilogy (I'm guessing the books probably even do this but I haven't read them so I can't say for sure). The Matrix Trilogy. And probably countless others. It's a super popular formula to hook people on the trilogy."

I've got health anxiety. Before I would have said no. But once you think you're dying, you fear it. Normally it feels so distant, you know it'll happen but it'll happen years off and that might as well be never.

But when you think you're having a heart attack and you're not sure you'll be alive tomorrow you realize everything you haven't done, you want to do so much while also trying to stay alive. You want to tell your friends and family you love them and you want to find a way to leave an impact as quick as possible.

Well, at the moment I've staved it off and I'm loving my life and valuing it more than ever. But I do fear death and that's okay. You don't have to be fearless about it because it's an unknown. But you can grow to accept it'll happen and that it's a part of life and that your life wouldn't be as special without it.

They can do X-rays and actually figure out what’s going on. A crap chiro will say how much it’ll help, crack your back, and send you along.

9592,"Me too.

If PIV sex is the only thing that makes someone not a virgin, then I'd be a 35yo virgin with a joint bank account and regular orgasms with this woman living in my apartment. 

Generally, if another person is touching my swimsuit area, I'd call it sex.  

The preoccupation with penis-in-vagina being sex only is some kind of mindgame people use to preserve the idea of chastity/virginity/faithfulness while engaging in sex acts.  

I won't say that every sex act has to end in orgasm for it to ""count"" since people struggle with inorgasmia, and I wouldn't call them virgins either.  But my SO and I don't have that issue, so more than 90% or our sex ends in orgasms for both of us, that's pretty much my mental picture of sex. "

9594,"I mean age differences in general can be bad. I'm not entirely sure why. I think at least part of it is that you're supposed to date older people the older you are, and so to not do so implies there's something wrong with you. It's a very common story to see a high school girl get excited about dating a boy in college because, ooo, he's older, she must be special to have been chosen instead of a girl in college. But then no, it turns out the boy was just some kind of terrible abusive jerk who didn't date college girls because they had figured out the signs to not date someone like him.

There's also likely power imbalance kind of stuff which can result in abusive relationships. Though that's not too relevant here.

I'm thinking of what me and others I knew were like at 16, and for a 30 year old to want to have sex with that, definitely makes me think there would be something wrong with them. Oh, and the boy was drunk for probably about the first time, that's bad too.

9620,"haha yep, on more than one occasion my father (general surgeon) took my friend directly from a sleepover at our house to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. grew up in a small town so at least 50% of the time my father would be the only surgeon on call.

when I needed my appendix out I happened to be staying at the local anathesiologist's house for a play date with his son when I suddenly spiked a fever and was doubled over in pain. dude called up his buddy from med school, who had a practice 30 minutes or so up the highway and so had hospital privileges or whatever at our small-town hospital, and had him meet us at the hospital so that he could get me taken care of as quickly and with as much skill as he knew his son would have received with my father operating. 

dad was in emergency surgery at the time and and got the fucking heart dropping shock of his life when he scrubbed out after finishing and saw my mom and sister in the hospital waiting room. all my mom could get out was, ""freddy's appendix was looking bad, scott and Dr. blah blah have in OR 2,"" before my dad bolted and scrubbed in to presumably make the operation as stressful as possible for the out of town surgeon operating on his first born child.

I'm sure my father would have operated without hesitation had he not been in surgery but operating on close family members is not usually done for obvious reasons."
9621,"No worries. I had similar situations. I learned this few weeks ago. Apparently when I was a freshman in high school two super hot girls in my school liked me.

First girl was in my class but she would always want to do a project with me because she wants to get closer. She hinted that she wanted me so many times apparently. ex. sitting on my lap and pushing her fingers into my mouth

The second one is obviously a regret. I had a crush on her but I just thought we were friends. She would hold my hand, brush my lips, and kiss me sometimes. The entire time I thought we were just friends cuz some friends at my school do these types of stuff. When she was leaving for another state, she was crying she doesnt want to break up. I thought she had a BF........

Burger comes, only onions. I send it back.

Burger comes back again, only onions. The server seems honestly confused that I don't want onions on my burger. I ask them to take it away, someone with me starts to get in on it and insists they do it right, we send it back again.

Burger comes back, onions and peppers again. It was incredible. It was like they literally could not find a way in the back to keep onions off this burger. Now the whole table is just flabbergasted they are having such a hard time with this. So we send it back because now we're drinking beer and debating if they can even do it at all. Send it back...

1. See something that everybody sees (the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall, etc.).

2. See something no one else sees (not literally no one, just something that gets passed over by most; the path less taken, a goofy museum, the bad side of town, a small village, etc.).

3. Leave something for next time (even if you are almost positive you will never return, taking time to explore the places you visit is, in my opinion, better than rushing from one site to the next).

After several years of following these rules, one of my favorite spots I've visited that very few others have seen is Gavur Kale (Infidel's Castle) southwest of Ankara, Turkey.  You can find it in books but it's hard to find in real life because there are no signs for it, you just have to keep asking locals until you find one to point you in the right direction to the middle of a pasture outside of a tiny village.

One day, my friend and I decided to have a contest to see who can get a rock in the neighbor's chimney first. I go first, and my throw is way off line - right onto a plate glass window.

My friend and I frantically leap off the play structure and get to messing around with our bikes, but when my mom hauls open the back door a few minutes later I can tell she knows. That was the longest walk of my 6-year-old life."

9816,"Witnessed the walking dead.

My grandmother used to have an exact routine.  Every morning for years at the exact same time she would get up, make breakfast, go back to the bathroom and clean her dentures, then eat in the dining room. 

I happened to be awake, I see grandma go from her room to the kitchen.  I take a piss, she passes me on the way to the bathroom, nothing unusual.  Then there was a loud bang.  She was on the ground but totally blue.  No pulse, very cold.  I call 911.  Everyone loses their shit and I have to restrain my mother.  

Paramedics arrive.  They want to know why I waited hours to call them, because they want to put DOA at like 0330 instead of 0730.  I am like, ""no I just walked past her before she hit the ground.""  They take her, the do an autopsy.  

She's in her mid to late 80s, nothing unusual.  I go down to get the papers and the guy I talk to asks about the TOD.  I explain what I saw and he goes ""did she respond when you said good morning?""  I realized she didn't.  Why?  She was dead.  She had began the process of dying in her sleep from old age, actual your body says you are too old and we are actually hitting the kill switch old age.  That's rare.  But that process can get kinda interrupted.  It takes many hours for full body shutdown, and she woke up with a routine so on autopilot that her lizard brain could do it until the last bit of oxygen flowed through her system.

When I walked by her, she hadn't been in that body for hours.   Hard to think about.

But I loved the way she made grits, and I was starving so I ate her last breakfast.  She used to give me some when she didn't finish it. Happened while we waited on EMTs to clear out.  Everyone was so upset with me thinking about food, but I was totally at peace with it at the time.  No use in anything going to waste.  Seemed right.

It would just make victims even more wary to come out, since they already face the threat of stigma and further harassment. 

The whole situation is fucked and there's no winning. So I'm hesitant to fully agree with you unless there were *absolute certainty* that the false accuser was really falsely accessing.

Just creating a logical-enough reasoning for zombies doesn't mean it's not a poor design choice for a human type of enemy, which needs very little introduction and reasoning why you should fight them. Zombies are just there, you know you will have to defend against them and kill them without remorse, because they're not human anymore, but they are really boring, spammable placeholder enemies."

9914,I think it's more that everyone gets sick of doing work sometimes. I'm sure there were days that Beethoven hated writing music or Einstein got sick to death of studying and calculating. Its unrealistic to think you will enjoy every minute of your work life just like it's unrealistic to expect to be happy every day in a meaningful relationship. It's the human condition to get bored sometimes and it's the human condition to bitch about it too.

9916,"I would normally agree with you, because you're statistically much more likely to use a firearm if you have it (which could potentially be escalating), but the thing that makes me believe this man needs a firearm is the part where he notes his neighbor ""shot a deer"". If there's an unhinged schizophrenic living next to you armed, you need to be armed in case you have to defend yourself, *especially* now that he's the target of delusions. 

Honestly? Best advice here is to move. I know it may not be financially the best thing, but it's not worth the risk of staying in harm's way as he escalates. 

Other thing I'd do is start recording the guy. Get the restraining order (not sure exactly how it would work if he's directly next door) and then document him breaking it. It's sad, but the only way this guy is gonna get help is if he enters the CJ system. Not sure about whatever state this is, but in my state, law enforcement can enact something called Section 12 (it's actually MGL Part I, Title XVII, Chapter 123, section 12 to be specific) where a person is either a threat to themselves or others and is then involuntarily committed to a mental facility. That, however, is temporary. Getting him some help may do a world of good, but once he's out, who knows what happens? Like I said, it is probably best to try and catch him in the process of breaking laws to put him away for a while where he can get *some* access to treatment. It is probably best to move, however, considering the effort and risk. 

I'm guessing since his username is ""Cincymatt"" that he lives in Ohio. Involuntary commitment is covered under [Ohio Revised Code Title 51 Chapter 22 section 01](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/5122):

&gt; (2) Represents a substantial risk of physical harm to others as manifested by evidence of recent homicidal or other violent behavior, evidence of recent threats that place another in reasonable fear of violent behavior and serious physical harm, or other evidence of present dangerousness

9962,"Not sure what wikitravel recommends, but I would recommend visiting many of Bosnia's natural attractions. Northwest area around Una river is gorgeous with few charming towns (Bihac, Bosanska Krupa, Cazin...) and Una national park. There you can enjoy beautiful scenery, but if you're into adrenaline you can try rafting on wild Una.   https://youtu.be/GKvDox7xvMs. (Sorry for annoying accent in the video ;) ) From northwestern Bosnia you could go a bit further into the country, perhaps Jajce (or maybe Banja Luka; can't decide just want you to see them all haha) , a captivating city with beautiful old city and waterfall; I believe it's the only city with waterfall basically in it's centre.  https://youtu.be/tLOgCQkihq0     From Jajce perhaps make a stop in Travnik, a city famous for pristine Blue waters, beautiful ottoman architecture and ćevapi, probably a national dish    https://youtu.be/6xtDNKuG0-0    . From there you can head to the capital, Sarajevo (Maybe stop by in Visoko where locals claim a somewhat perfectly shaped hill is pyramid, so see for yourself). Sarajevo is a special city, a place where east colides with west. You can see traces of ottoman and austro-hungarian rule on beautiful architecture. Mountains around Sarajevo are perfect spot for skiing in the winter or simply taking a stroll during summer. Trebevic cable car offers easy transportation and great panoramic view of Sarajevo. It's late and I am tired of writing more so you have more info in the short promotional video or you can look up yourself for something with more details than this one as this one has only basics   https://youtu.be/JuzW1gtO5DQ . From Sarajevo you could go to Perućica, only jungle in Europe, but it isn't that accessible so it isn't for regular tourists. You could continue your journey by train to Mostar, heart of Herzegovina. I recommend journey by train due to cheaper price, better view of landscape, sleeping cabins if need be, bar, wifi etc.  https://youtu.be/5qWTht_mVUE  There you can see famous Old bridge, destroyed in previous war but rebuilt stone by stone.     https://youtu.be/0yDoZmhZpVI.  There is also gorgeous Buna spring near, and Hutovo Blato, a nature reserve which is home to many wild species. River Neretva, which goes through Mostar, alone is worth visiting. That would be some of the must see things here. I wanna mention one natural phenomenon as well, stone spheres that appear in my town. They are geological phenomenon where rocks appear as perfect spheres, origin unknown. The biggest one in the world is supposedly here, not that far from my home and was discovered recently yet I am too lazy to actually go and see it. I would also recommend visiting other former Yugoslav republics, like Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Macedonia etc as they all have a lot to offer.

""There is little point in attempting precisely to impute Japan's unconditional surrender to any one of the numerous causes which jointly and cumulatively were responsible for Japan's disaster. The time lapse between military impotence and political acceptance of the inevitable might have been shorter had the political structure of Japan permitted a more rapid and decisive determination of national policies. Nevertheless, it seems clear that, even without the atomic bombing attacks, air supremacy over Japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion.

Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."" — United States Strategic Bombing Survey Summary Report"

10122,"Lavoisier, though brilliant and hugely influential, made some moves that probably didn't seem like bad ideas at the time but didn't really work out for him in the long run.  

For one:

&gt; “In 1768 he bought a practicing share in a deeply despised institution called the Ferme Générale (or General Farm), which collected taxes and fees on behalf of the government. Although Lavoisier himself was by all accounts mild and fair-minded, **the company he worked for was neither**. For one thing, it did not tax the rich but only the poor, and then often arbitrarily.""

and then..

&gt; ""...in 1780 that Lavoisier made some dismissive remarks about a new theory of combustion that had been submitted to the academy by a hopeful young scientist. The theory was indeed wrong, but the scientist never forgave him. **His name was [Jean-Paul Marat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Marat)**.""

on top of that...

&gt; ""Not only was he a member of the hated Ferme Générale, but he had enthusiastically built the wall that enclosed Paris—**an edifice so loathed that it was the first thing attacked by the rebellious citizens**. Capitalizing on this, in 1791 Marat, now a leading voice in the National Assembly, denounced Lavoisier and suggested that it was well past time for his hanging.""

finally...

&gt; ""...as he and his wife were making tardy plans to slip away to Scotland, Lavoisier was arrested. In May he and thirty-one fellow farmers-general were brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal (in a courtroom presided over by a bust of Marat). Eight were granted acquittals, but Lavoisier and the others were taken directly to the Place de la Révolution (now the Place de la Concorde), site of the busiest of French guillotines. Lavoisier watched his father-in-law beheaded, then stepped up and accepted his fate.”

10154,"I used to work in Customer Service. My employer at the time was expanding into the US (this was a British company) and decided that they should shake up how they dealt with customers to a ‘US model’. So what did they do? They decided to haul all experienced staff into this new training where an extremely condescending trainer taught us the meaning of ‘promise’ and ‘good service’ as if we hadn’t been performing well before and as if because we were CS we were stupid. They also forbid us to say the standard ‘Welcome to (Business)’ and we had to come up with catch phrases such as ‘How can I make your day brighter?’ or ‘How can I help you shine like a star today?’. We also couldn’t say Sir/Madam and had to use the customers first names.

It was all incredibly cringey and everyone hated it - including our existing customers who were really confused about the change. You could hear the pause of wtf? after we had to give our greeting. About half to three quarters of the experienced staff quit within a month and they eventually quietly dropped the new model (except for the first name thing - that seems to have become standard now).

It wasn’t so much the changes but the way they introduced them - I just wish companies wouldn’t treat Customer Service as a bunch of idiots who need to be kept in line."

10169,"Lola Montez's ENTIRE LIFE. She was born as Eliza Gilbert in Ireland, was shipped off to boarding school in England, eloped at 16 and eventually separated from her husband and found herself in Spain. She learned very broken Spanish and attempted Spanish dancing, even though she was very bad at it. She even went so far as to change her name to Lola Montez the Spanish Dancer for her new stage identity.
She debuted in Paris to terrible reviews, but when she made her way to Munich she was spotted by Ludwig I of Bavaria who took a very lascivious interest in her. He took her in as his mistress, to everyone's dismay. And when I say everyone, I mean EVERYONE. Heads of state laughed at him, his people were angry because the country was going broke from him spending all their money on Lola, and his family thought he was a crazy old pervert for wanting her around. Ludwig even had a cast made of her foot that he could masturbate to when she wasn't with him because he had such a strong foot fetish. 
They thought they could do her in by uncovering her identity, which meant telling the king she wasn't Spanish but Irish, and that she was actually still married and had worked as a psuedo courtesan for some years before she met him, and probably still had other lovers than him. She spoke very little Spanish, but it was only slightly better than his, and she managed to spin all of their truths into more lies so that she could stay at court and leech off of Bavaria's wealth.
It all came to a head when Ludwig's son demanded he give up the throne or give up Lola. Ludwig was determined that what he and Lola had was true love, so he renounced his throne and received a stipend from his family for the rest of his life. This wasn't enough for Lola though, so she left him, pursuing other lovers.
Historians are iffy on the numbers, but with the YEARS that Lola was Ludwig's mistress, they estimate that she slept with him between 0 and 2 times. She was the ultimate con artist. "

Officially called the Nizari Ismailis, they were a fringe Islamic sect in northern Persia that had very famous assasins (just a small part in their awesomeness, the word assassin (at least in English) originates from legends of then told to the crusaders)    

The leader of this cult would ensure loyalty by proving to his followers that he had God on his side.  He occupied a castle that protected a beautiful orchard which he made his personal heaven.  The trees were well pruned, fruit was abundant, honycomb was cultivated and placed to look readily available without any bees; and the whole plave had girls, which had been trained their whole life just to be good sex slaves, wait on the visitors.   
The cult leader would drug up his followers during a religious ritual, bring them to his paradise, allow them some breuf enjoyment, drug them up again, and carry them away. When the followers woke up he would claim to have sent them to heaven, and convince them that following his fanatical sect would get them back to heaven again."

10196,"My favourite is the story of Alvin C. York and 328th Infantry, Company G.

In June 1917, York was drafted.  A conscientious objector, he attempted to claim exemption, writing on his draft card [""Don't want to fight.""](https://www.archives.gov/files/atlanta/wwi-draft/images/york-l.jpg)  His request was denied.

In October 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and under the command of Sergeant Early, Company G was assigned to take the Decauville railroad behind Hill 223.  Due to a misunderstanding with their map, they ended up wandering behind enemy lines - specifically, behind a machine gun nest.

When the Germans discovered their position, they ordered their own troops to lie down, turned the machine gun on the American company and opened fire.  Nine of the seventeen Americans were killed, including Sergeant Early, who took *seventeen* bullets before passing command of the unit to corporals Parsons and Cutting.

The new commanders ordered York to silence the machine gun.  He trudged directly throughb the enemy fire, eliminated the gunners and secured the position.

In the ensuing firefight, no more of the Americans died.  By the end of it though, 25 German soldiers had been killed and 132 more had surrendered to the now merely eight-strong Company G.

For his actions and despite the admirable contributions of the rest of his company, York was singled out as the greatest individual soldier of WWI.  He still objected to the war however, and he used his newfound fame to promote education.  In 1926, he founded York Agricultural Institute in Tennessee, still in operation today as a public high school.  When asked how he wanted to be remembered, he said that his efforts to better educate his state and his hometown were his proudest achievements."

Essentially reddit has an ""API"" (Application Programming Interface) that makes it easy to communicate to Reddit using any programming language of your choice, though ""PRAW"" (Python module) is used near universally. 

Using the API, you can do things like have a bot look for key words and respond with a certain answer (probably the most common), or in this case look for key words, search for other posts with those key words (For this post it might be ""History"" and ""Interesting stories"") and just copy-paste high level responses. Every bot has its specific code because it's designed for its specific purpose.

The communication through the bot is stated by a user as so: Reddit-&gt;Reddit API-&gt;PRAW-&gt;botmakers python script. I'm sure you'll get more in depth responses but I think this is a good summary without being too complicated.

So apparently when my great great possibly great grandmother was a young child around 5-7 her family allowed Jesse James into their house for a night.  Here's the story.  So during the late summer one afternoon a man strolled up on a horse. Her parents didn't know who it was so they asked what his business was and other questions. I guess he was a bit quiet and just asked if he could stay for a night or two. As long as he helped out around the house and didn't raise hell he was alright to stay. The first supper he was a bit more talkative but still didn't answer much. He claimed he was out here prepping to head west to homestead and was just passing through. Suppers done and they do a bit more talking til it's time for bed.  Breakfast comes bright and early and the stranger is sort of rushing through his food.  All of a sudden a deputy or a sheriff creeps through the door, notices the stranger and gets the hell out without him noticing.  Stranger is done with his meal and thanks everyone for being kind to him and allowing him to stay there. He heads out and is gone for some time when the deputy comes in nervous as hell.  The deputy asks ""Sir, do you know who was just in your home?"". Gx3 Grandfather doesn't know and neither does his wife.  ""Well that was Jesse James! You know? The famous bank robber!"" They were pretty amazed from the sounds of it.  Sadly he didn't tell them where he hid his gold and money.  I guess my greatx2 grandmother was pretty strict when it came to her kids telling the truth and herself always being honest too honest.  "

10221,"So as to clarify, the point of this terrible punishment was to make these men constant dependents upon their communities. Neither dead nor productive (for the blind could do little those days), these villages that received their men would be forced to take care of their life-long disabled veterans causing a negative economic impact. It was truly rather maliciously minded."
10222,"my grand dad fought in the civil war on the communist side. he died of old age, with four bullets in him and a piece of shrapnel in his heart. he and his family ran away to macedonia, where he died. rip granpa risto!"
10223,"Hiroshima and nagasaki are a little less black and white though. Depends if you believe a main land invasion by the US would have been nevcesart for surrender or not. I kinda think they were, and am pretty certain that there would have been a US invasion otherwise. Where there would have been an estimated 1+million US casualties and millions of japanese citizen deaths as opposed to the ~250k from little boy and fat man. However the russians were pushing there way fowards and were only a couple weeks from invading the main islands and would have forced a surrender on their terms almost certainly. We would have invaded in a bog way to get to set our terms in the surrender and not have the whole of japan be under soviet control post war.

I believe Using the bombs brought the surrender as soon as possible and most likely with the fewest number of japanese deaths possible. Keeping the russians off the island, giving the US its moral boost from finishing avenging pearl harbor were just bonus. Also cant forget the bonus of showing off our new tech to the soviets in an effort to hopefully keep them hesitant to continue through berlin and take over mainland Europe (which was a threat serious enough some US generals fought against demobilzing our troops there, seeing the soviet invasion as a certainty) is a huge bonus too.

I do believ we should feel some sort of remorse for choosing civilian targets and killong  200,000 civilains but i dont believe any apology can be sincere when we would (justifiably imho) do the same thing every time in that exact situation, let alone them deserve any apology. Did we recieve an apology for pearl harbor? Those may have been military targets but at least our atomic bombs were dropped while we had war declared, japan attacked while at peace and purposely delayed declaring war until hours after.



A couple other points: we did try to warn them by dropping leaflets on those cities. They were purposely vague though and as we had left those cities mostly untouched in the latter parts of the war to more accurately measure the impacts of the nukes the people of those cities may have had a false sense of security. Bomb sirens did go off that morning before the first bomb but an all clear was given as they were used to the hundreds if not thousands of planes for a bombing, like they were very familiar with during the firebombings of tokyo and other cities. Its no surprise they didnt feel any fear from the 3 lone bombers flying over that morning.

A lot of people argue ""why did we have to drop 2? Wasnt 1 bomb enough to show what we could do?"" Yes but no. there was about a week in between where they could have/should have surrendered but despite the evidence it was hard to believe the reality of a single bomb really causing all of that destruction, or believe that we could possibly have any more( and coincidentally we did only have 1 more. If for any reason we needed another as soon as possible it would have been months)

Also to be fair about my earlier point about russias imminent invasion of japan, im sure that was of some factor in their surrender but in the official statement they made to their people and the world they made it very clear the reason they were surrendering was the new horrible bombs that would inevitably flatten japan and kill every person there with few if any american deaths as collateral.


Sorry for my rambling its very late here, hopefully that info is interesting or new to someone. Unbelievably i left a lot out for some laughable since of brevity. Have lots more if anyone is curious about anything more specific."

One thing I'll give them credit for is never giving the killers a positive portrayal. Sometimes in the true-crime community you come across articles/documentaries/comments/etc. that make the killers out to be sympathetic, anti-hero like figures. Charles Manson was a great example of this, there are people who look at him like a mad-genius or a prophet. But LPOTL pretty much always makes the killers out to be demented losers who committed heinous atrocities, and are worth nothing but disgust and ridicule."

For the first few months you're barely even going to sleep let alone have the energy to hit the gym everyday.

Hear me out.

Know that I'm British, and I think that the declaration of independence, and creation of the Unites States was a very good thing to have happened.

But the war in question was a shitshow.

The story that's taught in American schools is that England taxed America, igniting the revolution.

But we never collected on those taxes. And when the colonists decided not to pay, we we're like, yeah fine.

France owned land. Colonists wanted it. Britain said you can't have it, because it's not ours to give to you.

But colonists took it anyway. The people who would be America went to war on England's behalf with France, forcing England into a crazy expensive situation they didn't even want to be a part of.

So Britain stated taxing tea. Only tea. The only tax they would impose to the colonists was for tea, to *pay for a small part of the fight they started*, which lead to the BTP.

Almost every other revolution in history was either to combat oppression or poverty, but here, it was neither. We weren't actually aware that there was any instability at all, because the representative of the colonies, Ben Franklin, kept telling England that everything was chill back home.

The war against France was completely out of nowhere for England.

I'm not saying the war should have ended differently, but.. kinda? 

Really, France just had their shit taken from them, but all that's remembered is an American-English dick measuring contest."

He got back right at an hour but still burned the ship bc why not. The victims split up going through the woods, some to what is now Africatown (only 6 houses and the saddest graveyard ever now) and others went south to bayou la batre. 

I'm sure if I was a little older when she told me I would have gone to find the ship myself, but she didnt know exactly where it was. 

The feeling in the house that day was somber. Her in home care was a black lady who I'd also been around my whole life and Ms Meaher looked at her while she said ""I'm ashamed to be related to this, but we have to keep history alive so we dont forget what we were part of"".

Management like to also tell us at preshift ""I've waited tables before. I can wait them again. You're all expendable."" Nice pep talk, yeh sure I'll upsell.

One Saturday, I was having a bad night but nothing I wouldn't make it through. When a guy who ""quit"" like 5 times a month, decided to ""quit"" at 7:00pm. On a SATURDAY I remind you. 

Manager says. ""You have to take his section."" 

I already had a full section that was getting ready to turn and while those meals were wrapping I didnt have the time to deal with this bullshit. 

So I told my last table that hadn't paid exactly what was up, asked if they could sign their bills because i absolutelyhad to quit. They were super cool ladies and were very F your managers girl. Here's a big tip. You go quit. 

Cashed out quietly and waited a few minutes cause I knew the host would triple seat the new section and watched as they also double sat the now 2 open tables in my original sections. 

Never even greeted the tables.

Simply took off my apron and damned bolo tie, handed it to my manager in the middle of the kitchen and said. ""I quit "" 

Jerk actually said ""You can't! You have 6 tables.""

I just said. ""Already did. Besides you've waited tables before, you can wait them again.""

And then people who idolize the people who idolize Scarface also idolize Scarface by extension, so everyone is willing to ignore that most of the movie is a really long soap opera with some action scenes.

He's looking right at me. He calls me things like sicko and pedophile and explains how he'd like to prescribe a 45 mm to the head as a cure. No matter how much I try to talk him down and explain I'm bored, he keeps going on.

Other people start to notice. The couple people who know me take my side and still he persists I am some pervert. At that point my step dad gets involved.

Everyone jokes about how Frodo and Sam are gay, when their relationship was meant to convey just a genuine male friendship that I feel like we don't see as much anymore. Like, a genuine brotherly love. Tolkien made that clear in his writings. 

It's telling that we can't see male affection without immediately thinking it's ""gay"". I also wonder why that changed so much, but I imagine it's because of how much modern society disparages homosexuals in general, that ""acting gay"" in even the slightest way is something to fear and avoid.

So for example, we would set up road blocks or just go round up every male over the age of 10 in a village and scan their finger prints and irises, take pictures of them. Get as much information on their name and who, where they are from. 

Swab hands and their cloths for explosives/gun shot residue. 

All that info would go back.

And say, if one village had a guy and his prints matched those found on some IED or Weapons found somewhere. We would go arrest them.

But say, its a known leader or a really bad guy. They might go send in those Spec Ops guys.



What also fun is sometimes we'd be out and get a radio call saying we got a Spooky on station. (AC-130 Gunship) And its not like hes there for our support, they'd only show up when those Spec Ops guy are out and about.

I had brought with me a small bulbasaur attached to a keychain. I was telling anyone who’d listen about my favorite Pokémon. 

At one point, I stopped to proudly tell Miss Anita all about him. About ten seconds into the conversation I mentioned that he evolves into Ivysaur which was the wrong thing to say. 

Miss Anita cuts me off and tells me that evolution isn’t real and thus Pokémon aren’t real etc. etc. 
Of course, I start bawling and shortly after we had to go through the hour long graduation. 

It still pisses me off how she burst my bubble. I was so so excited and in a moment I was crushed. I didn’t even know what evolution was at that point and didn’t understand why I was getting yelled at. 



Additional info: My sister and I went to Miss Anita for piano lessons for about 5 years and she was awful the whole time. You weren’t allowed to say any word derived from a cuss. So no dang, darn, that sucks, shoot, crap, etc. etc. 

Also, she used to yell at me for not practicing as much as my sister all the time. When in reality, I practiced multiple times a week while my sister never did. She just happened to be naturally gifted.

Furthermore, intersex people exist (people who for whatever reason we're born with a mix of traits typically thought of as exclusively male or female). 

Gender is an expression of self, and its something that is pushed upon you at birth. You're always assumed to be something based on what genitals you've got at birth. We use the terms ""assigned male at birth"" or ""assigned female at birth"" (AMAB and AFAB respectively) since its probably the most accurate to how things are. Later in life as we grow and begin to get out own perception of self, we can reevaluate whether these assigned genders are actually true. If you think your assigned gender fits for you, that's what we call cis or cisgender. If your AGAB does NOT fit, you are transgender, a different gender than was a assigned to you. 

So basically every body part on a woman is considered a woman's body part. Same goes for if they are a trans woman. You might consider some things more typically masculine, such as broader shoulders or facial hair, but if they're on you they're girl parts since you are a girl."

The taste is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical tasting most of it will go over a typical drinker’s head. There's also the depth of flavors which is deftly woven into the drinks - the philosophy draws heavily from Ancient Grecian drink theory, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these tastes, to realise that they're not just good tastes - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lacroix truly ARE idiots - I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lacroix’s genius unfolds itself on their tongues. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Lacroix tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

If you don’t know how to deal with something like that, she could have told the student sorry you feel that way and recommend them to get help and report it. She didn’t have to say the rest of that bullshit.

I usually wear heels/wedges, have my hair blown out, have my nails done, eyelash extensions etc. Never wear dresses though.

When I was 20 I had the opportunity to buy a QP for next to nothing out of the blue, I've got no connects, no down line, no way to get rid of it. 200 bucks I believe it was. Guy I bought it from was being evicted that day. It was quality too, extremely dank buds. Then something weird happened, my neighbor Roger (Sweet old guy that lived alone and liked working on bikes, I really liked him.) across the alley died the next day, no warning. Pancreatic cancer, and he didn't even know it. 
All of the sudden, his son the tweaker weirdo is over there whom I sold weed to a few times. He comes over to tell me his dad left no will and that (being the only relative alive) Tweaker boy Patrick got the house, the garage, all of it. All the while telling me how much he hated his dad. But he has to clean it to get it sold. He's in the garage flinging his dad's things everywhere as I sparked a j outside.
 I asked him about some motorcycle parts I had my eye on. I knew that garage well, I helped his dad Roger clean it out once, but it was a wreck when he died. I told Pat, hey man I'll clean out this garage spotless for you and give you this QP of dankness, but I get to keep anything in the garage. He agreed. Fervently. We even put it in writing but left out the part about the QP. 
Of the stuff I took out of that garage there was:
*A complete 1964 Vespa that was disassembled into boxes, that I put together and sold for about 5k, didn't even need to paint it. 
*Enough Kawasaki dirt bike parts that I made three kinda custom bikes all from mid 70's parts and sold em for 2500-3500 on craigslist.
* 2 complete vw engines from a 65 and 66 bug that he had covered on rolling dollies (kept those)
* 90% complete Porsche 356 engine also on a rolling dolly out of a '62. 
* TONS of antiques, ($2500 worth) good quality stuff that sold faster than everything else honestly. I kept the uranium glass tea set though, it has little mushrooms on it. 
That was just the big stuff. And yes I kept all the engines and have plans for all of them.

11098,"&gt; the only people I can see downvoting this are those who have spent considerable money on cam girls/strippers and have convinced themselves they're well adjusted, or cam girls who don't want to believe it


If you were downvoted by lots of people who spend considerable money on camgirls, wouldn't that just prove that most clients realize camgirls aren't their girlfriends? Well adjusted or not, I'm pretty sure it's possible to pay someone for sexual stimulation, and even conversation, without thinking that you're buying your way into a real relationship. Offering those services doesn't mean that camgirls are targeting the type of person who's desperate and psychotic enough to become a stalker.



Also, by making your claims in this context, you're implying that the OP encouraged her stalker, which is a massive assumption at best. That's one likely reason for your being downvoted."

If you have no more need for your claculator (done with your math classes), then you can get some free weed and then the dealer can get a big profit off the calculator. Sure, you could sell it yourself, but why go through the effort when you can just get weed instead?"

My aunt made it so that it was NEVER mentioned and they just went on living their life and had 3 kids. So my cousins think they have this perfect family when in fact they have a secret older brother that they don't know about. I'm not allowed to say anything to them though."

My reasons against it are simple: I hate the taste (why would you ruin perfectly good &lt;&lt;insert drink here&gt;&gt; with alcohol?), I'm not a ""party person"" who is into social events, and I drive pretty much everywhere. Yes, I know there's designated drivers and stuff, but I'd rather drive myself. Besides, I don't need alcohol to have a good time."
11110,"I think u/Bbernad11 and you have a point. 

As a woman, I find we talk much less about our sexual encounters if it's a committed relationship. All my best friends know about my boyfriend is that I like it. We tend to tell each other all the details about one night stand and casual relationships. The only time I can think of where we discussed anything in detail about a committed relationship was when one of my best friends started dating this really quiet guy and she told us he gave the best oral she'd ever received and after he admitted to being a virgin. Even then I don't really have any of the details of what happened, just those two facts."
11111,"Another tip. Buy groceries with your bank account too. If someone is actually looking into you they'll notice that you don't ever eat. Go ahead and throw your drug money on $1200 worth of Taco Bell, but go to the butcher and the grocery store with the debit card.

If everyone knows you're going to the amusement park withdraw like $100 cash and then use your drug money for fun inside the park. If you're being public you need to have your money show that you're being public. Don't do big fancy events outside your pay grade."

11124,"C average student here. 
I struggled academically from the start. 
My first grade teacher suggested I be put on Ritalin. My third grade teacher would get so angry with me that her face would turn red and her eyes would well up. 
I just could not get my assignments done. I have NEVER read a single book assigned to me in school. After a certain point, my parents stopped asking if my homework was done. 
I took algebra 3 times, and during my sophomore year, my english teacher asked me if I was okay because I looked tired all the time. Not sleepy tired. 
I did not meet benchmark on the ACT in both math and science. 
I was getting Ds in my art classes, despite being very talented. 
I barely graduated high school. 
I wanted to go to art school but I knew I trashed my academic career. 
On a whim and in the middle of a manic flux, I applied for cosmetology school. I worked 30 hours a week as a restaurant manager, and I went to school for 20 hours a week, for two years. 
I excelled in everything there. I was placed into the “honors” program faster than anyone else. 
I had perfect grades. I peer mentored and assisted in teaching classes toward the end of my time there. I found total happiness in that. 
I now work at a hip local salon, and my chair is one of 5. 
I never thought I would have a CAREER, a job I loved and could be proud of. I never thought I would get to contribute something useful to the people around me. 
I love how my mom’s face lights up, and she wears her hair down after I highlight it for her. 
I love making people feel good. I love making 50 year old moms look in the mirror and say “I feel pretty again”. I love the way a teenage girl radiates self confidence when I do her hair or makeup for prom. 
I take a little time every now and again to stop and appreciate how lucky I am to have this. Because I really never thought I would have anything to be proud of. 

EDIT: What Im saying is, trade school is where its at. Its in demand, it is less financially draining, and has so much more to offer than the bullshit assimilation training systems we have masquerading as schools and colleges. "

11128,"In 1739, on the other side of the world there was a guy named Nader Shah. Nader decided he wanted to conquer everything around him and set out to do it. The short story is that he was really fucking good at warfare. In the Battle of Karnal, Nader's army of 55,000 managed to defeat Mughal Empire's army which consisted of 300,000 soldiers. The Mughal Empire backed off after losing 20,000—30,000 men while Nader had only lost 1,100. In another amazing victory, Nader's army of 15,000 beat the Ottoman Empire's 80,000 soldiers. The Ottoman Empire's casualties were somewhere between 40,000—50,000 men and 32 cannons. Nader on the other hand has his casualties listed as negligible. He barely lost anyone and was able to defeat an arny far larger than his own. Dude was a genius. Later on in life, he conquered what he wanted to conquer but he grew to became a very cruel and disliked ruler which culminated in his assassination and the end of his dynasty."

The electors are bound to the popular vote, which is a restraint upon their natural role. If we had a single pool of electors much like early America, they would be more or less free to vote independently and presidents would have a greater chance of coming from other than the current two major parties."

Bastard becomes the most powerful man in Europe, wipes his ass with the glory of Nazi defeat, wrangles his comrades into absolute loyalty all in preparation for his crowning achievement: nightly frat parties with The Bois.

Like most dictators, Stalin held near-nightly dinner parties that were originally meant to be state affairs that quickly descended into the entropy of vodka chugging. However, his prowess in alcohol consumption was matched completely by his ruthlessness and political skill -- he outdrank everyone, bullied everyone into drinking until they passed out, and then played pranks on his drunk inner circle (ie forcing them to sit on ripe tomatoes, the og proto-whoopie cushion).

There's accounts of Krushchev &amp; co. finding the libations so painful that they call out. When Stalin gets pissy about that they continue attending but all group up in the bathroom to replace their vodka with water. Stalin finds out and characteristically threatens gulag if they continue. There is no choice but to continue drinking.

Expensive Louis Vuitton suits were ruined. People were pushed in pools. Pool guards were installed because someone finally remembered that pushing in inebriated members of the high government into water was a bad idea.

This all isn't as important as, say, those two wars that happened but I wish it were more common knowledge that Joe Stalin was a heavyweight drinker who asserted political dominance with vodka politics. The podcast Behind the Bastards goes into this a lot more in their 1st ever podcast episode!"

I ended up enjoying it, but the final was crazy. It was take home, open book, open note, and we had 24 hours to work on it - as in 24 working hours, not return this same time tomorrow. I don’t remember how many hours i used, but i was close to the limit before I called it “enough.”"
11251,She should have went and bought some macaroni and some string for a buck and made all kinds of jewelry and wore that shit every time she went around him. The next time he offers hesitantly accept. 
11252,Can you elaborate on this?
11253,"A few years ago, (~17 at the time) when I was interested in law enforcement, I started researching the less legal side of the dark web. I've always had an interest in crime, in a study sense, so it was an obvious new focus. I wasn't even going in depth, just rabbitholing on wikipedia and some news sites.

You'd think I was running the silk road, the way my mother reacted, when I started excitedly sharing my findings."
11254,In developed countries its definitely less common but there are parts of the world where people are actually starving. Malnutrition and food scarcity are definitely still things I see as an American. 
11255,"Exactly. If you're a real hustler you will do whatever to keep your fiends sick. Its not uncommon for dealers to go after fiends who get sober. I knew one dude who payed his tester to go into rehab and get him more clio. Another dude straight up went to NA meetings and sold drugs in the parking lot, hed have people shooting up in the truck and going back into the meeting.

I may have sold drugs but I was never really cut like that, I cared about my fiends as my fellow human. The only reason I could live with selling the shit was that I knew if they didn't buy from me they buy from someone else. but dont get it twisted, they're custos and nothing more."
11256,"Unlike these other commenters I have a deep, smooth voice, love to smoke, and if this helps any, I love To Kill A Mockingbird and still have 2 copies that I stole from my school. Only caveat; am have vageena, so I can't quite do Morgan Freeman.

Let's make this happen."
11257,"The thing about ending prohibition is that you don't just stop arresting people for the sale and consumption of drugs, you convert the manpower and resources used to enforce prohibition into prevention and treatment. 

You give people that want to quit therapy without stigma, and you give people that want to continue using save access to drugs that aren't cut with additives or sold to you by a shady guy. "
11258,"It's not laughable. I'm kind of over the redundancy of this conversation, to be honest. I have male friends in older-woman-paying sugar momma relationships. I have Instagram famous male coworkers who are wined and dined by cougars for sex. I don't know why it's so crazy to think about. Plenty of older wealthy women want to pay for sex or companionship with hot young men they couldn't get otherwise.

These aren't average run of the mill men that no one would pay to have sex with.

The men I am talking about are 20-something year old old ab-ripped studs who makes $20,000 per post and has screaming girls fawning over them. They're going to want to be with a beautiful 20 year old girl. He's not going to fuck some old 50-60 year old woman, or even an average 30-40 year old woman, when he's literally attractive enough to get *any girl his age.* You do understand that male escorts and strippers are a hot commodity, right?"
11259,Not speeding
11260,"It's my understanding that it's not specifically about rape. It's about not having to negotiate your limits ahead of time because your partner is free to assume everything is acceptable. Could be relatively benign stuff like spanking, hair pulling, tickling, name calling, et cetera. But it could also include rape if you specifically agree to ignore ""no"" and ""stop"" but have another safeword that will be respected.

Rape fantasy is different in the same way that a square is a specific kind of rectangle. They're both quadrilaterals, but there's a reason why we have two words for them."
11261,"I was just getting 20$ worth. I was like 16 man. Broke af. One of them, ""Lemme get 20 dollars worth of weed"" kind of things.
This was like 2003 or some shit. "
11262,"Back in '98 I had summer school, which meant taking a bus for an hour from my tiny town to the city.

The math teacher tried to buy speed off of one of the kids in my class.  We didn't do any math after that and everyone got a grade in the upper 80s.  Just watched movies every day for 2 hours."
11263,"Most girls will not say a word. They will choose a non-female name or icon, and will just play. If everyone thinks everyone's a guy, no one starts anything. But most multiplayer games require voice communication to enjoy the experience, and if you're a girl, then you're in trouble.

I haven't watched ""ready player One"" but from what I understand theres (spoilers for Ready Player One ahead, about female interaction online)  a &gt;!big black orc dude (as an online avatar) with an oddly deep voice, basically macho macho. They turn out to be a girl with a voice changer who's been hiding this the whole time, even from their ""best friend"" the main protagonist. This is literally what happens online.!&lt;"

11267,"Did you watch the video? She was told that literally ANY signal to stop and they'd stop. Then she continues to film without once giving a single signal of ANY kind that she wanted to stop. This was clearly designated as a rough sex film. She was told exactly what individual activities would be done and those are exactly what they did. She was gagging and making choking noises, but again, that was the intention of the film. All she had to do was say ""stop"", or ""hold on"" , or ""I need a moment"", or literally ANYTHING.

Consent was enthusiastically given. If she was no longer consenting (and that is 100% okay) she has to give some kind of communication. Consent or lack of cannot be psychically transmitted. "
11268,"A local, much larger direct competitor laid off a large number of fairly well trained folks. Our company took the opportunity to expand a bit and try to snag a few of the good ones.

Poor guy worked at this other company for less than 2 quarters after he finished his undergrad, but talked himself up like he was the greatest employee of all time. Other candidates already had him beat, but he made it even easier. In the lunch “are you normal” interview, we mentioned a nearby art museum was fun and he said he didn’t understand art. He said, “Mannequins bent over backwards with a cigarette in their butt type of stuff I just don’t get.” Odd imagery to bring up in an interview...especially since there was definitely not an exhibit like this at the museum. "
11269,Someone who isnt me.  Usually used toungue in cheek or to avoid opennly confessing to crimes.
11270,That tells me more about their raging coke problem than it does their sexual preferences to be honest. Hard core drug addictions make people do lots of shit they regret. It's one reason why so many of them have to hit rock bottom before they consider rehab. A person with a bad drug problem is willing to break the law by robbing people and even burglarizing property. Not surprising then that some would stoop low enough to offer up sexual favours for it. A lot of prostitutes sell their bodies to pay for their drug addictions. They're willing to do horrible stuff to themselves if it means they get their fix. 
11271,"Yeah we’re actually beyond that now. TI-84s are the older model, the kids nowadays rock the T-800 Cyberdyne SM 101s."
11272,"Entrapment is when the Authorities convince you to do something than arrest you for what you did. Like, if a cop told you you have immunity from holding drugs because of some new operation they're running then arrest you for possession. Or, if they threatened they'll arrest and/or kidnap a family member unless you destroy evidence. Or, if they do an undercover sting in a high school and introduce a autistic kid to drug trafficking when he knows now one else that does it and then arrest him. 

By the way, all shit that has happened in the past 10 years. "
11273,"Japanese and Germans used meth. Japan was the first nation to synthesize it.

America used Dexedrine, which is the purest, best amphetamine.

Both are colloquially known as speed."
11274,"and what if they couldn’t? what if they were a student full time and needed something easy? it’s not like he was selling meth lmao it’s weed so i think you need to calm down and let people live
plus if you’re that worried about “fucking up over peoples lives” then attack the people buying because they’re making a conscious effort to purchase said drugs"
11275,"But the problem is that we are way too forgiving and permissive to these guys. Its even in your comment, ""he never crossed the line enough to warrant a straight block""

That's a common refrain in stories of abuse and harassment. Oh he hasn't done anything bad enough, just ignore it. But of course you can't really ignore it. The only answer is to fight these guys with everything we've got."
11276,Tourism is a subject in geography. 
11277,"I never expected help. I am just saying you are wrong, starving homeless exist. I worked my ass off to no longer be homeless and stop starving. 

It isn't wrong to ask for help, it just isn't always as easy as you make it out to be. Could you honestly stand on a street corner begging for coins while everyone around you looks on in disgust? As if you're lesser than the spider they squished in the kitchen that morning?"

11283,"I realy enjoyed your post, thanks!

What would you say was the best deal for you? Besides you dog ofc.

Did you get out of it without jail time and all your limbs?"
11284,That was actually surprisingly interesting. Do you have any more shoe store facts?
11285,I really want to read a couple of paragraphs where you elaborate on this
11286,"No, it really, really would. Everything you described is a basis for a huge sexual harassment lawsuit. Like, a fucking insane one. Having their employees perform sexually on camera, doing it in an area where other employees can see, and allowing any employee unrestricted access to the pornographic content then produce... That's a multi-million dollar case right there. I highly, highly, highly doubt that an ISP would risk their brand identity for the paltry money (In comparison) that running a camgirl ring would bring."
11287,/r/evenwithcontext
11288,"I teach this as a subject to students, and I avoid emotional words, as major and minor chords can sound happy or sad both, depending on the context they're being used in.

Chords don't sound happy or sad, or preppy or down or whatever. These are just words we use to describe the feeling of the major or minor quality (like how there isn't really vanilla in wine, it's just a metaphor for a sense of smell there is no established vocabulary for).

I usually go for ""bright"" and ""dark"". Those are less loaded."
11289,"Kink.com is one of the few sites I've paid for, precisely because of this."
11290,I worked in a restaurant for 5 years and I have to say (in MD at least) that minority races ALWAYS tipped very poorly. This happened to everyone I worked with as well. We worked in a more upscale (not super fancy but nice) where people generally tipped over 20% and minority races were always (literally) under 15%. 
11291,Man... my birthday was lame.
11292,"Why confine your statement to Abrahmic religions? As far as I have seen, almost all world religions have more or less the same set of ""don't be a dickhead"" moral values."

11294,"You realize that the sacrament of marriage and civil marriage are different things, right? It clearly *is* possible for a same-sex civil marriage to be valid. Do you think that civil marriage should be treated the same as a Catholic sacrament? If so, why? "
11295,"Yeah, plus the c-pillars in modern cars are so huge that in a lot of vehicles if something isn't directly behind you, you won't see it by turning around. 

Plus bigger cars tend to be tall. I took my driving test in my grandma's minivan and I had to use the mirrors, because the cones were actually below the sightline from the windows."
11296,not that kinda deep voice lmao!
11297,"Live near Yellowstone, so I visit multiple times a year.  I see so many idiots. Tourists who just stop in the middle of the highway to take pictures. Despite the 1,000 ""DO NOT APPROACH WILDLIFE"" signs, tourists get as close as they can to the dangerous wildlife (bison, bears, elk) to take a selfie. Many people are gored by the bison, kicked by elk, or injured in other dumb ways every season. They leave the boardwalks despite the multiple warnings that they are walking on geothermal ground that is extremely hot and unstable. A guy fell in and was dissolved in an acidic hotpot last year.

Here's some links. Its hard to feel sympathy for these people. It pisses me off because I will assume that eventually the park may get shut down because idiots don't know how to use their brains and follow the rules.

11330,"This is awful. The desensitization part, and the rape part are parts of the reason I quit watching porn altogether. I developed a weird and confusing rage-anxiety with porn, and now I can’t watch even sex or nudity on tv/movies with my SO without getting anxiety attacks and unknown anger. It’s this overall deep-seated rage and I know some of it came from back when my so and I started watching some porn together, there’s always such a focus on women (makes sense) and in some scenes the rapey situations looked like legit rape and I learned that some were and there’s no telling which is which. Some dark web shit I want no part of. There’s always been this focus on women in a violent way and I guess I’ve still not truly dealt with it cause I’m shaking right now. 

I’m so sorry to all those victims. It is so depressing and powerless to be unable to do anything to help such a large international issue. "

If it was someone who I knew could handle going hard from time to time I'd just be watching closer. If it was someone who was still testing the waters maybe, but if you cut someone off they just find another connect. If you want to keep someone in check all you can really do is slow play them and when they finally get upset that you don't respond as quickly as you used to, that's when you break out with a heart to heart and hope you break through. 

Literally every person I dealt with would have had to be treated differently in order to actually reign them in. I delayed a bunch, missed many more and saved 1, myself. Opiates are a bitch. "

11415,"Almost all of my saves have been in the line of duty as an EMT, however there was one...

Guy fell out of the dormer window on the top floor of my barracks in Germany, right past my window. Heard a ""thump, thump, thump"" of something rolling on the roof, a pause with a shadow passing my second floor window, and then what sounded like a sack of potatoes hitting the ground. I dropped whatever I was doing and looked out the window to see the guy on the ground. Without hesitation, I started yelling as I ran to him: ""CALL AN AMBULANCE! CALL AN AMBULANCE"" got enough of the guys in the barracks to at least come look to get some help rolling, shortly followed by the gate guards from across the parking lot. When I arrived I found him supine (on his back) with arms cockeyed and his chin tucked into his chest with agonal respirations (basically, he wasn't breathing because of his head position). I ran through my ABC's as on of my platoon mates came running up saying ""Don't touch him! He could have broken his neck!"" 

""I'm an EMT. Trust me. I have to do this"" I said as I took C-Spine and opened his airway. Thinking through next steps, I told him ""My keys are in my right pocket. In the trunk of my car over there is my EMT Jump Kit. Get it and get right back here.""

About this point a Squad Leader from a different company came running up and was starting to yell at me for touching someone with a possible broken neck. ""I'm an EMT"" repeat play. I don't remember who I passed C-Spine off to, but I said to them ""You see how I'm holding his head, and his jaw, just like this? I need you to take over doing this. DO NOT LET HIS HEAD MOVE. YOU HAVE HIS LIFE IN YOUR HANDS"" we exchanged positions, and I was able to resume the rest of my assessment. By the time the Ambulance had arrived I had completed a baseline assessment and performed some key interventions - most critical being the calling for the ambulance and opening his airway.

He had shattered his wrist in the fall, several cracked ribs, and a stable pelvis fracture. Fortunately, he had no serious spinal issues. Best guess is he broke his fall with his hands and rolled into the landing.

Therefore it is that with loving pride we drape the colors in tribute of respect to this citizen of your great republic. And here and now, in the presence of the illustrious dead, we pledge our hearts and our honor in carrying this war to a successful issue. Lafayette, we are here."""

11483,"There were multiple relatively small fires over the course of about a day or two, but the worse was definitely in Attica a couple of days ago. A forest fire started at the side of a mountain and wasn't deemed very dangerous, although the greek firefighting and special forces were still present and doing the best they could. After a couple of hours the wind picked up and the fire instantly took monstrous proportions. Its speed was so great it sweeped over the remaining forest land and over Mati, a region of Attica with about 3500 inhabitants in less than an hour. There is nothing that anyone could have done to prevent this. On top of that, Mati was built without respecting laws and rules set by the government, and without the government's permission, so there were no exits other than the ones at the top which were the first to get burned, dead ends, and there weren't many pathways to the beach, mostly big sudden cliffs, so the people running away got stuck and were engulfed by the fire. Most notably, a big group of 24 people were found at the edge of a cliff all burned together because the couldn't find the stairs that led to the beach. A workmate of my mother's lost her whole family: her son and husband were found burned alive, the husband with the child in his hands, and witnesses said they saw a little girl jump off the cliff as the fire came which turned out to be her daughter. 

So far there have been over 80 deaths and hundreds of missing cases, which are probably also dead. This is truly a national tragedy which we will definetely remember."

11485,"Sure, but there was a marked difference in the number of civilian killings between the two sides, both in terms of numbers and context, that cannot be entirely explained by the Nationalists ending up in control of the whole of Spain.

Republican killings were concentrated at the start of thr war, when the Nationalists attempted a coup, and then later when the Soviet-backed communists tried to gain control of the Republican Government and destroy the CNT-FAI. By contrast the Nationalists were rounding up and executing huge numbers of people throughout and after the war, from liberals to anarchists. Anthony Beevor gives a thorough and balanced breakdown of these killings on both sides in one of the chapters in The Battle for Spain."

Thinking of the Nazis, or indeed any historical or current enemy of one's own nation as being ""evil"" is intellectually lazy and runs the risk of falling into the trap of thinking that one's own country is, by extension, just and good and pure. The citizens of Nazi Germany thought they were just and good and pure as well.

Dismissing the horrors of Nazi Germany as being the actions of monsters is reductionist and does not sufficiently prepare one to see it when one's own country starts down a similar path.

And if anybody thinks that they would, in Nazi Germany, have been one of those people who spoke out against the regime, printing pamphlets for the White Rose and so forth; please consider this before responding; does your nation currently imprison refugee/immigrant children? How's that pamphlet drive going?

A gap, by itself, means nothing.  But the frequently quoted "".78 for every dollar"" statistic does not exist in a vacuum.  /u/SpareUmbrella quoted a bunch of factors, and there's even more on top of that (field of work, hazard pay, overtime hours, negotiation process, etc.)  If someone got paid less for equal work, equal qualifications, equal results, and not factoring in negotiation, then that would be unfair.  The quoted statistic implies that, by nature of there being a pay gap, that there is inherently a gender bias.

11724,"Unfortunately this can impact the 'direct' price too. A company sells it's products at higher prices so vendors with their own commission markup don't get shafted. 

Example: $7,000 price for product, but vendor wants 30% so you agree and raise price for direct sales and vendor sales to $10,000 so they get their cut and you still make your 7k through vendors. Now as a consumer you're paying extra just because that's how business works. That can be how a $100 products becomes $400 on the market.
Bonus: Now the company and vendor can have ""discount sales"" and still walk away with moneybags.

We can write whatever want as long as it’s a full page - she mentions she only reads one page at random at the end of the semester as long as we have the minimum # of pages. 

The teacher had told me before that she thought I was sneaky bc I am often quiet so one week I wrote a story pretending that I am in Fight Club and explained the premise and all the rules (I literally said the first rule of fight club... etc all that good stuff).  Finished the story and forgot about it. 

Fast forward a few months and I get called into the principals office. It’s him and that teacher and she’s holding my journal.  She tells me that she read my entry about fight club “randomly” and that my parents have been notified and I will be getting suspended. I have to explain that this is the premise to a very popular movie and book and that it’s all made up.  I figured an English teacher would get the joke but apparently not.

Now, I have *never* found a solid source to say that this was even slightly true, but given that this man knew the difference between the taste of old and new bone marrow, I can only assume that he tried it himself at some point.

edit: I had an idea for a Sci-Fi apocalypse scenario that was more realistic  that the old fashioned Terminator one, in it a big corporation sells a sort of AI product to customers and as they make it better and better they are unable to actually understand how it works and eventually it becomes so good at what it does that society can't live without it, then the fire nation attacks.

It makes advertisements and control of you generally more simple than if our crew was to do something as ridiculous as a dome from an archaic movie. You can't rationalize your feeling of being watched as easily. You can't just think to yourself, ""Well, I've been to other places in the world. I've traveled. No stupid television tv show could do that."" Thing is, we can. You could travel to Mars, Supernova 548, or anything that seems out of your reach and never be the wiser. You may want to, but you weren't chosen for that mission, for that quest, for that life. You were chosen for life in the late 90s, early 2000s. Also, don't think that your life is too boring. At least a part of it is not and that's what we need. Our show doesn't need to inconvenience everyone either by having a 24 hour show. We just dull down each week to keep it to an hour.

In North Carolina, how this works, is they only let you pay the tax once you've been charged, sometimes. If your lawyer is smart enough, he can use it as part of a plea. Defendant agrees to plead guilty and pay the tax, prosecutor agrees to drop the charge to a misdemeanor and put you on probation for 6 months. Ya know, instead of a felony and jail time. It's essentially a little extra cash boost for the state on drug charges they don't care about.

IIRC there was a reel where the talent randomly would bang in front of the not directly on set people to weird them out. Gianna Michaels has been in a few bloopers, like the time she made a guy premature ejaculate because he'd been talking shit just before about he had perfect orgasm control.

Well, in 1547 upon the King’s death, his coffin was said to have been brought to the chapel on a very bumpy road. That road was said to have possibly harmed the integrity of his coffin and so in the middle of the night, his bodily contents started leaking out and dogs were found licking his blood."

12168,"I don't recall any incidents of mass rape by western Allies, I believe unit discipline was simply stricter, some soviet officers did try to impose discipline, usually by shooting whomever was highest rank in the rape-line (the literal line of people standing by for their *turn*), but most soviet officers didn't stop it, or even joined in.

I can't remember where I read it, but I read somewhere that high ups in Soviet government came to think of it as one of the worst mistakes made during the war, because it ensured that victim countries (Poland, East Germany) would always resent Soviet occupation, whereas the Allies were embraced in West Germany."

12192,"I love the story Doris Kearns Goodwin told in Team of Rivals: “One of Lincoln’s favorite anecdotes sprang from the early days just after the Revolution. Shortly after the peace was signed, the story began, the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen “had occasion to visit England,” where he was subjected to considerable teasing banter. The British would make “fun of the Americans and General Washington in particular and one day they got a picture of General Washington” and displayed it prominently in the outhouse so Mr. Allen could not miss it. When he made no mention of it, they finally asked him if he had seen the Washington picture. Mr. Allen said, “he thought that it was a very appropriate [place] for an Englishman to Keep it. Why they asked, for said Mr. Allen there is Nothing that Will Make an Englishman Shit So quick as the Sight of Genl Washington.” “"

12203,"The Soviets didn't want to prop up any element of Polish sovereignty that wasn't aligned with communist ideology. The Soviets had no intent of actually allowing democratic elements to take hold in Poland, their intent was always to establish a communist regime, so they decided to not help the Polish uprising.

The Soviets and Nazi's both committed horrible atrocities on the Polish people, however the Nazi's intended to purge the Polish population in order for ethnic Germans to occupy the land, the Soviets generally eliminated all political opposition to their occupation when it was clear the Nazi's would be finished.

In the end, Nazi ideology called for the extermination of Eastern European peoples and specifically Slavs, the Soviets on the other hand intended to politically subjugate these states but not outright ethnic elimination. If the Nazi's had been allowed to persist the damage they would have wrought on the people of Eastern Europe would be almost unimaginable. Most of Eastern Europe would be depopulated of Slavs over time through various means including concentration camps and mass starvation. "

12222,"Yes and no. Accurate information about drug toxicity and harmfulness are very hard to cone by, because a lot of ""common sense"" drug knowledge is propaganda, or when people talk about how bad something they're discussing different things, or considering different doses. 

Cocaine is one of those substances where if you take it, and you have certain heart conditions, you can just die very quickly. But if you don't have a heart condition it's very hard to overdose, and it's not terribly damaging, as recreational levels of coke are non neurotoxic, meaning it doesn't damage your brain. Methamphetamine is fairly neurotoxic at 10mg, within the range of recreational doses, while Adderall (amphetamine) is non neurotoxic, even at very uncomfortably high doses that may give someone heart palpitations. 

The real dangers with coke are with heart damage with excessive chronic use, and this can happen with addicts. Coke is pretty addictive because it is very fun to use, and wears off quickly, but the high can be maintained for a pretty long time by redosing every hour or two, which can lead people to use very large amounts over the course of a night. Cocaine makes you feel generally happy and energetic, and actually can help people with creativity or social interaction (also can let you talk much faster than normal, but in a gun way). Id say the psychological addiction is more of the risk factor than the actual physical addiction though, because it's a lot easier to put down or maintain a light usage habit with cocaine than nicotine (of course this varies person to person). People usually develop coke problems when they use it for work, or some purpose in addition to recreation that causes them to use daily.

Hope this was helpful, though it's more general information, and I wouldn't want anyone to cone away from this and think ""cocaine isn't bad for you,"" because it is, it's just not really much worse for you than an eating disorder, which is also very bad for you. A better comparison would be cigarettes, except cocaine doesn't cause cancer, so it really only has the heart health and addiction problems of tobacco use. Definitely a good few levels below opiates, and meth for sure."

I found a funny little thing that the emperor julian wrote. He writes about all the Roman emperors meeting the gods. Julius caesar is ready to take down Zeus as soon as he walks in. They toss caligula into a bottomless pit add son as he walks in. Tiberius is a humorless military man. Here's what he says about augustus.

&gt;While Silenus, to whom the gods paid very little attention, was jesting thus, Octavianus entered, changing colour continually, like a chameleon, turning now pale now red; one moment his expression was gloomy, sombre, and overcast, the next he unbent and showed all the charms of Aphrodite and the Graces. Moreover in the glances of his eyes he was fain to resemble mighty Helios, for he preferred that none who approached should be able to meet his gaze.
""Good Heavens!"" exclaimed Silenus, ""what a changeable monster is this! What mischief will he do us?""

'Greensleeves' and 'greenskirts' are slang terms from that period in reference to prostitutes; one's knees or elbows would turn green after lying back and rubbing into grass. The song 'Greensleeves' is about a man who falls in love with a prostitute, he keeps doing things and buying things for her, but she's spurning him and he wants to know why.

I enjoy pondering this fact during weddings whenever this song is played. 😆"

Before graduation, I went to the city library and a librarian helped me find the source.

As a punk kid, I was so excited to throw this masterpiece back in the teachers face and bask in the warm glow of vindication.

I don't know anything about the more advanced courses (I've heard that the managerial stuff is pretty hard), I just took financial accounting for fun, but even that low level class was one of the biggest weed outs at my university and I think most people made it way harder for themselves than it needed to be"

She would also try to run and hated small areas. We ended up adopting her and she has become a loving addition to the family.

&gt; Also I'm going to edit this to add, finkle isn't even a good representation of a transperson. Iirc, she changes her sex for revenge. That plays into a toxic idea (deceit) about transpeople that isn't true.

Who says the movie was trying to be a good representation of a trans? Was it trying to be a good representation of Pet Detectives and Police Officers? It's a fucking comedy."

Yes, there was. People were sterilized and eventually herded into camps just because they were Slav. Thankfully the war ended before the genocide could begin in earnest for them as well.

So were some Jews, especially in the 1930's. There were even people with Jewish ancestry in the fucking SS.

Porfirio Diaz was making good things happen in Mexico, progressing it very far, and attempting to bring it forward. By no means am I saying that it was perfect under him, as there were a lot of shitty conditions for workers at almost slave levels, but Mexico was improving greatly. 

With that war, which we heavily romanticize, Mexicos progress was interrupted, it went okay for a bit but very shortly you arrive at the shit we have now.

Don't get me wrong, there are some terrible, lazy servers out there who don't deserve a free hand out because they are waiting tables. But more often than not, you will probably notice that they may have 7 to 8 tables that they are trying to take care of at one time or they are having to host/manage while they are trying to take care of you because they are understaffed. In fact, when I was serving, I encountered times when I had to go make my own appetizers/deserts because they were understaffed in the kitchen. But nothing makes me more frustrated with a server if my drink is empty and I see them off to the side texting or chatting up the host. Delayed service is unacceptable. But just know who to complain about before you do so. If you do have to complain, tell the server to get the manager, but make sure that they know it isn't about them. Tell the manager that you noticed how understaffed their restaurant is and how the service has been delayed because your server is taking care of 6+ tables at a time. More often than not, I will actually tip a server more when I notice how hard he/she is working because most of the other tables are eating with blinders on and aren't tipping them like they should.

12707,"I am a 24 year old female. I have several attractive female friends/acquaintances that didn't go to college, but are living relatively lavish lifestyles due to the fact that they're now married or soon to be married to an up-and-coming lawyer, doctor, engineer, etc. However, I've noticed a pattern where a lot of these females don't have a very serious career themselves. They often rely predominately on their SO for financial support. They're the type of girls who go straight from living under their father's roof to their husband's roof. 

Now, I finished my degree last year, and am trying really hard to build my career and am slowly (but surely) gaining momentum in my career field  &amp; settling into what I ultimately want to do with my life. My fiance got out of the military last year. He is going back to school starting next year, but you would not BELIEVE the amount of people who have given me shit for being engaged to a guy without a college degree. Some of the same females who don't have a degree themselves have the audacity to give my fiance a hard time because he's a manager at Starbucks right now while he gets his civilian career figured out.

It's super annoying because I don't see the guys who date these airhead women get the same type of crap from people, but my fiance is looked down upon (and sometimes I am too) because he doesn't have as many on-paper credentials as those with college degrees. The fact that he spent those prime years that most people get their degree in the navy doesn't seem to matter. 

I am not trying to shame these women, at the end of the day, to each their own. I just don't like the hypocrisy. Also, Starbuck's health insurance plan is actually 10x better than the VA's, so who's winning in the end.  "

Went over to her house and tried to teach her what i could so she could pass.

after she passed a few tests without any kind of cheating when i came over to her house she said she had some way to repay me for helping her, she said she would be right back, left the living room and a few minutes later she called out for me to help her.

She was back in her cheerleading uniform with no underwear, laying on the bed...my jaw was still on the floor.

ill never forget her words. ""To show you how much it meant to me, for your help, im going to let you fuck me and you can put your dick anywhere you want""

He told me it was part of my job description. (That was true. Cleaning the bathrooms was included in my job description, as it was with most of the employees.) I told him he needed to do what ever he felt necessary, but I wasn't cleaning that up.

I ended up staying there for another few months then quitting. Every time I thought of him having the gall to try to demand that I clean a mess of that magnitude of that up, I got more dissatisfied working there."

Ross's lesbian ex and Chandler's gay father (who is portrayed better in later seasons) also send a message which I think, if anything, would alienate homophobes more than homosexuals"

She called my mom and offered to pay for the trip, my mom respectfully declined and told her that she probably just misunderstood me and it was my fault (I mean it was) because I was bad at communicating. Didn't say anything to me the next about it either, just sort of knew that I was an idiot.

Let's call him ""J"". We had a great family party during the day but during the evening, all the proper adults  stuck around  while my cousins and I (aged 17 - 24 at the time) took off and most of us attended a mutual friend's party. I invited J along with us. His stepmom was so appreciative that I took him with me and said that he doesn't go to parties, please watch out for him and take care of him, etc. A little coddley, but in a sweet way. I bought him some beer and off we all went with the promise of me watching him.

 Well of course he gets shitfaced and throws up everywhere. And all I could think was ""oh shit, I am in so much trouble"". We dropped him back off with his parents afterwards and went home. I was mortified to face them in the morning. However, when I saw his parents they were beaming! ""J had such a great time last night thanks for taking him under your wing!"" Phew. Dodged a bullet there - he obviously didn't tell them what happened.

Because the distance between contact points matter this means that humans are less likely to be killed by the voltage step effect than a quadruped animal where the distance between feet on the ground is greater, and there are more vital organs in the electrical path through the body going from foot to foot.

When the teacher calmly asked whose phone it was and he answered and she confirmed it with some other classmates, she nonchalantly took a HUGE mathbook and hit him with it on the head with a force of a thousand parallelograms. He wanted to object, but she told him to shut his mouth and went out, only to bring a security guard of the school to get him out of class and threw his backpack and all other stuff into the hall.

Best teacher I ever had, she was actually teacher of the year quite often and always raised our schools total math exam scores.

A young woman told her during one class that she had a family member in the hospital and if they took a turn she'd have to leave. Professor agreed to let her go if it happened, but when the woman got the message to come to the hospital and she started sobbing and packing up, the teacher asked her where she thought she was going. She told the teacher that she'd gotten a message saying to go to the hospital, and the teacher told her that she *could* go but that she would be marked absent for the day and that it would affect her grade. The young woman left anyway. I realised that she'd left her textbook behind and asked if the prof would hold onto it and she refused because it was this woman's fault she'd left it behind and that she deserved to lose it. 

Same Prof also went on a half hour long rant about how she couldn't ride her horse into town anymore because there were no hitching posts, and told us that she fed her kids horse feed when they were little because it was cheaper than buying human food. (TBF it was just oats but like... Still fed the kids horse food.) She was also convinced that France was the greatest country in the world despite being from Cincinnati, and any time someone criticized France she'd go on a crazy rant about how the French were justified. She also spent half of one class rambling on about gay marriage and how she didn't care if the gays had civil unions but that they shouldn't be able to get *married* and couldn't understand why they would want to make that distinguishment. She was convinced that it was just because they wanted a ring.

New York, LA, and Boston are critical ports to long term occupation so they can’t wipe them out but their populations are highly educated, reasonably well armed, and prideful of their cities so they’re very likely to fight using direct and indirect combat methods.

The best way the Midwest and the remainder of California could fight back is to just walk away from their farms and ranches. No local supply chain makes feeding a large occupation force difficult. 

Mid Atlantic states (Conn to Va) threw sheer numbers alone would withstand extended bombardments and if indirect combat methods are used they could push back a pretty large force.

13056,"This! So many girls I knew in the past were trying to get pregnant solely to make their SO stay with them forever. A child will never fix a broken relationship, but if you already have a good relationship having a child just makes it so much better. At least in my experience. I thought I loved my SO before, but I love him so much more now that I see him being an amazing dad to our daughter. "

13073,"No no no. Not in the slightest. Even if regulated it’s still extremely easy to overdose when you compare it to other drugs. It’s safer than fentanyl, yeah. Not other opiates. 

All the bad shit is because it’s extremely addicting. Which will make you crazy. Regulated or not people will do whatever they have to to get more when addicted to heroin. Sure, there’s worse out there, but there’s nothing good about heroin. At all.

13074,"There is levels to it.  If the guy is picking up pounds and selling to other dealers, then giving you a gram to go pick  food or whatever is like me giving you a penny for x amount of your time.

13075,"Working for an online business (seek.com.au) a few years ago.
About 11am one day, an email comes from the CEO: ""Congratulations everybody! About an hour ago we hit $6B market cap.  Everyone take the rest of the day off, and if you can't, make sure you coordinate with your manager to have another day.""

But they were great about doing awesome stuff like that... Hot Day?  They'd get an ice cream van down in the basement carpark, and shoot an email around declaring free ice cream for the next 2 hours.

They also shut down one afternoon so the entire company could attend the final of the company tennis tournament. Free bbq and beer at Rod Laver Arena (where the Australian Open happens) - I don't remember watching much tennis.

In the time I was there the only people who left were people moving interstate, changing careers, etc.

13076,Both my parents are deaf and it's actually amazing at how many people dont understand that just talking to them and pronouncing every word well usually works. Lip reading is pretty successful most of the time. Obviously there is some struggle but everyone assumes they need to write it down or goolge how to sign a certain letter/word.
13077,I think The Railsplitter would be a much more appropriate finisher for him.
13078,I would say it is the contrary it has improved over time. The fact that we make school shooters famous is pretty in line with the movie. There is also the point on how much we just dismiss students mental health. And I love that it is a perfect parody of mean girls. Have you seen the musical it does all the things it needs to reinvent the concept I highly recommend it. 
13079,"It is factually wrong, otherwise we’d be magnitudes dumber than early humans. What’s described in the movie has been going on forever and we’re not really worse off for it. 

The whole problem when people make this argument about the premise is that it doesn’t actually matter why everyone is dumb. It’s said in the first five minutes in a humorous way, and then never affects any of the main plot and is never brought up again (except for an additional joke at the very end). 

People act like it’s a movie about what happens when dumb people breed but it’s not. It’s a movie about what happens when everyone is dumb, with a flawed but still comical premise as to why everyone’s dumb. "

13094,"I was interested in Nofap until I spent about 3 weeks on that subreddit. It's damn near angry zealotry. You can't even have an opinion on the good side of healthy masturbation without being demonized. It became disturbing when you'd read posts of guys asking if it's ok to cum from fucking their girlfriends. It got even weirder when every other post was some kid not even 18 yet trying to do Nofap because he thinks it'll make his life better somehow and he's doomed if he ever were to ""waste his seed"" as many of them claim. I think r/pornfree is a much healthier mindset in general. "

13097,"When I was in 7th grade I got picked on a lot but there was another kid who was always getting picked on. He was the “nerd” or “loner” of the school. Well to make myself feel better I started to pick on him at lunch one day because of course he was an easy target, but to my surprise he stood up for himself and picked on me back. This infuriated me so I waited outside the doors for him to leave lunch and when he walked through the doors I smacked him in the face as hard as I could with my lunch pack knocking his glasses off and breaking them. I told him never to talk back to me again. I never picked on him again after that but it still haunts me to this day I did that when I knew exactly how it felt to be picked on. It was a real dick move. Sorry man if you’re out there. "

13099,"For being from South America (""latino"") and when I travel outside my country (I love traveling btw):

- I like some salsa and reggaeton, but I prefer rock or even some ""cumbia"" songs. Actually, I only know the most famous reggaeton songs, so please, stop asking me for new singers because I don't know more than you probably.
- I like dancing, but it does not mean that I always want to dance. I am a really bad dancer and I am the kind of guy who needs to drink at least 2L of beer before dancing. I am tired of people who want me to teach them, at least try to ask nicely.
- Some ""latino"" topics like ""Trump's attempts to build a wall on the mexican border"" or the beautiful beaches in the Caraibe. I know something about Mexico or the Caraibe, but I am not from there. And I especially hate when people (mostly americans) try to be polite and they say something like ""I totally against Trump's attitudes against mexicans, I see how hard they work...."". I always want to answer: 1) I am not mexican; 2) I dont care if you are in favor of it. Actually, explaining to people that I am not mexican could be annoying. 
- Something that I would love to say to police officers at airports (especially the ones in the USA): ""I love traveling alone. I know you will make me 20 different questions because you think I am bringing drugs to your country, but this is not true. If I speak slowly if just because english is not my first language, nothing about being nervous. Anyway, take me to the fucking room with the other police officers and I will answer your silly questions again"". Of course, I answer politely."

because the dealer sells weed to lots of people, and is only paying taxes on whatever his boss bought

13103,Because of the liability. If the felony was violent in nature the business opens itself up to a true civil liability by having the person on staff. This is especially true is the individual's job duties would take them out in the field to deal with customers.
13104,Ouch. Were you guys on bad terms or something?
13105,Pool liner and installation for some weed. It was a really nice deal. 10/10 would recommend bartering. 
13106,"My sister lied. Like, *a lot*. About the craziest things, too. She'd cut up a shirt and say her friend's cat did it. She'd throw toys away and blame it on our grandma's ghost, and would lie to the school saying she didn't have lunch money. Stuff like that.


But she stole and destroyed MY stuff all of the time. She'd try to say things I bought with my own money were hers, and take them to school and just give them away. She'd get a slap on the wrist most of the time... I think our parents were just exhausted.


Anyway, my mom finally let me color my hair when I was 15. I hated the red in it, so this was a big deal to me. My sister decided she was going to switch out my hair color for my mom's auburn. I guess the brand difference and open box wouldn't be a giveaway. No harm, no foul?


Nah. I was *pissed*. I got the right color from my mom's collection, and gave it to my mom to put in my hair. Sister kept coming into the kitchen now and then to peek. So proud of herself.



We lived in an apartment and shared a room, so I grabbed some scissors from the bathroom after I brushed my teeth, and headed to bed. I waited until I knew she was out, grabbed whatever hair I could, and just gave three big snips. Shoved the hair into my pillowcase, and lost the evidence on my way to the bus stop in the morning.


They still don't know it was me. My sister accused me, but girl who cried wolf and all. She couldn't answer, ""What would make your sister do that?"" without outing herself.


TL:DR - Liar of a sister tried to dye my hair red, I cut half her hair off instead."

(and I know the haters will come to this post.)
I'm a trans gender woman, so there was a lot of time in my life where it seemed like I was a guy.   And of course I'd be a girl online.

It always makes me wonder, the guys who spend a lot of time online pretending to be girls, I just have a hard time understanding how someone who's 100% a guy can do that."
13122,"Because if I'm looking at two applicants with identical experience and qualifications; but one has a felony on the record, I have to account for whether or not that's going to cause me any issues.
Insurance liability if they drive a company vehicle?
Accounting liability if they're handling money?
Confidentiality liability if they're handling client information?
Liability for a felon in the home or vehicle of a client? 

As a business owner, I also owe good business practices to my patrons, which means a guarantee of safety of their money, information and anything I or my employees have access to. 

So I would be more inclined to hire an applicant that I can offer the guarantee of a clean record of my employees to my clients. "

We have people who volunteer or go out of their way to restore or build something nice and pretty and exciting for all to see, and a bunch of disrespectful jackasses just trash it or desecrate it because of a lack of respect for it. 

Hell, i called a bunch of teen girls with retarded hairstyles out on it once and one snob in particular called me a ""Libtard snowflake tree hugger"" which i just reported them and got them kicked out of the park because fuck them"

There was simply no way to entirely confirm an allied victory without the word of the Emperor, and frankly that would not have happened in a land invasion until the death toll was far too high. The nukes changed everything, and without them the war would have been much, much worse.

Just then I noticed that my aunt has brown eyes.  Everyone on both sides of my family has blue eyes.  My uncle, her husband, also has blue eyes.  My aunt is the only person in our family (except for now my baby cousin) with brown eyes.  Years later I asked my mom about it and she told me that our grandma had a fling with a guy who worked at a bar where my grandpa went drinking every night until it closed.  This guy, and my grandma, knew he wouldn’t be home for hours, so when my grandpa walked in, the guy would leave to go fool around with my grandma.  My grandpa never caught on.  Evidently he missed school on the day they talked about genetics.  "

Also who cares what Mao says, I’m talking about the feelings of regular people. And if you’re saying that people in Nanjing only dislike the Japanese because the CCP manipulates them with shitty TV shows then thats both ignorant and insulting. 

Perhaps you’re not from a country where you have to consider this, but many people around the world have complex emotions surrounding past crimes committed on their countries by other countries that are now peaceful, but also largely unrepentant. In my country, Ireland, many people are not particularly impressed by the moronic British government attitude right now towards the border with Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement that secures the peace on the island. The rising anti-British sentiment in Ireland is wrapped up in all kinds of complex, and often negative, emotions related to our history with Britain. You can say we shouldn’t care about the famine, Black and Tans etc, from before we were born, but we do care, and it’s certainly not artificial. "

There's just certain types of people on Reddit who believe they're edgy and ""woke"" by discounting fucking anything related to organized religion. 

Sorry, but I just had to intervene here. I read the comments that take the position that it's common knowledge that she was secretly a terrible cunt. OK. But in this particular case, I'm directly related to a personal friend and collaborator, so if anyone has that sort of relationship and feels that I am mistaken, I would like to hear, and would be open to their experiences. I can see how one could argue that I'm biased based off my my second hand relationship, but I personally feel that knowing someone who worked with her is likely a more accurate source than the internet.

13300,"&gt;IIRC, the electors are not bound by federal law to follow the popular vote, and not all states have the stipulation written in.

&gt;Meaning some electors could choose to vote a different way then the popular vote.

Here is a [source](http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=967)(c. 2012) to the number of states that do bind their electors(29). The rest are operating faithfully out of tradition.

If electors were faithless en masse it would pierce the veil and reveal our system for what it actually is. They would never do that, instead they configure the system such that the preferred candidates are the only ones who even have a chance.

&gt;I also don’t believe it has been tested in court if state laws requiring electors to vote the way of the popular vote would hold.

It would. The constitution granted that power to the states:

Article II Section 1:

""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress"""

You responded ‘men can be sterile too’ though I never said or implied they can’t. All I said was the language used implied it was a woman. It was the structure of the sentence with general word use rather than the idea that only women can be sterile. You and the original commenter kind of prove my point. Women like to use general terms when they can when men are fine being detailed. I’m a woman so to me it sounds better to say ‘I am unable to have children’ rather than ‘I’m sterile’ but I’m sure most men are fine with the latter.

They tried to argue that his films were child pornography under a new law since some of the actors wore clothing evocative of a younger age but the Supreme Court struck down the relevant law before it went to trial and there were no actual children involved so those charges were dropped. A few years later they arrested him again and charged him with obscenity for films that involved things like fisting, urination and vomiting. Note that the prosecutions were over the offensive nature of the content of the films, not anything related to the consent or wellbeing of the actresses. These charges struck and he served several years in prison.

I personally feel his conviction was unjust since they never attempted to make any argument over whether or not the actresses did not consent, so he was jailed over videos of legal acts on the basis of moral offence instead of any real crime. Bush was under heavy pressure from social conservatives to crack down on obscenity at the time and it's possible that they wouldn't have bothered with the case if it happened in a different political climate."

Yeah, watched that movie for the first time recently and enjoyed it but came to the conclusion that it just works better as the play Diane was writing. The triangle is pretty stupid at face value because these people just fall in love like there was something in the water. While I can argue that Jack does have a few redeemable qualities by being someone Diane can actually romanticize (something she had buried in herself), the fact is that Playboy Jack was just a rich dude with charm and not an actual 3 dimensional character like Keanu. Thus why it ends the way it does by Jack transforming himself into someone she can actually love.

Keanu unfortunately gets left at the restaurant twice in the film and it sucks to be good guy Keanu. 

It's a weird movie like lots of Nancy Myers films. I would say that him visiting his entire life of relationships to learn what his affect on women's lives were is a way that he experienced growth. "

Your assumption that southerners are ardently racist (and incestuous) is despite the fact that you've never been to the South. It's only backed up by how you're perceiving a response you get in an online forum, which you say is overwhelmingly negative. And your validation of this assumption is that you generally figure that this forum is a statistically accurate model of the relevant population who might actually give you the experience to make a judgement call here.

13562,"Really. You'd have to be pretty dense (or deliberately looking to be offended) to not understand the context of Blazing Saddles.

There's copious usage of the N-word, but never any significant doubt as to where the movie stands on racial issues (even the scene with the stereotypical Western movie ""injuns"" is just taking the piss out of the outmoded Hollywood practice of casting Jewish and Italian actors as Indians, which is why the Indians in Blazing Saddles speak Yiddish).

She intentionally made her class difficult so that students really understood the materials but always offered after every class for kids to stay for extra help. She knew her curriculum was difficult and extremely detail oriented yet had no intention of failing anyone. She actively wanted them to come in after class and ask for help so that she knew they were really trying. I was one of the students who really struggled with her class and I went to her class every single day after school for my entire junior year for help. At the end of the year, I managed to pass her final exam and passed her class with a less than stellar grade but still passed nonetheless. She gave me a hug before I left for summer break and said ""I'm so proud of you for toughing through it. You struggled and put in the work to succeed. Your dedication to passing makes me happier than anything else"". Her class was everything but easy but that was the point. She wanted students to go out of their way to actually understand it rather than bullshit and half ass their way through it like 99% of other high school classes. She was never out to fail anyone. She was out to install a drive to succeed in her class and it worked. It also helped that she was a lovely lady and was the polar opposite of a stuck up bitch. "

13654,"Again, even without the motivation, most people still see the Nazis as a much greater evil than the Soviets. For example, in Soviet Poland, it’s true hundreds of thousands were murdered for opposing the regime. And that “opposition” was very often extremely trivial, and the executions just intended to make the larger population behave. In Nazi Poland, however, 85% of the population would have been murdered for existing. Even if the Soviets had murdered twice they amount the actually did in Poland, it still would not come close to what would have happened under Hitler.

The uniqueness comes from the racial aspect, and the industrialization of murder. Any dictatorship executes political opponents. And there have been multiple which, just like the Soviet Union, have executed people for trivial reasons. Since by striking fear into the population, it lets them assert more political control. But as a whole, we are familiar with dictatorships. We’ve seen them before and since. The most unique thing about Stalin is the power he got. But if other dictators had gotten his level of control, their response would have been the same. And for the most part, we understand that as long as you follow orders, most people will be left alone

For the Nazis, anyone who was a “negative influence” was to be literally exterminated. These were completely innocent people, who even by “normal” dictatorship political standards had “followed the rules”, and were murdered in the millions just for exsisting. 

As bad as any other dictatorship in human history has got, they at least usually spare children. The Nazi’s murdered them by the hundreds of thousands. And then there is the methodology. Most dictatorships have mass executions. The Nazi’s literally industrialized their ability to kill completely innocent people. The Soviets had their Gulags, but at the least they were legitimately intended for work. The majority of people survived their time in the Gulags. Meanwhile, in Germany, there were sometimes up to 12,000 bodies a day in only Auschwitz. Mosy camps were intended for extermination. Most people were sent directly to be murdered, with no work whatsoever. In Germany, the labor that did exist, was just to squeeze an extra benefit out of those lined up to be murdered anyways.  If at Auschwitz, the labor force wasn’t being worked to death, the camp commanders would have been replaced. Since extermination was the objective.  In the Gulags, while many were worked to death, this wasn’t the wanted intention. Again, the large percentage of Gulag prison survived. This link basically describes it https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Russian-gulag-so-rarely-mentioned-vs-German-labor-camps-despite-the-fact-that-a-lot-more-people-died-in-the-gulag-system

We agree that both regimes were evil. But that does not mean they were equivalent. Stalin’s Europe was horrific. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t acknowledge that Hitler’s Europe would have been many, many times worse than Stalin’s was. We can acknowledge that two different things are evil, while still recognizing one as worse than the other. For example, if someone planted a nuclear bomb in a large city, they’d be seen as worse than any serial killer. That doesn’t mean that serial killers aren’t still unthinkably terrible. But just that the other person has somehow ascended to an even higher level of evilness.

This is more useful than it initially seems because until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes. Or the senatorial elite can be argued to have ""lost"" the struggle at the end of the Republic that eventually produced Augustus, but the Roman literary classes were fairly ensconced within (or at least sympathetic towards) that order, and thus we often see the fall of the Republic presented negatively.

&gt;Of course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits."

But the Khmer Rouge was just ridiculous, I mean evacuating the cities and working everyone to death with pointless labour? How could anybody think this was going to do anything?

A lot of experts have theorized that findings of dinosaur bones (or any other unusual or large bone/fossil) by earlier cultures gave rise to myths such as dragons, giants, sea monsters, bigfoot, etc. People had no other explanation for them. 

One of my favorites is Homo floresiensis. An actual hominin believed to have died out some 50,000 years ago. They lived in Indonesia and have been popularized as ""hobbits"" since they were only about around 3 feet tall. At the time of their discovery, there were local legends of a tribe of small dwarf-like people/creatures that kidnapped children or caused other mischief. No such living tribe has been found there, but some have theorized that the legends stemmed from the existence of H. Floresiensis- either as a result of direct contact with modern humans thousands of years ago, or because fossil evidence of their existence had been found by locals in the area over the years. Its been a long time since i read up on that, so i might have the some details confused. But you get the gist of it."

The worst part is that he and the other driver saw her ahead of time and were blowing the whistle or whatever to try to get her to jump off the tracks but she either couldn't hear over the music or it was a suicide. 
It was a cargo train so they ended up slowing down and eventually stopping in the middle of nowhere. My Dad then got out and went to the nearest house to use their phone to call the police where he learned it was the girl's house and he just told her parents she had died. He had a lot of time off after that. My Dad ended up being killed in a train derailment a couple of years later so this is just the story my Mom has retold but I couldn't even imagine how traumatizing it would have been. "

13837,"So a little bit different but related. I have a strong teacher kink and always have. When I was about 13 I realised I was strongly attracted to one of my same sex teachers. I tried to push that knowledge away as it felt so taboo but that didn't stop me from spending every spare minute in her presence. I excelled in her subject and it turned out we had a lot in common, despite the large age gap. I was absolutely in love. 

When I was 14 she began inviting me back to her place occassionally, but still maintained professional boundaries, like for example she didn't go into her personal life too much. I would also stop by the restaurant she owned, she'd give me free coffee and we'd chat. We were definitely firm friends by then. I spent the year followinf my sixteenth birthday overseas and would phone her up back home. When I came back to school afterwards, I was no longer taking her subject but our friendship remained strong.

 I can't really remember how our friendship transitioned into a closer one as an adult but I guess there weren't the same boundaries that had to be upheld. We spent longer together... coffee, walks, even going out drinking. For me it was a dream come true, even though she didn't know how I truly felt. Just the fact that she wanted to spend time with me was enough. 

She moved away for a couple of years, but I'd go to visit her and stay at her house. I knew all her childrdn and some extended family by then. We'd spend days together seeing the sights and talking non stop. We even started talking about our sex lives. Believe me, talking about your sex life with your former teacher is pretty awkward at first... especially hearing about theirs! 

Finally, last year, in my mid 20s, things turned sour. A year or so before that I'd decided to be honest about my feelings for her. They were so strong that I just felt like I was hiding too much from her. But I never expected anything to come of it because I knew she was completely straight, and probably not interested in someone as young as me.

 I hadn't expected her to be some uncomfortable with it, but the discomfort festered and began coming up in not so great ways. She had known I was infatued with her since about 13/14 (I was quite embarrassed at that), but she hasn't realised the extent of my feelings and they didn't sit well with her. 

Another thing that pulled our friendship apart is that when I moved away permanently about 2.5 years ago, I went through a lot of changes all at once, and was no longer the person she'd known. There was also a power imbalance in the relationship, she hasn't adjusted to me truly growing up.

 I miss her terribly but I'm glad for what we had. Spending all those hours together, confiding in one another, going special places just the two of us. It was more than my 13 year old self could ever have dreamed of. Up to where I am in my life right now, she's been my biggest love."

What actions of the Natives were good in contrast to the colonists? Some tribes actively owned slaves, some tribes subsisted mainly through a raiding/trading empire (see Apache and other Nomadic Texas/SW people’s). History is violet and the Natives weren’t inherently less violet than the colonists. They were just disadvantaged and thus taken adavantagd of. If you want to see power dynamics where natives were equals/stronger than colonists, read up on French and Spanish interactions with native groups on the Missouri/Missippi during the 17th/18th century. 

Edit: Just preemptive, yes I know the Spanish were terrible to natives, but the example I provided of the Missouri River valley is where a variety of Native groups were in larger numbers and dominated trade/access to the area."

I'm one of the lucky ones - I get off pretty easily to PiV. I actually prefer it to oral because after I come I'm usually too sensitive for more oral but I can come again and again from intercourse. So for me that means I generally like 20-30 minutes, but if he comes before that, I really don't care so long as we go again. And if we have the time and energy for it and if he doesn't mind not coming for awhile himself, I'm good with longer too. 

  
If I'm tired like 5-10 minutes is fine. "

13961,"Here’s my regret story. I was in my early 20s living in hollywood. I had two friends who were boyfriend amd girlfriend that lived nearby. I had crushed on my friend’s girlfriend for years. We had often hung out together and I consistently felt sexual tension between us. At that time all three of us were strung out on heroin.  And the two of them were my dealers. 

So one saturday morning i messaged her if i could come through to cop. She usually always got up earlier than her boyfriend and I needed to score as soon as i woke up so i wouldnt get sick. She said her boyfriend was sleeping but to come through anyway. 

I showed up to their apartment, and her boyfriend was still asleep. We got high then went out to the hallway (they lived in a studio and it was disgusting and almost like a hoarders place). Then she said something about her body being stiff and asked for a massage. 

At that time her boyfriend was pretty abusive, and things we’re escalating due to their addiction. He was trying pimp her out to do porn to support his habit. She was very unhappy in the relationship but she was very young and lacked the self-esteem to break it off. She had also shared with me how sexually frustrated she was because her boyfriend’s sex drive pretty much disappeared with his heroin use. 

She then laid down on her belly and i straddle her waist rubbing her shoulders and back. After a few minutes she asks me to message lower. So now my hands are are at her lower back and she tells me to go even lower! So I lift up her pink skirt and start to message her butt. At this point I know exactly where this is going and what she wants. I’m not usually one to turn down such opportunities, especially when I’ve secretly desired someone for so long. But for whatever reason, maybe i didnt want to jeopardize my heroin connection, maybe i was afraid of getting caught, i just messaged her ass as platonically as possible, until she realized it wasnt going to escalate and she told me to stop. 

We never talked about it. To this day, over ten years later, I still regret not hooking up with her, and not fulfilling a fantasy i had for years. "

Edit: Just because I realize this is a little mean. In case you're still hapless, ask girls questions about themselves that take a bit to answer then listen and ask any relevant follow ups. If something they say sounds cool or they sound really awesome, mention that. Try not to go on for too long though, as it's really hard to know when too much is too much. Basically learn to talk about yourself but in small interesting snippets. Continue doing that for a bit. You'll probably either get turned down which is cool or you'll notice them smile a lot and maintain eye contact with you then ask them to hang out sometime. Again getting turned down is fine, thank them for talking and try to remember anything really dumb that you said. Hooray you'll eventually meet someone who likes you!

-The way the wave breaks.
-No waves.
-Wind causing Choppiness of the water, which slows you down. Wind blowing you out of position, so you have to constantly paddle to stay in place. 
-Crowds- usually only 1 rider per wave, and  there’s 1 spot everyone is trying to position themselves in.
-you have to fight your bodies natural urges and use your brain instead of your gut feeling. It’s very easy to panic if you’re not used to being out of control and just go with the flow of the water.
-Forget about the sharks. They are so rare. the animals to be careful about are stingrays. sea urchins, jelly fish and man-o-war. One time I fell and landed on a sea turtle, but that’s just anecdotal.

He finds a potential fix, learns that he really knows very little, and while a bit resistant, once proven wrong, he accepts it and tries to better himself. He's humbled by the capabilities of The Ancient One. He admits he's not as good. 

His same stubborn attitude and focus on being the best, which got him to the top of his field in the first place, helps him quickly rise to the top of being a sorcerer as well.

While that could easily apply to most things, spending time with rocks is somehow a bit different, I feel. It's not just rote memorization, it's take this sample, feel it, look at it from all the angles, now look at this other sample of the same thing, note how some things are the same, others not... eventually you kinda start to develop the ability to semi-reliably identify things without thinking about it much.

I'm a firm believer in the non aggression principle. Go and read the entire comment and tell me if nearly every point they made doesn't violate the nap.

Hell, go to any porn site right now and look up anything with James Deen in it. The women act as if they are loving it but if you look at him (and most male talent for that matter) they are just pounding away with no regard to how the woman is feeling. "

14075,"Totally agree.  The first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is just about the only part you could call ""great.""  The rest is well-made, but I can think of a dozen war movies that beat it any day of the week.

Shakespeare in Love, though, is a great movie.  Entertaining, great writing, well-paced, and doesn't get trapped into the rom-com tropes just about every other movie falls into.  It's even greater if you are well-versed in Romeo and Juliet and the life of William Shakespeare.  "

I do check my clothes to see where they are made and when I can I don't get clothes from those areas. But it is nearly impossible to find clothes not cheaply made in the area where I live. I can't afford to buy clothes online for exorbitant prices, which leaves me the options of either not having clothes or buying clothes that unfortunately came from those areas. As it is illegal to walk around nude, I have to buy clothes"

14093,"Not a drug dealer (mostly) but when I was at a party I was offered 2 lines of coke. I did them, said thanks and had fun for an hour, then I started coming down and wanted more. I had nothing to trade because I'd already smoked all my weed that night. But I did have a bag of goldfish snack crackers. I was high/drunk and on coke so I thought what the hell. I offered to trade the goldfish for another line. Needless to say it didn't work. Still a good night though.

TL:DR- I tried to trade goldfish for coke."

Back in high school I went to a party in a not-so-nice part of town. I didn't really know anybody there but there were a bunch of black guys. I am Asian and one of the guys started talking to me and he said he ""wanted me to show me something"". He pulled me into his room and I started getting a little freaked out since I didn't really know this guy, I am girl and I was alone in his room. Worst case scenarios started running in my head. Anyway he comes in and tells me not to tell anyone about his ""secret""  which is in his closet.  To my surprise he opens his closet, and it is full, I mean full of manga, anime figures, the works. Taught me anyone can be a nerd. "

14116,"Going to our zoo's and treating the animals like shit. I once saw a family of tourists poking and throwing little rocks at a baby joey kangaroo because it was just laying in the sun and not doing anything and they wanted to see it jump or something. 

They were bloody lucky it was just a baby and was tamed from being a zoo animal and not an adult kangaroo. I don't think people from overseas really grasp the fact that wild Kangaroos will tear you to shreds. Just stay away from them if you come here and you're in the wild. They also fuck up cars as well if you're unfortunate enough to come across one in the countryside while driving.

Luckily one of the zoo employee's came over and told them off.

14129,"I think it’s the shock factor. People are becoming desensitized to things at an alarming rate. I remember only 10 or so years ago when streaming porn became the norm, anal and deepthroat videos were on the fringe, now those things are commonplace. In almost every video. Porn is getting crazier and crazier because people are attracted to the mundane less and less. I think that is the same reason why child pornography is becoming a bigger issue. Creating and sharing videos has never been easier, people need more shock factor to get off. Coed used to be the big thing, and no one ever used the word high school. Now the actresses are younger, smaller, and do crazier shit. Why would I want to watch a girl my own age do doggystyle with her average joe when I can watch Piper Perri, a 5’, 90lb teenager with braces, get turned into a popsicle by a 10” monster penis? "

The Flag, Constitution, and the entire design are modeled after the United States and still exists to this day.  The Ancestors that primarily rule and control the country even now are the direct descendants of pre-civil war freed black American slaves.  So when modern-day Black Americans feel like they have no ""home"" or ""place to go back to""...They actually have an intentionally constructed country that America created just for them to develop at their whim.  Many Black and White US citizens are completely unaware of this Country.  It's called Liberia.  Named after Liberty.  They've since had two civil wars themselves and several Ebola outbreaks, but that ended and they were cleared in 2015.  They are also credited with electing the first-ever female head of state of an African country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Johnson_Sirleaf) and being the first African country in history to declare it's independence on July 26, 1847.

Recognizing that the issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women, I would like to convey to Your Excellency my most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women.... By the Statement of Prime Minister in 1995, the Government of Japan renewed the feelings of deep remorse and the heartfelt apology for tremendous damage and suffering caused by Japan to the people of many countries including the Netherlands during a certain period in the past. My cabinet has not modified this position at all, and I myself laid a wreath to the Indisch Monument with these feelings on the occasion of my visit to the Netherlands in June last year"" 

November 26, 1998: 
&gt;Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi said in a declaration: ""Both sides believe that squarely facing the past and correctly understanding history are the important foundation for further developing relations between Japan and China. The Japanese side observes the 1972 Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China and the August 15, 1995, Statement by former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. The Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious distress and damage that Japan caused to the Chinese people through its aggression against China during a certain period in the past and expressed deep remorse for this. The Chinese side hopes that the Japanese side will learn lessons from the history and adhere to the path of peace and development. Based on this, both sides will develop long-standing relations of friendship"" 

2001: 
&gt;Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi (Also signed by all the prime ministers since 1995, including Ryutaro Hashimoto, Keizō Obuchi, Yoshirō Mori) said in a letter: ""As Prime Minister of Japan, I thus extend anew my most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women. We must not evade the weight of the past, nor should we evade our responsibilities for the future. I believe that our country, painfully aware of its moral responsibilities, with feelings of apology and remorse, should face up squarely to its past history and accurately convey it to future generations""

September 17, 2002: 
&gt;Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said: ""The Japanese side regards, in a spirit of humility, the facts of history that Japan caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of Korea through its colonial rule in the past, and expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology"" (Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration).

August 15, 2003: 
&gt;Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said: ""During the war, Japan caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. On behalf of the people of Japan, I hereby renew my feelings of profound remorse as I express my sincere mourning to the victims"" 

April 22, 2005: 
&gt;Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said: ""Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility. And with feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology always engraved in mind, Japan has resolutely maintained, consistently since the end of World War II, never turning into a military power but an economic power, its principle of resolving all matters by peaceful means, without recourse to use of force. Japan once again states its resolve to contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world in the future as well, prizing the relationship of trust it enjoys with the nations of the world."" 

August 15, 2005: 
&gt;Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said: ""In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Sincerely facing these facts of history, I once again express my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology, and also express the feelings of mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad, in the war. I am determined not to allow the lessons of that horrible war to erode, and to contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world without ever again waging a war.""

August 10, 2010: 
&gt;Prime Minister Naoto Kan expressed ""deep regret over the suffering inflicted"" during the Empire of Japan's colonial rule over Korea. Japan's Kyodo News also reported that Cabinet members endorsed the statement. In addition, Kan said that Japan will hand over precious cultural artifacts that South Korea has been demanding. Among them were records of an ancient Korean royal dynasty.

December 7, 2010: 
&gt;Prime Minister Naoto Kan apologized for Korea's suffering under colonization as part of a statement marking the 100th anniversary of the annexation in 1910. ""I express a renewed feeling of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology for the tremendous damage and suffering caused by colonial rule,"" Kan said. Kan said Japan colonized Korea ""against the will of the Korean people"" who suffered great damage to their national pride and loss of culture and sovereignty as a result and added that he wants to take an honest look at his country's past with the courage and humility to address its history

November 13, 2013: 
&gt;Former Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama Yukio offered personal apology for Japan's wartime crimes, especially the Nanking Massacre, ""As a Japanese citizen, I feel that it's my duty to apologise for even just one Chinese civilian killed brutally by Japanese soldiers and that such action cannot be excused by saying that it occurred during war."""

14282,"[Electoral voters have actually voted against their state's popular vote winner in nearly every election since 1948, although in very small numbers.](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-faithless-electors-2016-story.html#)

2016 saw *seven* electoral voters vote against their state's popular vote, which is the most in any election.  

Two are from a state that voted for Trump and five are from states that voted for Clinton. 

From the article, here's who they are and who they voted for:

&gt; - Christopher Suprun [of Texas], a paramedic and former firefighter who was one of the first responders on Sept. 11, wrote in a New York Times op-ed in the run-up to the electoral college vote that Trump is ""someone who shows daily he is not qualified for the office."" Suprun said he had a legal right and constitutional duty to vote his conscience and planned to do so. On Monday, he cast his vote for Ohio Gov. John Kasich.


 
&gt; - Another Republican elector from Texas, William Greene, cast his vote for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, according to the Austin American-Statesman.



&gt;(A third Texan, Art Sisneros, had also opposed Trump and resigned from the electoral college ahead of the vote. He was replaced by an alternate.)



&gt;In Washington, where voting for a person not nominated by the party carries a $1,000 fine, four electors defected from Clinton, who won the state's popular vote.



&gt; - Esther John, who voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, told local media she did so ""in the hopes that Democrats and Republicans could reconcile.""



&gt; - Peter B. Chiafolo, a co-founder of the group Hamilton Electors, which seeks to change the electoral process, also voted for Powell. 

&gt; - So did Levi Guerra, who, together with Powell, had previously attempted to challenge Washington's faithless elector law in court.



&gt; - Robert Satiacum, an environmental activist, voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Yankton Sioux elder who has protested against the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.



&gt; - In Hawaii, where Clinton won 62% of the vote, elector David Mulinix voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders because he thought Sanders was the ""most qualified"" candidate.

As far as federal and state laws on it:

&gt;The Constitution does not specifically require electors to cast their votes according to the popular vote in their states, but the laws of 29 states and the District of Columbia bind electors to do so. Some require pledges or threaten fines or criminal action, according to a summary of state laws by the National Assn. of Secretaries of State.

&gt;No elector has ever been prosecuted for not voting as pledged.


...

Also this:

&gt;Throughout the years, 71 electors changed their votes because the candidate their state chose died before the electoral college could convene. In 1872, for example, Horace Greeley, the nominee of both the Democratic and Liberal Republican parties, lost the general election and died 24 days later. Sixty-three of the 66 Democratic electors refused to vote for a deceased candidate.

""63 of 66 electors refused to vote for a deceased candidate."" 

He lost before he died so their votes had no effect regardless of who they voted for but still...*three assholes voted for a dead guy!*"

14341,"You make a good point.. here's a little piece of ugly history. 
   In WW2 children  from major cities in England that were likely to be blitzed, were sent by their parents or caretakers to safety in rural England, US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada. The idea was to send the children away from the immediate dangers of being bombed. There was to be an allowance paid per child to the host household, unfortunately the money would get tied up and unable to make it to them. As they could not claim the children as their own to receive their own government reimbursement,  the children were treated as burdens.
   I have spoken to some of the survivors of this British children's exodus and the stories were awful. Some of the kids were used for unpaid  labor on farms, beaten, sexually abused, neglected, starved, forced to sleep in inhumane  sheds or farm outbuildings.
   All the kids wanted was to go home and be reunited with their families. Their families thought they had gotten their kids out of harm's way. 
   All this child abuse was perpetrated by civilians. "

Also, I'm brown and my husband is white. He's got a large, connected family. I do too, but they are mainly in India. He's a lot more friendly than I am. But somehow, we end up getting invited to more family events of the few friends I have here than of his first cousins. 

I think it's because the notion of family in Western European culture is so narrow, so people who follow that culture tend to be less inclined to opting in to a larger community, unless it's for some political or economic cause. "

The book is more on the drier side since it is published for academic purposes rather than popular commercial. The only bias I would say he has is that he tells the history of the greater conflicts from the perspective of the Greeks and admits that he had family that fought on the Communist side of the civil war. Though I don’t think his slight biases get in the way of objective fact. "

So i just walked up to the teacher and asked if i could do it over myself. He tried to dissuade me as we had to present it in powerpoint form in front of class. Eventually, he let it be and I wrote about my bipolar depression and all that fun stuff.

One day my friend is on the phone with him  trying to set up a meet wen the dealer said he couldn’t because tomorrow is his daughter’s birthday and their baker flaked so they needed vegan gluten free cake in less that 24hrs. 

I happen to love baking so my friend asked if I’d do it, I obliged.  Even though we expected to pay he gave us the stuff for free 

Then because everyone likes my cake so much, I became his family event baker while I was in college. He would always ask if I wanted payment in weed or money. It was a pretty good deal. 


I also knew someone who paid for coke with gift cards. These weren’t like fresh ones with the full set amount, she’s just give them whatever stuff she had on her. Apparently she just saved them for holidays and used them to buy coke "

Another kid offered me his RooR bong for an 8th which I accepted. Thinking back now, I should have bartered way more. I also did a ton of Craigslist flipping.

I'm personally never going to slack off a lot or deliberately do a sub-par job through lack of effort/care because that's just the way I am with work (maybe fewer kids have that kind of ethic taught to them from a young age today, but I doubt it's a huge change), but how I feel about the environment has a big impact on whether I go beyond my job description or not or how sociable I am.

No murder that generation, however. This generation secret I think is just that my sister still has not told her husband that she won't be having children."

14470,"It's actually a little more complicated than that. What is crossing the line? Where is the line? In context, is it permissible? Are we being overly sensitive?

In my experience, it was an escalating series of acceptable concessions. I was never pressured into doing something radical, it was always a little more than before, a little step, and then another, and another, and another... Do something I was always going to do, but bring them along, help them, mentor them. Then I was going out of my way to help them, giving some of my time. Then some more of my time, and more. Invested in their life, giving them some social advice for their 'bad relationships.' Then they wanted me to spend more time with them, talking to them outside the game while at work. They wanted me to drop my social circle completely, and I was almost going to do it. But that was my line, the social consequences were low - they were isolated from all my friends already. I dropped them, and blocked them, and didn't have to worry about them coming after me because I'm a dude who just moved house.

When I say, ""He never crossed the line enough to warrant a straight block."" That was her line, not mine. How much you let people get away with before you think it's acceptable is up to you, and how far you would take it yourself. My line was a guy was trying to separate me from an existing social network - pressuring me to leave my friends just to hang out with him online. But, in context it could sound like someone really just wants a friend, this isn't emotionally manipulative behavior, until it is, until it forms a pattern.

Emotional manipulation and stalker behaviour isn't just straight to, ""omg I want see u naked. tell me where u live"" If anyone comes out with that right away, that gets shut down. It's subtle, slow moving, controlling. It prays on your wishes to be friendly and accommodating, which is why sociopaths never catch each other: They don't want to be friendly or accommodating, they only want what they want and they don't care about your feelings.

If someone says, ""Hey, PM\_ME\_UR\_TEAPOTS, can you help me find my friends?"" Is that emotional manipulation. No. If I'm saying this to you in public, do you feel a social pressure to help? Is everyone going to be a bit awkward with you if you say no, refuse this ""reasonable"" request? This is where the situation gets murky. It's hard to tell, hard to spot, hard to refuse. If you respond, ""Fuck off creep!"" Because you know this is another manipulation step - to separate you, to make you invested in me, what do others think of you? No, you say, ""sorry I can't help you"" you placate me, you don't step away, but you don't step towards, you keep me at a distance, but you don't get rid of me. The line hasn't been crossed. The line is where, fuck the social consequences, you're going to get rid of me. Which is why manipulators will add social consequences, they'll grab friends, your friends, to their side, they'll be muted in public, but more direct in private.

Online your best way to be friendly, and helpful, is to communicate with the perceived victim, ask if they're okay with this, and be available if things change. Be supportive, always. But, like I said before, a lot of 'white knight' stalkers will pressure you like this, make you think a friendly person is a manipulator, and they're just trying to protect you - you should be grateful etc etc etc"

Especially as Bernie gained steam in the last election cycle, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her primary in New York not too long ago, ""Socialism"" is getting thrown around a lot in ways that it should not; from both Liberals/Democrats *and* Conservatives/Republicans/Libertarians. 

* Social-Democracy is a *pro-capitalist* position which relies on a thriving private sector to be regulated and taxed to support public services and welfare programs.   
&gt;a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to *promote* social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and *capitalist economy*

* Democratic-Socialism is a *socialist* position in which end game socialism, aka the worker or community ownership of the means of production, is achieved through peaceful democratic means as opposed to traditional violent-revolutionary socialism.   
&gt; a political philosophy that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production with an emphasis on self-management and democratic management of economic institutions within a market socialist, participatory or decentralized planned economy. Democratic socialists hold that *capitalism is inherently incompatible* with what they hold to be the democratic values of liberty, equality and solidarity; and that these ideals can only be achieved through the realization of a socialist society.

My friends and I spread out and waited for bubbles to come up, then we all dove in that general area.  


Underwater, the gal had gotten turned around and didn't know which way was up.  She was swimming parallel to the surface.  We grabbed her legs and hauled her up, but she fought us off bravely.

Third post on their front page. I'll sum it up, it's basically one guy saying that not jerking it gave him ""powers"" with women. He used the word powers, not me. Again, they think not masturbating gives them super powers. Not like super strength, but the powerful super power of basic human social skills.

He also said the breaking point was that he couldn't get hard in a strip club... I don't know about you, but I don't think that's a bad sign. Then again I don't go to strip clubs, so I am biased against them. I just don't see the point in spending money to be sexually frustrated.

Of course you can just get better with women by acknowledging them as people and treating them with basic human decency, but that seems real hard for redditors to accept, just generally.

You can also do better by doing introspection about your relationship with porn. But again, introspection isn't something redditors are good at.

The fourth post down is similar, saying that there's no point to something if it doesn't advance your goal of getting a gf. Which is, well, first off it's sad. Second off that thought is just dangerous. All your actions don't have to lead to a goal, life is an arduous and odd journey. And in my opinion you should learn to live happily alone before trying to find a partner.

Like these guys seem to think that just having a relationship changes everything. It fucking doesn't, relationships can be wonderful, they can be horrible, and they can just be boring. But they require work, and the wonderful or boring ones require you to see your partner as more than just your personal key to fucking happiness."

14603,"I had a fantastic creative writing professor in college. We took Intro to Fiction Writing winter quarter and a special seminar spring quarter with a focus on genres (literary, sci-fi, horror, chick lit, etc). He was literary himself, but you could tell he genuinely loved reading and engaging with all the different sample pieces and student work. It was a joy to be in class with him (though he could be a hardass too). He was just an assistant prof and in line for tenure so he had to be observed once a quarter by tenured profs. The woman who came in to observe went to his office after class to discuss it with him and we huddled around the door to listen. She tried so hard to shame him (we were on sci-fi) and kept asking why he wasn’t teaching “real” fiction. He didn’t back down though and wouldn’t let her shame him for teaching what people wanted to write. That was four years ago and he got tenure two years ago.

I have my degree in English with a creative writing minor (all classes with the professor I mentioned- who knew I could learn to love poetry? I never did until he taught me how). There’s such a depressing focus on hoity-toity literary fiction and I say that as someone who writes that genre myself. Writing is about creating and expressing and passion. It’s hard and tedious too, but there’s so much more than the same old blue curtains. "

14634,"When Texas was independent, there were a lot of things going on in Mexico, most of them rebellion-related. Some folks tried to create an independent Republic of the Rio Grande, the Yucatan Peninsula broke off for a while... the country was having some trouble holding itself together.

After a while, Mexico kind of gets its shit together and sets out to bring Yucatan back into the fold. Since the area between the bulk of Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula is impassable jungle at the time, they begin building a fleet.

Meanwhile, the Republic of Texas is like ""You know what, we don't really need a navy, so let's sell these ships."" The fleet is put up for auction, but a riot in Galveston prevents the ships from being sold.

The Yucatan government sees that Mexico is building a fleet and goes ""Yo, Texas, we're about to be invaded, can you lend us a hand?"" Sam Houston is like ""Naw, we're fresh out of navy shit."" But the leader of the still-existing Texas navy is Commodore Edwin Moore, a dude who is convinced the Mexican navy will be landing in Texas next. He hops on the still-Texan ships and yells ""C'mon boys, let's get 'em!"" and off they sail.

Off the coast of Campeche, a combined Texan and Yucatan squadron defeats the Mexican fleet, staving off the invasion. Moore and his navy return to Galveston, where they are celebrated as heroes and promptly arrested for piracy. They were later acquitted.

The battle is notable in that I believe it is the only known instance of sailing vessels holding their own against steam vessels."

Within the context of the story told, it was accurate - life lessons told by a grandfather character with animation added.

That said, it's a mess. Looks like they rushed it into production. The story could've been done better with far more sympathetic characters. The kid who's hurt should've been repeatedly punched in the face. Disney had a problem with little kids in movies, being precocious isn't charming or cute. Spank that kid - behave.

Anyhow, back on topic.

You're upset that it comes from a different place where slaves were not being tortured, maimed and treated as animals. Bad things happened, we all can agree on that.

But not all bad things were the same. You can have cancer and told you will die from this... but you could also have surgery - and still die from this.

But that would happen much later, decades even. In both cases cancer is a killer. But on one, it's not as bad.

Never marrying or having any children, leaving the throne to his partying brother who then died and left it to Zoe who was Basil's niece. 

Which led to the eventual end to the Macedonian line and after that, succession struggles which led to the defeat at Manzikert and the inaction afterward that led to the near fatal weakening of the Empire.

Though this did lead to the interesting historical fact of the Empire being ruled by two women, Zoe and her sister Theodora as co-empresses with no emperors. Pretty sure no other Empire can say they were ruled by two women and no men for any point in their history."

14935,"I'm a plumber, so I've been to dozens of scrap yards for scrap day(the plumbers holiday). They seem to have one tare for all of their drums or dumpsters, and I really think that there is a significant variance between the weight of different drums and dumpsters or carts.

Lately I've just gone to the industrial scraper downtown because their copper prices are 20-25 cents more per pound than the smaller scrap shops in the suburbs. But the workers there don't seem to give a fuck. A few months ago I tore out some old coils that hadn't been cleaned since the 60's. I pulled up in an F-450 flatbed loaded up with the nastiest copper fin tube I've ever seen.I looked like a soot covered coal miner when I'd finished dumping the tubes into the wieging dumpsters. out of the 2,350 pounds their scales showed I'm sure there was over 100 pounds of dust and debris which they didn't adjust for. And the scale guys put down #2 copper instead of copper-aluminum fin tube, I told the lady that prints the checks and she said 'meh'. 

Whole crew went to the Diamond Cabaret looking like coal miners after we cashed that check. 

I think the bigger the scrap yard the less the guys care. Also maybe because the smaller scraper yards bring their shit to the bigger regional scrap yard which might make it harder to rip of the guys who've already ripped off others and know the real weight. Or maybe the big guys do it aswell and the smaller fish put up getting ripped off on the tarre because they do it to their clients?"

14984,"So I enjoy visiting cemeteries and geocaching, so when the two intertwine I really make a point to check it out.

There’s one near me at the [Historic Pearl River United Methodist Church](http://www.gcah.org/research/travelers-guide/pearl-river-united-methodist-church) which has a cemetery with graves that go back well into the 1800s. It’s a really cool place.

Not too far from it is another geocache and a small family cemetery: [Haley’s Forgotten](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c15815a3-b2e6-45f5-b8cd-64ec8d97519e) 

The Haley in this instance is Major David W. Haley who got his rank in the War of 1812 and was an adviser/interpreter for the Choctaw Nation. The Choctaw Nation considered him to be a great ally, to the point that in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek (the final Treaty with the Choctaw that forced their removal), Chief Greenwood LeFlore ensures that Haley would be granted land in the former Choctaw Territory as payment for his assistance.

The Choctaws ended up giving Haley the former homestead of a previous Choctaw Chief, Puckshunubbee, who was a signatory of previous treaties (but had passed away during a journey to Washington a few years earlier).

So this site and family cemetery is a confirmed location of a chief of one of the “Civilized Nations,” which to me means it should have tremendous historical value. I can’t imagine there are many confirmed homes of Native American chiefs.

However, this site is, as the geocache suggests, largely forgotten. In my research, I uncovered that it was [nominated as a Historic Site](https://www.apps.mdah.ms.gov/nom/prop/21129.pdf), but it seems that it wasn’t approved.

This area is also right on the shore of the Ross Barnett Reservoir, which was dammed in 1960 for flood control and recreation. It’s about 100 feet from being submerged and only wasn’t because there’s a natural rise to it (unsurprisingly that a Chief would select such a site). 

I had an entire year of Mississippi History in 7th grade and we spent about a third of the time on pre-statehood history, so we learned a good bit about some of the various chiefs such as Greenwood LeFlore, Pushmataha, and even Puckshunubbee (or at least that he signed other treaties and then passed away), but never knew that his home was literally less than a mile from my house and completely overgrown and used by teens to ride 4wheelers and drink.

Other signatories of those treaties were Andrew Jackson (capitol city named after him), Thomas Hinds (county that Jackson is located in named after him), and Carlos Dinsmoor (another Choctaw ally who has a very large subdivision in the area named after him). Then Greenwood LeFlore has both a city and county named after him. So it’s interesting to me that Haley is just basically a footnote to all of this."

15006,"The big problem with The Day After Tomorrow is that the plot hinges on real weather phenomena that actually exist in real life, and don’t behave anything like they do in the movie. I live in Minnesota, and okay, we don’t get -150 degree temperatures, but we certainly get -60 degree temperatures, and you’ll notice you don’t hear news reports of people freezing solid in 2 minutes (while wearing full winter gear), or glaciers forming, or statewide evacuations, or 50-foot snowfalls (in fact it’s too cold to snow once the temperature drops below zero) or wolf attacks (and we actually HAVE wolves). Nor do tornadoes show up downtown and eat up all the skyscrapers. Don’t these screenwriters know any meteorologists they can consult?

Even if I ignore all that, all the exciting stuff in the movie happens in the first 30-40 minutes. After that, it’s just “group of kids huddling around a fire” alternating with “two dudes trudging through snowdrifts”. Snore. Oh, and a scene where they escape the killer cold by running down a hallway and slamming a door. Lord knows I enjoy lowering my winter heating bills by simply going around the house and slamming all the doors, works like a charm! 🙄

2012, by contrast, is a little campy on purpose while being **completely** over the top. We don’t have sections of the coast cracking down to the mantle, and nobody’s been around to see what it looks like when the Yellowstone caldera explodes, so apart from “special neutrinos” nobody has to worry about getting it wrong. Plus, 2012 has better pacing and better character development. The kids aren’t even annoying. (I think my metric for “most annoying kids in the history of film” is a tie between pod-racing Anakin Skywalker and both kids in the Tom Cruise “War of the Worlds” remake. By the end of the movie, you just want to feed both those brats to the fucking aliens.) And all the characters have some good points and bad points, they aren’t just two-dimensional sketches that are obviously Good or Bad. Everyone is a jerk at some point and a good person at other points."

I don't know how old I was (maybe 12), but I once found a ""sex line"" which was sort of free. You could call the number from a phone booth, without having to put in coins, and get through and have conversations with other people the ""sex line"" chooses for you (who were calling into the number at the same time, waiting for connections), conversations mainly being of sexual nature, since the ""sex line"" was advertised under the naughty category. There was a chance you might have still gotten billed phoning that number from your home hardline though (as one of my friends was bitching about exactly that, having been shat on by his parents). Anyway, I was a horny boy back then, so I took the chance. Naturally, I never got through to a woman, so I tried it the other way around and, ehm, ""offered"" myself as a girl.  
  
It didn't take me past the first call to get connected to a guy. Now, as a 12-year-old, I haven't had that change in voice yet, so if you wouldn't see whom you were talking to, you would have confused me for a girl. So, I was there, in that phone booth (all by myself, by the way), talking to that guy about what I, the fake girl, was wearing and stuff. The conversation must have gone on for a minute or two, and when I realized where this was going and couldn't, ehm, contribute (because I was after all in a phone booth), I hung up. I never called the number again after, because I found the experience quite boring.  
  
What I learned from it in hindsight is that all girls online and on sex lines are fake, and I realized that by being one.

So this was a giant class on a subject I LOVED and was already knowledgable about, and I knew for a fact that most kids in there were only taking it because they thought it would be easy.

Well, it turns out that even though 450 of those 500 kids thought it was an ezpz class, 49 of those kids were music majors who had background not only in EDM but also every other kind of music known to man. I was incredibly naïve to think my knowledge of this specific genre would propel me past people who already knew the whole history of music... because this was a history of music class! One of the students was also a real DJ who had a day of lecture dedicated to talking about his contributions. I wish I remembered who it was, but I don't. He did get up and spin for us during the lecture, which was cool.

In all likelihood you're still pretty drunk, and your liver has been working on dealing with all of that alcohol. And now you've thrown two grams of acetaminophen on top of all that alcohol and your liver just can't process it and next thing you know you're in hideous pain and on your way to the hospital.

15224,"The story of the heavy iron plow! I remember learning about this in  a Western Civilization class and it blew my mind.

Around 9000 BCE/the Neolithic period, the growing population was largely either hunter gatherer tribes or were attempting settling as farmers. Yet there weren't enough natural resources to keep up with the population. Naturally, when nomadic tribes of hunter gatherers weren't able to get what they needed they would raid farms making things even more difficult for farmers who already struggled to feed themselves on top of producing enough crops to make a living. 

Then along came the plow which revolutionized farming and essentially birthed large towns and cities as we know them today. These massively heavy livestock powered plows were able to dig way way down into the soil to bring up nutrients and greatly increased the farmers yield and made it possible to reasonably process much larger fields than could ever be done by hand. But like all technology it came with a cost. 

A heavy iron plow needed anywhere from 4-8 oxen to pull. Plus the cost to have a local smith craft a plow (as well as the cost of all that iron) was incredibly expensive for these failing farmers. So farmers were forced to pool together their funds and healthy livestock in order to obtain and operate a plow essentially creating farming communities. As they continued to be able to cover more acreage and process more and more crops they continued to expand their farming territory.  This both meant they were a growing target for raids, so the communities would form local militias or even pool savings to hire guards/strongmen etc to protect their crops and homes. 

These growing communities also suddenly had enough crops to sell and trade which meant expanding trade lines and more importantly developing a local economy. Before long markets popped up, which later developed into townships and even in some cases cities which drew all sorts of people with power or aristocrats. 

So farmers and their families were healthier, continued to grow in numbers, became secure, and overall were successful, while the nomadic hunter/gatheres fizzled out or were absorbed into the farming communities (as farmers, other professions, or as the previously mentioned security roles or militia) essentially establishing some of the first of western civilizations. All thanks to a super heavy piece of iron that ox would drag around!

TL:DR: Plows revolutionized agriculture but required farmers (who were prior to this pretty much starving to death or getting shafted by hunter/gatheres) to pool together resources to buy and operate them. Eventually the communities were producing enough crops to sell, which created trade lines and marketplaces which later developed into some of the first even towns and cities in the west. "

Drugs are everywhere but in order to buy them you have to know somebody. If you know somebody then you're probably already hanging with a pretty shady crowd. Same thing but more extreme goes for selling them, you have to know somebody who can find drugs in bulk. Which means you have to know an even shadier crowd. Take the drugs you found from your connections to really shady people and sell them to your only kind of shady connections. That's how a lot of people get started. It's also the reality that the longer you sling the more likely you are to be caught. So only people who have no hopes for their future, or people who are too dense to think about their future, or people who are dangerously desperate for money choose to do it for any length of time. Some people go about it very carefully and some people are harmless like your college stoner who only deals green to their friends.

15413,"One night when I was living alone for University, I woke up in the middle of the night to pee (which in itself is a bit of a rare occurrence for me). 

As I left the bathroom I was made to jump out of my skin as someone knocked on my apartment door. I looked through the peephole to see my girlfriend, who lived in the apartment building next door. 

Apparently the fire alarm had been triggered in her building &amp; had to be evacuated. However in the panic she left her phone &amp; room key inside her room. So was left with little alternative than to come crash at my place. 

Adding more to the coincidence, she headed along the street to my building behind a group of 3 people - there was nobody else on the street. These 3 people lived in my building, so she was able to get through the secure gate and door into my 'block'. During this time, the intercom telephones were not working properly. So if she had not managed to get through the gate &amp; to the door of my apartment she would have literally been stuck outside all night, with no way of contacting me. 

Quite luckily, my bladder had awoken me at the exact time that she arrived at my flat. "

15479,"So I read an interesting case study on this issue many years ago, and basically it said, ""no."" The case was German legalization and regulation of sex work, and what they found was that traffickers would bring E. European women into the Schengen Area, then take their passports so they couldn't leave and traffic them across W. Europe, moving them from place to place to avoid detection. 

My partner works in this area and there are similar issues in the United States around trafficked women/girls (U.S. states instead of EU nations, but still). 

There's a whole system of code used to communicate among interested parties, and traffickers congregate at major events where they're likely to find clients. (Sturgis is a big one.) In truth, it's very hard to interdict trafficking if you have free movement of people in an area. Numerous groups are trying to help, from [the Polaris Project](https://polarisproject.org/policy-legislation) and their data collection and trafficking hotline, to the Department of Justice's efforts to train up local police departments to recognize telltale signs of trafficking and identify trafficked people, especially youths. 

I'm a pretty liberal dude, but regulation and legalization are often treated as panaceas when the issue is quite a bit more complicated. "

The “Alphas” in this unit are naturally the Matriarch and Patriarch of the pack, and the rest of their offspring. The Alpha/Beta terminology is—in this case—unecessary: Adolescents are always subordinate to their parents. 




The alpha thing does hold 100% true in other species though, including some primates. Chimpanzees for example, tend to follow an Alpha male. Bonobos on the other hand follow an Alpha female. 



Gorilla troops of course have the whole “Silverback” thing going on, with a troop consisting of a dominant older male and several females, adolescents, and occasionally younger/weaker adult males. This is more similar to the Wolf pack structure than it is tho the traditional “Alpha/Beta” idea though. "

15575,"It is dude. It's very real thing, but I disagree with the term ""toxic masculinity"" because the descriptor to me is inaccurate. Toxic Masculinity implies that certain aspects of masculinity are toxic, which I disagree with. 

The things that are commonly attributed to toxic masculinity like bottling up or ignoring emotions, using anger or violence to deal  with your problems, dominating others, and misogyny are not traits of a masculine man. These are traits attributed to men that are so insecure (or devoid) of masculinity that they project these negative traits to overcompensate for the lack of masculinity that they are insecure about. Unfortunately they don't realize that masculinity is ultimately being a good man. The pinnacle of masculinity begins with confidence, strength, and character; but using those things in a morally righteous manner. It's having empathy and a devotion to self-improvement, it's humility and a desire to protect, inspire, and elevate the people and the world around you. But due to the nature of their toxic behavior they are impeding themselves from realizing their true potential

I prefer the term psuedomasculinity, because that's exactly what ""toxic masculinity"" is. It's fake masculinity used to hide the complete absence of true masculinity. "

After his death, my dad and all my uncles went nuts, getting in fistfights over Persian rugs, a painting by an elephant, his Marine Corps saber... completely ignored the will. A few months after, I found the collection in my dad's attic. Goddamn I should have taken them right then, but I didn't know then they were actually legally mine so I didn't want to be a dick like the rest of my dad's family by insisting hearsay. I got a copy of the will from my half uncle, next visit lo and behold the coins were gone. I was bawling so, so hard. Composed myself, asked my dad about it, he just pretended like he had no idea and blamed one of his brothers. I didn't have the heart to point out he was executor to me.   


I still feel crushed about it to this day. Gramps told me in '99 it was worth a ""really nice car,"" and he thought his Jaguar was cheap. I'm 100% sure my dad didn't get them appraised right because he got \*real\* quiet when I told him that. I don't care about the monetary value, I just wanted to flip through those binders like my grandpa did, smiling and looking down his nose while humming thoughtfully and thinking about the history those coins saw :( at least he gave me his US coin collection while he was still alive. It's been in a lockbox at the bank since before my parents divorced, bless my mom's foresight... I've been wanting to get it out and add the coins I've accumulated since. If I happen to have a 1926 mercury dime I'd happily send it to you. It's from \*a\* grandpa, not the same but it feels right for me to offer."

When my sister and her boyfriend went to AirBnBs in Rome they bitched that it was dirty. I said ""A duh. That's run by someone who has less hospitality experience than the people on Hotel Hell."" 


Hotels at least have to get approval from the town (and respect zoning laws. The only reason we have a Comfort Suites next to a retirement home is that it was grandfathered in as commercial from past town government. They also employ more people (despite being shifty... like only paying housekeepers for rooms that are cleaned.) and are usually operated by people who have experience in hospitality. 

Yeah I know. there are some like the ones on Hotel Hell that were obviously not run by people who knew what they are doing.

To give some context, this was passage follows a description of the Battle of Breitenfeld, where the Protestant army led by Gustavus Adolphus routed the Imperial army led by Tilly.  This was considered a symbolic turning point in the Thirty Years War.  

The passage was written by C. V. Wedgwood in 1938.

""Two hundred years later, in the liberal nineteenth century, a monument was erected on the field, bearing one significant phrase: 'Freedom of belief for all the world'.  The monument still stands, set back from a quiet country road in the shade of a line of trees.  Three centuries have smoothed every scar from that placid landscape, even as the philosophy of New Germany has submerged the spiritual landmark.  'Freedom of belief for all the world'--forgotten yearning of an age forgotten among men who have no choice but to believe what they are told."""
15718,Do you ever hang around a gymnasium?
15719,"&gt; You can also see the rose/finn subplot as some way of showing the audience ""sometimes even the best intentioned plans don't work out""

I don't get people who say that the subplot didn't make sense, because this seemed to be the entire point of the movie. Sometimes the roguish hero strikes off alone and...fails. Miserably. So yeah, Rose and Finn failed, because the movie was trying to show that sometimes failure happens when you bet it all on the underdog. That was the point of the opening scene. That was the point of the Rose/Finn subplot. That was arguably the point of Luke's subplots. That was the point of Poe's interactions with Holdo. And at the end, the resolution comes when Finn is prevented from essentially committing suicide, because Rose (and the viewer) are supposed to have learned that doing shit like that is just going to mess things up and get people killed without any tangible benefit.

There's an evil guy who runs a big cybersecurity business. He sells a program that promises to protect your network from hackers. In order to drum up business, he hacks companies who _don't_ have the product, so companies will think ""wow, the hackers couldn't hack the people with the security product, we need it too"", and everyone buys it, including the government. But the reason evil guy wanted to get this program on everyone's computers is because it has a backdoor that lets him into the computers of anyone who installs it.

Sandra Bullock's coworker writes a program that accidentally connects to one of the servers the bad guys are running and, like them, gets the power to connect to all these government computers running the backdoor. They find out and kill him by hacking his plane's navigation system so he goes off course and crashes, but they find out he's sent the program to Sandra Bullock, so they go after her too. Because the assassin they send after her is super incompetent, she spends the whole movie evading him, and eventually tricks him into infecting the evil guy's servers with a virus that wipes everything out"

15787,"Social Science Inquiry II &amp; III.

I wasn't expecting to ace them.  That doesn't really happen at the University of Chicago.  But my parents had convinced me it'd be easier than the other sosc classes that fulfilled the common core.  (Something about it being based more in reality and not focused on my prof's feelings about issues.)  Everybody said I'd be fine with the math element because I'd taken AP statistics, and all the course description said was ""some background with statistics helpful, but not a prerequisite for this course.""

The first course in the Inquiry sequence made it seem like that'd be true.  I didn't have to read a bunch of philosophy texts, (I hate philosophy.)  It was interesting.  I could handle the workload.  There was a slight math element that my AP stats class helped with.

Then the second course in the sequence started and they were like, **""Teach yourselves R.  Oh, you first years have never heard of it?  Look it up, download it, and go fuck yourselves.""**

Inquiry had been pitched as a *first year* course, there was *nothing* about using R in the course descriptions.  I'm not sure it was even in the syllabus.  I knew the math behind what we were doing but had *no* background in any kind of programming.  My dyslexia made doing anything in R hell, because there's no ""spell check"" for programming.  Then my computer couldn't handle large data sets and kept crashing every time I tried to do the homework until my professor let me use different data for the assignments.

I couldn't drop, because I was basically locked into the Inquiry sequence at that point.  I fought through 22 weeks of hell, permanently destroyed my sleep cycle, and scraped ""B""s in both classes.  Maybe ""B-""s.  I can't remember."

I couldn't care less about upvotes, but it says a lot about everyone preferring to keep their dream alive instead of realising how completely fucked up that industry is. 

An old aquaintance of mine used to be a male model, a completely non-sexual male photomodel. He once told me how often people would try to pressure him or try to get leverage to force him into stuff he wouldn't do. Then he told me ""imagine how much worse it is for allready sexualised under-20 starter girls who just want to make it so badly"". A lot of them end up in the sex industry before they even know it, and after that your chances to make it as a ""real"" model are less than zero. Dreams ruined, privacy ruined, lessons learned. Have fun being young when that is your first run in with reality.

I knew an ex-ballerina. She told me in the big American ballets rich, famous, well known ""patriarchs of the art"" would pay to have their name embroided in the panties of their favorite ballerina.

For the most part of the 20th century (up until late '70s) Greek history was a bloody mess of wars, political strife, poverty, oppression and suffering. In retrospect, this is not surprising.

15990,"That really depends on you and the person(s) you play the quests with.

A solidly established partnership can be really great.  Having each others' backs, instinctively working in concert.  Knowing there's always someone to help you escape a bad mood or a bad day.

A new relationship can be exciting.  Finding out about another person, discovering the complexities and strangenesses of another real human being.

But those outcomes are pretty much the ideal, the best plausible scenario.  Sometimes you start a relationship quest and find that you and the other player are incompatible in a way that wasn't obvious.  Sometimes feelings get hurt in the process, and even if they aren't, you may regret the time and energy you spent.

It can be great, though.  If you don't have a fair number of people close to you already, I'd definitely recommend it.  Developing a [support network of other players](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/01/18/loneliness-might-be-a-bigger-health-risk-than-smoking-or-obesity/#47a189cc25d1) is one of the best things you can do to extend your playthrough and have fun."

- I may lay out an argument that causes a person to ruminate over a long period of time, eventually resulting in them changing their minds without ever telling me about it. That's fine. I don't have to know for it to have been worthwhile.

- Having the debate in a public space allows for observers who are silent (but still present) and on the fence to be persuaded as well. These people are much more likely to change their minds than the person with a solid stance on the subject.

- In framing my argument and having a back-and-forth debate with someone who holds an opposing view, I may come to the conclusion that my argument isn't as strong as I thought it to be and might eventually be swayed to the other side.

She wasn't home, and the one request she had was for us to turn the air conditioner on as soon as we got there, because the windows were closed and it's a hot Australian summer. She said the remote was in the top drawer of her bedside table. I remember thinking she sounded very seductive as she was talking, but I thought nothing further of it.

Anyway we get to the house, go into her bedroom, open the top drawer to get the air con remote and there was the remote nestled in a drawer full of sex toys. We had a quick laugh, closed the drawer  and got the house ready for the buyer. A few minutes later the seller shows up. She looked a bit surprised when she saw that her agent wasn't alone. She awkwardly said that she had forgotten her purse, went into the bedroom quickly and left house.

16083,"The band Eagles. Yeah, a lot of people obviously know their work, but I feel like it’s not really noticed just how much work they’re known for. 

The group’s first best-of album sold 26 million copies and was the first ever certified platinum album, and is the 2nd best selling album of all time. They sold more albums in the seventies, which was arguably the largest boom in American rock music, than any other American band.  Their past albums by the eighties sold 1.5 million copies a year. 5 number one hits, and another 5 in top 10. They released four consecutive number one albums from 1975-79, which held Billboard chart positions for a total of 27 weeks. 6 Grammys. 5 American Music awards.

Here’s a quick list of all of the first songs of theirs that came to mind that I think most listeners can recall just by the name:

Peaceful easy feeling
Best of my love
Lyin eyes
The long run
Seven bridges road
Take it to the limit
Heartache tonight 
Life in the fast lane 
On the border
Take it easy
Desperado
One of those nights
Tequila sunrise

Oh. And Hotel Fucking California.

I can’t go to a bar for more than a couple hours without hearing one of their songs. Radio stations across the multiple states I’ve driven through all still play multiple tracks by them. I know it could just be because I’m looking for it, but I’ve tried so hard to find any other musical act that isn’t as widely recognized to this day as them.  "

It's alcohol when you're not around.  A lot of alcohol.  They get physically fatigued and agitated when they go too long without alcohol.  Like if you're trying to go out but no restaurant has space or whatever, they start to get more and more shitty and you basically just have to settle for something because they just need a drink.

When you two hang out you get way drunker than you usually do-- every single time.  When you hang out in a group, everyone gets way drunker than they usually do.  You all can't figure out why.

They start conflict out of nowhere.  When you got together you were the sun and the moon.  Suddenly you ask if you look good and they tell you could stand to lose a little weight.  Or you do something nice for them and they start a fight.  This happens all the time now.  You talk about how you need to stop fighting but both of you just can't seem to.

16138,"When I was around 14 years old I was visiting my aunt who lived in the projects in a bad part of town. I went to the basketball court and started playing with some local kids, when another kid came onto the court with a huge metal pipe and just started banging it on the ground, and swinging it around. It was distracting and he was being pretty reckless so we asked him to get off the court so we could continue playing. He cussed at us and kept doing his thing, so I got mad and threatened to kick his ass if he didn't get off the court. He told me to go fuck myself and seeing how he had a weapon, I kinda just sat there fuming, wanting to beat the shit out of him. A few minutes went by and he started to walk off the court so I began walking back to the other kids when I heard a voice say, ""Hey, fuck you motherfucker!"" I turned to see the kid launching the metal pipe right at me. It was like everything was moving in slow motion in that moment. I froze for a second, tried to duck, then everything went black. When I came to, there was a crowd of people around me. All I could see was red, and every time I took a breath, blood gushed from the bridge of my nose. I crawled around looking for my glasses, and someone handed them to me. Then I got up and blindly stumbled back to my aunt's house and banged on the door. She opened it and nearly fainted. Anyway, it destroyed the bridge of my nose and I now have a scar that will be with me for the rest of my life, along with dozens of visits to specialists for breathing/sleeping problems that have affected me ever since. 

One more pretty funny thing. Years later I became best friends with this kid in high school. One day we were walking home, just talking about crazy stories when he told me about this kid that got really fucked up by a kid that threw a metal pipe. Ended up realizing I was that kid, and he was one of the people standing around me when I came to. He told me a group of kids beat up the kid that did that to me and they also smashed all of his windows, so I guess justice was served. "

This big, built guy comes up to us with with this solid sales patter saying he could see we weren’t looking for it at the moment but he sold hash, passes us around a block to check out (it was really good!), told us his name and said he was always in the park and to look for him when we were in the market.  We bought for him many times after that over the course of a summer, maybe two.

Then one day we look for him and he’s leading an anti crack rally (?!). Like, *leading* - speaking, gathering people, starting chants, marching in front through the park. We waited for a lull and approached him because, you know, he’s a drug dealer right? He *angrily* says can’t we see he’s busy and to come back later. It was so striking that he made his living off illegal drugs but was so passionate about crack being a problem he was actually setting aside his own business.  To this day I wonder what happened to that guy.  He had the charisma, smarts and savvy that I can totally see him having gotten out of the dealing game and finding success in some straight gig."

I remember accidentally casually strolling into a porn set. I worked in this loft/warehouse place for some artist somewhere in Brooklyn and was told to return a package to the correct place. I walked up to the place I thought it was. Door was slightly open and I heard people talking/music playing. I knocked, they said come in. I walk in and immediately was like 'lol oh!' They seemed to be on break or just starting as there were 3 naked girls/guys sitting on chairs/couches on their phones while another dude was teaching another girl how to use a camera. I walked in, they said 'sup!', looked at package and realized it was across the hall. I said 'ha guys! got the wrong room, have a good shoot!', they said 'later!' and left. Wasn't phased at all and just shrugged it off.

Things like, ""Don't out people if you meet them outside of kink meetups"" and ""respect other people's space when they're playing"". Oh and the most common safeword is simply ""stop"". But you should have two for severity, ""yellow"" means check in with me and ""red"" means stop, aside from ""stop"" also meaning stop.

I was trying to get into leather working as a hobby and a sex positive site seemed like a good place to learn how to make whips and corsets.

Armies are most frequently used to ""protect national interests,"" which is a diplomatic way of saying they are a goon squad for the country's industry. If the locals are getting uppity about working in slave-like conditions, send the Marines! That will teach them the error of their ways.

Don't wanna take my word on that? Cool. Let's hear from Major General Smedley Butler, who at one time was the highest-ranking officer in the USMC and a *TWO-TIME* recipient of the Medal of Honor (just in case you should go thinking the guy was just some behind-the-lines armchair strategist):

""I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.

I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.

I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.

During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.""

Well it was my first time using uber pool, and I was drunk. So I wanted to save the extra .30 cents and said “1” person, instead of “2”. It was my boyfriend and I. 

So the driver picks us up, no big deal. But now there’s only one spot left, and when we get to the next pick up location there’s two people (I’ll call them the new couple) who are pissed that there isn’t enough room for them. They start cursing and yelling about how they reserved two spots blah blah, and the new couple slams the door. The uber driver freaks out and hops out of the car and starts screaming at the guy for slamming his door and being a dick.

Then the uber driver goes to punch the guy of the new couple in the face, but he ducks, leaving the uber driver to punch the girl. I’m watching this horrified from inside the uber, knowing it’s all my fault. Were in Manhattan and there’s people everywhere, so people come out of the woodwork to scream at and physically restrain the uber driver who just punched a girl in the face accidentally.

So, they automatically start out at a manpower disadvantage. If Moscow was taken, the Soviets would just retreat behind the Urals (where they had moved their military production) and wage a bloody insurgency. There was no way that the Nazis would have been able to hold Russia, especially using the too young and the too old.
If, however, they had aligned themselves with the discontent and oppressed peoples, casting themselves as liberators, using Slavic help to creating client states to provide more manpower/production/petroleum, then maybe, MAYBE, they might have been able to hold Russia. But the Nazis were racist, genocidal, and disorganized, and already delayed in their invasion timetable. It was always inevitable they would lose. "

16298,"**CRUELTY OF BRITISH TO INDIA**

1. General Reginald Dyer shot and killed thousands of innocent people in Jalianwalabagh camp. He kept firing until his ammunition ran out and killing between 379 and 1,000 protesters and injuring another 1,100 within 10 minutes. He made sure to lock the gates of the camp so that no one shall escape. The only escape the people had was well in the middle of the camp where most people jumped and then died to save their life.

2. Between 12 and 29 million Indians died of starvation while it was under the control of the British Empire, as millions of tons of wheat were exported to Britain as famine raged in India.

3. It's true that they built Railways in India but made sure to put a signboard which said: ""DOGS AND INDIANS ARE NOT ALLOWED"". Even Mahatma Gandhi was made to sit on the floor while Britishers were sitting on the cushion.

4. The British plundered looted and stole from us, **2.5 MILLION**  Indians fought for British's war. Imagine fighting someone else's war and dying.

While you people make movies on **Winston Churchill** and speak on how great he was, we Indians spit on him.  Churchill has as much blood on his hands as Hitler does. Particularly the decisions that he personally signed off during the Bengal Famine when 4.3 million people died because of the decisions he took or endorsed and when we insisted all that he said was ""WHY HASN""T GANDHI DIED YET""?

These things aren't mentioned anywhere in the history books. 

There are many more cruelties which I cannot mention. The list will never end.

Edit to clarify: I did not tell the patient about my negative feelings. I processed them by myself and the help of a supervisor. Amongst being angry, there were many more things going through my mind, like doubts whether or not I overlooked something, whether I should have done or said something differently etc. I even felt guilty for going on vacation.

Honestly I think the loud vegans are the ones that have just gotten sick of meat eater's shit.

I'm a bitter vegetarian, sick of so many people trying to start shit just because I don't like to eat animals carcass.

I never even bring it up but people fucking ask me why I pick such specific foods, and then get pissy and act like I told them not to eat meat just by uttering the evil words:

""I'm a vegetarian.""

I can't even vent about this irl (hence why I'm ranting here instead) because everyone would just go ""oh you talk so much about being a vegan, do you ever stop hahaha"" and I can't stand that shit.

I just wish people would leave me and my Quorn in peace, but that would be too easy for them. Instead I have to live through society's total acceptance of people like me being shat on for trying to do something about global warming, or animal suffering, or whatever reason the vegitarian/vegan in question decided was important enough to slightly alter their diet.

Honestly, I'm beginning to wonder if it's projection. If those kids in school who held me down and forced sandwich meats on my face and in my mouth were just so fucking weak willed they couldn't even concieve of not eating dead animals. If those fuckers who wear the t-shirts about vegans being weak are just trying to cover up how fucking weak _they_ are for being too lazy to make a slight change of lifestyle for the betterment of the world. Because making fun of the people who are trying is easier than working for anything in your miserable life."

I don't know what specific language most or all bot accounts are programmed with, but for the sake of keeping it simple, it doesn't matter.

The person you just responded to you couldn't lay it out any more basic.  In whatever language the programmer is coding in, they set out parameters.  

If a picture of a puppy is a repost and rising fast, the bot script would basically request a reverse image search through any of the dozens of sites that offer it (and remember, the image never even has to be seen or loaded, which would be far too data intensive, it would only search the ""metadata""), if that site is Reddit, the bot scrubs the highest rated comment, and then is given a copy/paste/post command to repost.  Usually this repost would also be contingent on the comment not already appearing in the post from other bots in order to not have literally thousands of the same comments on reposts and out themselves.

We have contingency plans and hypothesis regarding all of these. we discuss the ethics of bringing up these topics with people of power too.

16480,"I know I'm late to the party but the story of Cher Ami is one my favorites.

In the Battle of the Ardennes in WWI a battalion of US soldiers penetrated the German line but the line closed up behind them. They were stuck there for a month. No supplies, limited ammo, and next to no chance of communication save a few dogs and pigeons that got through with them. 

Eventually, after they had been stuck there for a few weeks, a pilot was able to fly over them and write down their position. Problem is biplanes were made of balsa wood and canvas and would have to fly so low and slow that it was easy for the pilots to get hit by rifle fire. The pilot that got their position was hit 4 times in the process. This fucking badass wouldn't quit though. He was able to fly his plane back and land perfectly before he, like a gentleman, promptly died. 

The folks at the landing strip checked his body and found that he was able write down some coordinates before he perished. Obviously he wrote down the coordinates of the German line so they should and did train all of their artillery on that position. Next thing our boys that were stuck behind the line knew they had every possible piece of hell fire the US and British forces could muster raining down on them. 

They only had one pigeon left, Cher Ami. They wrote a note, put it in the canister attached to her leg, and sent her off with their last hope of ending this  maelstrom of death. She flew her little heart out. She was shot 4 times, just like the pilot, but still managed to make it back to he hole. She was missing one leg and the other was hanging on by a tendon. Luckys the one hanging on by the tendon had the canister on it. It informed the US and British forces that they were firing on the soldiers stuck behind the Ling and those soldiers would really like it if they stopped. The barrage quickly came to an end. 

For her bravery Cher Ami was then nursed back to health, retired, and awarded the French Croix de Guerre. She is the only nonhuman to be awarded that medal. After she died she was taxidermied and donated to the Smithsonian Institute. She is currently in the display about US soldiers in WWI at the National Museum of American History without her medal and only with the note that she was a carrier pigeon. 

I have accidentally gathered a small crowd while telling this story to friends and family this story at that museum a few times. One time some asked me where I read that from in the display and I had to just say I was a big fan of that pigeon and knew that story off the top of my head. This was also off the cuff so I might have gotten some details wrong but here's the wiki if any of you are interested!

16500,"Great comment, I'd just like to add a few thing to your Dutch example. The Revolt was led by William of Orange. He held the position of *stadthouder*, the highest representative of the king in a region. After the Spanish king was ousted, the position of *stadthouder* remained. This position is not comparable to a king/president, but it was definitely a leadership role in the country.  The office was somewhat elected, but you can't call that democracy. The elites of each province chose their own *stadhouder* out of the nobility. It just so happened that they always chose a guy from the Orange family. The office always had been for life. 

It was a powerful political position in the country, but nowhere near as powerful as a king. To illustrate this: there were two long periods where there was no *stadthouder*. 

Then William III of Orange happened. He strengthened the office and consolidated his power so much it was beginning to look like a monarchy. Which might have a lot to do with the fact that he was also king of Great Britain (Glorious Revolution). Then Napoleon came along and he kicked the monarchists out. After the final defeat of Napoleon the kingdom of the Netherlands was formed as a strong buffer state (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg combined), with William I of Orange as king. The Belgians didn't like it and revolted in 1830 and chose their own king."

We would sell one box at twice the price we bought it (but still less than the local stores) and then open the other box and split all the cards.  So each time we did it we got at least 360 good cards each (Since every pack had at least one).

16576,"Well, let's slow our roll a little here.  Yes, people get a little too excited over this information and start thinking it is a free pass.  Yes, that's silly.  At the same time, a small time drug dealer who reports ""other income"" is almost certainly never going to warrant more investigation unless they are claiming deductions.  It won't save your butt from getting caught but you are not any more likely to be caught through that method anyway.  You'd need enough drug income to start increasing your likeliness of being audited.

On that note, never claim deductions for drug income ever.  Although the supreme court has ruled that in general you are allowed to claim deductions for expenses incurred in committing crime as long as you can argue it is a business, there are specific rules laid out that prevent you from getting deductions involved in the trafficking of drugs that are illegal.  It's actually a huge problem for businesses that sell marijuana in states that it is legal because it is still illegal federally so they can't claim any deducations."

I was offered almost anything you can think of, really, but the strangest thing I was offered was a bag of ""Cakes of Light"" and a copy of The Book of the Law by Aleister Crowley in exchange for 1/8th of an ounce of top shelf Snoop's Master Kush. I was unable to take the donation, and only later learned exactly what was entailed in the recipe for cakes of light.

Same patient offered a different budtender a vial of her own menstrual blood - something she called a phylactery - and promised to perform a sex magick ritual for him, without his participation, for the same amount of the same strain.

16761,"I honestly don’t know for sure, but I’m thinking the prevalence of sex trafficking in Atlanta is probably related to the status of Hartsfield-Jackson airport as the most heavily flown international airport in the United States. I would be really surprised to hear that it stemmed from cam site operations like the one this poster is describing. Like your citation indicates, I would think that impoverished women are flown internationally into the hub and dispersed from there. 

I live in Atlanta and the airport has a lot of signage about recognizing victims of human trafficking, and I know that trafficking increases significantly for large sports events like the Super Bowl, and I’m guessing that’s the case on a national level as well. Your citation seems to suggest that it is mostly based in forced prostitution advertised on Facebook and similar venues, or in massage parlors. I think a cam site like the one described would honestly be too conspicuous to operate on that large of a scale without attracting attention. The girls in the story have too much opportunity to communicate with each other and it would only take one to speak out in order to tank the whole thing."

I'd even chat with them about the weather or something and while it wasn't best friends or anything, I could at least nod at people.

In the more affluent neighborhood, you almost never saw anyone unless they were walking their dog and you might say a quick hi, but they'd never linger and chat.

The problem with glomping at cons was that too many people were doing it a little too enthusiastically and without warning, which sometimes resulted in injury (from essentially being tackled or caught off-balance) or cosplay damage. There was a “con horror story” thread here a while back where at least a couple of people reported suffering twisted ankles and such from aggressive glomping.

I’ve cosplayed at a few cons, nothing too fancy but if I was dressed as a character from a currently popular anime, I would without fail have multiple people approaching me asking for a hug from their “favorite character”.  Which is almost always fine, if they ask! Now imagine someone basically leaping on you without your permission to achieve the same thing."

16987,"Not every animation studio is exploitative, and many of them are actually quite good. Besides that, studios that handle hentai are probably not quite as bad as general anime studios.

The problem with bigger studios, is that many of them still operate on late 60s, early 70s schedule practices of ""release a new episode every week"". Hentai studios don't put out nearly the volume that a full-fledged anime studio would.

Hentai is still less exploitative than live action porn, and doujinshi are usually much less so, since they're self-published.

Also, if I may make a recommendation, Locon is my favorite doujin artist."

""If you’ve ever lived in a food desert, you know what they are without my having to explain it to you. A food desert is an entire neighborhood, a place segregated by poverty and race, with nowhere to find cheap and healthy food. Food deserts are when adequate nutrition is absent in your community and you need a car to get to a real grocery store. It’s when the closest thing to fresh produce is Cheeto-dusted pork rinds. It’s when food is fast food and ordering off the McDonald’s dollar menu on your corner makes more sense than five dollars in bus fare and an hour in traffic just to get to a quality supermarket. It’s when a liquor store with a spinning bulletproof-glass cash register to pay for cigarettes and Skittles is your version of Whole Foods.""

School bus drivers, most of them over 50, in the industry since Jesus went to school. We couldn't keep a manager to save our lives, because the corporate level was so oppressive.

Suddenly this F550 with a light bar, duallies, and a lift that put it higher than a sedan was tall showed up in the parking lot. 

This kid was 24, grew up in Texas (we're in the Northwest), and swore he served as a Marine for 7 deployments in Afghanistan over 3 years. He became lot manager.

Locked management away from drivers, banned drivers from the main building, wrote people up for being 3 minutes late after they stood in line for 5 minutes to clock in. Told us you could only go to the bathroom on your own time. We received a 'memo' every day with reminders on his expectations. We had to ask to get keys and books, only got them when clocked in, and had no time to maintain them (which is driver's #2 duty).

We went from a shop that wrote 2 grievances a year to 25-40 a week. 

Then he started firing. Anyone he thought was an agitator. Told us go find new jobs if we didn't like him. Fired the five trans people. Aimed for the LGB people. 

All in 5 months.

It's been 3 years. They still haven't recovered. Morale is still low, management can't regain the pre-Nazi connection with drivers. Had a 2 week strike last year. Corporate came in and fired the regional management. They can't hire to save their lives.

I never understood the power of good management until I saw what happened. Sure as hell made the Union stronger though."

Doesn't matter. They're still afraid, they're still being abused and humiliated when they thought they were signing up for something more vanilla. They're still being traumatized. It doesn't matter if laws are being broken (which, again, we're pretending, because believe it or not lots of people get away with doing illegal things) because something that's morally wrong is still happening. If I trick you into signing a contract that says I give you $1000, but there's a sneaky little loophole where I legally get to kick you in the balls, I'm still an asshole. No laws are broken, but I'm still in the wrong.

That is where you discuss signals and limitations. She is not new to the business. She knows how it works, and the reason for this pre shoot interview is **specifically** to avoid this situation. They do that interview and she doesnt arrange anything like this. Her and the director discuss what to do if she wants to stop. She indicates very clearly that she understands.

It takes MANY jumps in logic to explain anything other than ""she lied"". And even with those situations (she discusses *different* signals *off camera* and avoids mentioning them at the appropriate time AND refuses to use the simple agreed upon signals which were literally any word, etc.), she is basically, actively doing everything possible to avoid communicating her desires.

I’ve recently started an internship at a large company. Part of what I want to do there is network, find departments I’m interested in and jobs I could see myself doing, and then see if I can get my foot in the door to a decent job there. But this means actually meeting my coworkers - going to company events, venturing beyond the walls of my office, talking to complete strangers, writing emails! I *hate* writing emails!! But I know that the more people I meet, and the more I learn here, the better my chances are of catching the next rung in the ladder. I’ve got a tendency to avoid those conversations, but I’m starting to realize that I actually have to reach for the next rung in the ladder if I want to have any hope of making it. Perhaps this is a rare or specific case and this isn’t how it is IRL — I wouldn’t know, I’m very new to the workforce. But that said, I’m starting to find that my comfort zone is holding me back more than I thought. I’ve got friends who are more assertive and more chatty and more willing to email out of the blue, and one by one they’re landing positions, and I’m looking back now and realizing what they’ve been doing that I’m not.

I had a dude who worked at a toys r us get me all kinds of toys for my little sisters Xmas and bday. I had strippers who would let me turn their houses into trap spot for product. Honestly if it was worth something I’d take it. The weirdest for me was an offer of a dog which I took because it was neglected and I rescued him and got that pupper to a great home. 

The absolute WORST was a mother who was addicted to pills who offered up her 14 year old daughters virginity, I was so disgusted and upset I called the police and told them a women was pimping out her other two underage daughters. Police came and arrested her and had her three daughters and son put in foster homes and I’ve seen them in Facebook and are they much better off. I spoke to the oldest a year or so ago and she knows it was me who called the police she cried tears of joy when she told me and gave me the biggest hug and couldn’t thank me enough from saving her sisters from that evil fucking women. 

I got robbed one time by a childhood friend and I was ducked up pretty bad. I had enough respect and connections from people some guys went looking for him found the kid and had me meet them wayyy out in the country on some backroads and wouldn’t tell me why just saying it would be worth my while and I wouldn’t be disappointed. I showed up to the guy who jumped me stripped down to his boxers in the middle of the woods tried to a tree and bloody as hell covered in piss from him pissing himself. I took a few licks on him got his ATM card and went and emptied out his bank account and we came back and he was obviously still tied to that tree 24 hours later. We untied him stripped him naked and told him to start walking. He was easily 40-50 miles from home in the middle of nowhere, came to find out he was charged with indecent exposure and went to jail for a few months. 

I had a gym rat who was heavily addicted to yayo thawas I would throw bags to him once in a while if someone hadn’t paid up and tried to run on me, which bothered me when people tried to stiff me because I would always tell people I fronted product to that if they couldn’t pay to just contact me and keep me updated and maybe we would work out a payment plan. I said I’ll never get mad at someone if they can’t pay if they show me they’re making an effort and aren’t going to ghost me. People learned from stories that it was a bad idea. 

One time we had a nitrous tank at an after hours party/rave back in the day I had two girls offer to blow me at the same time if I would let them have unlimited balloons that night. I turned them down but ended up getting head from them regardless. They call Nitrous hippy crack for a reason man. 

Too many stories to list or remember. If anyone has questions or wants to know something about the game( ie selling drugs lifestyle) I’d be happy to give you some answers to the best of my abilities. If remember some better stories by tomorrow I’ll update this post with more. 

Edit: I was offered a ghost gun by someone for product once. I took it and sold it to some of the dudes I knew down in the hood in Detroit because a ghost gun are these guns that look 100% real but are made my a person and they would put a serial number that doesn’t exist in any registry. So if you wanted to to go shoot and or kill someone. You could be all Godfather and just drop the gun right there and so long as it had no finger print it. "

17102,"I'm curious what people think of my reason: It's not because I like kids.  Honestly, I'm pretty resistant any time I'm asked to spend time with my niece, more than I feel good about.  I want kids some day (hopefully having a life in better order will help me be more willing to do things I don't want to by then) because I want the responsibility.

17105,"I have to add to this, my dealer was my best friend we hung out legit every day for well over a year, i'm his kids god parent and he only sold to me, I got this junker van for $350 from some weird ass hippie woman who was going to be a phish groupie, she bailed out and left it full of her junk, legit to the ceiling with random stuff home made cloths and a single shoe box of personal items like birthday cards and stuff (promised to be back for it in 3 weeks for $50 off the price), only got contacted 8 months later after I threw it out)
I couldn't do anything with the van due to it being full and needing repairs, I didn't have a license yet and couldn't find the title in that mess. My dealer was about to become a dad and needed a bigger vehicle he was willing to fix up. The downpayment was an ounce and a half of sour D my favourite purchased just for me. 

Turns out he didn't want to put the work in and in my effort to find the owner before the lady I got it from (I figured she never even got the title transferred) I became friends with original owner (some big single guy in his 60's) who wrote me a notice of sale for me. Well he mentioned he missed the van (while smoking my downpayment weed with me) so I told my buddy and he sold it back to the original owner.

He sold it for 800 to the hippy, I sold it for 450 (put a battery in so I made like $2 plus half an ounce of weed give or take)

dealer sold it for 500. we all made a small profit and smoked a TON of weed in the process. God bless small towns. "

17117,"The US Army and the Wehrmacht fought on the same side in at least one battle during WWII.


The Battle of Castle Itter occurred two days before Germany surrendered. Castle Itter was used as a satellite prison for the Dachau concentration camp to hold high profile prisoners, such as resistance leaders and the French prime minister. The Waffen-SS guards, fearing for their lives, had abandoned their posts. The French prisoners staged a breakout and raided the armory, but were besieged by an SS Panzer division that was sent to retake Castle Itter. Two messengers successfully ran the SS blockade and delivered urgent requests for help. 


The Americans sent a heavy armor division that was repelled by German artillery fire, and only a small contingent was able to reach the castle. Meanwhile, the second messenger got in contact with the Austrian Resistance, who sent a small relief force accompanied by a group of Wehrmacht soldiers who threw their lots in with the Allies. 


The Americans, Austrian Resistance, and the Wehrmacht reached Castle Itter around the same time. They joined the French prisoners, and attempted to hold the castle under the leadership of a turncoat SS officer. 

Vastly outnumbered, outgunned, and dangerously low on ammunition, the Americans, Wehrmacht, Austrian Resistance, and French prisoners teamed up for a desperate last stand against the encroaching SS Panzer division. They successfully held the castle under heavy fire as an American infantry regiment fought their way to Castle Itter, racing against the clock to reach the defenders before their ammo ran out. 


They succeeded. The American 142nd Infantry Division overran the Waffen-SS division, took them all prisoner, and rescued the defenders. Only one defender died in the course of the battle. "

17152,"I was working as an engineer contractor for a plant that was starting up. The facility was a mess due to mismanagement of time and funds. The design of the plant had been severely ""value engineered"" so what was left never worked or broke often. Due to the issues operating any equipment, the start up was way behind schedule. The contracted management company refused to communicate this to the upper management, so instead they lied about the state of the facility while pushing all employees and contractors to meet unrealistic deadlines for execution. We're talking approving drawings for things that weren't built yet, operating machinery not hooked up to utilities, etc etc. 

The company I worked for was well aware that this place was extremely unsafe as well as unrealistically demanding. We were all working 12 hour days with no weekends off, killing ourselves to make people happy that were NEVER happy. My manager was a great guy who went to bat for us, standing up to the facility management and higher ups in our company, and eventually we were all guaranteed that at the end of our current contract, we were ALL gone. No extensions, no one stays. 

Well, two weeks before the end of our contracts, when we all start to see the light at the end of the tunnel, an announcement is made that half of our team would be leaving the site effective immediately, and the other half would be extended for another two months. My manager got in a shouting match with the management company director and was barred from returning to site.

Two people quit in that same day. I quit three weeks later. It was basically a signal that our company neither valued our time or our safety, and every one of us that stayed lost all interested in killing ourselves for those people.

17159,"That's because virtual particles don't exist. They are just a mathematical artifact of a particular method of solving equations in quantum mechanics. Here's a simple way to think about it: 4 apples - 2 apples = 2 apples. But I can just as easily write 4 - 2 + 9 - 5 + 3 - 7 = 2 apples. All those extra numbers are ""virtual apples"" which are perfectly mathematically valid but don't have any real physical manifestation. I think a lot of popsci videos on YouTube are doing people a disservice by not even attempting to explain some of the math. 

Really any effect from virtual particles ultimately comes from quantum fields interacting, it's just that the particular mathematical trick we use to solve them gives rise to mathematical terms that look like particles do. But they are not measurable and not real things, in a physical sense. "

Besides that, you can’t compare third world sex tourism destinations like the DR with developed countries. People don’t just go there for the prostitutes — they go there because it’s a fraction of the price of the US. 

I firmly believe that the study would have found that places where law enforcement efforts are greatest against human trafficking have the least amount if it regardless of whether prostitution is legal or not. Its unforgivable to ignore that control factor. 

Both prostitution and human trafficking have increased considerably over the last few decades as hiring prostitutes has become more socially acceptable. "
