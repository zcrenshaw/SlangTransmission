I slowly ascended upwards to start at the top and work my way down with the lift.
About halfway down Im passing a window and a rather large old man is stark naked standing up and watching tv,

We make eyecontact, and Im not sure if anyone here has ever operated a lift but they're not known for their speed, so for what felt like an eternity we stare at eachother as I slowly glide past his window, serenaded by the hum of the crane.

9,"My narcissistic mother and I have a... strenuous relationship at best. We were in an intense argument (read: her attacking and verbally abusing me while I sat quietly and occasionally tried to calmly get her to start thinking logically again) once while I was in a depressive state and she said something that finally made me snap and confess to cutting. She paused, looked straight through my teary eyes and into my soul, and said ""what, because your sister does?"" 

Normally, I'd brush something like that off- it's an absolutely predictable thing for her to say. But the combination of my extreme vulnerability at that moment and her cold and calculated malice (she knew *exactly* how much it would hurt) wounded me to my very core and made me feel worthless and fake like nothing else has. She effectively stripped me of my individuality using the one thing that was helping me cling to what little control over my life I had left. You don't realize the amount of faith you put in your parents until all (and I mean ALL) of it is taken from you.

I was standing with my husband at the side of the room - but apparently not far enough to the side - and we were expecting our oldest when I felt a big kick and moved his hand I was holding to the top of my tummy so he could feel, too.  He grinned and gave me a big peck on the lips.  I didn't think about it until an older relative  casually chatted with us and wanted to ""show me the cake"" and mentioned that people had started watching us instead of the bride... I was really embarrassed, because I was young and didn't think about it being any big thing, but I was grateful to said relative for handling it with tact."

56," I'm going to this 3 day music festival and knew I was gonna take a pretty heavy dose of acid. So I brought this watermelon with me to eat while high cause I knew it's be a good snack. Well I just threw it in the corner of my tent for the first 2 days and didn't think much of it, since I leave watermelons on my counter for days at a time and they're fine. Well I didn't think about how my counter isnt in the sun nor 95¬∞F.


Fast forward, I'm tripping hard and I'm exhausted from dancing and walking around. I remember my watermelon and I'm so excited. I run to my tent, grab my melon, pull out my switch blade to cut out a big slice. Immediately when I stab it thick, hot liquid starts rocketing out of my melon. My high brain comes to the conclusion and utter fear that I am in fact not holding a melon and some how managed to stab a small animal or something - because why would my precious watermelon do something like that. 


Turns out the sun essentially cooked my melon and it caused the pressure to build up. I tried to eat some of it but it tasted both carbonated and alcoholic. I was devastated - my snack! Anyways, my homie gave me a strawberry papaya to eat instead.

As I had hoped, this calmed him down, and, because stuttering only gets worse with the speaker's stress, he was able to get through his request.  From that point, all of his calls were directed to me when I was on.

Mine did. They never taught me how to make professional or practical phone calls. They never taught me banking. They never taught me how to take care of myself. Hell, they never taught me how to put gas in a car. When the time came to do those things, they mocked me for not knowing.

Nah, OP, I think your parents were so obsessed with the superficial idea of ""taking care of your future,"" that they forgot to take care of YOU. 

What's worse is that it sounds like that when they thought their job was ""done"" (getting their kid into a good college!) they checked out entirely, like mine did.

87,"Also, Sean Connery was offered to perform the execution first, but he didn't understand how the guillotine worked."
88,"I posted this before, but here are my thoughts on what is the worst popular book I've ever read:

God I fucking hate this book. I would rather read all the Fifty Shades and Twilight books than try to slog through READY PLAYER BULLSHIT again. If 'Cringe' were a genre, READY PLAYER ONE would be it's fucking ULYSSES.

The writing is abysmal. Ernest Cline has maybe the most awkward style of writing I've ever seen in any work of popular fiction. I'm going to let this paragraph from the opening scene speak for itself (the footnote is the authors own):

&gt; Halliday is at a high-school dance being held in a large gymnasium. He's surrounded by teenagers whose clothing, hairstyles, and dances moves all indicate that the time period is the late 1980s.* Halliday is dancing, too-something no one ever saw him do in real life. Grinning manically, he spins in rapid circles, swinging his arms and head in time with the song, flawlessly cycling through several signature '80s dance moves. But Halliday has no dance partner. He is, as the saying goes, dancing with himself.

&gt; *Careful analysis of this scene reveals that all of the teenagers behind Halliday are actually extras from various John Hughes teen films who have been digitally cut-and-pasted into the video.

Shortly after that passage there is an extended description of the funeral scene from the movie Heathers. In those two brief moments you get an idea of how lazy Ernest Cline is as a writer. He lacks the ability to accurately describe seemingly simple things like the way thing looks or to create anything expansive and instead cuts and pastes every single pop-culture reference he can to create some sort of story. His dialogue is even more awkward than his exposition, people call each other things like 'suck ass', 'pussy', and 'noob' while having stilted arguments about whether Ladyhawke is better than the Ewok TV movies.

Let's get into the pop-culture references for a second. When I think about pop-culture, I think about watching MST3K as a teenager and searching the Internet to find out what some of the jokes these guys were saying was referencing. Slowly a whole new world of culture was opening to me because of that show and I found some really obscure shit that would stick with me for years. Ernest Cline's idea of a pop-culture reference is going 'he had a Millenium Falcon and that guy had a Batmobile, oh and there was Howard the Duck'. No subtly, nothing that delves any deeper into the 80s/90s/00s culture than Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, at a certain point reading about those things loses it's novelty and it becomes white noise.

The writing is also bizarrely repetitive. Do you know how many times he describes how Halliday is obsessed with 80s pop-culture, videogames, movies, and books? Almost that exact phrasing was repeated, in the 200 pages I read, at least 5-6 times. The timeline is incredibly inconsistent, unless we're to believe Wade is some sort of savant with the best memory of any human being ever. He makes reference to reading every single book from every popular horror/fantasy/sci-fi writer of the 80s, watching every popular TV show and movie multiple times (including entire runs of The Simpsons and even stuff like Growing Pains), and playing every 80s video game (except for Nintendo...curiously absent). However, it goes beyond that, he not only consumes these things on a casual basis, he memorizes them all to a photographic degree. You think I'm lying? The solution to one of the keys involves acting out verbatim, line by line, a semi-popular 80s movie. That's fine, maybe he had the time to do this because he's older? He's fucking 17 years old. He never describes any sort of method for doing all this at an accelerated pace, he just passes it off as 'when you live in a trailer, you have a lot of free time'.

What's the pay off for finding this treasure? Billions of dollars for our hero? He describes what he would do with the money in the book and it's the most absurd, poorly thought out plan to save humanity in existence. Without spoiling much, it involves creating new technology to travel beyond our galaxy and explore space, something out of Star Trek. I get it though, this a sci-fi novel and that might be possible, but it's absolutely not because otherwise the world wouldn't be a dumpster fire full of a handful of rich people while the rest of humanity plays a video game so that one of them (and only one of them) could win billions of dollars.

The worst part? The sheer amount of people who recommended this piece of shit book to me. The fact that it has 4.3 stars on Goodreads based on over 500,000 fucking reviews. For contrast, DUNE has 4.2 stars based on the same amount of reviews. That means that according to over half a million idiots, READY PLAYER ONE is marginally better than DUNE."

110,"My friend was hired on as a manager for an apartment complex and got me a job as ""The Guy who Fixes Stuff"". So he takes care of the tenants and I make sure their sinks and bathrooms work, also mow the lawns, pick up trash, etc... We both get free rooms plus really good pay (owner of the complex is an awesome lady). 

It's a fairly large establishment with twelve buildings and eight apartments in each building. That's a ridiculous ninety-six apartments in total. For the most part my job is super easy. No set hours, work on my own schedule, friends with the tenants, get my own work shed, there's no room for moving up but I can see myself doing this happily for forty more years.

Anyways. Sometimes the tenants are weird, not-so-great, or downright terrible. My buddy tries to weed out the bad ones but some slip past. The worst/weirdest two examples are as follows...

1. Young lady going to college in the area who had her apartment paid for by her parents. Always getting noise complaints (these rooms are borderline NASA approve sound-proof so that's not easy to accomplish), complaints about tossing trash out her front door, moving around other people's outside stuff (which is just a dick move), and having pedestrian traffic in and out of her apartment at all hours of the night (usually of the loud and rowdy kind). After a semester we assumed she would flunk out of college but this T-800 disguised as a cute college freshman made it onto the damn Deans List. So my buddy goes over the courtesy rules with her (beyond the regular troubles she never missed a payment) and it does calm down a bit. Only for me to get word that her dishwasher is broken. So I set up a schedule to go by and fix it nine months later (joking, joking, got to it the next day) and open the bad-boy up while she's at college. Fucking thing is full of condoms. Of every color of the rainbow. At least two dozen different condoms were jammed into the blades of different colors, sizes, and brands. I have no idea why there were two dozen condoms in her dishwasher but I took a pair of tongs from my toolkit (you learn what tools you need pretty quickly with this job) and got them all out. On my way out of her apartment her neighbor was waiting for me and started getting nosey about what was going on. And let it slip that a bunch of guys had been ushered into her place late last night. So yeah. Orgy/Gangbang clean-up wasn't part of my original job description but whatever. She moved out in her Junior year but still goes to college and still makes Deans List. 

2. Another lady moved in with her two kids and everything was fine at first. Then she got a... well, let's call him a Dave. So this Dave basically moves in with her without going through the proper channels. By the time my buddy figured it out a few weeks had passed. And it became pretty clear when I was summoned to fix a broken ceiling light. And when I say broken I don't mean a bad bulb, it looked like someone took a baseball bat and just started slamming it into the ceiling where the light was. I was half-right, it was a broom handle. This Dave psycho had gotten drunk and angry and just went to town on the light because he wanted to make a point to her. Whatever, I don't mess with that, told my buddy and he worked out the rest. But when I went to fix the light (replace the entire fucking fixture, that's right people, pro-bono self-trained electrician at your service, please don't tell anyone I might get fired) I went into the home and immediately noticed that Dave was, for lack on any other redeeming qualities, an artist. Entire place was filled with clay sculptures, paintings, and etc... that Dave made at some studio down-town and brought back here. All of them *crassly* sexual. There was a clay sculpture of a naked woman laid out on her back spreading her labia, a painting of a transsexual masturbating onto a woman dressed in what I presumed to be a shark costume, and it was just all over the place in an apartment with two children. I made a remark about exposing children to this and Dave didn't really understand my comment, and said he needed these here to inspire him. Well, I relayed all of this to my buddy and Dave has since been banned from the property after the lady of the apartment was given an ultimatum between eviction and heart-break. Dave did not however take his ""inspirations"" with him. Those were all placed in black trashbags and tossed in the dumpster by the lady after he left. Despite the temptation to keep one I have a girlfriend and didn't want to go dumpster diving. 

My life is pretty fun.

So my second-grade best friend would bring one of those giant pickles to school every day, and she sat right next to me while she ate it. I asked her a few times to at least not face toward me (thereby blowing pickle fumes in my face) while she ate it, but she said no. So one day, I say, ""I don't understand how you can eat those. Don't you know what they are??"" And she goes, ""No, what?"" And I say, ""They're cow poop! You're eating cow poop!!!""

She 100% believed me and started crying, which brought the teachers over, who gave me detention. But at least I did know what a pickle was- I was just a seven-year-old, being a dick."

Most surgeons don't specialize in plastic surgeon level repair (some plastics docs actually tattoo their patients themselves, in particular fake nipple tats after a mastectomy) but a tattoo usually makes them try harder.

Depends wildly on the doc and whether the surgery is emergent or not. Most trauma people are just trying to put you back together, not make sure you look pretty."

As a side note, don't over-exaggerate how many calories you burn exercising. Being generous you burn about 100 calories for every mile you run, so even if you ran a marathon you'd barely burn over 3/4 pound of fat. Most machines really over-exaggerate how much you burn. Eating less is by far the fastest way to burn calories."

He asked if he needed to call 911. I told him no, to call his dad instead. He brought the phone to me on the ground to unlock. Called his dad and very calmly explained that Mommy was hurt bad and needed help. Then he stayed on the phone with him and asked him every 30 seconds if he was almost to our house. I was so proud of him, and thankful for once that he was a pro at how to work a phone! "

When breeding mice, you typically want to house the male and the female together long-term (i.e. after the female gives birth, so that the female will immediately get pregnant again). This is an important note. So one day I got a call from a staff veterinarian letting me know I needed to euthanize a mouse. I asked why.

Her: ""He's...stuck.""

Took a few tries to get her to tell me why, but it turned out that the male had adopted the philosophy of ""any hole's a hole!"" and had raped one of his offspring to death. However, due to the fact that baby mice (and their orifices) are really tiny, he had gotten his dick stuck inside it, and - due to swelling - we would've had to do surgery to unstick him (which would render him unusable for our experiments).

So, I had to euthanize a mouse that was running around in a panic that was dragging a dead baby pinkie mouse by his dick. That was an...interesting...day."

265,"I ran a liquor store for a few years. Had one customer early on, probably in his late 50s, who came in every day for two packs of cigarettes, one full flavor kings, and one ultra-light 120s. The latter are stereotypical women's cigarettes. He never talked about anything other than the weather or random small talk, but he was unfailingly nice and was one of my favorite customers.

Later, the ultra-light 120 purchases become more erratic for a month or so, then stopped entirely, but he was still in every day for his, but he switched to the unfiltered version. He never explained or commented. One day, after we'd seen each other every single weekday for over a year and he hadn't bought the ultra-lights for a month or so, we got to talking. His wife, who he'd been buying the ultra-lights for, had been diagnosed with lung cancer and had died after a pretty short battle.

He said, ""I bet you're wondering why I'm still smoking, after something like that."" I kind of nodded, and he said, ""It's because I just don't care anymore without her. I switched to unfiltered so it would maybe kill me faster. Only reason I haven't just killed myself is it would break my kids' hearts."" And then he broke down sobbing."

277,"Movie trailers used to be shown after the movie, hence the name trailer."
278,"Know that it gets better over time. Longer relationships or more intense ones take longer to work through. It's kind of like a mix of grieving a death (it is after all the loss of a relationship) and going through withdrawals from a chemical addiction you had with someone you loved. Not that it's a bad thing. It's just when they leave your life, there is that physical change your body has to experience that you have to just go through. There are a lot of complicated feelings you never really get over. Their impact just hurts a lot less over time. But you work through it and come out better on the other end. It's near impossible to see that if you haven't experienced it before, but it's true. ""It gets better"" is going to feel like meaningless advice when the wounds are fresh, but it'll make sense over time.

The first few weeks are gonna really suck. Work out like crazy, do yoga, learn a new hobby, take a class in something you've always wanted to, spend a lot of time around friends, watch lots of movies, treat yourself, travel someplace you've always wanted to visit, journal. Hand-write a fake letter to your ex with everything you want to say to that person then throw it in a paper shredder and NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DELIVER IT (because it's not about your ex, it's about you coming to terms with your feelings). Spend as much time as you can with friends and family. Have a few that you can just diarrhea about the situation to and who will just listen. Know they'll be there for you as long as you need. Know you have to get your shit together and can't take advantage of them for more than a few months. They're there to support you, not enable you. I've watched people get crippled for lifetimes about the one they let get away. You got work to do to be happy with yourself and living your life to the fullest so that you can put as much awesome distance between your excellent new experiences and your breakup.

You're going to instinctively want to go back and look at what happened, why you or your ex broke it off. You're going to have that harmful desire to ask friends about it and look through old emails and pictures. Just nope that. The more effort you spend trying to figure it out, the less time you're actually spending doing cool shit with your life. It's an addiction, don't relapse into it. You might desire to dull the pain with booze, meaningless sex, drugs. Don't. That stuff will keep you in place wallowing in the pain. All that only exaggerates your feelings, so stay focused and do things that better yourself.

Block your ex on social media. You're going to grieve how you will by running a marathon or visiting that country you always wanted to or whatever you decide to do. Your ex will grieve how they do. And they'll probably do a lot of shit that is out of character for them. And it will drive you bonkers. And you'll get suspicious about who they're with for no reason. You'll play detective and it'll keep you hooked back in that relationship. But that relationship is gone. Let it go. Each time you learn about something new they've been up to, it might drive you into a spiral. If they get in a relationship soon after the breakup and you're single, it'll drive you crazy. Keep that information away from yourself so you can stay focused on improving yourself. It's over. Time for you to rock out and enjoy life on your terms!

After the first few weeks, you go from spiraling over it non-stop, losing sleep, and being a hot mess, to you going a day without thinking about your ex. Then a week. Then a month. Then they're just a passing thought years down the line. Someone told me it takes about half the length of the relationship to heal from it. There may be truth to that, but it just takes time depending how close you two were. But for all the reasons it didn't work, you'll grow. And life will be so much better now that you'll have grown and learned from it.

There is no miracle cure other than time, focusing on improving yourself, and enjoying life as much as you can without anyone else. So enjoy life! And when you're ready to, give dating another go."

333,"Yes, in fact, in regards to OP, the protagonist created the books. It's mentioned in the film that she used to write children's books. When the second book shows up she has charcoal all over her hands. 

The babadook is just an embodiment of her depression. It's the reason for her depression and why she harbors anger against her son because deep down she blames him for the tragedy of her husband's death. That event has left her scarred and depressed and that doesn't just go away. Like it's said in the movie ""The more you deny, the stronger I get."" If she tries to ignore these feelings she will only become more depressed and hostile towards her son. 

Since she can't get rid of the babadook (her depression) she must acknowledge it and take time every day to ensure it doesn't overtake her again. It's really a great way to show that people dealing with depression have to take a conscious effort to battle it every day. "

346,"Woke up one night because something icy touched my leg. Not a little touch, like the whole side of my leg. Like someone poured icy water down my leg. 

I reached under the covers to feel what it was... and my hand wrapped around something cylindrical.... cold, but... organic... instinctively, i pulled it up and out from the covers with immediate regret. I knew two things immediately: 

1) this was a snake

2)my snake is in a locking cage, so this is a DIFFERENT snake

Now, it doesn't help that i live in a place with lots of kinds of snakes, many of them venomous. So, I'm holding this mystery snake, naked in bed, in the dark, in the worst possible position (my hand is wrapped around the MIDDLE of the snake, so both ends of it are wriggling around crazily)  and I'm just sat bolt upright trying to figure out how I'm going to get the light on to identify this mystery SHEET SERPENT without being potentially fatally bitten...

Now is when my bf at the time wakes up, sensing me sitting up in bed. ""What are you doing?"" He mumbled sleepily. I'm just trying to be still as a statue and not panic, so i ask him,  ""hey can you turn on the light?""
""Mmmhm"" he shuffles out of bed and hits the switch, immediately his tone changes- ""what are you *doing*???"" He asks incredulously at me; sitting naked on the bed with a wiggling snake in my outstretched arm. 

Relief flowed through me. It WAS my snake.  She had figured out how to push the turn-style locks on her tanks lid with her nose. She slid two locks open and pushed herself through one side of the lid with the other two locks still intact. She must've been looking to warm herself up and ended up under my covers. I laughed out loud and moved to put the snake back in her cage- this time with heavy books on top to reinforce the locks until something sturdier could be purchased. 

So, the situation turned out harmlessly enough, but MAN that was a scary moment. 

The boyfriend never seemed convinced that i was not up to something shady with the snake.

Thirdly, I usually make some veggie crumble (or bacon thinly sliced if you eat meat) in another pan. I then pour the sauce over the pasta and mix shredded sharp cheddar cheese into the mixture, really letting it get all stringy and nice while still on heat. I throw in the meat or meat substitute and then put the cheeto crumbs on top.

441,"The UK's music chart is pretty centralised. We're a small nation and we have a national radio station run by the BBC (Radio 1) that historically plays the chart on Sundays. Less so these days with the rise of streaming and so on, but in the past it was a major thing for many people to listen to it on a Sunday night, so pushing tracks up the charts as a means of political protest is nothing new, since the BBC is obligated to play the tracks that are in the charts, if a song gets into the top 40 it will be played. 

This is why ""Ding Dong The witch Is Dead"" was pushed up the charts in the wake of Thatcher's death (and the BBC refused to play it, despite the chart obligation) as well as the attempt to get Rage Against the Machine back to number 1 during the release of the X-factor/Pop Idol winner's chart release which was seen as a cynical cash in for the music industry with shitty and unimaginative cover songs that were ""guaranteed"" to get to number 1 since the music business would control the release of other singles around the time.

460,"My son surprised us by being born almost a month early.  We had just built the crib, but because it was before the shower we didn't even have a diaper bag.  With the regular panic of being first time parents we also got to spend that first week, once we got him home, going back for blood tests and clinic visits and told he might have to be hospitalized again.  During that week was also a family reunion, which we also attended and passed around the baby.

My wife's cousin didn't attend the reunion, he showed up without calling the next week.  He didn't stay with my in-laws where they had room.  He showed up at our place and unpacked in the babies room.  He had stayed with us before, but this time he didn't acknowledge that instead of a bed, there was a crib. He and his boyfriend unloaded a car full of bags, hung shirts on hangers, and dumped their hair care products in the bathroom.  

This happened when I went to work to put out fires of leaving in the middle of the day a week before.  I come home to see two dogs in our yard: one a chihuahua that barked angry at everything and a beagle puppy that barked at everything the other dog did.  They had been in the car for hours and had 12 hour shits when they were let out, then shredded the shit.

I once had a mammogram in which the technician was so determined to get my whole boob in between the flattening plates that she grabbed my boob with both hands and pulled it away from my body. It felt like she was trying to rip each boob completely off as she wrestled with the machine. 

In the end, the semicircle of skin under each boob split open and I wound up with two oozing open sores under each boob that lasted for days.

475,"Sophomore year of high school, 1995ish. A close friend of mine had just gotten her first of what would eventually be many tattoos: a rubber ducky on her belly, just beside her navel. We had a church camp thing that weekend, and she tried to keep it covered as much as she could, but she had to keep applying neosporin and such, so we kept ducking out to hallways and spare conference rooms at this massive church so she could take care of business and I would look out for any adults who might yell at her about the tattoo. 

So, maybe the fifth time we go out to get her tattoo some air, these girls from another church sneak out and follow us. Picture the cast of ""mean girls"" - wealthy, snotty, preppy, pretty, and totally up their own asses.  They're all blonde, thin as rails, and dressed like a Land's End advertisement. (My friend and I were also skinny blondes, but she dressed grunge and I was into the skater/raver look at the time - a total poser, as I didn't do drugs, but I had a pixie haircut with a green streak in it and wore little boys' polo shirts and enormous pants - not the type these girls thought of as cool).  

Anyway, the lead blonde clone walks up to us and asks in her flat valley girl voice, ""Oh, my God. Is that a TATTOO?""  And my friend goes ""yeah,"" as she's dabbing little spots of blood away and applying ointment. And the girl goes ""IS IT REAL?"" And my friend goes, ""No, it's fake and so is the blood.""  Blondie catches her sarcasm, amazingly enough, stares hard at my friend's belly for a moment, and asks ""What's going to happen when you get fat?""

And without missing a beat or even looking up from what she was doing, my friend said, ""I don't know, what happened when YOU got fat?"" 

The girl was just openmouthed for a second, and then went, ""Bitch,"" and stalked off with her entourage. But I could tell my friend got to her. She was the comeback goddess.  She always knew exactly what to say to level a person who crossed her."

One particular weekend my brothers were away with some friends out of state, and I had a friend spend the night over. We went into my brothers' room to see what dumb things we could look up on the internet. We randomly started typing things into the URL bar like www.food.com, www.games.com. Generic kid stuff. Well....my friend suggests we go to Xmen.com as we had recently watched the movie....it loads, except it was NOT the movie, it was a porn site. The screen was suddenly inundated with pop ups of naked women, and none of the windows had Xs to close out. Being young and stupid we did the logical thing....turned off JUST THE MONITOR and ran out of the room. That would surely make it go away.

512,Why would that be common knowledge?
513,"It's ok to practice. Give each other a break if you mess it up. Starting a sexual encounter doesn't obligate you to finish it. You can't wait to have sex until your wedding night and then expect him/her to be a dynamo. You can't bully someone into getting an erection/orgasm. 

The coolest/saddest thing was a guy who had been married 30 years to a lady he loved, but fantasized so much about 3somes that he cut n pasted pics of her friends into pics with her to masturbate. She finds out, sends him to therapy. He finally gets over the shame to admit to her that he's just really into 3somes and she's like ""hmmm, o damn i'm super into that!"" And they communicate more about it and find a place they can legally get a sex worker to join in. They later came back to say that the most connected they ever felt in their marriage was making eye contact over the body of the stranger her husband was plowing. 30 years of shame and fear of what she'd think of him kept them from having that moment sooner/ hundreds of times!

Upon getting to the basement she was mortified. It turns out that the current owners shot BDSM porn in the basement so it was outfitted with a whipping station, cages, sex machines and toys, the whole 9 yards.

My parents did it for years, sending nieces and nephews to school and college so *they* could leave and support their parents and extended family with foreign wages.

Filipinos also have the once- or twice-yearly tradition of sending home the big 'Balikbayan' box full of essentially Costco stuff.  One of my favorite memories as a kid was helping my parents pack a big cardboard box full of coffee creamer, Hershey bars, socks, soap, and other things every year a month or two before Christmas so we can send them my aunts/uncles.  They would send back pictures of them and my cousins opening them and happily displaying all the stuff that was packed inside."

560,"So at the dog park, there's an airlock system to get in. You open one gate to a small area, close it behind you. Then you open a second gate and let your dog into the actual park. The reason for doing this is so off-leash dogs can't escape from the park while people are coming or going. It's basic common sense, but the number of people I see who leave one or both gates open behind them while they enter or leave, or who casually open the gate to leave the park while people are already entering through the other one (thus having both open at the same time) is astounding.

568,"My son's best hiding spot was inadvertent.

When he was 3 years old he was outside with me in the garden and said he wanted to go inside so I told him to go, and I'd be in in a minute.

I went inside after a couple of minutes and he was nowhere to be found.  I looked everywhere inside, outside, in the street, in the water out back... at this point I was losing my shit, I had one job as a parent and I totally failed.

I called the Sheriff's Office to report a missing child, searched the house again, screaming his name... when I finally thought to check some pillows on the couch.  Somehow he had wormed his little body in there so there was no trace of him and they looked like they normally looked.  But there he was peacefully sleeping.

Sheriff showed up, I apologized for wasting their time but he said he understood.

603,"My mom works at a bank. She had a little old lady as a frequent customer for many years. The lady stopped driving a few years ago and let her license lapse but would still go out to the bank either with her kids or in a taxi. She recently went into a nursing home an hour or two away near her daughter, and on one of her last trips into the bank, she took a picture with my mom. My mom has a special relationship with some customers (she's been at the bank for 30 years); as a kid, we took a few elderly customers to dinner for their birthdays when their kids weren't around, she still visits some in nursing homes, exchanges baked goods with others, and even has a customer who wants her to be the executor of his multi million dollar estate when he dies (she has been refusing for years), so a picture wasn't out of the ordinary.

Well, this little old lady goes to get new branch where she's living and tries to use the picture of her and my mom as ID! The branch actually called my mom to verify as the lady didn't have any other form of identification, and my mom vouched for her. She is pushing 100 years old, so she's not going to bother to get an ID now. The bank isn't a local bank either, it's a fairly large chain bank, but it is in a small town.

When the celebrant asked the question as to whether anyone had any lawful objection Marianne piped up with ""I object.  He should be marrying me not her.""

724,"She's married with a kid now, but I still think about her constantly.

Backstory:

In my senior year of high school, a very pretty girl named Annie said out of the blue, ""how are you so witty?"". I found her attractive before, but that compliment made me like her. That was only strengthened when, throughout the entirety of that year, she would call me ""funny"" and ""witty"" on a fairly regular basis.

One of my favorite examples is when I said something in class (can't remember what), and then a fellow female classmate passed my crush's desk and said, ""freakin' Lucky..."", chuckling. My crush then said, ""he's so witty, it's the best thing ever"".

I really needed the confidence boost, because I had been rejected by a longtime crush the year prior. I know it seems insignificant, but I really don't think I'd be as happy and self-assured as I am today without all the compliments she gave me. Annie still holds a very special place in my heart.

For a while, I really longed for her, and it really hurt when I found out she got engaged, got married, got pregnant, and had a kid. Eventually though, I saw her again, and it really felt like I got closure. I still long for her in a sense, but no longer do I feel bad about her moving on in her life. I even have seen a pic online of her and her new family, and it didn't bother me at all."

795,"My current tenant just moved out. I have (read: had) a beautiful home 3 years ago, 3 bedroom, fully solar, updated everything, nice bamboo floors. Enter my tenant.

Red flags were not immediate, she had a great history with prior residences, a couple of exceptions were made (she wanted to pay 100 less than I had listed, asking if she could plant things int he garden, etc).

Fast forward 6 months or so, rent starts being late. Not only late, but she would not let me know until the day rent was due that she needed to pay 3-4 days later.

When I could come by to collect the rent, she would tell me things were broken (disposal, sink clogged, etc). Which is all fine, but she would tell me it has been broken for 3 weeks and just now decided to tell me. We talk and text frequently about rent and other things, yet she could never inform me when stuff was broken until I dropped by.

This all came to a head when she got rats in the house. I go over to collect rent after 2 months not being there and holy hell. A fan globe was broken and the glass was all over the kitchen...for multiple days they told me (she had a 4 year old in the house too). The bathroom has roaches all in it, trash along the side of the house spilling out of cans, holes in the drywall (small, but there), blinds (nice wooden ones) strings broken, and the house smells awful like rat piss.

She tells me there have been rats there for a few weeks. Well I wonder if it has anything to do with all the trash outside and open food dishes in the sink that reek? I never in my life thought I would have to tell a grown woman with kids that yes, you need to put garbage in the garbage can. No, you cannot leave food out until it rots otherwise you get these lovely pests.

Anyway, even though it is in her lease to deal with rodent/pest control issues, I do it myself. I hire a company under contract to handle the whole thing for 1 year guarantee for like $1k. All she has to do is call the number I give her whenever she sees/hears a rat or anything. Well guess what she does NOT do? She would occasionally text me saying she saw a rat. I saw call pest control to come take care of it, then nothing. This went on for 6 months, all the while rats chewed my stove wires (now not under warranty since they dont cover pest issues), clogged the dishwasher, wrecked my cabinets, etc.

They just moved out last week. Hols int he doors now, looks like they tried to crowbar the INMTERIOR doors open for some reason, split jams, garbage left all over the yard front and back, my floors have this inexplicable grease all over and sticky things, her child drew in crayon all over the doors.

801,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them. Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

They were letting people go in groups. The first group finished in like fucking 10 minutes because it's just a freaking 5k. They didn't even have the finish line setup yet. They literally ran into people who were waiting to start. The security there seemed to be the only ones who actually knew how to do their job but because they worked for the production and weren't being told what to do they did the best they could. Parts of the course became narrow and created bottle necks. We ran in over flow parking so there were holes and people were falling and getting hurt. Some of the liquid that shows up on black lights they gave out had mold in it. I saw a chick in front of me collapse in line and the medical people couldn't get to her because of the aforementioned gate situation.

819,"My brother and sister in law are pretty crappy in my book. 

They have 2 kids and struggle with being adults. The brother really hates doing things like work. He tries hard to mooch off his mother before she eventually kicked him out. He and his wife would lock their kids out of their room and have sex, just expecting everyone else in the house to watch them. 

When they both quit their jobs and lost their house they moved back in with my wifes mother, bringing with them 9 cats. And my wife agreed to look after their dogs (while I was asleep), so they showed up with 2 dogs. The agreement was 2 weeks, and they would find new homes for the dogs. 

3 months later, they've not even so much as bought food for the dogs or come to clean up the sea of dogshit that is my backyard. Meanwhile they're not even looking for jobs. 

They finally decide that since no one wants them to mooch off them, they'll go ""Live off grid"" despite the fact that living off grid is a thing that people who have, you know, money do. No they buy a shitty tent or something and move up north. Find some random town and just move into the woods near it. With 2 kids, ones a toddler and the others a baby mind you.

So, I eventually get tired of looking after and paying for their dogs so I go to the dog rescue that I volunteer for and find new homes for the dogs. They FLIP OUT at my wife, calling her all kinds of names saying she's a terrible person blah blah blah. So I yelled at them that I was the one that got rid of the dogs, not her. I don't give 2 shits if they don't like me. 

They came over to see the dogs once in the 3 months that we had them and they completely ignore their kids as their kids are running around my house going crazy. The ""mother"" finally pipes up and I shit you not, whistles at her 3 yearold son and calls to him like he's a dog.

Now I hear they lock their kids up in a room for most of the day with a lock on the outside door to their room in the trailer their currently living in. 

These are just a few examples. My wifes sister overheard them bragging that they found a way to beat their kids and not leave marks. Just despicable."

You Google 2052 SPACE NEWS and read of an asteroid the size of Antarctica that was destroyed thanks to the technology built by a team of young scientists.

This interests you in engineering and space exploration, so you take night classes, study really hard and...don't make it into MIT so you decide to go back to your polysci/criminal justice major.  Dejected and feeling a bit sorry for yourself.  But, you've got 206 bones and none are made of quit, so you push through and graduate with a law degree.  A couple years later, your kids are in elementary school and you overhear the teachers complaining about government cuts and this and that.  How the music programs are being cut.  Neither of your kids play instruments, but that's not right to cut music.  So you start a petition.  Before you know it, people are really rallying behind you.  You've got a heck of a following.  Then one of these parents pipes in and says they'd vote for you if you ran for office.  You laugh it off, but then your spouse gets in too.  You know, I think you'd do great.  You're strong and you'll do what's right.  So you campaign.  You get so much money you can swim in it.  You don't even have to make calls, people are calling you.  
While on your cell phone you see a kid chasing a ball into the street.  In horror you yell at her to look out, but she can't hear you.  You throw your phone and run through people.  Pushing them to the floor to get to this kid.  The tires screech, the horn blares, you make contact with the kid just in time to push her and her friend you didn't previously see out of the way...
You have 206 bones in your body, not one of them is made of quit...you saved the world that day.  

That little girl goes on to invent the technology that saves the world from annihilation.  She had her award ceremony at the statue built to commemorate your bravery.

869,"I've talked about this in other threads before. I wasn't an incel, but I was *very* Nice Guy growing up. I think a lot of things factored into it, but the root of it was living in a small town where I was one of 100 other kids my age. I was a ""nerd"" because I could read before kindergarten and knew basic math before 1st grade. That reputation stuck with me and I got bullied pretty hard. Between that and having glasses, there were *other boys* that the girls wanted to hold hands with on the playground.

I lived in that town until I hit my teens and we moved to a new city. The damage had already been done, and my attitudes toward relationships were formed. I was very much that guy that said ""why are you dating *him*, *he's such a dick* you should date me instead."" I was ""friendzoned"" and ""brotherzoned"" by so many girls.

Then I dated \[Tori\]. ^(name changed) We were together roughly 2 years of high school and both of us matured a lot. I don't think I was entirely cured of my Nice Guy nature yet, but since I had someone I didn't really think about it too hard. After high school we broke up and stayed FWB. I met other people, including \[Lor^(i\]name chang)ed who helped grow even more mature.

By the time I got to college I was looking back on my teenage years and cringing at all he things I said and the way I treated some people. There was a certain level of self-awareness where I saw that it wasn't helpful at all and knew that the only thing to do was change my attitude.

EDIT: I'm going to look for my other comment about this, and link it if I find it. [Here it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/comments/6rck3c/facebook_just_reminded_me_that_while_you_were_all/dl432im) I talked about the *other* influences that made me the way I was there."

872,"I started off as busser. Then became food runner, then server, then assistant manager and eventually landed management and Assistant General Manager. This was over a 12-year period. I wanted the GM role badly. Finally got my shot. It was a high profile trendy restaurant that brought in $9.5 mil a year. I was making six figures and leading a staff of 110. It was remarkable and everything I ever worked for... And I was strangely unfulfilled. The 100-hr work week was a big part might of it along with the lack of vacation. I‚Äôd arrive at 10 or 11am and Leave at 3am. Dating was impossible and having friends was difficult. Even keeping in touch with family was hard. But it was insanely fun addressing issues with data and making decisions and watching it all play out while being at the forefront of food and service. It came with a huge cost. I was overworked, stressed, and the only thing I could ever talk about was the restaurant. That was me. 6-7 days a week. It owned me. My dog that I traveled cross country with was put down after he got sick really quickly, he was old but I thought of all the time I spent working and not with him. The guilt was real.

Our restaurant group was purchased and they flew all the GMs and executive chefs to Vegas to discuss the future of the company. We were there to build the brand. I was at the best seat in the house for the future. We were going global and wanted a bigger commitment from everyone. But I also failed to realize there was a target on my back. Months earlier, before I knew about this meeting I made plans with my girlfriend.. After my last meeting I jumped on a flight to Reno then took a puddle jumper and landed in the middle of burning man for the first time. The contrast of being in marble halls with 5-course meals talking about prospective markets and PnLs against the playa couldn‚Äôt have been more stark. No one cared about the most important meeting of my life and I was surrounded by people that were creating art. Watched the man burn and figured it‚Äôs all going to burn one day so might as well try to do something fulfilling.

Three months later I quit my job, sold everything I owned and hit the road with the girlfriend. We became seasonal workers and drove from San Diego to Alaska to Nicaragua and back. We still travel but bought property in Alaska and are building a hotel / community space. It feels like a lifetime ago and I struggle to remember who I was then. I view the concept of work in a very different light. And also happiness. And I‚Äôm not sure if I have it right now but I know I had it wrong then. It is an incredible honor to be able to compete at a very high level but not if you lose yourself in the process... but how else would I have learned that unless I went all in."

874,"In America it's because high schools are failing them by telling them not to. The mantra they drill into kids heads is ""college, college, college. You MUST go to college."" 

And in the 50s all the way up until the 90s (arguable), that was good advice. College would get you an easier, better paying job. Then the America economy collapsed and could on longer support so many non-essential, white collar jobs. But trade jobs can't be outsourced to india or mexico. And suddenly plumbers and mechanics were making three times as much as college grads serving up lattes at starbucks. 

But the educational system didn't react to the changing economy. Instead it kept pumping out the same old party line, ""college, college, college,"" even though it wasn't true anymore. It's continued to do so for nearly 20 years longer than it should have and really shows no sign of changing anytime soon. "

Worry about them.

I think schools give too much focus in the students that apparently are going to be failures in life and believe the students with the best grades have their life's solved and are far more mature than the rest of them. Please talk to them, encourage them to worry less  about study and live it's younger year to the fullest,  worry if they have over protective parents or they fear about their reaction if they're not succesful top students.

I'm not that bad as many of those mentioned here but I guess I would have chosen a better career, would understand better social life and would have surpassed my anxiety years before.  In my honest opinion, I regret deeply being such a top grades student and not enjoying nor my childhood nor my teenage years."
939,"Not a student but a classmate in HS that all the teachers at our reunions are always in awe about. Jenna moved to our upper-middle class town from ""The City"" in middle school. Nice enough girl but didn't fit in and started hanging with ""the loser crowd."" She got pregnant in 11th grade and her mom sent her off to one of those bible summer camps and it was well known throughout the school that she gave the baby up for adoption. To say senior year was rough for her socially was an understatement. 

When I would come home on break from school I saw her around working cashier jobs and going to the local state school part time. Her mom moved away and so she was on her own the day she turned 18.

She came to the 10 year and it turns out she joined the Air Force so we exchanged emails (I'm in the Air Force too) and ping each other about once a year. 20-year rolls around and our former principal, a retired Marine, just can't stop talking about how he really ""had faith she would turn her circumstance around"" which is code for ""thought she'd never make it in life."" 

She's now an officer and working at the Pentagon on the senior staff of some important generals. She made below the zone promotions her whole career and is getting ready to promote to Colonel next year (which is one step below one-star general).

You could see our former principal just completely engaged talking to her when previously probably only talked to her when he was suspending her from school. I know everyone expected her to turn out like a bad episode of Teen Mom but she really turned that one around for sure."

So next to my old secondary school was a theme park where a lot of local kids worked  during the summer. This meant a bunch of 18 year olds that barely know where there feet are have jobs operating somewhat complicated machinery. So this one kid (I could find his name but not going to out the poor lad) has the job of operating a rat ride (the ride in question [https://i.imgur.com/AUukhaL.png](https://i.imgur.com/AUukhaL.png)) stops mid way through. So this kid operating the ride, instead of just getting a maintenance guy to decides to just push the cart. He pushes the cart and trips. So to not fall off the side he grabs the cart. Rat ride proceeds to go around a bend so the kid goes flying off the ride and falls from pretty far up. Poor lad died soon after.

953,"I am an atheist. Hardly groundbreaking, have been since I was 12ish, so half my life now, but I'll never forget the moment when I came downstairs and told my mother ""I don't know if I believe in God"" and in the crossest voice I've ever heard from her, she said, **""Yes you do.""**  I knew then that I could never be open with them about my religious convictions.

My entire family is deeply religious.  My father considered becoming a pastor several years ago.  My mother, in the midst of her grief at their divorcing (which is now), told me that she doesn't ""understand God's will, but will follow it"".  My sister tells me often that she knows she's going to hell because she can't be a good person like God wants her to be.  If I 'came out' to my family as an Atheist, it would ruin my relationship with each member.  At present, I'm also the only member of the family speaking to all the others, so...there's that.

**Edit:** My relationship with religion growing up was negative, but not abusive. I understand the place of resentment many of the comments below are coming from, but I think we ought to conduct ourselves somewhat more honorably. Atheists often criticize Christians and other religious people for their lack of compassion, so perhaps we should extend that same compassion to the people in my family that are struggling.

This thread was about what you can't tell your family. Every family has a different dynamic and you simply can't divine my relationship with them from one post, or even a handful. I've always been very formal and distant with mine and they know very little about me. I like it that way. I think they're all dealing with a lot, and frankly I don't care about much of it, but it doesn't mean I can't still be good to them in my own way. See my reply below.

&gt; But that doesn't mean you stop meeting people. You meet an attractive person who you would have considered pursuing if you were single and that spark doesn't just go away. You just learn to tuck it away and say ""that's just not the path I chose to take."" I care about my partner and the bond we have far more than I care about a potentially brief fun fling with anyone else. It feels...wrong.

&gt; I can't imagine actually cheating on someone. It honestly staggers me how common it is. People who cheat...I'm not going to say they disgust me, but I just don't understand. If you're unhappy in a relationship, break it off. Don't make life worse for three+ people, with yourself being one of them.

From an early age he'd let the children do household jobs like cooking, doing the dishes, vacuuming or even small repairs like a punctured bicycle tyre, of course with our help. When they protested (or when I protested that it took much longer that way) he'd say (translated from Dutch): I do not want to deprive you (them) of the chance to learn how to do this. 
You can imagine this used to annoy our children to no end, but years later it has become a saying in our household, our 17-year-old daughter calls it our family meme. He was right, though, they know how to do a lot of things that will make their path towards independence smoother.

The person saying it set his/her mind to something and then achieved it, thus giving ""setting your mind to something"" a 100% success rate from his/her perspective. They just fail to realize the staggering number of cases where someone set their mind to something and *didn't* achieve it, usually because of factors entirely out of their control.

People are extremely uncomfortable with the fact that every single thing they've achieved in their life ultimately comes down to sheer luck. Every time you hear someone talk about something they achieved by the merit of their hard work, consider how well that would have ended up if they had instead been born in a war-ravaged African village, with AIDS passed down from the mother and no access to medicine. These people didn't just forget to ""put their mind"" to becoming a successful CEO of a large American tech company."

Some people fight it and can win (like Yoda and many more jedi) while others fail (Quinlin Vaas) while others embrace it and let it make them more powerful.

My problem with Shameless is something the US version did by being a success. In the original UK version, most of the characters come and go. Frank is the only Gallagher who actually sticks around. Fiona, Debbie, Lip, Carl and Ian all escape.

Because the US show wants to keep the cast together and keep going, No one can succeed:

US Lip can't succeed at college. UK Lip became an architect and raised his kid with Mandy.

UK Fiona ran off with Steve who got his shit together, and shows up at the end of the show to steal the youngest ones out from under Frank so they won't be screw ups. US Fiona has given up on raising her siblings and is a huge fuck up.

UK Ian leaves to hide from gangsters because he saved a friend's life. US Ian leaves because he's inherited Monica's mental illness. (Actually a better plot, but they fail the ending).

UK Debbie becomes the new Fiona after Fiona escapes. Debbie at 17 decides she needs out and joins the military. US Debbie becomes a teen mom.

UK Carl becomes a cop. US Carl goes to prison.

Seriously, I'm a california liberal and if it's one thing the left does NOT get, and gets wrong about pretty much everything- is guns.

California is riddled with laws that simply make zero sense in the real and practical world.

Silencers are called supressors, and they are critical for ear protection. They make a gun as loud as a jackhammer, so there goes the idiocracy of thinking it should be banned because: ninjas. It's basically like being against ear muffs.

Same thing with flash hiders. They don't make guns invisible. They keep the gun operator from being blinded by his own shots- Everyone else see's the flash just fine. This of course, is an evil feature and banned for no good reason.

The amount of gun deaths compared to other deaths is relatively low, ESPECIALLY when corrected for how many guns there actually are. And no- assault weapons aren't the gun of choice in gun deaths. Handguns are- WAY more, also they're the LEAST regulated of gun types.   

Gun death statistics are comprised of a lot of suicide deaths. There's not the murder problem the statistics like to claim.

No,  ""gun control"" didn't ""work"" in Australia. It' got maybe a third of the worst, most harmless guns off the street, and murder rates as far as guns declined just as much as they were anyway, so it pretty much failed.

1279,"Well, that's not really how that works.

You make bail to get out of jail, which is where you go when you're arrested and awaiting trial.

Prison is where you go when you're convicted. No amount of money gets you out of a prison sentence that's been handed down.


That said, yeah, that would have been a pretty easy self-defense claim. Assailant is a known felon with priors. Assailant introduced the weapon. Assailant utilized the weapon first. 

At worst, he might be facing involuntary manslaughter, but it'd be a super fucking petty DA to go for that. And an involuntary manslaughter charge usually only has sentences of about a year, and based on circumstances he'd have gone to a low level, not a Hollywood high security prison. 


Edit: Actually went back and rewatched that section and it's worse than I remembered.

One, the attack was completely premeditated. Tommy (the brother) smashed Evan's (Ashton Kutcher) car while he and Kayleigh (Amy Smart) were at dinner. Evan arms himself with mace while Kayleigh apologizes for not telling Evan he was out of prison.

Then, they find a jacket of Evan's on the ground, and Tommy steps out of hiding and very quickly begins attacking Evan with a bat. Evan uses his mace and punches Tommy several times and only hits him once with bat.

He'd have never seen a jail cell after a ten minute investigation by police.

Second part, he's clearly in a prison. Yet, he has a visit from his mom who says his lawyer can get him off on self-defense. In the extremely unlikely situation that he was even charged, he'd have easily bonded out. "

1369,"I work in an occupation that requires a lot of talking. I partake in as much discussion as I need to but no more, I am generally not a huge talker. I went camping a couple of years ago for a few days just to get away - as you do. All I wanted to do was go for walks, the odd swim, a lot of reading - but most importantly I did not want to talk to anyone. I made sure that I found a camping spot well away from the main areas to minimize how many people I would encounter. The time of year I picked though was school holidays in basically springtime, so the park I chose was quite heavy with walkers, hikers, campers etc. I really should have predicted what happened and just picked another more remote park, but anyway.

As the first day drew to a close I settled into my chair to just read (I had an absolute cracker of a book that I was loving every page of) and enjoy the twilight. It is usually about this time, however, that other campers choose to be sociable - dotting their way around other campsites and chatting to pretty much everybody. It really is quite lovely that people do this - it restores your faith in humanity a bit - and I will do it myself occasionally, but I was so intent on just keeping to myself. After enduring idle chatter with a few couples and families that strayed my way, I decide I had had enough and that the best thing to do was to give any potential encroachers a glare as they approached. Say nothing, just glare at them. This worked a treat, but worked too well in that I was starting to get some concerning looks from people. I noticed that people in the main camping area were talking among each other and nodding in my direction, parents were stopping their kids from coming near me - that kind of thing. Rather too late, I realized that I had made myself out to be some kind of weirdo spook keeping to himself in the corner of the campground. "

The same firm worked as contractors for the company my Dad worked for, so he has the best/worst stories about them. On one site, they'd found that sections of a pipeline had been sealed with asbestos gaskets. The boss of my firm (I'll call him Jim) was present on this site, and had to call in a specialist to remove the asbestos.

Jim would never wear safety gear like the other guys, claiming to be ""exempt"", and so when the specialist turned up in full breathing gear and overalls and tried to do his job, Jim just stood leaning on the pipe in his normal clothes talking to him. My Dad and the others are stood well away from the asbestos at this point, and he shouts out:

1418,"First I want non-gun owners, specifically outspoken anti-gun people to actually learn correct and factual information about firearms and the laws pertaining to them before they open their mouths and make very specific and bizarre fallacious technical claims about them. I'd also like them to educate themselves before they attempt to influence laws that negatively and arbitrarily impact the lives of millions of gun owners.

Fictional sources such as movies, television, books and video games are not acceptable forms of which to educate yourself about firearms. They are highly exaggerated and erroneous in their portrayal.

I also want them to do a deep dive into the statistics of what gun violence in this country actually looks like. Don't just go to Moms Demand Action's website and soak everything in at face value. It's pure 100% propaganda. Believe it or not but anti-gun lobbying actually is profitable. It's just another scam to make money by capitalizing on your ignorance and using emotionally manipulative tactics to scare you into thinking you and your children going to be shot any second. If you really look at data from various sources you'll see the average person is not going around shooting people with any alarming regularity. Mass shootings, school shootings and the like are extraordinarily rare. 2/3rds of all gun deaths are suicides. The vast majority of gun related homicides are gang related.

I also want them to understand every time a politician opens their mouth and blames firearms they're playing you. They're attempting to redirect criticism and focus on their failings in the socioeconomic arena, which are the true deciding and motivating factors behind violent behavior. Passing the buck to firearms is all too easy and lazy.

I'm a liberal guy. Gun ownership and valuing your rights isn't a left or right thing. It's an American thing. Stop with the stereotyping.

I lost friends, my sick father was asking me to come back home but I was too scared that the people I owed money to were there.

I've brought disgrace to my family. I lost my job. I lost everything that was going okay with me.

One day after a full night of gambling, I had $20 left in my money. That was the last of it. I went to the casino and told myself that I would take my life if I lose.

I lost.

Rode the bus back to my father's house from some spare change in my pocket. I was already planning how to end my life. Burn some charcoal, put it in a pan, lock myself in my old room and then close the windows and my door. That was the best plan.

I rummaged around the house to look for charcoal. Then maybe I could go to the store to buy some. However, I used my last money for gambling and fare.

I lived man, I survived the night. And then the next day, then weeks, and now I'm still here. 

I now work for my drean company. My salary is way above what the market has set. A beautiful woman inside out is in love with me just as I am in love with her. 

Life is great with some challenges on the side. How I managed to stay alive until today baffles me. But life has been good. They say that bad experiences make good stories. And that's what I feel right now.

1474,"Right now actually. Three years ago, my wife and I had a pretty good life. We had a house, good jobs, and newer vehicles. Life was good and we decided to add to it by having children. When our first was born two years ago, my wife had been looking at getting a new job. It was her dream job but it was in a different state. However, it also was only about an hour away from family. So we figured if she took the job, we could stay with family until I found a job and then proceed with life. She got the job and we proceeded with the plan. However, I have been unable to find a job that also pays enough to keep my kids (I have two kids now) in daycare. The last job I had, it cost us $200 a month for me to work.

1484,"I have had quite a few long term relationships (including my ongoing one with my husband) and I never had that *""OMG you're THE ONE""* feeling with them. But I did fall head over heels once for a guy and I did get the feeling like we were absolutely meant to be together. Like he was a sort of a piece of a puzzle in my life that I didn't know was missing. I felt like he knew the real me, the me deep inside, that I was ashamed of but he liked. We exchanged the most heartfelt and intimate gifts, including family heirlooms. He was a truly talented and wonderful song writer and wrote dozens of songs about me that just swept me off my feet.

He didn't want to date exclusively in the beginning. I wasn't super happy about that, but I felt it was reasonable enough. I didn't date anyone else, but he did. However, I did see one of my ex-boyfriends during that time. He asked me all sorts of questions about seeing my ex. I answered honestly but guardedly. He said, with total sincerely, ""it's so interesting that you had a visit like that and didn't make love."" [He always talked like that.]  I said, ""we did."" He was clearly shocked, but tried to play it off, saying, ""oh, it's so cute how bashful you were to answer that."" 

That exchange just snapped me out of it. I realized how immature he was, he expected that he could date all he wanted and I was just going to be celibate waiting for him to decide on me. We dated for a while after that, but it was never the same, and it fell apart after a few more weeks. The funny thing is, I don't even remember how we broke up or what our last conversation was like. I barely remember him now and don't consider him at all to be one of the loves of my life like I do some of my exes. It was just a flash in the pan.

It's amazing how wrong our instincts can be. I love my husband to bits, of course, but it was never ""the lightning bolt."" Sure, I liked him pretty much from the beginning (hence why we dated), but our love grew over time, as we got to really know each other. It doesn't feel like something out of a fairy tale or a ""I never thought it would happen to me."" It makes complete sense to me why we are together. And we stay together because we want this relationship, it's a very conscious decision, and doesn't feel like some fated path."

One time I was in the high school gym alone, ready for phys ed class to begin, just kind of messing around with a basketball. I‚Äôm decently far away from the basket, I don‚Äôt remember where exactly but probably farther than I could usually throw and get the ball in the net. I suck at sports in general, so basketball was no exception. I decided I was going to do something cool for fun. So I turned around and threw the basketball behind me as hard as I could, then I turned around just in time to see the ball go perfectly through the hop and net. I couldn‚Äôt believe I did it and I looked around to see if anyone else had seen such a jaw dropping event... and nobody was there. Not even the teacher. Just a second later, several of my classmates started filtering out of the change room. How disappointing.

Also, I‚Äôm sure everyone remembers when the whole water bottle flipping trend was big, anyway, I remember going to throw some empty water bottles in my recycling bin, but one of the bottles still had some water in it.

1564,"Ok, this was in response to a question awhile back on AskReddit, it was something like, ""describe a situation where you almost died"" or something like that;

I was on point as a SL(Squad Leader) , leading my fire teams in Afghanistan, 2010. We were tasked with clearing COI's (Compounds Of Interest) in what was largely a deserted village. There were grape fields all around the village, lower than the surface of the ground. 

It was hot, as per usual, and we had a TEDD (Tactical Explosive Detection Dog) dog and handler with us. It was early yet, the villagers just stirring about We worked our way thru one field, and I had just climbed up out of it onto a dirt path, the village mosque directly in front of me, my Joes still in the field. 

I stop, look up and down the path. Nothing.

I look at the mosque, and a guy is now standing at the corner of it nearest me.  He had no weapon, and looked like any other dirt farmer in the area. He stepped back out of sight, and I began to turn to give one of my Joes a hand up out of the field.

In absolute silence, the man then reappears at the corner of the mosque, with a PKM machine gun planted on his hip, and cuts loose. About 20-25 meters separated us, and time seemed to turn to molasses in January. I just froze, there in the ball open roadway, not a shred of cover around. 


The report of that fucking thing, I'll never stop hearing it . I've heard almost any type of weapon you can think of in the modern arsenal fire. Close up, far away, you name it...


The reports were a harsh ""POCKPOCKPOCKPOCKPOCKPOCKPOCKPOCK!!"" I've heard plenty of PKM's fire before, but they never sounded like this. I can only assume it sounded that way because he was so close, and the muzzle of the weapon was oriented directly towards my dumb and fumbling ass...

I began trying to back-pedal down the road way, but it was like my legs were stuck in concrete. I have never in my life experienced a feeling like that. There is no logical reason for how he missed me, he should have cut me in half, yet every one of the around 40-50 rounds he fired missed me. (We counted up the shell casings after) I could feel/hear them snapping the air around me. 

In those seconds, I fumbled my M4 up to the level of my hip, and flipped the safety off and began yanking back on the trigger. My surprise was so complete, the only portion of my brain that functioned was the part that had been trained to ""point weapon towards guy with weapon, pull trigger.""


Our exchange could not have lasted more that 3-4 seconds, but it seemed like several decades. At the end of that time period, I collected my wits enough to bring my weapon up to my shoulder properly, and ended the situation.

I still think of that one often. Sometimes, after I smoke a bowl or two, I wonder if my life now is all in my head, and I really did die that day, and all of this is just those seconds stretched to eternity. Silly, I know, but there it is"

1575,"Not so wild but here's some stories from the 4 years I did massage work:

- Women ""accidentally"" being naked when I walk in the room. Usually patients gown down in to underwear and a gown. I knock, get the ok and enter the room and drape them with a towel. I expect them to be lying down mostly covered not standing up naked. There was an Austrian lady who was naked when I walked in but she said that that's what she does when she's in Austria and I gave her the benefit of the doubt. It only happened once with a male patient, I think it probably happened with 5-6 patients, most were repeat offenders. Makes it pretty uncomfortable. 

- Many middle age women asking me if I do house calls. My workplace didn't have a policy against it but I always said no. Some of them would squeeze my leg or arm and say that girlfriend (now fiancee) was a very lucky girl.

- A few semi-famous patients talking juicy gossip and life stories.

- A topless waiter/lingerie model that started making very sexual moans as I massaged her. The rooms were private but the top was open so it was possible to hear her from the other rooms. It was very awkward for me. 

- A patient had more warts and moles on their back than skin. There were a few guys where it was like massaging a rug. 

- One of the patients said ""Sorry I just want to check something"" and walked out into the reception area to confirm something with the receptionist in her gown and underwear whilst we had people in the waiting room. 

- An older gay guy would always smile and tell the receptionist how lucky he was to have me. He was a funny patient. 

- A blackout. I didn't stop, I just joked that it was ambience. The lights came on a minute or so later.

- Some patients don't realise that it's easier to perform the massage when they're changed down to their underwear. Every now and then people will let you know it's not possible as they're going commando.

There's not many wild moments and I was there to do a job, not conduct myself like a porn script. Most of it is people complaining/sharing about their day/life whilst you massage them. "
1576,"A part of it can sometimes be attributed to accident. I remember a Doom glitch where you could propel yourself off small protruding objects. It's likely someone did this by accident, they tried to apply it usefully."

It's a moniker used to describe materials that are (in the case of Avatar) highly rare and costly - that planet being the only known source of it.

As far as I'm concerned if you don't have garbages in each stall you bring the flushing upon yourself.

You cannot say I love you too much. Even if they roll their eyes. They need to know they‚Äôre loved. Make the right and wrong you teach them be about how things affect them or others - not just arbitrary rules. When they understand the why, they try much harder. If their life is screwed up because of your choices, acknowledge it. Don‚Äôt make them think they‚Äôre crazy because your life is chaos. They‚Äôll tolerate a lot if they understand you‚Äôre trying to make things better."

Obviously we all clued into the fact that it was just the power that went out, but it got me thinking that if it wasn't a Disney flagship movie, like if it was a smaller or more independent studio, that would be such an awesome way to end a series. Everyone goes out eventually but they would all go out together."
1613,This comment makes me feel like I'm I'm the future. 
1614,"Kind of different but i think it still counts. 

Selling eggs/ produce. I always throw in a dozen eggs if someone buys fruit or veg and always give them a basket of produce if they buy eggs. Free of charge. It costs me nothing, as i regularly get overwhelmed with extras i don't have time to preservd, but the customers will inevitably tell everyone they know to buy from me. You get $0.15 (my cost to produce) in veggies, i get 25 new customers spending $10-20 on average every time they stop. 

Selling livestock: moms and babies are in front. You walk past all the lamb, rabbit kits, ducklings, calves to get to whomever is for sale. Every animal here is friendly, so i encourage petting. This causes people to slow down. The longer the walk takes, scritching lambs and getting nuzzled by calves, the less haggling i have to deal with. It softens the grizzled old men who want to argue with the female farmer.

So we stop at a CVS, slip around back, and try to have sex as quietly as possible behind a dumpster as people walk by not 15 feet away.

In hindsight, we probably should have stopped inside to buy a pack of condoms first, but I was young and stupid. Luckily nothing came of it, and by god it was probably the best sex I've had in my life just because of the fact that it was a surprise she was willing to do it, and the thrill of potentially getting caught. It really was the perfect farewell gift, I thought about her a *lot* while I was away."

1628,"One day, when I was about six or seven years old, I was at a BBQ with my Dad at a beach. On the side of a nearby toilet block was some graffiti of the best nose and eyes that I had ever seen. I was so excited to have learnt how to draw such well proportioned eyes and nose that I began drawing it on all the faces that I drew. I thought that my teacher and parents looked at me a little strangely when I showed them my pictures, but didn't think too much about it. Eventually I grew out of it and drew faces differently. It took me a good five or more years, before I looked at my old artwork and realised that I had been drawing dicks on all of my characters' faces as a child.

Delicately i got her to talk on it some when she was awake, between that and other events im aware of from other people i reasoned what i heard was true, i didnt tell her of her confessions but i was able to get her to accept therapy to try and work on it all, that was a few years ago, through meds and counseling shes doing better, but she doesnt need to know that i know.

Summer 2013 I went backpacking deep in the hills behind Ojai, California.
It was early summer and we went looking for hot springs (not really sure why we would do that in summer...) anyways the hike in is really exhausting and when we finally reach our destination it‚Äôs dusk. After setting up our tents I hear this shrieking sound almost like short bursts of screams. This makes us very nervous but it stops and we don‚Äôt hear it again. Anyways that night we decide to go looking for the hot springs when lo and behold the screams resume from somewhere in the underbrush. We decide to run back to camp in the dark and start a fire. Needless to say, I eventually fall asleep and next morning we go back out looking for the hot springs. Eventually we did find the hot springs and proceed to pack out.
 Upon getting home I google animal sounds and find out that mountain lions make that exact sound that we heard. I had a close encounter with a pair of mountain lions which is actually a lot less scary than a human screaming alone somewhere in the hills."

I wanted to get Asian characters going down my sternum, and after I picked three I sat down with the artist (who was a paraplegic Mexican dude) . My first mistake was trusting the accuracy of the characters without checking. So everything went off without a hitch, and we went on our merry way. Several years later, my brother married a Chinese girl he met while teaching overseas, which led to my second mistake: letting her see the tattoo. Turns out only one character was accurate and the other two made no sense whatsoever. I never heard the last of it."
1662,"My cousin and his wife are very shy. He has a very bad speech impediment and she was just shy. They wanted a family wedding but they didn‚Äôt want to be the centre of attention. My cousin was the groom and his own mother was too shy to give a speech. 

They brief the celebrant on this. To get around it they 

- had the bridesmaids and groomsmen together with them at all times 
- they weren‚Äôt mic up and we could only hear the celebrant 
- the celebrant explain the vows were for the couple only and will be said only to them 
- they had a few screens up that limited their view of the crowd but not the crowds. 
- it was strictly family only at the wedding. 

At the reception the bride and groom made no speeches and all toasts from the table were made by the bestman. The reception had a private area the couple could retire to. 

The reception was arranged like a circle so they didn‚Äôt feel like they were on stage. The first dance was all the family together. 

Also the open bar was very generous and everyone was too pissed to do much but dance the nutbush and eat.  

There were three speeches and the speeches were done on the other side of the room so no one was staring at the couple. 

It was the best wedding I‚Äôve been to. Amazing location and just a relaxed friendly wedding. "

1721,"I tend to agree with that last interpretation. I think (in most versions of the character) Superman represents the best of America only through the luckiest possible chain of events. He grew up in a stable household in a nice town, was raised right and believes in American idealism. I‚Äôm all for that.

But as I mentioned above, it only takes one truly bad day for all of that to come crumbling down. Lex is a humanist - and he‚Äôs right that relying on an immortal, indestructible alien to protect us keeps us from growing as a species. "

1726,"I think about the girl who suddenly started avoiding me saying that I creeped her out when I asked her what was going on. To be fair I don't entirely blame her but smiling was not my strong suit at the time and people with Asperger's have too many thoughts go through their head at the same time, causing sort of an intense look on their face. 

So no I don't blame her but there are nicer ways to say it, and it taught me to have more facial expression. I was 15. Learning to smile was very very hard for me to do but I eventually got there."

1729,"The guy who lived next door to us had gotten into an automobile accident and--when he took the car in to get repaired--he just went ahead and had the shop repaint his entire car a different color. It went in black and silver...came out a candy apple red. At any rate, when he pulled in to the driveway, my wife (who was in the yard with my then 3 year old daughter) made a comment about the new paint and said, ""I want my car painted red, too. Do you think you can help me out?"" They started talking and my wife (after a few minutes) realized that our daughter had wandered off (no biggie since we had a fence with a locking gate and we knew she couldn't get out) and had gotten really quiet...so she started looking for her.

My wife found our daughter, standing next to her white car, happily coloring away on the door with her red markers.

When my wife saw it she screamed and said, ""Honey, what are you doing to Mommy's car...?"" My daughter looked at her, gave her the biggest, proudest smile she could and said, ""I color your car red for you all by my big self, Mommy.""

Thankfully the markers were water soluble and the color came out after a few good washes...but it was funny as Hell to me."
1730,"I was walking home from the bus stop at night, passing a park. I hear someone running behind me, no big deal, maybe a jogger. I look over my shoulder to see how far I should scoot over to let them pass; and see a brick being swung at my face.

I'd like to say it was superior instincts and battle sense that helped me dodge it, but in truth, I flinched like a scared cat. In any case, by the time he stopped and turned around in front of me, I already had my revolver pointed at his chest. 

To be honest, I was already squeezing down on the trigger, but he dropped the brick, and turned to run before I fired, and I had enough presence of mind to realize I can't shoot an unarmed person in the back. 

Managed to relay the story to a cop parked around the corner at a KFC, but never heard anything on it, so doubt they caught him."

1743,"Reminds me of when I was a kid, and my daughter.  I remember when I was 6 my parents flipping out at the sheer number of candy wrappers and discarded candies in my room.  At first they didn't believe me that it was my halloween candy from the last couple years.  I never liked candy much.  There was no chocolate left for sure... but the candy was just slowly going away.

My daughter does the same exact thing.  It's a nice treat, but we both would rather sneak cheese."
1744,"My Dad used to do this thing with his socks before putting them on: He would un-tuck them out of each other (when you create a ball to store them together) and if they didn‚Äôt open up fully he would hold one by the end and flick it really hard up and down until it unravelled itself, usually smacking it off his knee. I picked up this habit too and had been doing it at least 20 years when one day at the gym I realised I was doing it in front of everyone in the changing rooms. I became *hyper* aware of how ridiculous and batshit crazy it looked to everyone else."
1745,That's pretty amazing and wonderful
1746,"They spent a good 20-30 minutes searching through some coats in the room, getting all excited each time they found something.

But I just had a vivid memory of my gym teacher telling the story of a girl claiming she was assaulted by another teacher. The gym teacher wrote her up and sent her to detention.

That  gym teacher was sexually assaulting students and eventually got caught with a 13 year old girl.

1759,"I lived in the United States for almost a year as an exchange student on an University (9 months in Florida, 1 month in California).

I have to say I loved the country and the people. I will just make a list of whatever comes to the top of my head:

-Free water at restaurants: I was U21 at the time, and not a fan of soda, it was amazing having free water.

-Sports: I really liked how involved people are with sports in the US. Go to a High School/University and you will see lots of teams from different sports, and a bunch of competitions. I studied at a relatively small University, and yet there was still A LOT of sport events going on, both competitive and just for fun. I played a bunch of different sports on small tournaments and have been fitter than ever while living there.

-Music/Movie Industry: Most of my favorite bands are from the USA. You have contributed a lot to the world of music. Don't even need to mention about movies.

-People: Can't tell if I was a lucky, but everyone seemed super friendly. At the University everyone was super helpful and friendly. I noticed Americans love complimenting others (hey nice shirt or hey I like your hair) and that's really cool. Also everyone looked very chill and open to talking. 

-National parks: I did some camping and visited some national parks. They are all amazing. All very conserved, and wit great structure for visitors.

-You know how put a great show: some people might disagree, but you guys know how to put a great show. The basketball game from my University didn't even mean a lot, but it was so entertaining due to all the gigs added to make it more fun.

-Grocery stores: I know people make a lot of fun, but I loved going to those big stores like Walmart or Target. I could find every fucking thing I needed.

-Food portions size: I miss eating a lot. From restaurant portions to bags of chips in the supermarket. I am sad I can't find 2kg MMs packages where I live :(

Anyways, I loved my time there. Wish I could move and live in the US. You guys rock

1767,"A few years ago I went to a baseball game with my family, Sunday day game in July or August and sitting in seats that could not possibly get less shade, so it was pretty miserable to begin with. In the 3rd inning a bachelorette party of maybe 10 with more coming later rolls in. They're light beer drunk at 2:30, so things quickly get obnoxious. Turns out that behind us is a group of four deuchebags who by the 7th inning decide to initiate contact with the women, who are by this point drinking liquor (I assume) from sunscreen bottles and occasionally running off to throw up. Because there is no room to move, deuchebag 1 asks my father to pass a note with the guy's phone number to one of the women. My father, being polite, asks which one, the guy points to what is clearly the bride. So, my father, mildly oblivious and very foreign, obliges. The woman is initially startled and kind of disgusted, thinking it's from my father but he points to the muscle shirt guy behind him. She does something along the lines of winking and licking her lips at the guy.   It's very awkward for everyone around as they visibly start texting each other. A bit later they meet up in the aisle and walk off as two of the other women go to the bathroom. Dexter Fowler then hits a walk off single in the 10th, so I don't know how the story ended.

It's not crazy or *that* bad per se, but I vividly recall it because of the awkwardness of my dad having to be the intermediary."

1774,"Working security in am over-under club.

early in the evening it's under 21 with no alcohol.

Later the kids get cleared out and alcohol is served.

During the changeover there was a mix of drunks arriving from other clubs, and tweens waiting for their parents.

in the crowd a drunk guy in his 40's got a 13 yo girl against a wall and VERY forcefully penetrated her with his fingers.

She was in absolute hysterics.

Professional standards would require us to use no force, because he was cooperating.

We beat him pretty hard, right there on the dance floor.

But we maintained enough professionalism to not ""throw him out the back door"" as the crowd was requesting. I'm pretty sure they would have beat him to death, at the very least unintentionally.

When we got him to the street the pervert told the cops and the sidewalk crowd that we had beat him up.

Unfortunately for him, the police had already encountered the victim.

They cuffed him.

Then they asked him, loudly enough for the whole crowd to hear ""Did they rough you up?""

When he said ""yes""

The officer said ""Did it look something like this?""

...then he grabbed the back of the handcuffed guy's head and smashed his face on the patrol car hood about 6 times hard enough to break his nose and dent the hood.

There was a fair amount of blood, and the guy was dazed and semi conscious.

The other cop proudly announced to the crowd ""this is what happens to people who attack kids""

Then they told the pervert ""Don't worry, we'll have you at County (Jail) in a couple of hours.""

County was about 5 minutes away, and the cops left heading the opposite direction.

I guess they took him to a field and beat him as much as they could.

The guy ate shit at sentencing, he didn't even get concurrent sentencing."

**REDNECK:** Why?    
**GIRL:** How are you going to ride a horse when your head is shoved so far up your ass?

*The redneck sputters and grows red in the face. After a moment of this, he angrily turns back to Max.*

**REDNECK:** Yeah, well, how about I shove my head in *this* gay fucker's ass?!    
**MAX:** See, I knew you were interested!

The guy eventually decided to leave, but not before trying to goad me into a fight and making another pass at the young woman in my company. I couldn't help but laugh at the whole situation, because unbeknownst to the redneck, the girl was actually a lesbian. I mean... it figures, right?

Anyway, it certainly wasn't the most effective comeback, but it ranks up there with the best I've heard.

I've seen many accidents where people died because of their rash driving but one incident stands out and scares me even now.

Two youngsters on a bike with no helmets were driving rashly at 90kmph and they decided not to slow down on a curve, so the guy who was driving it tried to overtake some car from the left but hit the car's side mirror and fell down, their heads hit the ground and they split open with all their brains being spilled out. It was a horrible sight.

Wow - did not expect all the great replies! Thanks for all the comments guys.  Thought I'd share a little more regarding this.  I was 17-18 (25 now) when this occurred and we were both into different things.  She liked to go get drunk and go clubbing while I was more of 'sit down at a bar with a few drinks and have a chat'.  At the start, I did try to impress her by going with her to these clubs and whatnot, but eventually gave up which most likely gave her the urge to look for a different partner. She was very rude for my liking anyhow but as she was this popular girl, I thought I'd give it a try.

After reading some of the comment further - I usually do not have the patience to argue about a point.  She liked the satisfaction when I agreed with her, but when I didn't she gets upset because I would just be calm about it and say we both had different opinions.

Listen to what I want. Show me all the cool shit it can do. Show me features. Show me what makes it safer, and better than other products. Be honest about the downsides of it. 

This is how I ended up with my new car not long ago. Went to look at a different car from their website, but it had been sold. So I gave the sales guy my requirements for a car, and my price range. He brought out 3 cars, keys, and specs. Then he told me, ""We can drive all 3 of these if you want. They're all in the same price range, with the around the same mileage. But based on everything you've told me, I think you want this one."" Then told me why. I still looked at the others. But he was right. I bought the one he said I would like best. He even told me the things he didn't like, but that I had said weren't a selling point anyway.

Instead I used my lady voice to say key words like ""Please call the police!"" And ""Stuck outside!"".

2035,"During my university years, a computer science student set up a network server for people to share files. Eventually it went to include not only school related materials just as course work, but also music. As time went by, the server grew and grew, to include games, software, movies, and TV shows. Now this was in a country where piracy laws aren't that strict, so the university ignored the server. We would use a software like DC++ to log on to the server, and just copy the files we wanted. At one point, he was updating the files daily, via torrent. So every TV show that was popular in 2005 was there, with new episodes every week. It marked an era of binge watching in the dorms that led to a LOT of students failing their courses (maybe that's why the university left it, so they can get more money from students retaking courses). Everyone knew him by his username, ShadowLord, but few people knew the guy in person. He was one of the nicest people on campus (it was small, at that time around 5,000 students), but also a slow burner student, took around 8 years to finish his class, and wasn't always on campus because he was in his room or off-campus somewhere. Eventually only the students who were in his classes/dorm/entered with him (my batch) knew who he was, as all his friends graduated and only new students were left on campus. But the legend of ShadowLord grew and grew. 

So he graduated in my batch, after taking 3 years longer than planned. They call out his name so he can receive his degree, and people in the crowd clapped a little. But the students sitting down started murmuring his name, ""that's ShadowLord, guys that's ShadowLord"", and slowly, there was a thunderous applause from the graduating students.

And then everyone clapped.

 It went on for a full 5 minutes, delaying the whole ceremony because of the noise. People in the crowd had no idea what happened, but they clapped as well. It was glorious.

2098,"I was working a case because I‚Äôm a lawyer and that‚Äôs what I do. Anyway, my paralegal just had her first kid so I was alone and had to go into court by myself. She usually refreshes me on each case before we go in and so I was looking over the papers instead. We were representing a guy who was being charged for cruelty inflicted upon a minor. Not my proudest day, but there was some room to get the charges lessened based on circumstance of the situation and no prior record of him behaving this way. So basically what happened was, he was in a grocery store and a kid was pushing around one of the children grocery carts that some stores have and the child‚Äôs mom had a real cart alongside the kid. My client comes into the aisle and the two carts are blocking the entire aisle and usually children‚Äôs carts have little flags that help other people see them, this one didn‚Äôt, which helped my case a little. He sees the other cart and goes to the other side ‚Äúnot seeing the child‚Äôs cart‚Äù and bumps into it, apparently he thought that this was the ladies cart, because he was looking at cereal and not looking down, when he hits the cart he pushes, because he thought the lady was on his side of the aisle, and this pushes the kid right on his ass, and the kid ends up going to the hospital. Anyway after the kid falls over and he sees what he has done he doesn‚Äôt respond apologetically and instead asks the lady why they‚Äôre blocking the entire aisle and why the kid needs a cart in the first place. Meanwhile the kid has injured his head and is crying on the floor. By now he‚Äôs pissed and the kids cart was pushed forward and he had room to go through so he continues to walk down the aisle, with seemingly no regret, and ends up running over the kids hand in the meantime. Now the mom is pissed because it seemed on purpose. That‚Äôs the back story of what happened. 

So now we‚Äôre in court and I‚Äôm talking to him and still seems to not have any regret about what happened and is mad at the mom for letting the kid have a cart and taking up the aisle. This was a flag for me to not let him talk during court at all, or have him testify. Anyway the mom is brought on the stand by the prosecution and she‚Äôs telling the story of what happened and all the injuries that this poor kid sustained, I don‚Äôt remember exactly how many, but a bruised skull and at least one broken bone in the hand. While she‚Äôs talking about the injuries he makes a ‚ÄúPfft‚Äù loud enough for the judge and mother to here. I‚Äôm thinking in my head ‚Äúoh fuck.‚Äù The mother on the stand does the mom ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù...‚Äùdo you have something to say‚Äù and I stand up and say ‚Äúsorry about that ma‚Äôam, he didn‚Äôt mean anythi‚Äî‚Äú before I can finish my sentence he says ‚Äúyeah‚Äù this is where he goes beyond stupid ruining the case and making things worse. 

‚ÄúIf you had parented your kid better he wouldn‚Äôt have been in my way and none of this would‚Äôve happened‚Äù (something like that)

The mom responds with a second ‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù he then repeats the same exact stupid sentence he just said. By then the judge is slamming his gavel telling them to basically shut up. 

The mom responds, ‚ÄúNo. No. (to the judge, like ‚ÄòI got this‚Äô putting up a finger to him) Maybe if you had paid attention he wouldn‚Äôt have been knocked over, and maybe if you stayed where you were, instead of continuing on with your day, you wouldn‚Äôt have ran over my kids fucking hand‚Äù

The judge is now freaking out at the both of them. 

My client then responds, ‚ÄúI wish it was you on the fucking ground, I would have made sure it was worse than a couple of broken fingers‚Äù (what a fucking idiot)

The mom is now speechless and doesn‚Äôt respond long enough that I have time to say as calmly as I could, ‚ÄúYour honor, if you don‚Äôt mind, could we have a brief recess.‚Äù I wanted to pull him by the ear and tell him what an idiot he is. 

Edit: He got off very easy for the amount of damage done (in criminal court) the main reason being that it was seen as accidental (and was pretty much accidental). He got community service and a $500 fine with 6 months (very light) ARD probationary period he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten anything had he stayed with the kid and apologized after the fact instead of trying to leave the scene and then running over the kids hand. Where he really got his ass kicked was in the civil suit the mother filed. The medical expenses were not cheap, the kid had to get an MRI and a bunch of other tests, on top of that she got some money for emotional damages. I think she also tried to sue the grocery store because that specific cart didn‚Äôt have the flag on it like the rest of them did, not sure of the outcome though. "

Some idiot tried to prove my point by saying, ""Nah, we just don‚Äôt care after we got ours...truthbomb"". Why would women even bother trying to give their men the real deal when their men don't care?! 


If a man is receptive of a woman telling him she's not being pleased, and accepts her suggestions, then he most likely won't be getting fake orgasms. That cervix bludgeoning, throat choking stuff you did with your ex that drove her wild might not work with your next.

It literally just means involuntarily celibate, or in other words, a person who wants to have sex but is incapable of finding a romantic partner. So, to a person who fits that definition, it can be incredibly alienating to have no real outlet that doesn't involve the negative connotation being in that group implies. I say this as someone who had this issue until age 25, but was never misogynistic, bitter towards women, or anything like that. But I still spent time on places like /r/foreveralone because those were the only people that I felt could truly understand what that was like.

After working for 4 months, earning below minimum wage, and working from 7 in the morning to 10 at night (with ~2 hours break) and 1 day off a week, I had enough money to travel abroad. My parents tried to stop me. My father's words: ""The morning I was supposed to drive you to the airport, I was very close to just refusing and keep you here forever"" (I grew up in an island, so not many ways I could travel away).

After a lot of adventures and trouble, about 2 years later, I found my dream job and living my life exactly how I dreamed it when I was 14. My father actually called me a couple of weeks ago and apologized for the way he treated me, without me telling him anything. He said he always considered me a loser, and that I'd be a fail in life, and his plans for me was to survive using his retirement money. He told me multiple times that when he sent me to a college it was because ""You'd just go there and play a little bit, then you'll come back"" also ""I want people to think that I sent you to a college, so that they don't gossip"".

I'm not sure if my parents ever understood the reasons I left. I told them clearly that I'm not going to stay and I'm going to chase my dreams, no matter what, and they didn't believe me. My father still believes I'll return back one day, but I've told him multiple times that even if they pay me double the salary, I'm just not going to do that.

How did  that impact them? My father was dreaming the rest of his life with me, he is now living alone (my mother divorced him), asking me to come back in exchange of 1 house and 1 shop that I can rent and ""live without working"" (which for a lot of reasons I'm just not going to do it).

My mother never supported me, I'd always spend my free time studying my hobby, but she would always shout at me to stop doing that because ""it's just a hobby, not a job"". Ever since I left, she was worried and asking me to come back, going as far as trying to yell at me to return home. She is in a better place now thought, she calls me every so often telling me she is proud that I'm successful.

To be fair, even if I had more supportive parents, I think I'd still make similar decisions. I left to chase a career that just didn't exist where I grew up, so it was inevitable."

2149,"Some of my favorite moments were the simplest ones where you were just allowed to take as much time with the guests as needed because sometimes it was kind of obvious who needed the most magic.

Once I was hanging out with Mickey at a character dining experience and this mother and daughter were there. The father (who'd been meant to come on the trip) had just recently passed away, and they had this nice framed photo of him with them they wanted the characters to take pictures with. Mickey had been his favorite. I was able to sit at the table with them, hold the photo, try to make as positive an experience as possible in that bittersweet moment. There were few things that meant as much as managing to make that little girl laugh. 

There were so many moments like this--literally happening every day, where people who are at their lowest are trying their best to find a little joy and you need to be the one to bring it to them. 

Of course there were plenty of cute, fun interactions too. Like the babies who'd refuse to let go of you because they think the characters are gigantic stuffed animals and the kids who realize that when Mickey's signed their book twice and his autograph is the same, he's real. And their eyes and smiles get so wide. "

2175,"Be prepared for the psychological barriers you will face if you are dieting. People will pressure you to eat badly all the time without really realizing it - when you go over to your parents' for Thanksgiving, when your co-workers go out for drinks and wings after work, when your partner wants to go out to eat and celebrate something, when you go over to a friends' house for a dinner party. 

People think they are being nice to you when they say that one piece of cake or big meal won't kill you and you should just go for it. In other circumstances, they just won't realize that are making you feel like a diva or a wet blanket when you don't eat what they clearly want you to. You have to be prepared for these curveballs or they can undo everything.

Most diets are designed for you to be able to construct your meals basically from scratch at home, or consume something prepackaged. But for many people their lifestyle and social life just can't accommodate that enough. You need to learn to have backup plans that don't make you feel like an ass or a killjoy. Plans can involve eating before, deciding what you eat when you get there, and how to talk to other people about it so everyone is comfortable. It takes some effort, but you get the hang of it pretty fast if you work on it."

He's had his entire life catered to, he has no real education, no real knowledge of how the world works, and while he's got a decade or so of continuing to live in the limelight as he's pursued by everyone who knows him from the show, and the media wanting to treat him like the celebrity he is, his life will be hell.  He'll push back against the constant paparazzi immediately after, slowly agree to start making some appearances for pay, when he realizes that he's got no money to live off of.  Start to worry when those offers start drying up, and then, finally end up as a bum that people vaguely recognize as ""that guy that was on that show."""

Find time every week to do something for you and let mom do the same. Get a baby sitter (as hard as that is) and go on dates every other week or so. You may need to wait a few months to start this. But make it a routine. It rekindles your relationship in an extremely powerful way. Even just having dinner resets a lot of frustration. But do enjoy the moments. They are precious. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take photos and videos and share them. Read all the time. Limit screen time. Spend time outside. Make stuff. Make mistakes. And it does get easier.

So we end up sleeping in the same bed together, and I stayed there every night for like a month straight, she would always change in front of me facing the opposite direction, and we hung out all the time. It got to a point where I wanted to make a move but this had been going on so long that I didn't even know how to do it. So I never pursued it and she started dating a guy and stopped hanging out with us completely, another girl that was close to her later told me that she really liked me, my heart sank because she was already then married to this guy and I realized how much of an idiot I was and was pissed she didn't say anything to me at the time."

2344,"LO/TO fuckups were a fire-able offense when I worked in a plant. One violation and done.  


I was a 21 year old engineering intern in a pilot plant where they worked us to death with little supervision, honestly it was a horrible job. Once we were up against a tight deadline and the mixing impeller came loose and fell out in one of our small tanks. My boss was the only one who could lock it out and he was in meetings all day, so since it was a small impeller (not much bigger than a drill) and literally a 30 second fix (one screw) I had the other intern cut the breaker and just watch it while I fixed it. As luck would have it my boss managed to walk in during those 30 seconds so I got reprimanded pretty hard. Fortunately I always had great performance evaluations and was well liked, so I didn't get fired, but I definitely could have been and they made me attend some safety meetings as punishment.  


I understand the reason for the rules and why I was reprimanded, I shouldn't have done it. But what pissed me off is there were a lot of much more dangerous things going on in the plant on a daily basis that I complained about often, but they were never taken seriously because the company didn't want to invest the money or effort into fixing them. There was an uninsulated high-pressure steam line at face level that I had to complain about so many times before it got fixed. The steam lines didn't have enough condensate traps and weren't sloped properly so every time the steam was turned on to a piece of equipment the whole line would shake and knock like it was going to break. The space was retrofitted to be a chemical plant, so there was totally inadequate drainage which would lead to mold growth on the floors, which was not only unsanitary but made the floor slick as snot and a falling hazard.

- 1: Always treat a gun as if it's loaded.

- 2: Never rest your finger on the trigger unless you plan to shoot.

- 3: Never point a gun at something you do not plan to kill.

2417,"So there was a fairly popular convention here locally called Nerdacon. For about 9 or so years they had their con held on a local college campus and due to the increasing popularity of the con they began charging a small admission to get in and expanded to another area of the campus beyond the rec center. Totally fine until the next year, 2015, they decided to hold the con in a local convention center. Again, not a bad decision in and of itself since it makes sense that you'd have to expand, but everything that could go wrong did go wrong.

For starters, there were two other events happening at the convention center in addition to the con itself: A wedding reception in the grand ballroom and a gun show. This condensed the entire con to one floor, including the artist alley and vendor hall only having half as many booths as they used to, panels had to be cut short as there were not enough rooms for them to be held, and the biggest space they could hold for the rave and cosplay contest could only hold around 400 including contestants, audience, and staff members. To put the icing on the cake, during the raffle in the end of the cosplay contest, they pulled a Steve Harvey and announced the wrong ticket and embarrassed the poor guy who had the ""winning"" ticket. It was terrible as Nerdacon was almost like a homecoming for some of my old friends and to see a once great con turn to utter shite whether it was entirely their fault or not hurt.

They tried it again the next year but I decided not to attend after the blunder of 2015 still fresh on my mind. Last year they couldn't even hold it due to unforeseen circumstances and someone else had to create a new con from scratch to rise from the ashes which in all fairness was leaps and bounds better."

2509,"My parents own some land in very rural Colorado and I would use it to camp on sometimes because it‚Äôs free camping so why not! Occasionally I would invite friends to come with me and nothing strange had happened before this incident. Due to circumstances my friend and I had to drive separately and I got there before her, set up camp, and waited. And waited. I kept waiting and my friend never showed up. I was obviously concerned but wanted to stick around in case she did show up. I waited until morning and then finally packed up camp and got back into service range to find out what the fuck had happened. 

Now, this part of the story I wasn‚Äôt there for since I was already on the land, but apparently my friend was driving around looking for the plot and she just could not find it no matter what. She definitely got there after me but said she didn‚Äôt see my car anywhere or any signs that someone was on the land. I parked in a spot where no one would be able to miss me specifically so that she could find it easily. So she kept driving around and started coming across all these ultra-religious creepy ass billboards that were warning about hell and damnation and all that fun stuff, which creeped her enough out that she turned around and just drove back home. Most people would think that she just went down the wrong road and that is what I thought too until we reconnected later and went over the map and she described the area. There was no way she wasn‚Äôt in the right spot. The area she described perfectly matched where I was and she went down all the right roads but somehow got teleported into a creepy religious nightmare. I‚Äôve been in the area a lot and I‚Äôve never seen anything like she was talking about with those billboards.

2536,"The top would have to be my Father In Law that I just met.  

My husband barely knew his father. The guy left his Mom when he was young and moved to Florida and married a much younger woman.  After that he didn't even call to wish a Happy Birthday. The guy was lazy and a terrible father. So 5 years into my relationship with my husband comes.  His Father whom we will call Joe,  called him and said he was moving back to Michigan and needed a job. My husband manages to get him a job at his work making good money. Then Joe says he needs a place to live until they can find a house. My husband invited him to stay with us without consulting with me. He said he just couldn't tell him No. 

Mind you the house we were renting had only 3 bedrooms and his sister already was living in one room. Which meant our small son was going to be in our room until Joe left.  I didn't even know this guy or his wife, my husband had not seen him in 8 years,  and there he was living in our house. 

So Joe proceeded to wait for my husband to fall asleep one day and grabbed his phone,  went through the photos,  and sent my NUDE PHOTOS to his own phone for his viewing pleasure later. I only found out because my phone wasn't working and I asked Joe's wife to use there's for a call.  I open my husband's name and the last few texts are my naked photos. I freaked out. 

On top of this, when Joe and my husband were driving to work one day they both managed to get tickets for no seatbelt.  Joe tells us he is going to the office to pay his ticket.  So my husband asks if he gives him the money, can he also pay his while there.  Joe agrees.  The ticket money was $70. 

Two years later my husband gets pulled over and finds out his licence has been suspended for awhile.  He is confused and asks why,  and the cop says he never paid a seatbelt ticket way back. Joe pocketed the money and never paid it. Mind you that Joe didn't have to pay us rent at all,  and was making $650 a week in cash. By him doing that he costed us $2,000 in paying off all the fines and everything. The worst fucking person I ever came across. 

Side Stories: He made his wife put his shoes on for him and take them off.  He treated her like a literal slave.  He viewed woman as worth nothing. He would yell at my 8 month old son for crying in the middle of the night. He would tell me to ""shut my kid up."" "

Plus it's an interesting talking point once people find out.

There's a few things that you really have to adjust too though, the main one is showering at the gym or using pubic restrooms if the need comes up. Both can be included if you get a big enough van/ are willing to sacrifice other aspects of you're living space.

2711,"When I was in middle school my Grandmother had stayed the night as my parents were away on vacation. She comes in at 3 am and says, ""Stimp, do you have any friends over?"" I tell her no and she walks down the hallway. Confused, i roll back over to go back to bed when i hear something that sounds like breathing from behind my door.

""Hello?"" I called out, only to be greeted by a shadowy figure appearing from behind my door. From the light in the hallway, I could see it was a tall Hispanic man in a leather jacket, who then looked over to me and said, ""You alright? You good?"" Me, completely flabergasted and downright confused mutter out a quick, ""Yep,"" and try my hardest not to freak out. Then this guy walks over and sits on my bed, looks at me and says, ""Do you want me to let your dogs out for you?"" 

Now mind you I was going through a phase where I slept in the nude, so i'm chilling here in the buff with a random dude sitting on my bed. I eventually repond with a, ""Uhh no they're fine. Do you need help getting out?"" To which he nods his head and walks out of my room. 

I quickly throw on some sweatpants and go down the hallway to the front door where I see him struggling to open the door handle. ""You gotta push then pull,"" I tell him,  and he eventually gets it open. He runs out the front down some stairs, as a cop car drives onto our property. At this point he sees the cop, turns around, and runs right into our basement (we lived in a raised ranch). 

The cop calls out to me, ""Hey, does that guy live here?"" I shake my head no and he gets his K9 out of his car and lets him loose into the basement. 

After 10 minutes of searching they gave up, he apparently got out through a window and they never caught him. A bunch of cars were broken into on our street, and a gas station saw him trying to get into the front door. 

All in all a pretty fun experience, 9/10 would do it again just for the PTSD it gave me for a few years.

By the time I was hired, the owner had basically left the store under my best friend. He would come in, take the broken consoles for repair, and drop off snacks that we sold. It was the most fun I had working to this day. Since my friend was my boss we just hung out there, even on the other person's day off. Although we goofed around, we had loyal customers and provided top-notch customer service. I learned so much about video games there. One day, the small strip we were located in increased the rent. Instead of leaving the store open or move it, the owner decided he was done. I couldn't blame the guy, we weren't a HUGE money-maker. He was also a very successful architect. We bought a lot of stuff at discounted prices. Stuff I dont think i could have found anywhere else. Not the only time I stayed at a store that went out of business.

There was also a movie theater on the second floor of that marketplace. I also worked there, and then THAT went out of business as well. The crew there was like a family, we would hang out outside work all the time. I was only there for like 4 or 5 months but it was great. On the last day, we all took home a shit ton of movie posters.

Dig a big trench above the high tide mark at the beach. Have a bon fire with some big flat stones in the fire. Spread coals and now blazing hot stones in the trench.

The summary described the plot as a mother dealing with a son in a car accident whose personality drastically changed for the worse. The accident happens within the first few pages, and from there, the mother is obsessively thinking about what's going to happen. Basically just worried questions. The problem was that the author wrote out the thoughts every 2-3 paragraphs, abd never varied the questions. It basically read like ""and then I went to the car. *question 1 question 2 question 3* and then I drove down the road *q1 q2 q3* and then I arrived in the parking lot... ad infinitum""

2815,"The myth that Titanic was in any way badly designed, badly built, or badly operated by the standards of the time. In fact there are so many ridiculous inaccuracies surrounding Titanic that it's hard to list even a fraction of them here...

* She was an incredibly seaworthy ship - much more so than any passenger ship around today. The iceberg tore a gash almost a third of the way down her side, and she still stayed afloat for more than two hours!

* In that time, all but two of her lifeboats were launched - there wasn't time to launch any more. She could have had a hundred more lifeboats on board, but that wouldn't have helped without vastly more crew to operate them.

* Titanic's passengers genuinely did believe that she was practically unsinkable. When the time came to begin loading the lifeboats, many thought they would be safer staying on Titanic. There wasn't time for the crew to wait around convincing more people to get in, so when a lifeboat was ready, if there was no-one else waiting to get in, it had to go. This is why so many of Titanic's lifeboats left only half-full - the crew weren't worried about over-filling them.

* Titanic wasn't travelling too fast for the conditions - by the standards of practice around at the time. Further precautions were put into practice after the incident, but no-one on board can be blamed for doing what anyone on any ship would have done the same.

* Titanic was by no means a fast ship - nor was she ever intended to be. The White Star Line (Titanic's owners) were in competition with one other big shipping line, Cunard. Cunard's liners (Mauretania, Lusitania and later Aquatania) were the fastest in the business. To combat this, instead of fighting for speed, White Star decided to try to make their liners the most luxurious in the world. Olympic and Titanic were famed for their splendour and comfort - passengers said that it was easy to forget that you were at sea, as there were very few vibrations from the engines, and the ships remained stable even in fairly rough seas. By comparison, Cunard's liners were very fast, but their quadruple-screw configuration made vibration more apparent. It's a myth that Titanic was ever trying to make record-breaking speed across the Atlantic.

* She wasn't built using sub-standard materials. This rumour goes around a lot these days because of an article that was written some time ago - what the article is supposed to mean is that there is much better quality steel available today. This was not the case in 1909. Additionally, Titanic's builders were paid on a fee plus materials basis - they were given a set fee to construct the ship, plus the cost of *all* materials used. There was no incentive to use anything but the best steel they could get their hands on. The shipyard had an excellent reputation and would not risk tainting it by using bad steel, which could easily be noticed on inspection anyway.

* Titanic and her two sister ships Olympic and Britannic were also surprisingly manoeuvrable for their size - much more so than was expected. Some will tell you that Titanic's rudder was too small, but this simply isn't true. In fact, Olympic's wartime captain marvelled at her manoeuvrability, and was even able to throw her into a sudden turn, ramming (and sinking) a German U-boat. Olympic was the only merchant vessel throughout the First World War recorded to have sunk an enemy vessel.

* While it's true that the lookouts' binoculars were misplaced (or rather, locked away in a cabinet that no-one on board had the key to open), this made no difference to Titanic's fate. The images of sea captains and pirates scanning the horizon through telescopes, while common in films, has virtually no stead in reality. Binoculars and telescopes narrow your field of vision down to a fine point, making it harder to spot anything. Lookouts on real ships will use their eyes alone to search for objects of interest, and once they've been spotted, will use a set of binoculars to further inspect it. Titanic's lookouts would not have been using their binoculars to search for iceberg even if they'd had them.

* Third class passengers were never trapped below decks - the big metal gates you might remember from the film never even existed. The only time passengers were kept below decks was near the beginning of the disaster, when the officers needed time to prepare the lifeboats. First and second class passengers were allowed on deck, but as there were so many more third-class passengers the crowd was asked to stay below for a short while, until the officers were ready to start loading lifeboats. No-one was ever locked up. In fact a higher percentage of third-class males survived the sinking than second-class males.

* Titanic was the largest ship in the world, but not by much - her older sister Olympic was identical in almost every way. A few changes to Titanic's layout (including the covering up of some promenade decks, making them count as interior space) made her technically larger, but both ships were exactly the same length, breadth and height. Olympic had a GRT (gross registered tonnage) of 45,324 gross register tons. Titanic's GRT was some 1,000 tons greater. After the disaster, Olympic received a refit, after which her GRT was up to about 30 more than Titanic's had been. But Titanic's younger sister, Britannic, which was launched after the disaster and had been modified during construction as a result of it, was about 2 feet wider than her sisters and had a GRT more than 2,000 tons greater than Titanic's.

* White Star Line's owner, Bruce Ismay, likely had nothing to do with the incident. Another myth popularised by the film is that Ismay had convinced Captain Smith to sail faster and try to get to New York in record time. He's also portrayed as a bumbling idiot, and sneaks onto a lifeboat when the officers aren't looking. While we'll never know whether or not Ismay really did discuss Titanic's schedule with Smith, it's incredibly unlikely - Smith was looking to retire after commanding Titanic, had an extremely good reputation, and was a much-loved public figure. Passengers scrambled to sail on a ship under his command. He is unlikely to have been swayed to make rash decisions based on Ismay's need for Titanic to make headlines. Ismay himself played an active role during the sinking, helping passengers into lifeboats and doing what he could where possible (one officer recalled telling him to get out of the way as he was making a nuisance of himself by getting involved, but testified that he was trying to help). Ismay stepped into an empty spot on  one of the last boats to leave the ship, just as it was preparing to lower. He didn't take anyone else's space. Unfortunately the media needed a scapegoat, and he was the highest-ranking official to survive the disaster. He adopted a secluded lifestyle after the disaster, funding several naval charities but otherwise staying out of the public eye.

* Higher watertight compartments or compartments sealed at the top would not have saved the ship - Most people could tell you that Titanic sunk because the weight of the water in the foremost watertight compartments pulled the bow down, allowing the water to spill over the top into more compartments, and so-on throughout the ship. But had Titanic's watertight bulkhead walls run all the way to the top deck, she might actually have sunk faster - with so much water contained in the front third of the vessel, she would have begun to tilt forwards much earlier, and possibly have broken in two sooner than she did. Sealing the tops of the bulkheads to prevent water from spilling over is actually illegal, and still is today. The International SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) Regulations state that no civil (non-military) vessel can have any obstruction above watertight compartments that could impede a passenger's escape. The bottom line is that Titanic was damaged beyond her specifications, and was doomed from the moment she hit the iceberg.

* ""Full Astern"" - There's a belief (popularised by the film) that Titanic's engines were thrown full astern on sighting the iceberg, and that this may have hindered her ability to turn away from it. This rumour started because of evidence given by the fourth officer, who who wasn't even on the bridge at the time of the collision. The only survivor who was present was the quartermaster, but from his position in the wheelhouse he couldn't see the commands sent to the engine room on the bridge telegraphs. Survivors from the engine room and the boiler rooms attested that the command was ""stop"" rather than ""astern"". Whoever you choose to believe, when you think about the timescale it really makes very little difference. There was less than 40 seconds between the iceberg sighting and the collision - and in that time, the lookouts had to ring the bell, pick up the phone, wait for 6th officer Moody to enter the wheelhouse and answer it, and alert him to the iceberg; then, Moody relayed that order to the most senior officer on the bridge (1st Officer Murdoch); Murdoch ordered the turn to port, then crossed to the telegraph to send the order to stop. Try acting that out in real time, and work out how long the engineers had to act on the ""stop"" order - not long enough. There's a really good article explaining exactly what went on in the engine rooms [here]( http://www.uco.es/~ff1mumuj/titanic1.htm); this goes into a lot more detail than I can, and comes to the same conclusions. Long story short - there wasn't even enough time to stop the engines, let alone put them in reverse. Slowing down or keeping full-ahead would have had no difference, as the turning circle stays the same. Leaving the starboard engine running may have turned Titanic's bow away from the iceberg, but it would have made it more difficult to keep the stern away. "

*The GANG are gathered around DONALD TRUMP, who is wrapped in an American flag that has been used as a makeshift restraint. He glares up at the group.*

**TRUMP:** Let me tell you, it's... and a lot of people are saying this, you know, I hear it all the time: They say that when people are captured ‚Äì it's one thing to be captured, I always say, everyone knows that, but it doesn't always happen ‚Äì it's because, well, they've been captured. I've never been captured. That's not something that... some people have tried to capture me, but I tell them, I say...

*Once again, Fred yanks on Trump's hair. More of it comes away, along with a mass of orange grease.*

**DAPHNE:** Yuck! It looks like some kind of sludge!

*Velma steps forward and touches the cheese-colored ooze on Fred's fingers. She examines it closely.*

**VELMA:** It's oil! It's some kind of... spray tan!     
**TRUMP:** I have the best tan. The best. Everyone knows it. Everyone keeps saying it, they say...

*Scooby shoves a handful of Scooby Snacks into Trump's mouth.*

**SHAGGY:** Like, talk about a waste of perfectly good food.     
**VELMA:** And time.    
**FRED:** Well, let's not waste any more of it, gang. Let's see who he *really* is!

**DAPHNE:** Yuck! It looks like some kind of sludge!     
**FRED:** I think you're repeating yourself.     
**DAPHNE:** Well, it was relevant again.

*Trump finally chokes down the last of the Scooby Snacks.*

**TRUMP:** You think you've won? You haven't won. Nobody wins. I'm a winner, okay? I got away with it, even in spite of you meddling kids. I always get away with it. I got away with it, and I...

*Fred clocks Trump over the head with a flagpole, rendering him unconscious.*

**SHAGGY:** Zoinks!    
**FRED:** Well, gang, that's another mystery solved!     
**VELMA:** I'm not so sure. *Someone* had to be behind all of this. Why else would Trump try to close the library?    
**FRED:** Let's leave that for Robert Mueller to figure out.

We can guide them with questions, make non-judgmental open ended statements such as ""you really read a lot about mental health, do you feel that is helpful to you? What do you gain from reading all those materials""? Or ""Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental illness or mental health issue by a professional""? Or they tell me about a behavior they have and I can say ""well that sounds totally understandable""  


You also can't say 'quit your bullshit' lol there are so many protective things clients hide behind, they fall into telling a story instead of focusing on themselves, they say the phrase I don't know over and over to avoid feeling something, they intellectualize feelings instead of feeling them.

We can guide them, but not correct them, we aim to educate clients by direction not correction. It can be a bit trying at times, though when it works by direction and comes from the client and not me, it is immensely more impacting and they have a far better chance of integrating what they have learned in a session into their life.

And listen to Gryffindors when they made speeches.

Instead of making sure that young Slytherins would feel welcome, that they actually have a place to run away from home, if they don't want to join the Dark Lord, what did Dumbledore do? He allowed the Weasley twins to bully first year olds Slytherins and laughed when they were proud of it."

This idea that UK citizens have no freedom of speech or expression needs to die in a fire.

EDIT: To be clear, it's probably fair to say the UK has stricter rules on freedom of speech than the US does, for better or worse. That's not what I'm arguing against, I'm saying it's clearly ludicrous to suggest the UK doesn't have freedom of speech *at all.* We can discuss whether the UK's restrictions are a good thing or a bad thing, (personally, I think they're generally a good thing although sometimes there are exceptions), but that's my opinion - yours may be different, especially if you're from the US. Claiming that the UK is some sort of dystopian totalitatian hellscape where people routinely get locked up for saying the wrong thing or browsing the wrong website is completely ludicrous, though."

- Clean your body up. Clip your nails, brush/floss/mouthwash, manscape your pubes a little bit, throw on a dash (but only a small dash) of cologne, etc.

- Eat nice and lightly that day - skip the hot wings or spicy curry at dinner. For her pleasure, eat some pineapple for a few days beforehand.

- Take it slow and make the buildup/foreplay last a little bit of time (shoot for at least 15 minutes or so). Chicks generally take a little more time than we do to get fully aroused and worked up. Brush your fingers along her body, lightly kiss her collarbone and under her ear. The best part of sex for me is when the girl guides your hand downstairs because she can‚Äôt wait any more. Fucking awesome!

- Keep a jar of coconut oil next to the bed. It‚Äôs better lube than almost anything else on the market. You only need a little bit!

- When you‚Äôre actually having intercourse, go slowly and deeply. She‚Äôll let you know when she‚Äôs ready for hard fucking.  Protip: it drives some chicks wild if you fully pull out in the middle of some slow fucking and enter back in until she is completely full of you."

And this isn't even an opinion, it's a fact that the [American Psychiatric Association](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx) agrees with:

&gt; Sex is assigned at birth, refers to one‚Äôs biological status as either male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes such as chromosomes, hormone prevalence, and external and internal anatomy. **Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for boys and men or girls and women.** These influence the ways that people act, interact, and feel about themselves. While aspects of biological sex are similar across different cultures, aspects of gender may differ.

3208,"Late to the party, but this is too good not to share.

A friend of mine organised a bachelor party for another friend, and we were having it in one of the attendees' beachside apartment.

We had gone paintballing, and then gone back to the apartment for bbq, booze and they had organised 2 strippers.

The first one was great. Her name was Daisy and she was bubbly, funny, entertaining and joined in the fun. We had 2 hours with her and 2 hours with the next girl, Brandy.

Brandy arrived 25 minutes late, she was wearing pyjamas and looked like she'd just woken up. When she arrived she was led upstairs to get changed.

She came back down 10 minutes later wearing nothing but a gstring (thong), but it was dirty. When I say dirty, I mean it was once pink, but had odd stains on it. She asked if she could quickly have something to eat before she began. Being the accommodating gentlemen that we are, we offer her a steak.

So we're in the living room of this apartment, most of us drunk, while an all-but-naked stripper is eating steak with her hands...and the steak is drowned in tomato sauce (ketchup). She is not with it and the sauce is dripping all over her.

She finishes her steak, chases it with a beer and then starts dancing. She works the room and gets to the groom-to-be. She's grinding on him and asks what his fiancee's name is. Weird question. He tells her and she has a weird reaction to it, but keeps going.

She asks him how long they've been dating. Weirder question. He tells her and she, again, scrunches up her face.

She suddenly stops and says she needs a minute. She runs upstairs, slips on the top step and cuts her knee as she falls. I run after her, help her up and take her into the bathroom.

As soon as she gets in there she bursts into tears. Like, uncontrollable sobbing to the like to that she's shaking. I ask if everything is ok and she launches into this story about how her friend recommended this gig as it pays really well, but she'd been hiding it from her boyfriend.

Apparently he found out, didn't tell her, but instead waited for her to get home to surprise her with him and another girl going at it in their bed. His justification was that if she was allowed to bang other dudes (which she says she didn't do, she was a stripper only), then he was allowed to do the same.

She had apparently smoked a bunch of weed before arriving to try and calm herself but it didn't work. I found the best man and told him we couldn't let her do this, she was in no state to continue. He was too drunk to know what was going on.

I put her in an uber and sent her home. Daisy agreed to do another hour pro bono as she'd had fun, so it all worked out in the end."

3257,"A transgender person seeks to be THEIR VERSION of the gender they identify with. 

Because their brain believes they are that gender due to its development (brain vs. body gender is a thing, science increasingly supports this) - thus the way they perceive that gender is imprinted on it.

It adopts its identity from both biology and culture and combines them in a very nuanced and multi-leveled fashion.

As in, my brain identifies as a woman, so it looks to women as a source of a way to define itself as a woman. Doing what -to me- makes me a woman is the way to make that dysphoria go away. 

For some people, that might mean dresses and skirts, painted nails, and perms because that's how they see women.

For another, it might just be speech mannerisms, behavioral patterns, blue jeans, and cat sweaters.

But trans people are likely to express their identity at a higher level in order to mask the one they are leaving behind - not for everyone else - but for themselves. 

Gender ""roles""  are not the way you dress.

They're the jobs you have, the way you act in a relationship, the way you divide household responsibility, financial responsibility. They're the way a company delegates who gets to do what based on the idea that men are good at ""doing"" and women are good at interactions and social things. 

But also, gender roles are not an abstract. There's good evidence that men and women behave certain ways based on biology, not just culture. 

The goal of feminism should be that each person be able to select that behavior and be judged as an individual, not as part of a group. 

So if a woman CHOOSES to be a house wife, that's fine. If she CHOOSES to be a single business woman, that's fine. 

If a man CHOOSES to be a bread winner, that's fine. If a man CHOOSES to be a stay-at-home dad, that's fine.

You CAN ACTUALLY HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. Saying men and women, biologically, tend to have certain behavioral trends does NOT exclude them from sharing behavioral traits, or one expressing the traits of another. 

But that's not what transgender is about. 

It's about an individual's feelings on what makes them a man or a woman and what they have to do to  make their brain comfortable with who they are. 

To sum it up, I don't want to be a ""feminine man"" because that will not make me comfortable with myself, my sexuality, my body, etc. 

I want to be able to look in the mirror and see a woman, because that's what my brain tells me I should see, and until I do, I will continue to experience dysphoria. "

I had to move her dvd player momentarily and there was a dvd upside down on it that i left on top of the dvd player as I moved it. Finished the tv install and went to put her dvd player back, this time curious if maybe the dvd is a movie I‚Äôve seen before. Flip it over and nope,  the label says ‚ÄòWhorehouse Girls‚Äô so I quickly put it back where I found it on top of the dvd player.

We had plenty of beer and food and firewood. We were all telling stories and having a raucous time. The noise quiet down for a moment and that's when we heard some movement in the distance. We all got freaked out. We threw some more wood on the fire and kept a lookout. About a half hour later we notice he's too bright orbs in the distance. We constantly watch that for the rest of the evening. As the fire started to die down do you want to get closer constantly bordering the edge of the dark and the beginning of the firelight. Nobody slept at night. We constantly keep the fire burning and never turned our backs to it. Come Morning the orbs are gone and there's nothing in the brush except for some heavy Footprints of a big cat. Now in New Jersey and Pennsylvania deny that they exist but I truly think that there was a mountain lion stalking us in the woods that night.

The second time was for nearly choking his girlfriend to death and beating and biting her 2 year old kid. They also survived and were able to get help.

All this felt relatively normal at the time but there was a pretty horrifying moment one night as I invited a group of friends over for a little party (about 15-20 or so people). Just as the party was starting to warm up around 10pm or so a friend came to the door looking unusually trashed with a bottle of wine in his hand. He was telling people he loved them and kind of passing in and out of consciousness. We were getting pretty worried about what he could've taken as we could see this wasn't just alcohol. He started turning pale blue in a matter of minutes and we slapped him awake. We thought if he took heroin then he would have OD'd already but what we didn't know is that he had sniffed it and it was gradually dripping down his throat getting him increasingly high. He puked up in a shoebox in my to and after the third time he passed out we called an ambulance and he was lucky to still be living.

I couldn't find a camera anywhere nearby (and cachers are *really* good at spotting things that don't belong), so I suspect they must have been hand-taken (busy enough park, so it wouldn't be too hard for the placer to wander around and discretely snap a pic every now and then).

Soon enough, both of us were pretty sloshed (I want to make it clear, we were equally fucked up), and making out (which we had done before). I picked her up and brought her to my bedroom. Eventually we were both naked and making out, which had *never* happened before, excluding once when her and I were involved in a kinda threesome together, but that's another story.

Anyways, at this point I figured it was gonna turn into the sex so I moved downtown to start doing my thang, because I am a gentleman. She stopped me last second and told me she didn't want to go through with it. I of course stopped and said that was cool. We ended up taking a shower together but nothing more happened during that except some minor kissing

She stopped talking to me for 7 months after that. It crushed me. She had been one of my closest friends for almost 2 years. She helped me through breakups, helped me through parental issues, helped me through some drug problems, and is all around a great and fun person

Happy ending though: We just made up today! I'm out of the country rn, but we have plans to get coffee and catch up when I get home and we are having a phone date tomorrow night

3421,"I wanted to work in forensic psychology since I was about 15. I was fascinated by the human mind and criminality. I was average at school but knew I'd need good grades to get into uni so worked my arse off to get what I needed. Worked hard in uni to pass and get some relevant experience and applied for tonnes of jobs when I'd graduated. Finally managed to get a foot in the door with a group facilitator job. It was in the forensic psychology department but not on the psychologist pathway but I was in and working in my dream setting (weird as it sounds...) It was about 4 years in that I realised unfortunately the job was ruining my well-being. I was enjoying it as much as I always had as it was fascinating and professionally I was doing well with promotions but I was constantly stressed, anxious and my health was going down the drain. I never actively thought about work outside the prison walls but it wormed its way into my psyche and started to rot. I was working with high risk sexual and violent offenders and it just started not being right for me. I fought it for another 3 years till I had to admit that it just wasn't good for me anymore. I left and bummed around for a while before I settled into working in substance misuse. I love psychology and criminality will always fascinate me but it has to stay an interest now rather than a career. I'll always be gutted though, I thought I'd found my career for life."

3429,"There are fundamental differences between men and women (on average) mentally and physically.

This does not mean one is better than the other -- they are simply different.

Women and men by and large have slightly different temperaments and interests.  Men tend to be more interested in things and women in people. (Again, on average -- you find reversals and extremes for both genders).

All things being equal (which I'm not saying they necessarily are right now), this alone could explain the dearth of women in engineering fields and the dearth of men in other fields typically thought of as ""feminine"".

But both men and women are in general incredibly adaptable. The differences are just innate temperamental/preference differences that could be overridden through training or incentive.

In societies where men and women enjoy a great deal of freedom and economic prosperity (I'm looking at you ~~Scandinavian~~Nordic countries) -- men tend to gravitate towards traditionally ""masculine"" fields such as engineering and women tend to gravitate towards more feminine fields such as nursing, teaching, etc.

These are societies where there are incredibly few barriers towards doing whatever you want with your life.  They are socialist societies.

Yet, left to their own devices, men choose certain fields preferentially and women choose other fields to work in.

This does not mean men are superior to women, or women are superior to men.

We just differ (ever so slightly) on average and in the extremes, is all.

Tell this to a feminist and they will eat your brains for dinner.

Some companies out there do treat their employees right and can give regular raises/promotions without asking but for the most part, companies are not going to go out of their way to make sure you as an individual are happy with your compensation.

3436,"I once had a really intelligent dog. I could go on forever about what kind of things he'd do without any kind of prompt or just one time verbal commands, but here are a few of my favorite:

The dog never killed any animals in the yard, ever. He didn't care for them and often could be seen sitting next to some rabbit that got in the yard. Anyway, my mother started a garden in the back yard in a fenced off area. After a few months of my mother being visibly disappointed every time the rabbits ate from the garden, we started to find dead rabbits in there. Without being prompted, our dog learned to jump the fence and kill any animals trying to eat our garden. We never found any dead animals anywhere else in our large yard and once the garden was gone, we never found another dead animal.

He learned how to shell and eat raw peanuts by watching us do it.

My brother had a pet lizard that he caught in the backyard. One day, it died and my brother was very visibly upset holding the dead lizard. The next day, my dog walked into the house, walked right up to my brother, and dropped an unscratched lizard at his feet. He had never caught an animal before this or since. 

 He knew all of our names and some of his toys names. Without any training, he could tell him ""go find ___"" and he'd do it.

He learned to put all his toys back in the toy box when he was done by watching us do it. We never taught him that.

Dog gates never worked on him because he always figured out how to open them.

This one isn't ""intelligent"", but rather funnily human like: I was once watching him in the yard while I was inside the house, through a window. He walked up to one of our trees and began scratching an itch on his butt using the tree and looked incredibly happy at this. Then, he took a momentary sideways glance at me, kept going for a moment, then did a double take at me and froze as he realized that I saw him do that. He immediately stopped and walked away like nothing happened. 

Okay, I wrote a bit more than I was expecting but it was fun remembering him. "

As a whole, the Dark Knight is still pretty damn good, but not great, and certainly not iconic. 

What makes the movie so iconic is Heath Ledger's Joker, which if you ask me personally, is the greatest film performance of all time. 

The strength of that performance is what gives it such a reputed place in the history of cinema, but if you take that performance away you left an above average film.

Overall, I think the Dark Knight Rises was the best of the 3."

3446,"This story kinda fits the topic.

I had been working at [Fried Chicken chain headquartered in Georgia] when I was in high school. They were saddling me with 4-midnight shifts while I was still in school (Side note, that job was a fucking nightmare and I left after only three days) so I was exhausted and not thinking clearly at all during my shifts. On my third night we had a woman come in, ask for a water cup. I give it to her and go back to hating the job. A few minutes later, she comes back up to the counter and asks for another water cup. Its at this point that my brain turns back on and I actually notice this woman. She was late twenties, had a very thick Vietnamese accent, was wearing very scant clothing and a lot of very shitty makeup, and her right arm was covered in small bruises that I knew were the result of improper needle punctures. I take all this information, add the fact that its about 10 and that our restaurant wasnt in the best location, and I come to the conclusion that this woman is some kind of prostitute. I give her the new water cup, and I watch her as she goes to fill it up, take a few sips while ""strutting"" across the restaurant, which was dead empty at that point, before setting the water cup down on the railing between two booths. Then she comes back up and asks for another water cup, this time with a receipt printed off so she can see the address. 

I give her another cup along with a blank receipt, and watch as she does her sip-strut routine again, this time stopping by a booth that had an unfortunate customer in it to ask him something. 

As morbidly entertaining as this was, I decided to take my food break. I get my food, sit down and start eating while browsing my phone. This woman walks over to me and sits down in the chair across from me, and asks to borrow my phone to make a call. My brain was fried and I just wanted to eat my food, so I let her. She makes a call, I can tell its ringing and she looks frustrated. It goes to voicemail, she dials again. Again, voicemail. This time i see her start dialing again, but now she dialing something a lot longer. I realize she's texting someone, but I'm too confused to really say anything before she tosses my phone back onto the table, leans back with a huff as says ""If anyone replies, let me know.""

And then she doesn't get up. She's still just sitting across from me, she'll know if it goes off. I check my messaged to see what she sent, but she seems to have deleted whatever she sent. So I rush through my meal in uncomfortable silence, then get back to work. She does the water thing a few more times, and by the time I'm cleaning up front of house later that night there's seven half-drank water cups scattered around the restaurant. 

So I finish my shift, go to sleep exhausted. I wake up the next morning to find that I have a string of text messages from an unknown number. I go back to my call log to see who the prostitute was calling and sure enough, same number. The messages are ingrained into my brain, and are as follows:

""Hey angie""

""Yo angie""

""angie where you at, this place closed""

""angie come the fuck out here""

""angie im at McDonalds""

""im gettin breakfast, you want something?""

""I got you a mcmuffin, where you at?""


So I feel kinda bad for this confused pimp who lost track of his girl, so I do what any reasonable, naive, white high-schooler would do: call him. So I do, first thing he says is ""Angie, bitch, where the fuck you at?""

""Oh uh, I'm sorry man, but I don't know. I uh, this woman came into the [Chain name] that I work at and asked to use my phone, I didnt know that she had texted you.""

""Oh yeah, huh? I get it.""

And then he hung up on me. I thought it was fairly clear that he didn't believe me, so the next thing I did was call my boss, and tell him he needed to change my hours, because working right after school wouldn't be possible. After a brief argument over him not wanting to give me different hours, I quit. No idea what happened to Angie or her pimp."

3490,"Ok, I'd like to take a moment of your time to tell you about the worst RomCom protagonist of all time: The 13-year-old from Crazy Stupid Love. I don't even remember his name, so from now on I will call him Dickface.

Honestly the whole plot of the movie is slightly fucked up. The whole cheating thing is just kind of swept under the rug and Ryan Gosling is kind of a dick womanizer, but as far as RomCom plots go, whatever, I'm not in it for quality storytelling. But let's break down Dickface's story:

Dickface is in love with his babysitter, Jessica, who is 17 (and also has a crush on his dad, but that is irrelevant to this part). Early on in the film she catches him masturbating and immediately leaves the room like a rational person. he finds her afterwards and tells her that he thinks about her when he masturbates (gross), and when she tells him to stop telling her this, he ignores her and keeps talking.

Later on, he bothers her with a bunch of texts about how it's not weird that she's 4 years older than him and she responds, more or less verbatim, ""Please stop, you're making me really uncomfortable."" He does not stop. He pulls off a few more stunts, all of which fail. When he asks why she won't date him, she always has an excuse like ""I'm into someone else [his dad]"" or ""I'm too old"", never ""I don't feel the same way as you and have no obligation to, leave me alone"" which I feel would have been a better response, but whatever.

He tells his dad he's in love with someone who doesn't love him back, and instead of his dad telling him to, I don't know, respect her wishes and leave her alone, he tells his son to *""keep trying""*. Sorry, I've noticed you didn't immediately throw up at that fucking statement. His dad, an adult man, told him ""Hey, kiddo, that girl doesn't like you back? No worries! Just **never leave her alone**."" If you were ever wondering what rape culture is, it's that. Like, fuck me jesus christ who approved this horseshit?

Anyways, we get to the end of the film, and Dickface decides to give some speech about love conquering all or some shit at his eighth grade graduation. Don't even ask me how that fucking happened. Typical RomCom ""now everyone kiss and make up"" ending that solves literally no problems but whatever, we'll move on. But here's the thing, the babysitter is at the graduation, hears his speech, and afterwards goes up to him and basically says ""Hey, you know what? You won me over, call me when you're older"" or something like that, and **he faces literally no consequences**. None. He effectively stalks and harasses a young woman for a whole year, and it's all fine because he's in love. Fuck that. Fuck that shit with a rusty dagger. 

I'm a gal who loves a RomCom. Even the really trashy ones. Hell, I watch Love Actually every Christmas. But fuck Crazy Stupid Love. And fuck Dickface."

3535,"The letter and the poem differ. Wilde's chief goal was to establish plausible deniability. He wrote the letter to Douglas; a friend, Pierre Louys, worked with him to turn the poem into verse and translate it into French.

**The letter (which really is quite beautiful):**

January 1893, Babbacombe Cliff

My Own Boy,

Your sonnet is quite lovely, and it is a marvel that those red-roseleaf lips of yours should be made no less for the madness of music and song than for the madness of kissing. Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry. I know Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly, was you in Greek days. Why are you alone in London, and when do you go to Salisbury? Do go there to cool your hands in the grey twilight of Gothic things, and come here whenever you like. It is a lovely place and lacks only you; but go to Salisbury first.

Always, with undying love,

Yours, Oscar

HYACINTHE ! mon coeur ! jeune dieu doux et blond !

Tes yeux sont la lumiere de la mer ! ta bouche,

Le sang rouge du soir ou mon soleil se couche . . .

Je t'aime, enfant calin, cher aux bras d'ApoUon.

.

Tu chantais, et ma l}'re est moins douce, le long

Des rameaux suspendus que la brise effarouche,

A fremir, que ta voix a chanter, quand je touche

Tes cheveux couronnes d'acanthe et de houblon.

.

Mais tu pars ! tu me fuis pour les Portes d'hercule ;

Va ! rafraichis tes mains dans le clair crepuscule

Des choses ou descend I'dme antique. Et reviens,

.

Hyacinthe adore ! hyacinthe ! hyacinthe !

Car je veux voir toujours dans les bois syriens

Ton beau corps etendu sur la rose et I'absinthe.

What made this even more mysterious at the time was that /u/Stonetear began to delete all of their old Reddit posts shortly after the initial articles claiming a Clinton link, so that people ended up being able to actually watch and screenshot in real time as the account was deleted post-by-post. That, in many peoples' minds, added enormous weight to the claims being made, but ultimately we'll probably never know one way or another."

True story.

Then collapses back down to the bed.  I about shit my pants.  Walked right out. I was shaking.  

It took me about 15-20 min to get it together.  Then I forced myself to go back in cause she still needed her med.

I work in a supermarket in the UK and am responsible for 5 production departments, he is one of my butcher's and is someone I try to have minimal contact with as his opinions and values are skewed into the ridiculous and there's no convincing him otherwise.

He was previously a first aider in the store but was removed from our trained resource pool as he refused to help gay, black, muslim people or anyone else who wasn't a white male.

At one point he was as friendly as capable with our female line manager. He would regularly tell her how all women are prostitutes as men inevitably pay for them to some degree eben if they are in a relationship. 

I'm referred to as the cow or the bitch, our line manager is the wench and the personnel manager is the fat cow.

He has no issue in detailing how he spends ¬£200+ a week visiting prostitutes, that they tell him how good he is and that he satisfies them like no other man.

A complaint was made before I was his manager after he told a female butchery colleague how he had spent the previous evening watching videos of women being raped. He obviously enjoys trying to intimidate and make people, especially women, uncomfortable.

He is only around 25-26 and it's kind of sad to see someone with such a shitty way of interacting with people at such a young age but the boy is seriously delusional. I could be here all night detailing the extent of his disconnect with reality, so aye, I'll leave it at that

3756,"Here goes: Attend, all those perfect attendance (and near perfect attendance) awards do mean something. It matters to show up and participate. Is this day, this also translates to turn off your phone when someonn's talking to you.

Work hard to learn. You do NOT have to have the highest GPA - honestly I see those students sometimes crack later on due to the strain students put themselves under. 

They READ - for pleasure, to learn how to do something, to solve a mystery, to learn what someone else's life was like. They read books that aren't assigned to them and without earning ""points."" And they talk about what they are reading. 

They have a good sense of humor that acccompanies resillliance. I've had students from all walks of life and the ability to accept defeat, mistakes, and sometimes failure and learn from it to try again. 

They are curious. They ask the craziest, coolest questions. Then come back to school the next day to share what they found out when they researched on their own. So I would say they are self-directed in their learning. They aren't bored, because they are always wondering, always making connections. 

Remember - students mature and develop over time. You change from 2nd grade, and are different at 5th, 7th, 12th grades - even in graduate school. Never let a teacher, a parent, a ""friend"" limit you or your child with a label while growing up and developing because kids will change and mature. I don't know how many students have told me they weren't good at something because X told them so. As a teacher I felt it was my job to foster that person's potential.

I cant imagine being their height from my perspective as I have over a foot in difference in difference, I bumbled into relationships and get complimented in public and have a decent message/reply/match rate on date apps. These guys have never had that happen to them from my chats with them.  Nobody messages them back on dating apps.  People tell them they're creepy if they used the same pick up line I did later.  While I loathe the violent outward blaming incels that are popular in media, these guys would never hurt a fly, they internalize their insecurities and it's really depressing because most of them are insecure about an outwardly visible trait they had 0 control of, I can only sympathize with them that they're not being judged by character but by physically uncontrollable attributes."

Finally, MONTHS pass and they get approval to have law enforcement force them out after not paying rent. Then they could finally work on getting the house fixed up again to rent out again. Once the house was fixed up, the old tenants broke into the home in revenge, poured cement down the drains, and turned on the faucets, thus flooding the entire house.

However, most libraries anticipate that new releases will be popular so they often have them available on their catalogue ‚Äúon order‚Äù weeks to months before they are released, which will allow you to get on the waiting list sooner so you‚Äôll wait much less for a copy.

3959,"I still have my childhood comfort animal, a goat named Geraldine (after the book ""The Goat in the Rug""). Male, 27. She usually only makes it into the bed when I'm sick or having a bad depressive episode.

My wife though... She suffers from terrible anxiety and has a little stuffed cat toy.

We were long-distance over the internet for nearly two years, and occasionally over skype I would catch a glimpse of... something in her bed with her, but I never asked what it was because it seemed like she didn't want me to see it.

On our third or fourth in-person visit (at her family's house), she finally told me what I was seeing. It was a scrap of cloth, with remnants of lace and (thankfully) a tag.  It was the very last last last bits of her childhood stuffed animal, a small purple creature.  She could not sleep without it most nights. She had loved it to pieces, literally.  She went to go take a shower and I examined it more closely and I just started crying about this thing I was holding in my hands, that had been loved beyond measure and still was, even then, even when there was virtually nothing left.

There was enough of a face left for me to tell it was a cat, and I had the color of the fabric, so while she was in the shower I was googling harder than I've ever googled for ""light purple cat plush."" On what remained of the foot was an embroidered ""p f"", so I added Fisher-Price to my search terms and, lo, there it was...

I then searched on eBay and found one in mint-condition.  When she came out of the shower she saw that I'd been crying and then saw the remains of her stuffed animal.  I asked if she would still love it if it were back to its former glory.  I didn't want to just buy the new one because I didn't want her to feel like she had just abandoned the old one with whom she'd been through so much.

I showed her the listing and asked if that would be something she would like, and then SHE burst into tears too and said yes.

When it finally got there (after I had gone back home), she took what remained of her old one and sewed it up inside the new one so she would still have her oldest friend.


If anyone's curious, this is the stuffed animal:

Now digital copies are basically the way to go for games so pre ordering doesn't do much for you unless you're a collector.

And if you even had a physical copy to sell you should do it online instead because you could sell a month old triple a game to game stop for 5 bucks or sell it on Craigslist or eBay for 30.

I now see how deeply wrong that was and how unfair it is to the victims. Even a ""willing participant"" can be so , because he was manipulated in the most grossest of ways. I didn't think before much about it. There should be way more awareness about this, essentially we as a society are encouraging this to go on by silencing the victims and this is disgusting."

Once you're out of med school, at least for the short while the pressure and stress of exams is taken off you, you're finally an actual doctor and you slowly begin to enjoy things. Anyway, once you've graduated and have the degree there are a million different things you can do. Even take a break for a couple of years if you wish to.

4070,"Found this story in a ""worst mental breakdown you've witnessed"" thread. Saved it because it hit me so hard. Only comment/story I can remember that actually made me cry.

&gt;Probably when I found my bff soaked in his own partially coagulated blood in my bathroom where he'd seriously slit every body part open. He was spending the night and I heard him go to the bathroom, didn't think much of it, fell back asleep. Woke up again a while later and he still wasn't back. Asked him if he was okay in there and he said yeah, just stomach issues. Knew he wasn't doing okay, he'd been a shadow of himself for a long time. So I couldn't really fall back asleep and was kinda worried. Eventually I went to ask again and I got no answer no matter how hard I knocked. After saying his name a few times I just knew. Said ""hey man, I'm going to open this door now because I don't think you're really okay"" Yup. The smell of coagulated blood was right there. It's like my brain just knew exactly what to do. Almost like if practiced it. Like a trance. Calling 911 with one hand, checking his pulse, breathing, putting him Recovery Position, ripping off my shirt to tie and stop the bleeding.
The EMTs arrive and he's got severe PTSD and nobody is generally allowed to touch him. I try to warn them. It was like his body knew a stranger was touching him and he started screaming. It was this gut wrenching scream of absolute terror, it was like it came from a deeper, more primal part of the body; when they didn't stop he tried to move away and kept screaming. Again, my brain just acted on some sort of impulse that just knew what to do; immediately I tell him ""Elijah I'm here bro, I'm here, they're not gonna hurt you, you're safe, you're in my house, in my bathroom, I'm here"" while stepping over and sitting down; I don't remember it as soggy or gross but it must have been. I squatted down in the red-black sludge on the floor while talking I grabbed his hand and put his head in my lap, and just kept stroking his forehead telling him ""it's okay man, I'm here, it's gonna be okay, I'll be with you the whole time, it's gonna be okay, I'm not leaving you alone, they're gonna check some things and stoop the bleeding, they'll roll you into the ambulance but I won't let go okay? I'll hold your hand the whole time okay just stay with me man please just stay with me""
Holy fuck that was one of the most terrifying moments of my life, but also I'm so grateful for my anxious brain having worried about this and probably ten thousand, ten million other scenarios too.
A part of me wants to believe that maybe, just maybe, there was a part of him that wanted to stay alive, who knew that if he did it in my house, there was a chance that he'd survive.
He's my best friend and I'm so fucking glad it happened the way I did. Im glad I dared to be affectionate and just step in and say those things, they really did soothe him. You could tell once they started putting him on monitors and stuff. As soon as I wasn't talking his heart rate would go up, or if I moved position so he couldn't feel me it'd speed up too.
Idk what my point is with this. Love your friends. Don't be scared to tell them you love them. Don't be scared to be affectionate and comfort them when they're down. I promise it won't make things weird. I think we all want it we just don't know how to do it, we don't know how to, when to do it. It feels weird. I guess I just kinda channeled how my mom would hold me as a kid.
There was this sense of overwhelming loneliness and fear in him; and I felt that like, damn, he's just so fucking scared. He's fucking terrified. He doesn't feel like he can do this, he can't do it anymore, and I felt like, that moment when a mom is hugging her kid, like that was the opposite. That he was so scared and he needed a hug, he needed comfort.
These days we give each other real hugs both when we say hi and when we say goodbye. I put my hand on his shoulder when he's telling me about shitty things. Instead of trying to find a silver lining or whatever we genuinely meet each other with ""damn, that fucking sucks. I can't believe he'd do that. You must have felt humiliated."" Or ""I'm proud of you for setting boundaries, that was really brave man"". Just kinda like, genuine-ness. Not listening to try and solve each other problems just listening and being there for each other.
Last time he'd tried this he called me. I got a call and he just said ""hey.. um dude, I did something stupid. I broke my sobriety, and I'm not okay. It's bad""
And idk I'm fucking argh I'm getting goosebumps even talking about it. I'm so fucking proud of him for doing that. Like... can you imagine it?? He was at his darkest fucking moment, his demons getting the better of him. Can you believe what kind of courage it must have taken him to literally go against everything inside of him telling him to die and instead like, ask for help? I don't have PTSD, I can't even fathom the amount of shame and fear he deals with, i just have never met a braver person in my life.
He just.. fucking looked his demons straight in the eyes and said fuck you.. he fucking dragged himself out of hell by his fingernails and I'm so fucking... I'm just like.. I'm feel fucking honored to know a guy like him.

""I heard a crinkle!! What are you hiding!!"" Now, i know she didnt hear anything, she must have heard some music playing on my Alexa. but she felt the need to interrogate me more. ""get up and walk to the wall, youre hiding something!"" So it was either get sniped with my juul (my parents are strict and id be fucked) or have a stop dead in your tracks embarresing moment. i attempted to make my mom as embarresed as possible by telling her im watching porn and to leave my room. she thought it was a cover up. she thought i made that up so that way i could hide something. did i mention she had the nerve to rip my covers off! anyways, it ended with her going on my phone and revealing, just like i promised

Something wakes me.  It takes me a second to realize that the unfamiliar place is my new apartment.  I feel pressure in my bladder and reluctantly get up from the warm bed.  As I turn toward the bathroom, the sight of a naked stranger facing me in the twilight stops me cold.

Every time we went out to eat, even after dating for 2 years, he would flag down the waiter and say, ""We need the check split in half. Evenly."" If we would spend $5 at the grocery store buying spaghetti and sauce, he would ask me to pay half. 

Anyway, my 17 year old cat was dying, and I was heartbroken. The day I said goodbye to her, my ex (then boyfriend) took me out for ice cream. We shared a $5 sundae at Dairy Queen. He paid!  I was so happy and touched by the small gesture during the worst day of my life. But then in the car afterwards, he asked me if we should ""settle up now or... because, I mean... the sundae was $4.95 and I don't think you gave me any money for it,"" and I lost it. I threw a $20 at him and cried. 

Listen, I don't expect men to foot the bill all the time, and I definitely like to be fair, but buying your long term girlfriend a $5 sundae when she's absolutely distraught is not unreasonable.

Edit: thank you for all the love! I forgot to add this was 8 years ago, and I'm since engaged to a wonderful generous man! We share money wonderfully and I think I'm even more appreciative of him because of this particular ex. "

4170,"I was trying to explain to someone recently why I watch this every time I have to spend the day home sick: because it's the perfect film.

First as the framing device, it's about a kid who doesn't want to stay home in bed, but he needs to, and his friendly soothing grandpa keeps him company.  Right off the bat, it gives you exactly what you want to feel comforted.  Even if the story itself wasn't great, there's something about having someone read a story to you by proxy.

Then, the story was specifically tweaked to BE what you want to hear when you're stuck in bed.  Action and adventure, but nothing that makes you anxious or nervous.  Romance and heroism, but not grandiose or overwhelming.

It was a film that was purposefully built from the ground up, brick by brick, to make you feel happy and relaxed and satisfied.  And when it's done, you don't want to go on an adventure, you don't feel morose about being bedridden in the middle of the day... you just feel comfortable with permission to have a contented nap."

We nearly shit ourselves when he jumped out the fucking thing and ran away to clock out and leave. We never saw him again so I assume he quit or someone reported it and he was fired. 

Also you can't hear shit when that thing is on. That thing is about as loud as a train horn and it doesn't stop until the thing has compressed and decompressed. Screaming wouldn't have helped him as the sound of the baler would have drowned him out.

If your doc tells you you're fine, you're inclined to believe them until it gets really bad. Take it from someone who had symptoms of a spine tumor brushed off by doctors for almost 2 years until it grew so big it almost paralyzed me. At this point I'm not really surprised by a doctor's incompetence in the face of an emergency given what I went through, so this story doesn't shock me at all, it's just absolutely tragic that the doctors dragging their heels and not bothering to investigate cost this woman her life."

My end responsibility was to make sure they make it on time to and from the gates, and that they get an excellent service, or legendary as we called it.

Most times it wasn't hard, but there were a few times when just being a professional would not suffice. There were two instances where I had to deal with wheelchair bound, very rude mentally handicapped people. On one occasion I had to deal with a passenger that tried to scam the airline into saying that his electric chair was damaged by them when they stored it into the hold. As soon as he got out of the plane he started swearing and cursing at staff, saying that they broke his chair. He smelled of piss, and had a bottle of it attached to the side of the chair. His chair wouldn't work so I had to help my staff pushing a very heavy and non-working electric chair outside the airport all while being called idiots and fucking cunts. On more than two instances I stopped everything, got down to his eye level, pointed at him and told him to stop swearing at us, allow us to help him out and to say thanks otherwise I would let him in the middle of the airport to let himself out. He would get quiet then proceed to swear at the rest, including the police that had to intervene but were also quite intimidated by his attitude but would not say much just because he was in a wheelchair.

I eventually got him outside, got him in a taxi home and received recognition from airline staff and police, and received some sort of small reward from managers the second day. So all in all me almost asking him to fuck off paid off."

My own mother had a stalker that followed her around, made constant death threats to her, me, and my brother via paper plates left on our property, and one terrifying experience with him brandishing a gun at me through my window in the night. He also worked literally across the street from my school and would stare towards us as we boarded buses to go home.

Ended up calling the police one night (early in the stalking) when he was roaming around our property leaving some notes. Grandfather chased him, only for him to get in his truck and run away (nearly running over my grandpa), with my grandpa getting a good smack on his window with his cane. Police officer said, ""nothing can be done unless there's physical proof he's harming us"", cuz the paper plate death threats weren't enough apparently.

Stalker even attempted to sue us for damage to his car from my grandpa's cane. Was a fucking fun year before we moved."

Then when I went dead weight and he couldn‚Äôt get me up all the way, he grabbed my wrists and dragged me to the passenger seat so we could ‚Äòtalk‚Äô. After I kept trying to leave he showed me his knives, forcibly cracked my knuckles, asked extremely invasive comments, and just kept terrifying me until I was able to calm him down and waste time by asking about him, complimenting him, looking at pictures of his family, etc. Anything to become the nice, compliant girl he wanted because there was no outside help and I didn‚Äôt want to end up a story on the news. 

I was in a gas station parking lot with customers. People saw me and did nothing. 

The only time I had any help was when the two men working the station told us it was closing time so we had to leave, so I IMMEDIATELY told them that he took my keys and wouldn‚Äôt give them back. Once he saw that wasn‚Äôt just dealing with the 5‚Äô5 girl he worked with at an art museum anymore he let me go. 

A little more than ‚Äòmean‚Äô but after seeing all the responses I felt I needed to say something. Men, you really CAN do something and help someone. Just by knocking on the window and being present there was a huge shift in the power structure of the car.

With the old toilet, when the black tank was getting full, it would ""burp"" up a bubble of poo juice when you flushed. Frankly, it got a little scary to even pee when the black tank got full, worrying about the size of the next poo-juice- bubble-burp to erupt. And, God, the smell! It would get so bad! Then, we'd have to pack everything away, pull up the lifts, drive down a washboard road, then 15 miles away in order to dump. Then back down the washboard road, and re-set up camp. Ugh.

In contrast, the composting toilet never stinks. You put Coconut fibers in the base. Then when you poop, you turn a handle to mix it in, and it smells only like soil. When the basin gets filled, about 10-14 days later, we just lift out the basin, bring it outside, mix it with the dirt. The plants love it! We decided to modify our toilet, by attaching a pipe from the liquid basin into the 40 gallon black tank (so we wouldn't have to empty a 2 gallon bucket every couple days). That worked out great! A 40 gallon tank holds a LOT of pee. When it needs to be emptied, we pull into a local KOA campground on our way home and empty the tank.

I had just finished high school and my mom had planned a big trip to Ireland with my entire extended family for the end of the summer. All summer she was nagging me to find my passport, and my room was crazy messy so I kept putting it off til about a week before we left.

I started looking for it and COULD NOT FIND IT. We looked everywhere!!! My mom was PISSED. Crazy pissed, more mad than I had ever seen her. It also didn‚Äôt help that her husband (my stepfather) had passed away earlier in the summer and obviously she didn‚Äôt need anything else stressing her out.

The night before our flight out of JFK we decided to go to the passport office in New Jersey. We had to stand in line all day and my mom flipped her shit a couple times at my brother and I and anyone she talked to really, but we were able to have a new passport issued that day and just barely made it onto our plane.

When I got home I found my passport in a brown paper bag full of junk and papers from school. I didn‚Äôt tell my mom for 6 months because I thought she might kill me if she knew it was almost trash."

4315,"Similar here (if not as bad). When I was 16, I got drunk off some old vodka and red wine that my parents had stored away. This was my first time ever actually drinking enough to be called drunk, and as a skinny guy (I must have weighed 135 when I was 6'1,) combined with doing it on an empty stomach, it didn't take many drinks to do me in. I threw up into my large glass in my room in the basement, and drunkenly walked upstairs with it and dumped it into the sink.

Unfortunately, drunk me is a little more wobbly than normal me, so I spilled a bunch of deep red, mostly liquid barf on the stairs. I made an effort to clean it up, but it really didn't do much.

Next morning, I work hard and Scrub that shit hard until it got almost all the way out, and my parents believed me when I said that it was some red pop that I spilled when tripping down the stairs.

In hindsight my lie is fairly unbelievable, and I certianly wouldn't believe it if I had someone tell me that, but knowing my ridiculously strict religious parents, I highly highly doubt that they thought I was lying due to the fact that I never heard about it again."

She admitted to me that she was a bit of a partier in high school and made a lot of mistakes academically and socially due to drinking too much and she didn't want me to make the same ones.

1. There are a lot of people out there who have no idea what they're doing and need some hand-holding. I have a surprising amount of people that pay me booking fees for really stupid flights like BOS-NYC. They are so confused about the entire process and would rather have me do it than save a few dollars online.

2. Having said that, online prices rarely compete with mine. I have rates directly from the airline and hotels. Sometimes it's the same, sometimes I get a better deal. 90% I at least have a better hotel package. Expedia is a huge rip off.

3. Travel agents are invaluable for frequent travellers. I can't tell you how many vacations I have saved, business meetings, etc. Plus, y'all have no idea about some of the shit that goes on in the background of your reservations. I have spent hours talking to airlines and hotels trying to fix these huge problems that customers never even knew existed. Even the best airlines will have a glitch or will mysteriously cancel you off your sold out flight 30 days in advance. 

4. Travel agents can really curate some amazing experiences for you. They leverage relationships with vendors, travel a lot themselves, and know things you won't find on google. It's like having a friend in x city that is very connected."

There are two reasons they tell you not to give meds prescribed for one person to another. The first is usually for legal reasons. If your company tells you it‚Äôs okay to mix meds and you fuck up, you just put a lot of people at legal risk. Secondly, it‚Äôs because they correctly don‚Äôt trust laypeople to be able to make informed medical decisions about when to give a person medications they haven‚Äôt been prescribed.

One of the few exceptions to this is epinephrine for anaphylaxis. It has no contraindications for use in those cases because anaphylaxis will fucking kill you dead real quick. Even if something goes horribly wrong with a reaction to the epi you can‚Äôt get worse than that was already happening without epi (note that this is also rare). 

The best rule is to do what you need to do to save your patient within the scope of things you know how to do. I‚Äôm a WEMT and do a lot of backcountry pretend doctorin‚Äô, and that‚Äôs generally the rule we go by.

4567," So back in the early 80's my brother had this band, they would play in the clubs in North Jersey and NYC. I would go along, pretending to be their ""roadie"" I say pretending because I'd basically just carry their shit in from the van. But it got me in the clubs for free where I could get drunk, hit on girls and say ""I'm with the band"".

They had this gig at CBGB's in NY one night, it was late fall-early winter. I remember that because I was wearing this blue bomber jacket that were all the rage at the time. Anyways...if you've ever been to CBGB's you would know that it was a shithole of a club, dark and dirty, in the Bowery, which, at the time was a not so nice area of the city.

The band played the gig, I got hammered and hit on girls, and we packed up and left. I vaguely remember it as being a fun night. By the time we made it thru the tunnel back to Jersey I realized I had left my blue nylon bomber jacket at the club. There was no way we were going to go back there at 3 am to go get it so basically I just chalked it up as gone.

Fast forward a year, I don't recall now if I was going to CBGB's for another gig of my brothers band or if I was going there to see a different band. I'm in the club, hanging out, it's all dark, dirty and full of people, I take a seat on a wall bench, which are like church pews attached to the wall. I throw my cigarette down on the floor to stomp it out, and while looking down, I notice this dirty dark blue crumpled up ball of nylon stuffed under the bench. I'm thinking, no freakin way!. I pull it out and sure as shit, a year later, my blue bomber jacket, filthy, crumpled and torn was under that bench!! Even had the half pack of Newport's still in the pocket. CBGB's held about 300 people, and after a years worth of crazy ass punk shows and other misfit bands my jacket was still there. What are the odds!"

4592,"Something similar happened to me but I lived alone.


Woke up to hearing my front door open while I was sleeping on the couch 2 feet away at 4am. Felt someone sit on my chest and start groping me (slept in a tshirt) and being really rough with me. This instant calm set in and I was sneakily cooperative although internally the adrenaline rush and fear was so intense. I ended up fighting him off but didn't realize until we were both standing really that IT WAS MY DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR! 


This was a house made into 3 apartments and this dude lived with his girlfriend of 10 years and was the sweetest person ever constantly. I was so spooked and called the police. Come to find out right before he got with his girl friend he had been released from prison. His girlfriend had always trusted and believed it was for manslaughter for a DUI and he did 16 years. What he really did was viciously attack, rape, and sodomize a woman. I had to do the honors of explaining it all to her later that day after she got off work when hed already been arrested.


I almost never saw our top neighbor, another young woman who lived alone. When I finally did see her 2 weeks later I told her what happened. She was flabberghasted and I found out the reason she was never around was because he did something similar to her one night but it wasnt severe enough for there to be evidence and him get arrested. So she was just never around until her lease was up. I'm still shocked to this day.

But Donna I think has *one line* in the entire first season and looks very average office-worker-y and not the treat yoself/night club part owner that makes her character so great later. Ron has a line about how heaven will give him virgins, I think? I can't remember exactly as I try to skip over season one on rewatches, but he vastly improved also.

I want them to know they are worthy, beautiful and sexy, but I am always afraid they think it means I'm interested, and some men react very negatively when you insist you aren't. So I am very careful about who I compliment.  


 I think a theme with these answers here is women are socialised to be more physically intimate with female friends, and we want that with our male friends but then men misconstrue it to mean something sexual, because they are not socialised to b that physical with their male friends. All round mis-communication, not necessarily women being evil teases. SOME of the responses here though I don't know what was going on with some of the women. "

 She is.... special... like Kevin special.  

- If you play staring contest with her, she would go cross eyed and fall over.  
- She doesn‚Äôt now how to properly chase lasers. Her reaction time is so poor that she reacts long after the later has pass through.  It almost looked like she is running away from the laser, poorly.  Then after couple attempts, she just roll over, go cross eyed, and lie there.
- cant catch a toy on a stationary string. If she raise both front feet, she would fall slide ways. 
- She doesn‚Äôt eat properly, just inhale and barf, so her food is strictly controlled.  
- can‚Äôt poop properly. She thinks if her front legs are in the litter, she is clear to poop and look confused when finding her poop outside and then spend 5 minute trying to cover it with invisible sand.
- she has yet learn how to lick herself properly.  She does not have the gross motor skill to bring her paw up to her face to lick. She tries and it looks like drunk man trying to lick popsicle. 
- She has zero self defence skills or instinct.  A 2 year girl of a friend dragged her through three large rooms by her ears to show her daddy the kitty.  At the end, she just lied their on the ground looking at everyone confused.  
- We attach her to a broom and push her around the hardwood floor and dust her off outside.  No reaction. 
- she has no idea how to socialize. If her brother come near her, she would slap him across the face and scream like she legs are getting sawn off when he pounced her. Even then, she would just lie there.
- sometimes she may attempt to run away from things, poorly.  She would walk faster for like  5 feet and then give up.
- her running never end well. She will run into something always. Like ramming full speed (which is a pretty slow jog)  into a door
- her brother would try to teach her to hunt.  Yes, cat can get frustrated and his frustration is hilariously palpable.  
- She cannot even properly hunt a hair band on the ground.  She would prepare to pounce it for like 5 minutes and then miss, sit on the hair losing it, give up and lie down.

She is very fuzzy though, like a soft warm teddy bear that purrs.

She is 13 year old."

4798,"**This is a repost from my reply to a similar thread about a year ago.**

I went to an agency that said they were sending me to a ""Packaging Plant"".

It wasn't. It was a place where turkeys arrived in trucks and left in boxes.

Stick around...this is pretty funny.

I know I was in trouble when I could smell the place at least a mile away. The agency was kind enough to give me a ride in...and now I know why. If I was driving my own vehicle I would have ""Noped"" in record time.

As soon as I assembled with the rest of the temps, I was offered a singular but very puzzling honor. I was given a rain suit, you've seen them, the cheap canary-yellow slicker, pants, and yes, even the hat. My curiosity was soon to be satisfied.

I was tasked with removing the turkeys from the truck. They arrived in a truck that looked exactly like [this](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2411/1642523478_7242d94a72_b.jpg).

Now there's two things you need to understand about turkeys. First, they are the most incredibly stupid creatures imaginable, and second, they are shit factories. They've been fattened up for market, and have been stuffing themselves with whatever vile sustenance turkeys eat, and what goes in, comes out.

Have another look at the truck, and imagine the liberal coating of turkey shit covering the poor turkey bastards on the lowest level. When I reached into the cage and picked one up by the feet, they would struggle and flap their wings, and would become a Turk-O Turkey Shit Arial Distribution System.

**NOW you know why they gave me a rain suit.**

After 10 minutes of this I wanted to say ""Fuck You"", I am am out of here, but I couldn't, because:

- It was 40 miles out of town, and if I quit, there goes my ride.
- I could have called for a rescue, but I already smelled so awful I couldn't subject the vehicle of anyone I know with the aroma.  

So I stuck with it, until, by some absolute MIRACLE, someone came out and said ""We need somebody to work inside"". Did I mention that this was on an outdoor dock, in December, in Canada? ""Oooh, ooh, pick me, pick me!!"" and they did. I was finally off the dock, and no longer had to deal with shit-spraying turkeys. Nothing could be worse that that....

**I should have known I was in trouble when they didn't ask for the rain suit back.**

Now the way this works is that some poor bastard takes the turkeys off the truck and hangs them upside-down, by their feet, on metal hooks on a conveyor belt. They get submerged in a water bath, and electrocuted. Then they come up out of the water, and someone chops the head off. They travel a bit, draining of blood, and then they go into a hot, hot bath.

This softens the feathers, but before long, this hot soak is pretty much equal parts hot water, blood, and turkey shit. Then they get plucked...by travelling through a tunnel that looks like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hFZGXo5cqfg/maxresdefault.jpg). Imagine all these discs, spinning rapidly, and knocking the feathers off the birds.

Now imagine each of the turkeys as still half-full of shit, and being furiously beaten in a tunnel of spinning dildos. Imagine the cloud emanating from that tunnel, an aeration of water, damp feathers, blood, and turkey shit.

You might, at a long stretch, be able to imagine it, but I assure you, you cannot imagine the stench. You may have driven past a slaughterhouse, and caught a whiff. That's the difference between catching a hint of cheap cologne, and having a 5-gallon bucket of it poured over your head. This was the source, the fount of the hideous miasma that blanketed the countryside, and I was the lucky chap that was right where the birds exited the tunnel. I was bathed in a continuous mist of this most disgusting of substances. In my eyes, my hair, my mouth. It was inescapable.

My important and crucial task was, using a pair of needle-nosed pliers, to remove the stumps of feathers that broke, rather than get ripped out of the carcass. I remained there for another 5 hours, in a place where minutes felt like centuries.

I can now endure anything, for I have been to Hell, and emerged alive. I would not wish this experience on the worst specimens of humanity.

When I returned home, I was grateful to be living in a high-rise apartment. The stench had permeated every fiber of my clothing, my body, and my soul. I removed the clothes, bagged them for disposal, and placed a plastic lawn chair in the shower, where I remained for the next 90 minutes, frantically scrubbing myself raw. Thank God for apartment buildings and their endless hot water.

I had made it home about 6pm, and at 8, the phone rang. It was the agency, calling to let me know that tomorrow we were going to be starting 2 hours early, and I needed to be at the office for 5:30am, not 7:30. I don't recall exactly how I responded, but I do recall impressing myself with my masterful command of profanity.

Yes, dear reader, I most certainly did decline their kind offer of continued employment, and you may be startled to discover that I have never regretted the decision."

Now, every single year she's had this, she has always selected a female to represent the youth. This year she decided to put me on, an ethnic male, to show diversity.


Long story short, there were a lot of important people at this event. I was on the panel with our city's police commissioner, mayor of the city and a bunch of other people, and then me. The ratio was 90% female and 10% males that came with their wifes. I talked about my mom and how she struggled when she first came to Canada and how I was heavily inspired by my female music teacher.

4828,"To take it a step further, be there for the mother to support her mentally and emotionally. The tasks involved in raising a newborn are not hard at all and babies are resilient and they're essentially created to survive. So it's honestly not difficult taking care of a newborn, what makes it really hard is the mental and emotional angst of taking care of your child combined with the lack of sleep. so if you can step back and realize this, it really helps a lot. 

But what I did not realize, and what really surprised me, is how difficult the post-delivery process can be for a mother. My wife recently gave birth to our first child a few months ago and she's has a very difficult time dealing with a bunch of issues that I just did not even think of. She has guilt from not being able to provide enough milk from her breasts, she had an unexpected C-section so she had a very difficult recovery process, she now has a scar she sees every day and so she deals with body issues, she's had difficulty getting rid of weight, she's not able to sleep well so she's constantly tired, etc., etc., etc., 

I was fortunate enough where my company gave me a long paternity leave (at least by US standards) and so i spent the first 2 months with my wife and newborn child. My sister told me in a very direct way that I shouldn't look at my paternity leave as an opportunity to take care of the baby; I should look at it as an opportunity to take care of my wife. Obviously she didn't mean I should ignore my responsibilities to the newborn, but she was simply emphasizing that the mom would have a lot of issues to deal with and so I should try to support her emotionally. So that's my tip -- make sure to be there for the mom with all her mental and emotional issues post-delivery."

I remember seeing this lime green car parked in this one parking space far away from everything when I was there last week but that day, it was still there.  I know it hadn‚Äôt moved since there was a fast food cup still on the ground behind the back tire.  I went up to the car and saw a man slumped over in the driver‚Äôs seat.

The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons; we have no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee, fuck thy mother.

Rorschach's badness is justified on a smaller scale: He destroys evil people one by one, and occasionally he kills someone who is otherwise good in the interest of eliminating _their_ evil.

Ozymandias is doing the same thing but he thinks bigger. Rorschach is a retailer‚Äîhe is concerned with individual customers. Other costumed heroes think bigger and worry about markets. Ozymandias thinks about entire _economies_. Are you willing to kill ten million people so that two billion can live? He is. Is that terrible? Of course it is. But so was killing Grice's dogs.

Although the stories you read here may have ultimately resulted in a better life, it is still a very hard road. There are far more kids who don't survive and end up living on the streets for the rest of their lives. You will most likely never hear those stories. 

I am not saying to not look for a way out of abusive situations, but running away and living on the streets should be your absolute last resort. There are plenty of resources available to people who need them. Talk with someone, anyone, chances are they will either be able to help you or know someone who can.

* Your *rights* as a citizen in various settings, especially where the police are involved
* Local/state laws you should be aware of
* How compound interest works, how to calculate it, and how it impacts you
* Writing a check, applying for loans, and making large purchases (financing etc. see compound interest)
* How to pay taxes
* Basic security principles (at home, and on a computer)
* Self-reliance (how to get help when there's nobody to give it to you)

I know that many schools have a program *like* this, but in my experience a lot of schools don't set aside an actual course and treat it with the importance they give Math and English. I don't think this should be a special program, I think it should be real work that has real homework and everybody is required to complete it. Too many people are graduating high school and making horrible life choices because they don't know any better.

If anyone has any ideas of what to add I'd be glad to hear them.

Edit: yes, it means dropping an elective for students in senior year. I think it‚Äôs worth it, as most seniors should have room for an ‚Äúextra‚Äù elective during that year without sacrificing their band/rotc/choir/art/whatever class. "

As she kept digging she found a bunch of naked dudes and to the point where she realizes he hasn't been working on his business he was supppsed to be getting off the ground, he's having sex chats with people and swapping nude pics.

I graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA , I went to a community college for a few years and made a 3.5 GPA

Then disaster struck

I went suddenly blind for a year

I had two severe vitreous hemorrhages, one in each eye

Vision went from ""OK"" to ""legally blind"" in half an hour 

The doctors couldn't do anything about it

I ended up dropping out of school, not being able to work, or see or anything

Eventually it healed enough, I wanted to go back to school, but my mom lost her job , I finally found a full time job, and did that for a few years.

I started going blind again a few years later, this time, cataracts.

I had almost no vision for two years, before the doctor did surgery

They could now see into the eyes after the surgery

I had developed glaucoma because the cataracts were so bad

I have now have permanent damage to my vision , have a million other problems, and now live on disability , homeless the last 2 years.

I went from being really smart kid who defied the odds, (was a miracle baby as well)  to a broke, fat old guy with PTSD , who can't even find a place to live.

I have an uncle who is gay and the happiest I've seen him was in the last few years when he met his partner. They're both wonderful together and I love his partner to pieces. Hes a great, funny guy. But I do know that my uncle went through conversation therapy at a young age and he explained it as being one of the most traumatic things he ever put himself through. I can't imagine what it was like and it kills me to know that people go through that. Especially people who have so much care in them."

4967,"co-worker in a long gone steel mill, we shall call him Goolie since that was close to his name.

Goolie was odd on so many levels, and while I was a new employee he had been there for about 20 years.

Goolie would eat off the floors and out of the trashcans, this was a job paying in the 50-60K a year range. He would steal the leftover slivers of soap left in the showers and squish them together to make 1 large ball of soap...but didn't shower at work.
Goolie would evaporate on midnight shift for an hour or so then end up back at his station with a trashbag full of clothes/boots that he had acquired from hitting all the dumpsters, then he would try on each item of clothing and keep them all. It was common for his shirts to say ""Joe"" and that wasn't his name. This is a steel mill, no one expected hospital sanitization...hell we flicked our smokes on the floor and spit a lot (it was dirty and you have to breathe). So you can imagine the sheer pits the dumpsters had to be. He would wear thrown out boots (the contract got you a free pair of boots each year) without socks...so boots guys had sweat in for months in ungodly heat he would just slap em on his feet and go about his business.

Goolie would drink your drinks if you didn't keep an eye on it like a hawk. Once a guy left a trail of Oreo cookies about 50yrds long from the storage area in the warehouse back to his station to see if he would re-appear...it worked, here he comes like an episode of Family Guy(but well before that show) just bending over eating a cookie then taking 4 steps and repeating. Oh piece of candy!

Goolie would say he was jackin it in the coil fields imagining some of the female foremen...this is a steel mill not a Starbucks. These were big ol cornfed women that were strong enough to break into a male dominated company in the 70's. They were strong and proud but they wernt spankbank material.

Goolie would cross aisles looking one way and holding his arm out the other way, think dab but no arm across the face. There were battery powered coil haulers that would move at a good clip down these ""roads"" plus being electric they made no sound. They were killers and had confirmed that fact a few times over the years. His logic was if they hit his arm he would feel it and move...instead of looking back and forth like a normal person. 

Goolie had been making 50-60K for 20 years and bought nothing, no car, no wife, no clothes (see above), no house since he lived with his 80+ year old parents. So god only knows where his money was...probably buried in his backyard. Anyhow, his mother got sick and ended up in the hospital and died of a few lung related issues(emphysema pneumonia that kinda stuff). Goolie was convinced the hospital killed her and was offering each of us new guys $20 to help him go dig her up so he could prove it was murder. 

Dude was a total nutcase...and that saying a lot if you stand out in the weirdness of a normal manufacturing plant.

**TL;DR Dude asked us to dig up his dead mom for $20 plus would eat off the dirty factory floor**"

He started saying something terse under his breath, going around the room looking for something in circles before turning off the lights and jumping into bed. I was already in bed reading some literature, and when he rolled over so his back was facing me I just got this thought a la Spidey Sense that he needed some back scratches even though it looked like he was trying to seclude himself.

Long story short: he melted like butter and then vented all that frustration to me, got it all out, tired himself out, gave me a hug and passed out haha"

Finally we get to dude's office, which is much more normal than the rest of the house. While we're waiting for his System 8 Mac to boot, I look at the pictures hanging on the walls. One of them is clearly the gun-nut when he was young, standing at ease in a diving vest and short-shorts, while being inspected by President Kennedy.

If they took all the time they put into shrines and used that development time for story centric dungeons I think I would have had a blast instead of loading hundreds of samey looking shrines over and over.

This led to yelling and screaming and crying about how i stole my childhood from her. I was 13 and 14 for these incidents that, if handled properly, wouldn't have scarred me for life and played a large role in me not wanting to see my parents again.
For reference, she found out I was cutting the same time she found the erotica. She was more concerned about some mild porn than her daughter hating herself. Cheers.

4992,"Usually with ""I'd love to"", a ""but"" follows with an explanation. 

A few years ago I was asking my then-girlfriend if she wanted to go with me to a gathering I was going to after work and I'd pick her up, she said she would think about it and see if she would be able to in the first place. Later on she said ""I'm good"" in text, and since the event was right after work I acknowledged and went. About an hour goes by she texts again asking if I was picking her up, long story short she made a running gag that I ""forgot her"" when I thought that by ""I'm good"" she meant that she was good with not going, she was going to stay home. That's the slang.

After I took her home and pulled up to my home, I sat for a minute processing it. Went inside, told my dad what happened and asked him if ""I'm good"" means the same thing to him that it did to me. He had a confused look on his face and answered in the affirmative, and doesn't know how she meant it that she was going to go rather than stay."

Background: was a Christian (past tense) at a fairly conservative college. Girl and I have been getting to know each other in group settings, I think she's cute so we keep in touch but will *only* hang with me in group settings. This obviously drags out the process and on top of that she is the type that wants to be ""courted"", so things are at a standstill. I ran into in the cafeteria one morning after a schedule change and walked up to her table to say hello, then asked if I could join. She kindly said she was having devotional time with God... No problem. Flash forward a week and same thing, see her at a table reading her Bible, I swing over that way just to say good morning and when I did, she looked up and just said ""Jesus time!"" rather lackadaisically, but also somewhat condescendingly. 

I was over it in that moment. 

So a month goes by, and we are still seeing each other incidentally with this group of friends, but I'm paying her minimal attention. We've not established anything at this point, so I don't feel the need to acknowledge the fact that I'm moving on. Meanwhile, I get a crush on another girl who recently joined the crew from girl 1s dorm. Girl 1 catches on, asks if I like girl 2 and I say yes. 

Two weeks later girl 1 text me in a huff and asks if we can talk. We meet somewhere semi-private and sit down, where she tells me that she doesn't doesn't feel like ""God isn't taking our lives the same direction""...

In my head: mild screaming, but also 1) bitch how dare you fucking use god as a cop out, just own up to your shit and 2) we weren't fucking dating because even if Jesus himself asked you out, you'd say he isn't Christlike enough.

But to try to directly get between a hooker and pimp might well result in them both attacking you. Not sure if that is what you meant.

If I met a girl who was homeless and hooking to survive, not clear what one could do -- you ain't going to take them home with you; most people don't have the money to change the lives of a random hooker. If it was a situation where she convinced me she needed to get home and would use the money for that (big ""if"") i might give her a few hundred with no expectation of seeing it again. But in general, a girl in that situation left home for a reason, probably is beyond your ability to help."

In college, she called me over to her place because she thought she heard a noise in her apt. I had just got a pizza so brought it over. She didnt have furniture yet in her living room, so we sat on the floor with a blanket, ate pizza and watched movies until late at night. Wasnt a big blanket so we had to sit tight.

It was time to go to sleep and I said I'll sleep on the floor downstairs, and she said, ""absolutely not, my bed is big enough for both of us!"" So we went upstairs she went into her closet to change, but disnt close the door, and easy to see her changing. She wore little booty revealing underwear and a tank top. Being a respectful guy and quite frankly pretty poor at making moves at that time in my life, I froze. We may have touched skin in bed, but I stayed on my side and she stayed on hers. I dont think I slept at all.

She had to get up earlier than me and got  a shower went to class. I waited until she left before I went downstairs myself but there was a note there for me. Dont remember exactly what it said, but the main points were, 
1. I love you.
2. I trust you more than anyone else I've ever met.
3. I am so lucky to have you in my life.

So I thought this was the sign to make the move (obviously the bed was one also), so the next daymnowing she was going to be at class, I brought her flowers and left a note telling her how I felt...thinking how lucky I truly am.

She writes me a letter soon after and drops it off at my apt. The whole letter was about how she loved me, but not that way, and that she never saw me in that light. I was crushed. She still wanted to be friends. I couldn't do it. So heart-wrenching. Let my guard down and got, well, crushed.

5144,"I've been dealing with a Frank since high school. He was convinced the reason I wouldn't date him was because of a mutual friend, when it was actually all because of him. It never bothered him that I dated anyone else, he just seemed paranoid that I might date this other guy (my actual best friend). I turned him down repeatedly, but we tried to maintain a friendship, and although we'd stop talking here and there we mostly managed to keep it going for a while.

Then about ten years later I actually started dating the friend he'd been so worried about, and it's like he couldn't think of anything else but going full nuclear. The first opportunity that presented itself he blew up at me. The whole thing was very public and very messy and he was so much more vicious than that tiny argument required. It was obvious he had been waiting for his chance to hurt me back for the perceived injustice I'd committed against him.

He pops up now and then, apologizes for his most recent blowup or for not talking to me for months at a time. He always asks if I'm still in a relationship, and I always confirm that yes, I am still with our mutual friend. The last time we spoke was August or so, and when he asked about my relationship status I told him I was getting married. I haven't heard from him since then.

I want to feel bad for him, but I've been pretty kind considering the things he's said and the names he's called me. I only ever wanted to be his friend. I made that abundantly clear."

We get this very old woman just moaning ""Help"" a few times.  She sounds very strangled and in dire need of assistance.  But she gives us no info.  The only thing we had to go on was the logged phone number in the message system.  This doesn't always work though.  We called it twice and got no response.

I decided to try and use white page's reverse number lookup and got a name, cross referenced in my system for people we were expecting in the coming weeks and got a match.  I called the non-emergency police and told them what I knew.  They took it seriously (I was worried I was going to be taken as a crank call or something), but that was the last we heard for the time being.  Coworker and I were both shaken and remained so for a few days.

After a few days I decided to try calling the number again, and this time actually got a response from the woman.  Turns out she had come down with an extremely bad flu, and was in her 80s, I believe it was.  She had been dangerously dehydrated and called us...somehow.  Why our number and not 911, I'll never know, but I'm just thankful we were able to figure her info out.

In the following photos her headless body is the subject, with her killer having placed her in suggestive positions. She is naked except for black leather boots and decapitated at this point. Her body is then moved onto the floor, and the killer continues to place her in suggestive postures. In one photo she is sitting up against a wall and has her legs spread, with a silver cross between them. Lots of marking on her body‚Äîhe could have beaten her before killing her or it might be due to death by strangulation, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was sexually abusing her body. The last few are of her disembodied head on a counter. In one image the killer is prying the eyelid open (her face is swollen from strangulation), and in another he has placed sunglasses on her face. There are a few photos of her head placed sideways so the stump is visible‚Äîit's mainly just a red mess, no organs (trachea/esophagus) or vertebrae were visible, although the cut looks somewhat clean (as in there are only small ragged bits of skin hanging down).

5357,"One thing I learned a long time ago that really helped me cross the divide from hating sports to loving them was that people don‚Äôt care about sports because they think it‚Äôs actually that inherently important. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt understand how ridiculous it is. They care because, like any non-critical pursuit that anyone cares about, they‚Äôve chosen to be invested.

Sports, like anything else in life, gives you back exactly what you put into it. The more invested you are, the more of an impact it will have on your life. When you think of it like that, it feels a lot less stupid because that‚Äôs how everything in life works. No matter what it is that you choose to apply yourself to, you‚Äôre always going to have to deal with the results that you get. The more of yourself you put into whatever that is, the more those results will impact you physically, mentally, and emotionally.

When you have a superficial or non-existent understanding of a sport, all you see is a bunch of fully grown men playing a child‚Äôs game while being paid ridiculous sums of money to do so. It‚Äôs a joke. But if you just accept it for what it is, you can still choose to take it seriously on one level or another. Obviously this still requires some basic level of interest to support your effort, but once your ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù starts growing it can be immensely satisfying.

I started following hockey and football knowing absolutely nothing, but what I realized is that my default position of ‚Äúthis is stupid‚Äù only ever surfaced when I didn‚Äôt understand something. As the years started to go by, I learned a ton things ranging from rules to strategy to knowing the players themselves, etc. And what I noticed was that as my foundation of knowledge grew, as my investment grew, my enjoyment grew as well. I went from being completely miserable anytime sports was involved in anything to being a genuine fan.

It‚Äôs not that people are dumb and have the wrong priorities, it‚Äôs just a choice some people make. It‚Äôs a hobby. It‚Äôs an interest to have. It‚Äôs a fun extra layer of personality to have. It‚Äôs not for everyone, but I really did learn that it was so critical that I couldn‚Äôt just expect to get something out of it at face value without putting something in first. The same goes for anything else I‚Äôve ever done, from learning the guitar to learning how to exercise properly to my career. Everything in life only gives you back what you put into it. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a sports fan, just try not to hate on people for liking sports because there‚Äôs more going on there than you‚Äôd think."

5364,"Dashcon was a bit of a let down, but the artist floor was pretty cool and some of panels were awesome. I got a hug from Doug Jones!!! However when we all got called down to the massive conference hall and told that the con staff needed to raise a bunch of money for the hotel it was a little odd. If I remember right, the story they were going with was that the hotel/convention center didn‚Äôt think that the convention would be as big as it was (which is was the Rosemont convention center I think so, idk how they thought it would be small) and had upped the fee to keep the convention for more than one day at the last minute. I think (like a lot of the things they booked) the con center wasn‚Äôt 100% paid for after the first day (I think it was a total of 2 days... idk it was a while ago) so they upped their rates after seeing the type of people that the con brought in. There was a huge fancy wedding reception going on one of the nights and I don‚Äôt think they wanted Dashcon goers to be seen by the wedding guests. But they sectioned off the hallway and it worked out. Plus the wedding party and a ton of the guests though the con goers were awesome and complimented a lot of cosplays as we passed by. It was poorly planned, especially with the Welcome to Nightvale fiasco and the convention center issue, but it did have its good moments.

5365,"I won a contest that Sprint ran to promote the release of the HTC Evo 4G. To enter you had to submit a 150 word story describing something you do ""fast"", and if chosen, you had to be willing to blog about your trip and post pictures on a dedicated site.

Prizes were an early HTC Evo phone, 1 year of service (which ended up being only a credit for that line for 12 months, my family plan had 4 lines so I was still on the hook for that), a trip to a 4G destination (we lucked out and got Maui!), and spending cash. 10 winners would compete by blogging and the public would vote for you with the highest vote getter receiving a $4000 cash bonus (which I won also, based mostly on a cute pic of my 1 year old son wearing a bright orange wig.) 

The promotion company booked my wife and I a 4 day, 3 night stay at The Whaler in Maui. We received Amex gift cards for the balance after the flight and accommodations (I think it was $8000 to begin and I believe we got roughly $6000 in Amex cards.)

At the time, my wife and I had 2 kids and just agreed to buy a small home when we got the news a day before closing that we needed an additional $3500 to pay because a government credit we were told we'd  qualify for fell through. This exhausted the last of our savings and we literally had ZERO furniture, TVs, or appliances.

So naturally we spent over $4k of the trip money to furnish and stock new home... and I am so thankful for it. 

My wife and I were married the year before and didn't have money for a proper honeymoon, so this served as a good substitute.  We were so happy to have won this contest and I think, based on our situation at the time, it was meant to be.

It took over twenty minutes to pull the three guys in it out of the water because we had to dump our gear on shore first to avoid swamping the rescueing canoes too. The packs in the swamped canoe were inexpertly packed, resulting in us losing several days worth of food, leaving us with maybe two small meals extra- enough to continue onward so long as we didn't delay extra days.

Well he goes to meet his possible daughter and as soon as he saw her he knew right away that she was his. Looks a lot like him. They did the DNA test anyways. Came back that he was her dad.

Well he plans a meeting between him, his wife, me, and my brother to meet his daughter and her mother as a family. Well all I knew was we were gonna meet them. Didnt know anything else. Hadn't seen any pictures prior to that.  

Well we walk into a restaurant and I see this super cute girl walk by. Only the side profile and he ass. I was thinking to myself ""dayum she fine! And dat ass is killer!"" Well we all shuffle our way to meet my new sister and guess who I see sitting at the table we are walking towards? The girl I was just freaking drooling over. I was now the guy who had the hots for his own damn half sister. That was an odd  feeling. 

 On that note, here is a similar kinda story that sounds like it's out of some damn shitty teen comedy romance movie. There was a girl I had a crush on in middle school. She was cute and had killer hips and ass.

 Well my dad had recently started dating again after being single for a long time. He and this girl date for a few months and they decide that everyone should meet! Me, my dad and my brother go to meet her and her daughter! 

Again, I hadn't seen any pictures or anything of either of them. Well we get there and guess who the daughter is? My fucking crush. Go figure. Then our parents got married and my crush was now my step sister.

5396,"Stuck me with an expensive hotel bill and taxi ride.

I was on a trip to Kandas City with one group of friends and had been drinking all day when I ran into a guy and his wife that I also am friends with. They were going to go to the downtown part district where their hotel was and my other group of friends was just wanting to go back to the hotel in another part of the city. I decided to continue drinking and everyone agreed that we would meet up at the baseball game the next day so I could ride back home with the people I came down with.

The problem was I kept drinking and ended up walking off by myself and  lost track of where the husband and wife were. I stumbled around the streets looking for their hotel and thought I had found it (a Marriott) but actually was at an Embassy Suites. I was hanging out in the lobby when I was finally told that I needed to get a room or leave. I got a room and woke up at about 11:30 the next morning to a horrible hangover and huge bill.

Keep in mind that this was before cellphones, so I couldn't just call or text everyone. I tried calling both hotels where I knew my friends were staying,  but they had already checked out because of the time. I had to call a cab to take me to the baseball stadium, while trying not to dry heave the entire time. 

Some guy outside the stadium took pity on me and gave me a ticket to the game, but I had no idea where any of my friends were sitting. I was just trying to figure out how to make contact with someone when I heard my name from behind me. Turns out the original group of friends I came down with had bought tickets that day that ended up being a few rows behind the free one I was given.

Disaster was avoided,  but I think i saw about 2 of the 15 runs that were scored in the game because i spent most of it dry heaving in the bathroom. "

5428,"Pok√©mon breeding in and of itself makes no sense anyway.

At a base level, you put in one male, and one female Pok√©mon and you end up with a baby Pok√©mon that's theoretically the youngest version of whatever you put in. So a male Fearow with a female Pidgeotto gives you a baby Pidgey. That alone shouldn't make sense, why can a Fearow impregnating a different species of birth result in a younger version of the same bird? This is based on egg groups, and some of the shared egg groups make no sense - most well known is Skitty (a small cat) with Wailord (a giant blue whale). 

Then you get baby forms that require incense. Normally, if you breed with a female Snorlax, the baby is another Snorlax, as Snorlax is the base form, but if you have the mother Snorlax hold a Lax incense, you end up with a Munchlax. Somehow it can have a younger form, but only if it smells a particular scent. Which would imply that all such babies are maybe premature births. But, all Pok√©mon are born from eggs, and you can put the egg in the box for years, as it will only hatch if you walk with it (the distance required can be shortened if kept in a party with a Pok√©mon that knows Flame Body).

But Ditto makes it make even less sense. Ditto can turn into a mirror copy of any Pok√©mon, and can breed with nigh anything. Including Pok√©mon like Hitmonchan who are all male, and Electrode, which don't have a defined gender (and are otherwise completely unaffected by gender based attacks like attract). But if Ditto's a perfect mirror, where does it get the vagina for otherwise all male Pok√©mon? Also, Ditto can't breed with another Ditto. It's impossible to hatch a Ditto. So where do all the wild Ditto come from?"

The eagle seemed unpersuaded and continued to tear away at the gull, until things got too busy - then it grabs the remains and takes off ... the crows chase it, the seagulls followed the crow.

So the wedding itself was great, I had a wonderful time, but the shitshow behind the scenes to keep the parents contained was super uncomfortable.

I walked to the bar and Grace's stepdad stopped me and asked if I was pregnant. I kinda laughed and said ""I hope not"" but then he went into this rant that women like me should be more careful and not drink before Grace's brother rescued me. 

Grace also told me later that Brian's stepmom lost her shit because Brian walked his mom down the aisle, followed by his dad walkin with the stepmom, but apparently she wanted to go first. She threatened to *leave* the wedding.

My 22nd birthday, I was working nights. It's the middle of summer, it's buggy, and my boss decided to give me the night off. So I woke up at my regular time to not throw off my sleep schedule. (2 p.m.) and I was debating what to do after I cooked myself breakfast. Hung around the apartment for a bit, then decided to ride my bicycle around. 

I was wearing a black baseball cap because I couldn't find my helmet. Worried about bugs in my teeth, I also threw a black bandana on over my nose and mouth. I had a backpack full of beers to drink on the way downtown, also black. 

I hit the trails with my nice big lights on my bike so I could see where I was going, and made it the 15 or so miles to downtown. I did stop every couple miles or so and had a beer. So by the time I got downtown, it was midnight. 

I got spotted by a member of the local constabulary riding a bicycle downtown with a dead battery in my tail light, a black hat, and a black bandana on my face at midnight on a weekday. Needless to say, that police officer's interest was piqued, and he rolled his car around for a chat. Once he realized I was a moron, and not actually up to no good, he was really chill with everything. He ran my license for wants and warrants, we had about a 20-minute chat about paintballing, (paintball company backpack) he wished me a happy birthday, and sent me on my way. 

He almost definitely thought I was up to no good. "

5535,"Right, but we have an obligation to prisoners, like it or not. They are, by the nature of being imprisoned, unable to support themselves. We can't just not support them. Not unless you want to release them all, or kill them all. The only two realistic alternatives, incidentally. 

Whereas we have no practical obligation to the homeless. Morally we might, but not in a practical sense. They have greater capability to provide for themselves than someone who is incarcerated. Difficult, yes, but much easier than someone doing 25 to life.

It would be nice to be able to give everyone a basic income but it's just not feasable. We *have* to spend the money on prisoners, like it or not. We don't *have* to spend money we don't have on giving everyone universal income. 

&gt; Also is it not fucked up that 2.2 MILLION people in the U.S. are behind bars? Thats over half a percent of the entire population.

Yes, that is fucked up. But that is an entirely different discussion. "
5536,Definitely not my cousins new wife. 
5537,"Ok, so this is a weird story . I would definitely say that he is incel, but I think there may be way more going on, with certain aspects of his situation not being completely clear to me.

When I was in the training phase of my Navy career (not bootcamp, but our ""A"" school or where we learn our specific job). I met a dude(can't remember his name so we will go with incel) who seemed to be pretty chill ( I am a dude myself and not a target of an incel). While he was a little off socially speaking, no bells went off in my head, although I have a pretty high tolerance as I know how it feels to be left out so I always try to be as inclusive as possible so long as major lines aren't crossed. 

This guy pretty much stuck to himself, playing video games. He was not out of shape, and not actually unattractive. It was actually strange in that the way he carried himself, most people thought it was his form of humor to be ""socially awkward"" and until you got to know him, you didn't realize that was how he is. I don't know if I am describing it right. it is like the way he speaks and the way he moves makes most people misunderstand his social awkwardness.

Now before I say what I am going to say, I play video games myself, and I see no correlation between playing them and being a ""neckbeard"" type. yes they come hand in hand and yes you can be addicted, but just because you play doesn't mean you are some basement dweller.

Now that that has been said, He was a pinball wizard in the sense that he has literally beaten every pinball game at all the local arcades. Now I don't mean to say that playing pinball makes you weird, but I think the fact that it is in the 2010s, and the most time anyone really puts into playing pinball would be like 15-20 minutes tops, because how many pinball machines do you really see, and of that number, how many do you ever see really get used? I would like to say that this alone was not a red flag, but that after everything else was said and done, it kinda makes you go ""ohhhhhhhhh""

So other than social awkwardness he was alright. It is now important to explain that while we were in ""A"" school, he was treated like crap in one situation. Now, the people who ran our ""barracks"" (I use this word because it is the easiest for the unfamiliar to understand) were in charge of us. they told us when we worked, when we went to school (to a point. we had a set schedule) when we had duty, when we had liberty, etc... and they also had the ability to punish us any amount of ways for anything they felt like. Unfortunately this would be abused in many situations, and incel was definitely a target of ""I want to punish someone because I can"". long story short, he was falling behind in a ""self-paced"" course. when this happens we have to go to a mandatory extra session everyday until completion or until we catch up. He finished the course and when he was receiving his certificate of completion he made sure to ask if he needed to show up the next day (saturday) for mandatory study. the guy was like, why would you need to? you are done, plus, here is your certificate of completion. so he got to sleep in the next day, or so he thought. He got called down to the office and he got in trouble for not going to mandatory study despite having completed the class and despite adequate proof he didn't need to go. They gave him restriction. This is not just some slap on the wrist. This means 45 days of half pay, 45 days of extra duties, as well as being restricted to the barracks and the galley. so, pretty fucked up for punishment for nothing.

Well we went our separate ways. He went to the west coast, and I went home to the east coast. We become friends on facebook. Facebook was way more popular then than now, and it was my homepage which meant that i opened my browser and it was the first thing I would see. Often times I would open up just to go to a different website. meanwhile he would always message me to play some facebook game. whatever the latest bullshit was. This is where things started getting weird.

Whenever I told him I didn't want to play, he would guilt trip me hard. Also, the second I opened my browser he would message me. Every. Time. When I didn't respond (whether knowingly or just clicking to wherever I wanted to go on the web) a couple minutes later he would message again with super passive aggressive bullshit like ""I guess I am not important enough to talk to today. whatever"". 

Now to the incel stuff. After he was out of the Navy, it sounded like he was in some kind of weird halfway house. He had a job outside of where he lived, but he also had a curfew set by the place he lived. I never fully understood what kind of place it was, but I felt it best not to ask any further questions. It sounded like he could own whatever he wanted inside and go wherever, but he had a curfew (If you know what this might be, feel free to elaborate) and at this place, there was a girl that worked the front desk that he took a liking too. He told me he would always see her and he would get ""that"" feeling in his heart and he would get all nervous. He talked to her a few times but could never get the nerve to ask her out. I kept encouraging him to talk to her, and he would almost do it but he would chicken out everytime. This went on for months. quite possibly a year even. He never went forward with anything. (from this point on, keep in mind that the idea of incel was not known as incel. I'm sure this was a stereotype of people seen as weird to the mainstream) This slowly started to get weird as he said he would get jealous of other guys flirting with her. I kept telling him ""well, why don't you try"" and he would say he couldn't get the nerve to do it. Then he started complaining when guys would show up to take her on a lunch date. and then it became clear that she was dating one guy. complaining went to straight up aggression towards the subject matter. He started freaking out about the idea that she was probably having sex with all these guys and she was a slut, even though he had no proof of any of this. I even pointed out that he had no right to be upset, as they were not in a relationship and he in fact never made any moves, plus even if he did, she may not even be into him. He was having none of it. All of the sudden she was a whore who ripped his heart out and stomped on it repeatedly even though he never even asked her out on a single date. He never put himself out there. It got so bad I stopped talking to him for awhile. Of course I kept getting angry messages from him (This anger never showed itself when we were in the Navy BTW.

Then finally, when we were talking again (against my better judgement, because I wanted to help the guy out) He told me he was looking to move somewhere else. He was tired of seeing her with other guys and he wanted a fresh start somewhere. I explained to him that my job was always hiring and paid well. It was a job that the military was a customer of (I won't name what the job is so don't ask. the question will be ignored). When he found out that the military was a customer, out of the blue he tore into me about how I dare help those monsters out in any way shape or form and how I was a child killer and yadda yadda yadda. I never  read stranger messages in my entire life and so I cut contact right there. I get that the military as a whole are not the good guys (to an extent) but it was obvious he was displaying some rather extremist views. I don't think he would ever do anything dangerous, but I felt it serious enough to cut contact. His views also were not because he disagreed ideologically. It definitely stemmed from the incident where  he was put on restriction wrongfully. He made that quite clear. I don't blame him for being salty about the situation, but there was definitely some mental illness going on at this point.

5542,"Our company builds things, usually standard units but sometimes custom if a customer asks.

We were contacted by a middleman company on behalf of another company to build something that is pretty custom that we haven't really ever done.  We were told they are just trying to hit a certain temperature but other than that, there's no spec.  So, myself and another guy engineer it that way.

Now they've received the product and asking why it doesn't meet this spec that they have.  Nobody told us, ever along the way, and myself and the other guy frequently asked ""now, the product can only do this, is this ok?"" and were constantly told yes its fine.

So we've been having to have conference calls with the customer and the middleman company trying to arbitrate what to do.  I think the failing is with the middleman not doing their research on us because they keep referring to us as experts in &lt;custom product we don't sell&gt; field, and why is it so hard to make a product that meets the customer specs?

I just want to scream at her over the phone.  The customer themselves is really cordial and I think we can work around what they need, problem being they kind of don't know what they need."

5545,"This is basically a spot-on dissertation about why I'm hesitant to go to law school (was accepted last year).  I'm a paralegal, making more money yet working far less hours than associate attorneys typically do outside of biglaw.

 It grates on me to not be able to give legal advice when I know the answer, and not getting credit for my best work.

5658,"It wasn‚Äôt a patient‚Äîjust an entire unit. I was working a couple summers ago when the entire hospital was short staffed. They were offering double incentive pay ($20/hr on top of OT). The catch was you had to pick up through the float pool so they would assign you to any random unit that needed you. I get the call that I‚Äôm to go to 7 south. After a lot of confusion and being turned away from 7 North, I find where I‚Äôm supposed to go. 
Apparently the unit used to be the NICU/Newborn nursery before we had a children‚Äôs hospital. But then it got abandoned and was just empty rooms with some cute baby colors on the walls. This unit had not been re-done or stocked or even staffed, but that night it was being used as an observation unit for ER patients. There was no regular staff, protocols, or rules. The charge nurse was also a float pool nurse there for overtime. We had to call down to supply for IV kits and nasal cannulas because the storage room only had a few items and random baby stuff. 
The whole unit gave off a creepy vibe. Of course I was working night shift as well. We were using roughly 1/3 of the rooms available, so during some downtime I was wandering around looking behind closed doors. I found many small empty offices with computer screens on, just illuminating the darkness. Creepy af. 
Another important thing to note: that although the unit still had some baby supplies around there were absolutely no children on the unit. We had an entirely separate children‚Äôs hospital and there are strict rules that no children (visitors or otherwise) under the age of 12 are to be in the adult hospital after 9pm. So there weren‚Äôt any kiddos around. 

Around 2 or 3 am I‚Äôm in my patient‚Äôs room chatting for a little bit. While she‚Äôs talking I notice that the sprite can that‚Äôs on the bedside table between us starts moving. It almost slides off the table so I catch it and move it. I just go, ‚Äúhuh that‚Äôs weird‚Äù when my patient casually asks me if we also have kids on the unit tonight. I ask her why and she says ‚Äúoh because I just saw the cutest little girl with blonde pigtails looking in here!‚Äù 

Fuck. That. Shit. 

I told my charge nurse and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh yeah this unit is definitely haunted.‚Äù

5673,"It's a real enough thing that ""resilience"" has been the buzzword of choice for the past several years in academic circles. Kids who are pressured to excel invest enormously in that identity, and if the home environment hasn't been forgiving of failure (which is part of excelling, because you need to take risks), you end up with fine crystal: impressive but fragile. Put those kids into a highly competitive university where every kid in the class is accustomed to being the best student in the room and many of them shut down. They have been taught that that the only acceptable role is top of the class, and when they can't achieve that, they face a painful crisis of identity and self-worth at a point when they don't always have the social and emotional resources to deal with it. 

TL;DR: If you want your kid to excel at college, support him/her through failure and teach your kid how to bounce back. "
5674,"This is seriously such a common thing. People go through highschool and are captain of every team and president of every club with straight A's taking every Honors or AP class they can find, then they hit college and instantly fall apart, because in real life, you can never be the best at everything and if you try, you will probably not end up being very good at anything."

As I walked up to the van, in a loud voice I said ""What's the hurry lead foot?"".  That's when I got up close enough to the driver side window to see that it is NOT my friend from college, but a complete stranger.  A stranger in a wheelchair with hand accelerator and hand brake. A stranger in a wheelchair that I had just called ""lead foot""...

I quickly said ""please drive safely sir, you are free to go"" as I did an about face and scooted back to my cruiser. I called back in service to dispatch and got the heck out of there.

- If you do not want to do something, there is never shame in simply saying ""No""
- And do say ""no"" - not ""maybe later"" or ""we'll see"" or some other postponement tactic. Don't wanna? Draw the line and say ""no""
- If you are uncomfortable in a situation, get up and leave. No explanations or excuses are ever necessary
- It is entirely possible for two people to be close friends and get along well yet not feel any romantic attraction. If you have the hots for someone but they have declined pursuing any sexyfuntimes, respect their choice and move on.

I personally really appreciate my hair. (I'm a guy, and the only guy in my family to make it to 26 and not be totally bald. My hair is super long, and it's fucking gorgeous, i'll tell ya.) To me, losing my hair would be no different than losing an arm. I am 100% serious.

The show fails to accurately communicate the thought process behind making those mistakes, and I hypothesize it's because nobody writing the show actually knows what it's like to be poor and making shitty decisions for the sake of it.

If you don't see us dating seriously, that's fine, but let me know so we can both move on to find what we're looking for. 

My boyfriend of almost three years always texted back in a timely manner, showed up for dates on time, and he initiated the ""where do you see this going"" talk after probably four dates, and it impressed the hell out of me that he was up front with his feelings instead of dancing around the issue- he straight up told me that he liked me a lot, wasn't seeing anyone else and didn't want to, and that he could see this going somewhere great.

5928,Perth zoo in Western Australia has had a very succesful captive breeding program for Sumatran Orangutans for a long long time and has had a decent sized Orangutan group for a long time.The  breeding program has worked so well that it is the only zoo that releases orangutans back into the wild.I think the success of the breeding programit was an inadvertent accident.In the 1960's the zoo built a big bell tower shaped cage for its male orangutan with a platform right up the top where the male orangutan would stay.It was just a happy coincidence that he was a magnificent super sexy orangutan that no female could resist and he fathered about twenty babies over the journey and that orangutans like to be able to see each other from a distance but don't feel the need to visit very often.There have been many escapes from enclosures over the years.The smartest one was an orangutan that watched tradesman building upright structures and at night by just using the strength in his hands pulled out the screws and bolts in his jungle gym and rearranged it and the ropes so that he could swing across the moat and out of his enclosure.

My friend told me about his neighbor. They lived in a neighborhood where they had big ass front lawns and long driveways. His neighbor was a retired mechanic, and he had a few clunkers parked in his driveway. They didn't run, and he used them to take parts from, mostly. One of these clunkers was a conversion van.  

His neighbor started hearing things coming from his front yard. Every time he'd go to the window to look, there would be nothing. Eventually though, he'd start hearing voices, like *whispering* voices. And every time he'd run to the front window, there'd be nothing and nobody.   

So this guy called the cops. After a couple times, the cops told him he needed to stop calling them and put up surveillance, because they could find nothing at all. The whispering continued, and this guy legitimately thought he was going nuts.   

One summer evening, the guy couldn't sleep, so he went out to his back patio to smoke a cigarette. That's when he could hear the whispering coming from the front. He snuck around and peered around the corner just in time to see the doors to his conversion van silently shut. The dude ran back around to the back and went inside and called the police to tell them what he had seen. Cops arrived down the road, and got out and as they approached the van, the doors swung open and a bunch of people ran out in different directions.   

Turns out the locking mechanism was not working, and some heroin addicts had been using the van to shoot up in. There were little empty baggies and needles inside the van. According to my friend, his neighbor changed the locks, and put up surveillance cameras around the house. But he was so relieved that he wasn't losing his mind after all "

Anyway, here's one of my favorites. Two punchlines, even. A bargain. A bang for your buck. 


Archdeacon Frollo is looking for a new bellringer because Quasimodo died, starving himself to death by Esmeralda's grave. If you know anything about the book, it's slightly darker than the film. But, the problem for the Archdeacon is the same; the bells need to get rung, and he very well isn't going to ring them himself, so he puts out a notice that he's looking for a replacement for the dead hunchback.

Frollo was nothing if not a bastard at heart, and decided to himself that it should be another freak of nature, a man or woman who did not belong in proper society that should take up the job cloistered up in the belltower. Food and lodgings would be provided, and one of the vermin the Archdeacon hated so much would be off the streets. Frollo's notice was a big hit, as many, many people wanted to have the honored position of bellringer of the bells of Notre Dame. Up from the top, Archdeacon Claude Frollo could see the line wrapped around the church, all people wanting the job desperately.

One by one, they climbed up, up, up the winding stairs of the church of Notre Dame to meet the Archdeacon of the church Claude Frollo and audition as bellringer. One by one, they descended back down the winding stairs of the church of Notre Dame after the Archdeacon of the church Claude Frollo turned them away for either being too normal or an insufficient musical talent for such a prestigious position as the bellringer at the church of Notre Dame. The sun was getting lower little by little and Frollo was starting to give up hope. If he didn't find them by the end of the day today, he'd have to start all over tomorrow, or perhaps even have to ring the bells himself which was quite out of the question.

A man shambled to the top of the stairs and Frollo turned around.

""I'm here to audition,"" he said, and Frollo took stock of him. He was average height, average build, with a smiling face and, Frollo noticed, no arms. The Archdeacon of the church of Notre Dame Claude Frollo laughed for the first time in many years.

""Thank you for lightening my spirits,"" he said, ""but you have no arms to ring the bells with. I am sorry only that you had to climb all this way for such a joke.""

""No, please,"" the man begged, ""let me show you. I can play the bells""

Frollo stepped aside with his arms crossed and waited. The man stepped forward, pulled his head back, and slammed into the first bell with his forehead. Down the row he went and back again, playing a tune that Frollo once knew when he was a much younger man. Even his icy heart started to melt a little. The playing was perfect, and this armless man had full control of everything from the volume of each bell to the length the note was held with only his head striking them. Frollo grabbed him by the shoulder and wiped a tear from his eye. He led the man to the window overlooking the entire city, the window that would be this man's view for as long as he served as the bellringer at the church of Notre Dame.

""Son, you have done me a great service, and will do this city an even greater one. Truly, you are the most talented musician in generations to grace our church. I am glad my search found you.""

And Archdeacon Claude Frollo clapped the main on the back, giddy that his long day had yielded results. Now, there was only one problem. Without arms to steady himself, what Archdeacon Frollo thought was a gentle pat on the back actually sent this armless man teetering towards the window. Before Frollo knew what had happened, the man fell down, down, down the belltower to the streets of Notre Dame. Frollo let out an ungodly shriek and sprinted down the spiral stairs to get to the ground.

Out the front door of the church he flew, where a crowd had already gathered around the man who had fallen down from the belltower of the church of Notre Dame, dead and splattered on the ground.

""Oh, Archdeacon Frollo, Archdeacon Frollo!"" Shouted a woman. ""This man, he fell from above! From the belltower of the church of Notre Dame! Archdeacon Frollo, who is this man?""

""Well, I don't know his name, but his face rings a bell.""

Archdeacon Claude Frollo rang the bells himself the next morning grumpily. He'd lost his golden goose, and needed to find another. So he put out another notice for the next afternoon, requesting that anyone interested, even those who had already auditioned, return and try again. He looked out from the top of the tower at the line already forming, even in the early hours of the morning. Surely one of these men or women would be a suitable replacement.

""Archdeacon Frollo,"" said one of the deacons, ""there is a man here, insistent to see you. He says it cannot wait.""

Frollo turned around and saw a perfectly normal man with an odd resemblance to his armless casualty the day before. With the arms, he didn't quite fit the bill Frollo was looking for. But before Archdeacon Frollo of the church of Notre Dame could speak, this man started weeping openly.

""What's the matter?"" The Archdeacon asked.

""The man yesterday who tragically fell to his death was my brother Archdeacon Frollo. My own brother. His only wish was to ring the bells of Notre Dame. Musical talent runs in our family, and despite my own occupation as a cobbler, I wish now to take up his place and serve this great church of Notre Dame.""

Frollo decides, just this once, to make an exception, and see if this man truly does have the talent his brother had. He sent the deacons away, and gestured for this new audition to begin. And begin it did; the man played with inhuman grace, better even than his brother, and Frollo felt a tear prick the corner of his eye. This was it. This was the future of the church of Notre Dame. Frollo clapped despite himself, and the man pulled his arm back to strike the bell a final time, the end to his song.

Suffice to say, the final blow never came. The man clutched his chest, gasping for air, and dropped to his knees. Frollo ran to him, but felt no pulse even seconds later. He died there, in the belltower of the church of Notre Dame, at the side of Archdeacon Claude Frollo. Frollo let out another inhuman shriek, and the deacons came running.

""Archdeacon Frollo, what is the matter-oh, God almighty! What happened to this man? What was the name of the man that needed to see you so urgently and died here in our own belltower in the church of Notre Dame?""

""I never learned his name, but he's a dead ringer for his brother."""

6022,"I work for comcast as a tech. We had a chronic call in old lady who at this point was just calling in and complaining about her services just to get credits on her account. The house had been rewired 2x from the tap to each outlet. The levels were beautifil, and all she had was one hd box and one small adapter box... no internet or phone. 
She would always complain her tv was in Spanish (pressing the button on the remote to turn on SAP), her tv was showing no signal (wrong input everytime), or some other stupid excuse like she  ouldnt get her dvd to work (not our problem). I always get sent to corporate escalations as a SR tech, so I was in this ladies house about 7 or 8 times. 
The last time I was there, she was complaining about her tv not working at all. She unplugged it from the wall. 
Every single time i was there, i was always professional and nice to her. 
But she was a raging old lady bitch and would scream at me and my supervisor (supervisors have to go to all corporate escaltions with techs, so he was with me every time i was there).

So just a quick side note, every time she calls in within a 30 day period, it counts as repeat on the last tech out. Since i was the only one who would go, my metrics for repeats took a hug dip and looked terrible over a 2 month period, and i was getting pissed because now youre fucking with my money when raise time comes along.

So, back to cranky old lady. The last time we were out there, she was cursing us off about her tv being broken because we kept rewiring the wires and swithcing out boxes. THE FUCKING TV WAS UNPLUGGED BY YOU BITCH. So finally towards the end of the job, she mentioned that if something happened again, she would be switching to Verizon. I looked at my supervisor, and he had a smirk on his face. I took out my phone, looked up verizon fios phone #, wrote it down on a piece of paper, and gave it to her. I told her that comcast will no longer service her because she was just scamming us for credits, so she needs to switch to verizon. She flipped the fuck out. She started throwing stuff at us like pens, a pan, one of those ceramic precious memories doll things, and a tissue box.

We walked out, i went to the tap where her connection was, and disconnected her services. We are allowed to deny service in certain situations (child porn, stealing services, etc). My supervisor told me to do it, and he would take the heat. He wrote a 10 page essay for corporate with my input about what was happening in order to justify disconnecting services. It was beautiful.

She is now a Fios customer, and one of our previous techs who was fired got a job with Verizon. We keep in touch, and he recently told me about some crazy old lady who always calls in for the stupidest shit. I asked him if it was a house on ""spruce st"", and he said yes. I laughed and told him good luck. 

It was so satisfying to disconnect her, and now know that she's doing the same shit to verizon."

He was saddled most of the morning with a public defender who apparently got most of his training from watching Matlock.  The guy would variously scream and make dramatic motions to the judge, and the judge would have to pause things to tell him what he could and couldn't do.  

He had two or three quick cases in a row that just had technical foul-ups.  Like, one guy spoke only Spanish, but the court hadn't procured a translator.  So, he sat there with his head in the hands while they searched for the translator.  Another guy kept trying to talk about how the US court system is illegitimate, and kept interrupting the judge until a baliff stood behind him.

6070,"Andrew fought in over a hundred duels. 

""Contemporaries described Andrew Jackson, who had already served in Tennessee‚Äôs Senate and was practicing law at the time of the duel, as argumentative, physically violent and fond of dueling to solve conflicts. Estimates of the number of duels in which Jackson participated ranged from five to 100.

Jackson and Charles Dickinson were rival horse breeders and southern plantation owners with a long-standing hatred of each other. Dickinson accused Jackson of reneging on a horse bet, calling Jackson a coward and an equivocator. Dickinson also called Rachel Jackson a bigamist. (Rachel had married Jackson not knowing her first husband had failed to finalize their divorce.) After the insult to Rachel and a statement published in the National Review in which Dickinson called Jackson a worthless scoundrel and, again, a coward, Jackson challenged Dickinson to a duel.

On May 30, 1806, Jackson and Dickinson met at Harrison‚Äôs Mills on the Red River in Logan, Kentucky. At the first signal from their seconds, Dickinson fired. Jackson received Dickinson‚Äôs first bullet in the chest next to his heart. Jackson put his hand over the wound to staunch the flow of blood and stayed standing long enough to fire his gun. Dickinson‚Äôs seconds claimed Jackson‚Äôs first shot misfired, which would have meant the duel was over, but, in a breach of etiquette, Jackson re-cocked the gun and shot again, this time killing his opponent. Although Jackson recovered, he suffered chronic pain from the wound for the remainder of his life.

Jackson was not prosecuted for murder, and the duel had very little effect on his successful campaign for the presidency in 1829. Many American men in the early 1800s, particularly in the South, viewed dueling as a time-honored tradition.""

https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/andrew-jackson-kills-charles-dickinson-in-duel

TL;DR: Andrew Jackson got shot in a duel, refused to go down, and demanded the right to shoot his gun. He shot his opponent and killed him but Jackson lived.

The cost of living is increasing to the point most people I know have to make sacrifices they've never had to think about before.  It's the essentials that are increasing in cost; groceries, housing, transportation.  

Anecdotal, but to give an example:

My wage has increased by about 10% in ten years.  
My home is mortgaged at a fixed rate thankfully, but it's assessed value for property tax has more than trippled.  Taking my annual cost up by almost $4000.00.

Electricity has gone up 5-10% per year where I live, except last year which was 25%.

Groceries have doubled and trippled depending on what you buy.  Only junk food has stayed low, and even that is up 50%.

Gas has risen, fallen, and risen again, but we are still at double 2010 costs.

My cell phone has decreased in cost by more than half, but that was due to switching to a cheaper prepaid option and buying phones outright instead of on contract.

All told, my wages are only up 10%, while my total costs have gone up 75%.  Throw in diapers and formula for three recently added kids.  It adds up to us no longer being able to afford a dinner out, movies, my wife's softball fees, and my video games.  If things keep going the way they are, we will have to cut savings, and maybe downgrade our home.

Before you say anything.  We are making well above double our local minimum wage, and we have two earners doing about the same.  Ten years ago we were firmly middle class and now with the rising minimum wage and increasing costs, we are borderline.  Ten more years and we will be in trouble.

Newer, but controversial, advice, is to simply do nothing. Just tread water and wait for the current to circle and deliver you back to shore. This, unfortunately, doesn't always work either.

The only advice that's universally applicable is: **Don't panic.** The worst thing you can do is to frantically struggle and expend lots of energy -- that's how you drown. Try to focus on keeping yourself comfortably afloat. Try the parallel swim technique if you can, but don't tire yourself out.

6150,"On February 23, 1987, at 7:35am UTC, roughly a hundred random people all over the world saw a momentary flash of light in one eye.

That was the moment when a burst of subatomic particles, having whizzed through space at very nearly the speed of light for 168,000 years, passed right through the Earth as if it weren‚Äôt even there. Named by the great physicist Pauli as the ‚Äúlittle neutral ones‚Äù, neutrinos don‚Äôt bother interacting with much: on average, it takes six **light-years** of lead to stop them. There is only a tiny, tiny, *tiny* chance that any neutrino will even hit an atom.

Later estimates showed that the supernova behind the neutrino burst created 10^58 neutrinos in total‚Äîwith that kind of gobsmacking number of neutrinos and impossible odds for an interaction, the math occasionally works in your favor.

When neutrinos do bother to interact with a water molecule, you get a stray light particle, and if you are looking for it you can find it. That‚Äôs the principle behind neutrino detectors like Japan‚Äôs Kamiokande-II: a massive sphere of 2,140 metric tons of water, the exterior tiled with highly sensitive photon sensors. On the day when the neutrinos from supernova SN1987A finally reached Earth, this gigantic detector saw...12 flashes. That‚Äôs it. But it was a discovery, and matched findings from other similar detectors around the world. 

One type of detector, however, may have also caught this accidentally. For there‚Äôs another kind of device which is a ball of water containing photon sensors: the human eye. With five billion people alive in 1987, two eyes each, and about 6 grams of water in each eye, there was 60,000 metric tons of water in the human ocular version of Kamiokande-II on the day SN1987A made it to Earth. The math works out to about 300 neutrinos which actually interacted with the water in the human eye to make a flash of light. Knock that down a bit for folks who were sleeping, and for flashes of light which didn‚Äôt head towards the eyes‚Äô rods and cones, but there‚Äôs still something there.

Those hundred or so people will never know that they were the first to see that supernova."

Should you entertain the proposition, I am prepared to grant liberal terms to the inhabitants and garrison; but should I be forced to resort to assault, or the slower and surer process of starvation, I shall then feel justified in resorting to the harshest measures, and shall make little effort to restrain my army‚Äîburning to avenge the national wrong which they attach to Savannah and other large cities which have been so prominent in dragging our country into civil war.""

Eventually, Ching Shih sought amnesty when offered by the Chinese government, but not without first negotiating to maintain the riches and power she earned as a pirate lord.""

So at the end, the Chinese government said 'fine, keep what you took, just do take anymore'. She retired extremely wealthy.

6165,"When I was really young, like four years old, there was a neighbour girl. IIRC she was like 18 or 19 years old.

I recently reexamined a lot of my childhood, and it's really odd; a lot of very disturbing memories came back very fast. I remember her playing very strange games with me, and as a kid I obviously didn't know better. She'd force me to kiss her and strip naked and other things I really don't want to get into.
I don't remember her name, and we moved away from there a long time ago. It's been thirteen years and I haven't brought it up to anybody.

I was taking more than the recommended dose. One night, with no contact with her for a couple of weeks, she comes to my house. My dad being drunk off his ass, let's her in and she comes to my bedroom. What happened next, I still don't know. I don't remember any of it. I only found out it had happened because she texted me the next day. Asking how last night was and if we could do it again that night. I told her I don't remember her coming over the night before or anything after I went to bed. Honest to God, I don't remember it. She was psycho, she stalked me for years after this. Even having a friend of hers that worked at the bank I had an account at, look up my address and she showed up. After the night of non consenting sex, I got on pills pretty hard and did that for about a year. I didn't deal with it healthily. I didn't date either for over a year.

They get a lot of crap from outsiders, so they're fiercely protective and defensive of each other.

A group of them tried to walk off with my preschool aged son in Costco, and there was a small showdown when I tried to grab him back.

You see, I'd dressed my then 2 1/2 year old in a white dress shirt and slacks because I thought he looked cute, like a tiny business man.  He tried to stop at the TV display in Costco where Cars 3 was playing and a bunch of other kids were standing.  The polygamist family showed up at about the same time (3 women and the 12 kids between them that weren't in school yet).  When they moved to go, they went straight and I went left, towards clothes.  My son tried to follow me, so a four year old girl grabbed his hand to keep him with the group.  I went to gently intervene, and the whole group closed ranks around my little boy.  The older children encirled the younger, and 2 women took defensive positions while the remaining woman ran at me with a purse raised to swing at me.

I froze, kept my hands visible, and said ""that one's mine."" They looked at each other, did a head count, did a second head count, and cautiously nodded.  Finally, my kid yelled, ""Mama! I want you!"" and scurried over to me.  The three women conferred, confirmed he didn't belong to one of them, and then gave me sheepish smiles as they herded their kids on to go shop.

My son had the same white blonde hair as some of their kids and his clothes blended right in.  He no longer owns any white dress shirts.  It keeps things less confusing, and that family recognizes me now when I go to Costco.  They're fairly friendly to me now.

Edit:. People do try to snatch kids from them occasionally, so I get some of the fear.  Mostly, people are trying to illegally ""rescue"" the children, but I sort of understand the fear."

6312,"My now husband and I went overnight hiking on one of our first dates. Out by Mt St Helens. About a five mile hike to our destination shelter- Bolt Camp. It‚Äôs just a little wooden shelter in the middle of nowhere in the Gifford Pinchot national forest. 

The hike was beautiful. The sun was going down and there were many ancient Doug fir trees with hollow bases. The sun was setting through them and they looked like little faerie abodes with warm hearth fires burning within. There were little wooden footbridges here and there, we could imagine little trolls living under them. As night fell we started seeing all these bioluminescent mushrooms on fallen logs, glowing an impossible shade of green. Magical.

We arrived at the shelter, built a fire, ate dinner, drank, went to sleep under the shelter (which was half collapsed because a tree had fallen on it at some point). 

I woke up in the middle of the night cold because the fire was out. Of course it was pitch black. Now hubs was sleeping towards the outside of the shelter, me on the inside, facing near the back. That‚Äôs when I saw it. A ‚Äúthing‚Äù, whatever it was, floating around inside the shelter. Don‚Äôt know how to describe it, other that a gossamer spiderweb looking thing, floating through the air, turning and twisting over and over on itself. It was really quite lovely. I wasn‚Äôt afraid of it, but so fascinated. I really wanted to wake him up and ask if he could see it, but I was afraid it would either disappear or he wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it and would think I was crazy. I mean, I barely knew the guy. So I watched it for a bit, fell back asleep and said nothing.

Until a couple months later when we‚Äôd gotten more familiar and were reminiscing about our trip. I told him about it and his mouth dropped open in shock.

So, we‚Äôd packed up and left the next day and I dropped him off at his house, that night he was out on his porch having a beer, when he saw the exact same thing!

Perhaps there is a fear that our maple syrup has fermented and, in a drunken post-pancake frenzy, we will launch our 150 year old American bought steam driven fighter jets over the border and establish a beachhead in Minot, North Dakota.

What's super good about your country? It's people - my family has experienced great kindness and generosity from Americans. Others and other countries have experienced this as well. Americans work harder than we do. They are full of ingenuity with a ""I can do it"" attitude. A great US university gave my son a full ride (with $20,000 living expenses) to obtain his PhD. 

I fear that for years your contributions to the world have not been appreciated.

Below is a commentary from the crusty Canadian Gordon Sinclair in 1973 - it is dated but it demonstrates the point:

 
The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French, and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany. It has declined there by 41% since 1971, and this Canadian thinks it's time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous, and possibly the least-appreciated, people in all the world.

As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtze. Well who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did, that's who.

They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges, and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Mississippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help. Germany, Japan, and to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. And I was there -- I saw that. When distant cities are hit by earthquake, it's the United States that hurries into help. Managua, Nicaragua, is one of the most recent examples.

So far this spring, fifty-nine American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped.

The Marshall Plan, the Truman Policy, all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries. And now, newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, war-mongering Americans.

Now, I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplanes. Come on now, you, let's hear it. Does any country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar, or the Douglas 10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or a woman on the moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times, and, safely home again. You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They're right here on our streets in Toronto. Most of them, unless they're breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend up here.

When the Americans get out of this bind -- as they will -- who could blame them if they said ""the hell with the rest of the world. Let somebody else buy the bonds. Let somebody else build or repair foreign dams, or design foreign buildings that won't shake apart in earthquakes."" When the railways of France and Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both of 'em are still broke.

I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name to me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. They'll come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they're entitled to thumb their noses at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians.

And finally, the American Red Cross was told at its 48th annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke.

This year's disasters -- with the year less than half-over -- has taken it all. And nobody, but nobody, has helped.

I remember overhearing a conversation between an elderly woman and manager of the store, which consisted of her constantly berating him for not having stock of, well, basically anything, and constantly demanding to know when they were going to stock it. Basically it went something like:

When are you going to get more of X? 'Never.' THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

When are you going to get more of Y? 'Never.' HOW DARE YOU!

He kept trying to point out that the store was going to be shutting down in less than a month but she would not listen. Finally she stormed off in a huff saying she was never going to shop there again. The manager gave the best comeback I've ever heard before or since: Great! Goodbye!

And then she stabs herself three times and you're locked in the same room as her for the weekend..."
6475,That's pretty normal for most people I think. Practice is the only way to get better though.
6476,"Two things.
My coworker said the worst thing he saw was during a car fire. He was in charge of the hose and the plan was to open the door of the car and then spray inside. As I understood, due to the size of the flames and smoke they weren't able to confirm if there was anyone inside the vehicle. Buddy opens the door and my coworker turns on the hose. He didn't realize until it was too late that he was spraying water onto a body. He watched the water tear skin away from flesh of a burn victim. At this point the body was charred and whoever it was was obviously deceased.

For me as a paramedic the most haunting is people I can't save. Granted I'm two years in and it does it easier with more exposure, but it's never easy. Me and my partner got dispatched to a stroke. Arrive and a woman is on the floor and the fire department is breathing for her. As we load her onto the gurney I ask if she can hear me. She says yes. I ask what's going on with her and all she says is ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" When we get her inside the ambulance we're preparing to pace her (same as a pacemaker but with external pads) as her heart rate is around 25 beats per minute. This was kind of shocking as not many people are conscious with such a low heart rate. We can't get the pads on fast enough and I watch her heart rate slow from 25 to 13 to 6 to flat line. I start cpr and she never regains pulses back. I think the worst part is that her husband was convinced she was going to the hospital and would be okay. 20 minutes later she's dead in the back of my ambulance and we have to break the news to him. He's in shock and tells us that he's a man and doesn't cry. Saddest thing I've seen. Your wife just died. Its okay to show emotion. "

Except that when you have a Frank in your group, including him in everything is functionally excluding the Susans of the group who are super uncomfortable or downright scared to be around him. And frankly (badum-tiss!) some behaviour warrants exclusion."
6480,"Having kids isn't the end of your life, don't quit your hobbies and don't sacrifice EVERYTHING you love. Compromise, don't over accommodate, if you don't enjoy living, your family don't enjoy being around you.

Be consistent of what you tell your kids. Whatever you promise, you must do it, even if it's something you didn't mean to. When you say no TV, then it's no TV. Don't give them excuses. If you promise TV time, you better have 2 TVs ready because if one breaks down you have a spare."

A year or so later,  he passed away.  She left his body on the couch he died on all day and then when it got dark enough after I dropped my daughter off for the weekend,  she had my daughter and her sister dump his stiff 80 lb body in their trash can for the city to pick up in a couple days.

Once you have been properly crushed by reality until you realize that almost nothing you do actually matters and very few people care about your particular suffering. 

Once that happens, if you are very very lucky, you will realize that the small collection of people who care about you are the most importing thing in the world. You will begin to spend your time thinking about ways to treat them with care and consideration. You will begin to notice that sometimes what they want is vastly different than what you want - and you will find ways to accommodate them because, in a harsh world, they matter most. 

But you don't need to rush to suffering. Be a kid as long as you can.

I agree with some of your statements, but at that point of the series (Order of the Phoenix), Dumbledore had kind of fallen out of favor with the higher ups at the Ministry. This was partly because of his insistence that Voldemort was returning and the Ministry vehemently denying anything of the sort.

She goes on trips all the time and has friends or family watch the dog. Since I asked her (very nicely) she flipped out, said she was annoyed to have to find a sitter for her dog and that last time someone watched him he shit all over their house the whole time because he was angry üôÑ and now she's not talking to me... yes this is my best friend, a grown ass woman.

6654,"about 13 years ago, I purchased the book 'allen carr's easy way to stop smoking'. I bought it out of curiosity and read it. Afterwards, I smoked a cigarette and put it out whilst following the instructions. Not smoked since.

The key phrase I think a lot of people use is 'trying to give up'. Trying implies effort. Eventually you'll give in as the effort is concieved to be untenable. I think the key to stopping is doing just that..stop. Don't try to stop. Just stop. Once you decide to stop smoking and put out that cigarette, that's it, you've done it, you've stopped smoking. I also think a lot of people who 'try to give up' wait for that time when they won't get cravings any more. This time never comes. There will always be a little bit of you that wants a cigarette and eventually you'll give in and smoke.

My advice. Just stop. Don't try. Just do it. Throw away or smoke that last cigarette. Once you've done that, that's it..you are now a non-smoker."

6672,"A great question to ask is why do some kids get bullied? There are several reasons but this one is often overlooked (reposted from a couple of months ago.)

My 12 year old son has a classmate who just transferred to his school this year. I met the parents at a basketball game and they told me that they transferred him because the bullying problem at his school was bad and he was being constantly picked on. He became friends with my son and everything seemed good. It was the first time this new kid had been invited to a birthday party (my sons) and the parents and boy seemed pretty decent. They explained that because their son didn't play hockey he was an outcast in his school hence the bullying. We all felt good that this kid was now leading a normal 12 year olds life until my sons birthday party when it all started to make sense...

There is no way to say it politely- the kid was an asshole. Got in other kids faces, taunted others and tried to establish himself as the alpha dog in the pack when he was the smallest kid there. More than once I had to tell him to back off as I could tell the other kids who didn't know him (half the invitees from my sons football team) were getting annoyed by the in your face attitude of this kid. I chalked it up to him being excited and let it go until I had a superbowl party and this kid showed up. I was cheering for the Eagles and he is a Pat's fan. He started getting in my face and telling me how shitty the eagles were (his words not mine.) After he left I told my son (who was pretty annoyed by him too) that he was no longer welcome at our house as he ruined an otherwise fun event.  

My sons reply "" I think I understand why he was bullied at his old school."" 

If you don't want your kids to get bullied teach them modesty and respect. Those qualities will allow them to make friends. Of course this is just one Dad's opinion.

Life of Pi.

It starts well. Gives us an interesting, quirky protagonist, details the beginning of his life and his weird approach to religion.

Then there's the weird and pretty stuff in the middle. The beginning is completely forgotten. Pi's previous views are not challenged, improved and expanded upon. Pi starts a weird guy who tries to belong to multiple religions at once, and ends a weird guy who tries to belong to multiple religions at once.  In the end, in my eyes, Pi's father is the one proven right. Pi's survival is only due to the cold, scientific and dispassionate thinking that went into designing a survival boat. Pi of course fails to notice.

Then comes the big reveal. He tells the movie's fancy story, and then a brutal story about the cook, and asks which is better? That's it? Your case for belief is simply ""I prefer fantasy to the harsh reality""? That's the most underwhelming argument I've ever heard.

And I'm no stranger to musical theatre. Tap, swing, ballet... all of that makes sense. I'm not great at dancing, but I can try some swing.

Saw two kids (maybe 12-13) climbing the little cliff, one grabs a rock and pulls it right off the cliff. He fell down a good nine feet, and so did the rock, right onto his face.

The ceremony went off without a hitch and everyone was having a great time. Chatting, having a drink or few, reminiscing, all that good stuff. As we were mulling around after the ceremony and everyone was making their way into the banquet hall the wedding events organizer starts to gather all of the groomsmen and bridesmaids together and pairing us up. In hindsight this should have been clue number 1 that something was about to happen.

Anyway, there we are, getting paired up and one of the bridesmaids and myself happen to be the first in this newly formed line. We get ushered in front of the (now closed) banquet hall doors and asked if we're ready to go. The bridesmaid and I both give each other a brief ""What in the fuck is he talking about "" look and that's when we were told about this ""bridal party dance"" deal. Now normally this wouldn't be an issue, I'm an easy going guy and I can make a fool of myself....with enough time to prepare. But at this point we had all of 4 minutes to figure this out.

So in a panic induced frenzy we both try to figure out how we're going to go about this. We're bouncing ideas back and forth but nothing is sticking. (Nothing makes you forget how to human like a good 'ol fashioned time crunch)

With about 40 seconds to spare we settle on walking out to the dance floor, me giving her a little twirl, taking a brief bow and moving the fuck on like we had this planned for months.

6857,"This is a bit of a long one but I still feel scarred from what happened. TL;DR at bottom.

I live in China and I had a 18 year old Australian roommate who we will call Child (due to his lack of adult qualities) and an absolutely fantastic dog who will be referred to as Doggo. I got doggo as a puppy and he was a perfect dog. He actually helped me find the woman I married so you can safely say I was attached to him,

Throughout my ownership of Doggo in China, Child was living with me until he got fired from his job for going completely awol and even before that his work performance was a 2/10 at best. He was a a bit of a fail at every aspect of live and for some reason I couldn‚Äôt help but feel sorry for him. Sometimes I would give him food when I would cook as he couldn‚Äôt even boil an egg (I taught him how and he ate only eggs for a week) and I would end up doing all the cleaning in the apartment as he couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt do it himself. Throughout the entire time we were staying together, any kindness or generosity was completely coming from my side and was never returned from him. The only thing he ever did was play and walk Doggo. Once he had lost his job, he had nowhere else in the city to stay so he kept coming back and staying in my old room (I moved into his old room the moment he ‚Äòleft‚Äô as he got the nicer room when we moved in). I had essentially ignored his existence while in the apartment as my girlfriend had moved into my room and I had no reason to ever really interact with him except to try and get him to leave. I wasn‚Äôt putting much effort into that anyway as he was keeping Doggo occupied while I was spending time with the girlfriend.

Eventually Child flys home to Australia (he steals some of my stuff and gives to a guy he barely knows), is there for a few weeks and his parents kick him out for not doing anything with his life. He returns to China to go to a low end university in the South on a complete full scholarship (because he was their only white student) and got back in contact with me. I was living in the North so we were 1000s of kilometres apart. He would constantly be sending me messages about Doggo saying how much he missed him and how much he loved that dog. I cannot exaggerate how often and serious these messages were, he actually tried to drunk call Doggo one Friday night.

This went on for a couple months until I had issues with my employer (who had been subletting the room I was staying in) and I had 4 days to leave the apartment. Where I was moving didn‚Äôt have the capacity to take Doggo with me so I offered to fly him down to Child as I knew he had always taken good care of him in the past. Child accepted immediately and was so excited to see Doggo. I paid a lot of money and a few days later, he was with Child in the South.

I should point out that the South is where China gets its reputation for eating dog so I made sure to warn Child not to let Doggo out on his own and keep a close eye one him. I had heard a lot of stories about dogs being stolen for food and he was living in a very low tiered city.

I had kept in contact with him for a couple of months then all went quiet. He wouldn‚Äôt respond to my messages or calls so I couldn‚Äôt get an update about Doggo. About a month went by and I got my girlfriend (who was Chinese) to contact his university to see what the story was. To my complete horror, one of his lecturers told my gf that Child had decided to give up on university and fly back to Australia. He just dumped Doggo on the street. The lecturer actually said she had seen Doggo hanging around campus as a stray so my girlfriend immediately told her that if she saw him again to grab him and that I will pay to have him sent home.

She did see him again. It was the moment the bus hit him.

Child wouldn‚Äôt respond to anything I ever send him until two days after I was married. He actually sent me a message congratulating me and when I responded he tried to end the conversation very quickly. I asked him if he was going off to kill more dogs then told him how he had killed Doggo. I got a ‚ÄúSorry, shit happens‚Äù and a explanation that he had lost his wallet so he thought he should drop out of school and leave the county. He then proceeded to accuse me of stealing his computer keyboard then never contacts me again.

Sometimes I‚Äôll be happily walking along the street and see a dog which will remind me of what happened to my Doggo. I would love to get revenge but there is literally no way I can do anything since he lives in another country now and I have no way to contact him.

I miss Doggo.

My mother was in a VERY similar position to you at around the same age, deadbeat husband (my father), never worked, took credit cards out in her name and maxed them out with useless shit, never helped around the house. Eventually, she just told him to get the hell out, filed for divorce, worked hard to clear the debt, I helped around the house as much as I could, I was still around 15 or 16 at the time so couldn't really provide financially.

This did cause a few issues, they'd been married since they were 18, loneliness, depression, anxiety, but she reached out for help and it made all the difference.

Eventually, she needed a change, took herself to university, got a degree and now has a really well-paying job, she's already managed to put a lot of money away for retirement, she knows she'll never own her own house (I'm hoping to help her with that when she retires), but she has a loving partner now and is really happy. I am so fucking proud of her.

There is always hope and you always have the chance of giving yourself the future you deserve, if you need to get out of the marriage and don't think counselling will ever work, then get out and live life for yourself.

Anyway! One day towards the end of my shift I had a lady call to make a complaint, figured fair enough, nothing unusual. I asked her what the complaint was about and she told me she didn't like the hold music. When I asked her what the problem with the hold music was, she said it was because it was 3 bars long and not 4 bars. Very strange I though, but I told her I'd log it and close it for her as there is nothing that we can realistically do about it. No, she wanted ME personally to get the hold music changed or else she was going to go to the ombudsmen and report us. This is where I started thinking ""Oh boy, here we go...""

She wanted to know why when she called up she was on hold for 8 minutes. I explained to her that she had called up at a particularly busy time as people were coming home from work, opening their letters and then calling us up to enquire. Well, she demanded to know why we don't hire more people at this time. I explained the shift patterns to her but she still wasn't happy and insisted that we hire more people.

So this is about 15 - 20 minutes into the conversation and she starts going batshit crazy. She was telling me how the hold music is giving people subliminal messages to buy products and how all the big corporations are all plotting against the consumer to trick them into buying stuff. At this point I was just agreeing to try to shut her up. Then she started asking me about my political views and wanted to know how much I was getting paid by the hour. When I wouldn't tell her how much I get paid she was pissed!  

She then started to go on about school shootings in America, the NHS, Facebook and different conspiracies.

This went on for an hour and a half. I was getting more and more annoyed by the minute because not only had she made me stay over my shift, but she absolutely ruined my target for the day (we were only meant to be on the phone for 750 seconds on average)

I very nearly snapped at her, but then I figured it's not worth losing my job and being unable to support my newborn twins just for the sake of telling some nutbar to fuck off."

6939,I worked with a guy who was training to be a pilot in his spare time but also exhibited a lot of strange behaviours around the workplace. He used to talk to himself a lot which could be anything from conducting imaginary auctions to leaping around and acting like a monkey with all the requisite noises etc. He used to act like he was high class and would refer to his workmates as peasants even though they did the same job. He told us that he would stop taking his mental health medication whenever he needed to pass a test to become a pilot and then resume it afterwards. We used to joke that it would be terrifying to board a plane and just before take off hear the pilots announcement and realise it was him. I ended up moving on from that workplace and several years later I saw on the news he was killed piloting a plane that crashed into a mountain top in Papua New Guinea. It was sad news. He was a nice enough guy with a lot of quirks but quite young when he died. RIP dude.

6945,"When I was walking around applying to every business that I could I applied at a sex shop. Hours sucked. Being alone with creepos late at night sucked. The discounts were pretty nice. The best part however was the boss. She was the wife of a very rich man. She did this so that she wasn't at home all the time and often didnt give a shit about the business let alone really know what she was doing. She had her daughter doing most of the actual business stuff and she was really nice if she wasn't overly stressed out.   

Anyways, boss, smoking hot milf. So she comes in one night which is very unusual. It was a tuesday or something and had been dead slow for hours. She just looks around some toys so I go to show her how good of an employee I am and I start showcasing everything. About half way through my spiel about this realistic 8"" dildo she asks if I have tried it myself. Awkward back and forth and long story short she locks the door and pulls me into the back. My everything hurt for the rest of the night but I felt like I was on cloud 9. We did this without telling anyone 3 times.  I ended up with an extra 10/hr added to my wage and all her daughter said was ""it's was so strange. She must like you or somethin'""

7051,"&gt; I have one non-sex offender couple where the wife is coerced into having sex. He is threatening divorce and she would be deported if they got a divorce. It took three sessions for him to get it.

If I was in a relationship where my partner never wanted to have sex, I would want to get a divorce.  That's an important part of a relationship to me.  This is hypothetical, obviously, because you've left the details appropriately vague, but how would you balance a thing like this?  If one partner wants to have a sex life and the other doesn't?  If it wasn't for the deportation part, would your advice be to just get divorced?  I mean, if she doesn't want to have sex, it's reasonable for him to get divorced and find a partner who does want to have sex?  They shouldn't have sex if she doesn't want to, but he's stuck in a relationship that's unfulfilling because of her immigration status?  With the power differential, maybe they shouldn't have gotten married in the first place?  Sincere question.

Edit:  In case it's not clear, I don't think she should have any sex she doesn't want to under any circumstances.  "

She has a one year old boy named Jack. Pain in the ass, but he's very much loved by my best friend and I. 

Where do I even begin? She had him, took care of him for a week, took off with her boyfriend (Jack's dad), didn't come back for almost a month. She's always coming and going, most likely doing heroin because every time she comes back, she looks more and more like the fucking crypt keeper. She only ever comes back to start shit or to take some of Jack's things when her and her bf wanna play mommy an daddy and act like they're gonna work shit out. (Oh, and her bf has a whole plethora of warrants). 

2 months ago she got arrested in a motel parking lot for being with some dude she didn't even know who was selling drugs. Of course, she got bailed out. Went home for while to lay low, and then one day she ""took Jack to the park"" only to stay in some shitty motel up the road that's known to be a crackhead meetup (yes she brought her own son to a fucking crackhead motel). She didn't take him back home until midnight a couple nights after.

Her and her bf fight in front of him all the time, and I mean physical fights, the shit you see in jails. They fight with Jack in the backseat screaming his lungs out, too. 

She got arrested again not too long ago, got bailed out. Never came back home, only for my best friend to find pictures of her and some dudes she doesn't even know holding wads of money and a gun that they probably don't legally own. 

So since then, she hasn't returned home. Doesn't call, doesn't text, nothing. Just some Facebook pictures of her acting like she's a gangster. "

7080,"Morally yes I can agree with you. Legally no, and heres why: Let's say someone rapes a kid, and the punishment for it is death. Depending on where you live, laws can be different, but in a lot of places murder is life in prison or death. One option has less punishment, and one option has the same punishment. So in these predators minds, why not kill the kid? It could get rid of evidence that the rape occured at all, and there's no risk of the child telling. If the child is dead, the best result is you get away scott free, the worst is the exact same punishment. This is the sad reality of it, but child rape cannot be a punishment equal or even close to murder for this reason. If it is, then argueably worse things will happen to many children."

Between the mountain of law school loans (which for me, combined with my undergrad loans, ""thankfully"" only totaled $111,000.00) and the stress of my job, I hate being a lawyer. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't.

My practice area involves foreclosure and collections work. I am sworn at on a regular basis. I've been told that they hope my building burns down (all because my firm is not equipped to accept credit card payments). I've been called a ""fake lawyer"" (since I do collections work). I've had four Bar complaints filed against me (all were found to be baseless) simply for doing my job. I've had people accuse me of billing my own mother for sending her a Christmas card. I've heard every insult in the book. 

My boss is a difficult man to work for, and we butt heads a lot. It's uncomfortable and unpleasant.

I have lain awake at night on numerous occasions, unable to sleep because of work stress. 

The pay is all right...I have a roof over my head (modest house), a good car (Subaru, nothing flashy), and I can pay my bills and have some ""fun"" money. But I am not raking in the cash by any stretch of the imagination.

I am leaving in a few months to forge out on my own. It won't relieve ALL the stress, but it will get rid of some of it. My financial situation should improve since I'll have complete control over how much I earn. 

Yes, there will be additional, new stresses...running a business, drumming up clients, etc. But having the work I put into those things paying dividends directly will definitely help cushion the impact.

I'm also fortunate that my clients are generally very long-term and ongoing...not one and done like a divorce or a criminal case. I represent businesses. I anticipate that some of them will come with me when I leave my current firm. 

Thankfully, I don't give two shits if any other attorney looks down on me for running my own shop. 

Since I made the decision to leave, my outlook has been much improved. 

But still...having the choice to start over? Not a snowball's chance in hell. "

Cancer isn't a foreign body, cancer is an uncontrolled growth of our own cells because the DNA regulating their division got broken.

7163,"7 years ago, I was part of a student environmental conservation group lead by the University of Queensland. Our efforts were situated within the Main Range National Park, a mountain range consisting of many small water systems connecting up to Australia‚Äôs largest river, the Murray-Darling. More importantly, it was a popular hiking &amp; camping destination.

At the time I was just a student, barely out of high school. Everything I knew about environmental science had come out of a book, I had no real-world experience. But I needed the extra credits for a passing grade. So, I agreed to join the conservation group, albeit with some reluctance. We would be conducting research into the health of the microbiomes within some of the harder to reach rivers.  

To get to the site we traveled 2 hours by road, and 6 hours by trail. It was almost night by the time we arrived, but there was just enough light to set up camp along the embankment. As microbiologists, we‚Äôre not often faced with early mornings. Microbes are particularly sensitive to temperature, and we‚Äôve found that the most accurate readings almost always occur in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest. We like to joke about microbes being late-risers. But something happened that morning, something I will never forget. 

It‚Äôs hard to put into words how piercingly quiet the forest can be. Before the sun has risen, there‚Äôs no wind, the water is still and all you can hear is the sound of your own heartbeat. The smallest noise can sound like a gun shot. It was the sound of a splash that woke me; something in the water. Dazed at first, I thought nothing of it. Until I heard a second splash, like a rock being thrown into the water. Initially I thought it could just be a fish, before I remembered that there are no fish in these high-altitude river systems. 

I hear the splash a third time, and a fourth, and a fifth. Each splash arriving in almost perfect ten second intervals. Six splashes, seven, it doesn‚Äôt stop. I need to see what‚Äôs happening out there. So, I get up, and open my tent door. The sun hadn‚Äôt risen yet, but there was some light. It was that moment just before dawn, when everything‚Äôs a dark shade of blue. I could just make out the river, almost frozen from the nights cold. As I peer out of my tent I hear the splash again, it‚Äôs coming from the left side of the embankment. I walk out and let my eyes adjust. 

As I head towards the source of the sound, I see something standing upright on a small island in the middle of the river. My eyes, still trying to adjust themselves, can just make out a silhouette. It‚Äôs a man. I just stood, paralyzed, looking at the figure. My mind, simultaneously racing and going nowhere. The man outstretched his arm in a gesturing motion, as if he was trying to offer me food. I did nothing, I just stood there. He opened his hand, dropping into the water what I believed to be a stone; the source of the sound. The splash pierced through the camp site. 

A thought crossed my mind as my senses came flooding back. This could be a lost hiker, he could need my help. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúDo you need help?‚Äù. I walked towards him, my heart pounding in my neck. Even as I neared the man, I found myself incapable of discerning any details beyond a basic silhouette. Almost as if all he didn‚Äôt have any. Almost as if he was faceless. Then, as though my nearing was enough to provoke, the man stepped forward, and fell into the water. He didn‚Äôt surface. 

I scream out for help, alerting my other group members. They sleepily stagger out of their tents, flashlights in hand. ‚ÄòA man fell into the river!‚Äô I shouted, ‚ÄòA man fell into the river!‚Äô. I grab a flashlight and ran to where he fell.  Nervously pointing towards the island, I say, ‚ÄòHe fell in here‚Äô. We aimed our flashlights downward, illuminating a portion of the riverbed. The light was not powerful enough to reach island. I had to get closer. If I could get closer, then maybe I could find him. Then I said something. I don‚Äôt know why I said this, it was almost as if something compelled me. I said, ‚ÄòI need to go in.‚Äô.

As I removed my shoes, my professor stopped me. ‚ÄòThe water is almost freezing. If you go in, you will die.‚Äô, he paused to give me a look of concern. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs almost day light, we will have a better chance at finding him then.‚Äô. Had my professor not stopped me, I would have gone in the water. I reluctantly agreed, and we waited until daybreak. Even though the water was clear, and still, we never found him. We ended our expedition early and I reported these events to the police. This led to a minor search and rescue, with no outcome.

As far as I know, no one, or no body has ever been reported missing or found in that area.  I was the only one who saw him. 

I remember retelling this story to my colleagues.

7167,"I was at a hotel in Vietnam with my girlfriend, we're both white foreigners living there. The hotel had an attached massage/spa place and we've used these kind of service many times, we like having couple massages.

At this particular place, we're lying on massage beds next to each others. The girl massaging me pretty much immediately goes for my dick, tries to slip her hand under me. I swat her hand away a couple times, I assumed she was trying to see if ""I wanted more"". My girlfriend is fucking lying next to me. 

She was still massaging my back but every now and then would just grab my dick and ""jerk"" it. I had to tell her ""Stop"" twice and she laughed. It was VERY weird, as it was *kind of* arousing, she was pretty and touching my dick. But I'm faithful to my girlfriend. And the masseuse was not doing it gently, just reaching and tugging. 

As the massages end, we're sitting on the tables and she keeps asking me if I want a private foot massage or a face massage or something, I firmly say no. My girlfriend is noticing I'm very uncomfortable and have an angry face. After we paid and got out, I told her what happened. 

My girlfriend was very supportive and wanted to make an official complaint (she did, on the day we left). After about an hour of being in shock, we were able to chuckle at the fact that I had, indeed, been sexually assaulted by a tiny Vietnamese woman.

It's not going to be as horrible as other experiences in this thread but it was still a very disturbing thing to go through and my first experience, as a man, where I could *kind of* imagine how sexual assaults on women can be traumatizing."

7178,"Lincoln wanted to end slavery, but he wasn't an abolistionist because it was too much of a hardline position and knew he wouldn't win support or elections like that. He believed that if you stopped slavery from expanding into new states, the slave states would become more and more outnumbered and slavery would be choked off. A much more gradual death as opposed to a swift action that he knew would result in revolt (which of course would happen anyway). Also, until they were outnumbered, there's no way legislation banning slavery would have passed.

This balance of slave vs non-slave states is why the Kansas-Nebraska Act was so controversial and helped pave the way for the Civil War.

Also, whatever the Emancipation Proclamation didn't do, the 13th Amendment he helped push through did."

&gt; I am from Ohio and one day in late August at age 15 I got in my car, which I bought with money saved from a part time job at a grocery store. No license no more than 100$ and no where to go. I just left. I wasn't currently abused and I have a mom and a step dad I love dearly, but they didn't understand me. I was sexually abused by my father from age 7-9 when I got my first period and I was never normal after that. The day I left I got in a small argument with my step dad and when I left I told him I was never coming back. Anyway I drove about an hour from my home and 30 min from my school and ended up in a park. It was a hippy kind of park attached to Nelson ledges. The nice old man that ran the park let me camp there in my car. I turned 16 shortly after and got a decent job as a prep cook and made enough money to get an apartment in a not so nice part of town, closer to my school. And you know, with running water. It was above a meth lab so eventually I started getting really sick. I would spend most my day at school in the nurses office. Eventually after talking with the school nurse a very understanding younger lady, she agreed to help me get things in order. She helped me get as emancipated as you can in Ohio. Helped me get on a school program and would listen to me when I become very over whelmed. Eventually it was winter and I left the meth lab apartment, sleeping in my car once again. I was dumb and got a dog while I had a place of my own, but she was the most perfect dog ever and we became roommates in my car. As an adult I know you shouldn't just leave your 1996 Chevy cavalier just running all the time, apparently you'll die and so will the car. So a full winter of sleeping in Walmart parking lots and parked on the side of the road with just my dog and a bunch of blankets gave me enough time to get my money in order to live a better shitty apartment. It was had being under 18 with a dog and no current residence to rent an apartment. I moved maybe 9 times before I was 18. I don't ever ever regret leaving . I know I put myself in some bad situations considering I was a girl, alone, and vulnerable most of the time. I called my mom about once a week after the first 2 weeks and now we have a great relationship. I think me leaving let my mom and step dad live the lived they wanted (I always got in the way) and I got to live the life I wanted. I have a good job, own my own house so I'll never have to live in my car again . I am currently on break at work on my mobile , so sorry about everything being unorganised and written poorly. 

I don't believe you. I dug through your comment history because I remembered a comment of yours where you  claim to be much older than 24, and what I found was: you claim to have lived in three different states within six months but now claim to have a house. You claim to be both 24 and 37, that you have a wife who is not a hooker, but also a girlfriend who calls you ""Daddy"". You said you're male, but now female. You've had pretty much every job AskReddit inquired after including but not limited to several positions at an inn for skiers, as a nurse at a psych ward for Alzheimer's patients, and a mortician. You also made a statement five months ago that implies you currently couldn't have a great relationship with your mother.

Well we all know when people are caught off guard, they blurt the truth. Apparently, she told my dad that if she had to buy gifts for all the step kids they would be on the poor house. Mind you, this is her only step grandchild, and at the time she is at her vacation home in AZ.
Now, I'm pissed. I box up the gifts and send them back to her with a letter saying family is family, it doesn't matter who gave birth to that child, she is my daughter.
She just didn't get it, still doesn't. And my dad for fear of getting written out of the will, sided with grandma. So we don't talk either.

When I was in therapy for depression and other issues, I learned ways to focus on me. And I came to a realization. I had linked good looks, money, friends, talent, and all that with having a perfect life. In my mind, if I was beautiful or had all these talents, nothing would ever be wrong in my life. But that's so false. Yes, having these things can improve life, but that doesn't mean you can't have issues. Just because someone has it better than you, or that you have it better than someone else, doesn't mean them  or you can't be dealing with some shit.


One of my old friends, who had everything, suffered from such bad depression she almost killed herself. No one thought anything was wrong with her because she had everything. 


A lot of times you only see what people want you to see. Especially in social media. Sure, some people might have it better than you, or never experience giant hardships like you might, but these people can still experience pain, failure, heartache, and loss. These people are human like you.


We disort what we see sometimes too. Sometimes we are blind to other issues, making them seem like gods, while we are blind to our own virtues.


Sometimes you gotta focus on just you and no one else. Last year I tried out for my school musical, and didn't make it. I got a callback and got really close, but no cigar. However, while it still sucked ass that I didn't get what I wanted, it wasn't fair to wish bad luck onto the one who did. I sure wouldn't want someone feeling bad if I got the role, and I mostly definitely wouldn't want them to wish badly on me.


If you use social media a lot, I'd suggest cutting it out, especially if it's paining you to see everyone always having a blast while you suffer.

First and foremost start early treating them like human beings and not props for your ego whether that ego is to shove them into what YOU want them to do or as foils for your anger/happiness/pettiness.  Treat them as interesting people and they will be interesting.  Pay attention to them and pay attention to their interests.  Kick their asses to achieve but achieve at what THEY like.  Challenge them to try new things, food, meeting people, team sports.  Kick them outside to let them explore and let them explore safely.  Safely means staying close enough so that if they break their leg you can help them, but not close enough where they rely on you for everything.  Let them take risks and let them learn to reap their own consequences.  Schedule them, give them jobs, give them a sense of ownership whether its in cleaning their room or feeding a pet.  "

The time stamps now only say ""a year ago"" but if I remember correctly the time from his ""I'm doing this"" post to his last post were a few short hours apart (like 2-3?). He had lost his sanity before the drugs had even completely taken effect (it peaks at 5-12 hours later and it can last days) that isn't a good sign.

Now that I'm an adult I crave affection more and more from the opposite sex as the years go by. It's like my body is hungry for another person's touch but my brain is screaming no bc I still associate touch as painful and/or uncomfortable. It's complicated. 

However, I do have two nieces and when they were born I remember saying that they would live a life different than how we were raised. I find it easier to give hugs and kisses to my nieces than to other adults bc my mind knows they can't hurt me and they need it just as much as I do. It's a work in progress.

Kinda. It makes sense if you know about classical fencing, which isn't necessarily something modern fencers would really need to study. (You need to know the stuff but not necessarily who came up with it.)

The bonetti's defence part is kinda confusing and archaic, which people just think refers to keeping your distance, but otherwise everything else they say does indeed refer to a genuine thing in fencing.
A Capo Ferro is just a lunge, very linear and covers lots of ground (so obviously good at closing distance), while Thibault's defence is based around redirecting attacks using maths efc. Very effective against lunges, BC lunges tend to make one prone to vulnerabilities if you miss. Camillo Agrippa was a short sword dude so obviously would have a focus on working in close quarters."

In mathematics, you can prove that these two sets have the same cardinality, which basically means that they have the same number of elements in the set. Cardinality is what that straight lines are saying. So, if you were to read it out loud, ""|Z|"" would be said as ""the cardinality of the set of all integers"".

Mathematicians are mostly seen as smart because they have a bunch of weird, hard to read symbols, not because it's actually hard. I hope that helped you understand some of the words."

7471,"Not saying she‚Äôs not rude to keep on jump scaring her bf, but I can see a situation like this where very necessary communication is never really impressed enough to get to the other person. 

Here‚Äôs a normal situation that I can imagine as an example- 

Say she jumps ‚Äúboo!‚Äù to the bf and he is shocked motionless, maybe frozen in his reaction, and she just laughs at how shocked he is  ‚Äúhaha I really got ya!!‚Äù thinking he will very quickly get past it and ‚Äúhaha (we‚Äôll go on as normal) hahahaha.‚Äù 

Through her laughing, his reaction starts to subside. He‚Äôs starting to realize he‚Äôs okay, but he really doesn‚Äôt want to have a conversation about struggling with PTSD, especially at that exact moment- she‚Äôs being very rambunctious for such a serious conversation and it‚Äôs *alot* to open up about- so, to make it clear that she shouldn‚Äôt do it again, he says ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like being scared like that‚Äù and ends the conversation there. 

He thinks that he‚Äôs made it clear enough that he doesn‚Äôt like it, especially if he said it in a serious way, and now he is hopeful that she won‚Äôt do it again. What he doesn‚Äôt realize is that in other ‚Äúgoof off situations‚Äù where he maybe picks on her or annoys her in some way and she whines ‚Äústoooopppp!!! I hate that!!!‚Äù that he‚Äôs reinforcing that sometimes it‚Äôs ok to ‚Äúannoy‚Äù eachother for fun (which it is). 

Meanwhile when she hears ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like being scared like that‚Äù she‚Äôs thinks ‚Äúhaha, well yeah, nobody *likes* being scared like that, but no harm done!‚Äù or maybe her rationalization is ‚Äúok but i really get a kick out of doing jump scares, so I will only do them sparingly so he‚Äôs not *totally bothered*, but I still get to have a little fun sometimes!‚Äù And shes drawing on her experience from the times that she‚Äôs been scared that way, and perhaps she didn‚Äôt like it in the moment, but she found it funny a split second later because she doesn‚Äôt have PTSD. For her, that momentary spike in adrenaline doesn‚Äôt take her back to a horrific time in her life, it just gets her heart beating a bit faster.

So- flash cut to-  it‚Äôs been a long time since the last time she jump scared him, and she‚Äôs in a silly mood, and decides to jump scare him again. Maybe she‚Äôs totally forgotten how serious he was when he said he didn‚Äôt like it last time. She thinks ‚Äúhaha i‚Äôm going to get him good, he can‚Äôt hear anything over him brushing his teeth!‚Äù and 1/2 of a second later she‚Äôs laid the fuck out on the bathroom floor because her bf has lived a life that she can‚Äôt imagine, and when she‚Äôs playing around, he‚Äôs being sent on a personal trip to hell so fight or flight kicks in long before he‚Äôs even gotten a chance to think and now he‚Äôs accidentally ko‚Äôd his girlfriend and he‚Äôs flooded with years of guilt, whether they stay together or not. 

TLDR: sometimes that girl isn‚Äôt a moron or a psychopath, but they haven‚Äôt been given all of the relevant info and, from drawing on their limited perspective, don‚Äôt understand all the repercussions to their actions.

Setting up the visit, I‚Äôd spoken to a man about coming in, but when I confirmed, I was given a woman‚Äôs name. 

When she arrived, at my incredibly rural school, I realized that she had been born a man. And despite the dress, make-up, and woman‚Äôs name, my students saw it too. 

They handled themselves so well, no mention was made, no giggling or carrying on- I was proud of my class‚Äô maturity and respect. But as the visit went on, and she shared her information, the tension in the room was building.

It was surreal: a transgendered woman talking about caring for the dead, and my adolescent students carefully and intentionally not noticing anything odd in the situation... and then eventually something was said, and she laughed. 
A man‚Äôs laugh. 
Deep.

And then we were all laughing together, and it was ok to laugh, and it felt so good, and then it was time to stop laughing... time to stop...  and I COULDN‚ÄôT! I told myself I was the teacher, I had to keep it together, but I almost slipped over the edge. Stopping was a test of my professionalism.

I was so grateful to the woman for coming to share- her career talk was brilliant- and so proud of the students for not making an issue of her difference. At the end of the day, I was the one who had the hardest time keeping my grip."

7578,"I‚Äôll try to answer this as an 18 year old about to leave for college in a few months.  

My parents have done what I think is a pretty damn good job.  Obviously I‚Äôve gotten caught doing stupid stuff just like everyone else but they handled each situation well and made sure that I knew what I‚Äôve done wrong.  I think of my parents as hard workers that have put a lot of effort into myself and my sister.  

Now, especially in the past few months, I‚Äôve held a full time job and haven‚Äôt had to ask them for too much as I know they are paying my college tuition and that‚Äôs the best thing I could ever ask for.  I see them as half friends, half the people that have raised me.  I can be more open with them than I used to but obviously they don‚Äôt know all the details about everything.  

I wish I made more time for them now, but after living under someone‚Äôs roof for 18 years straight it‚Äôs hard to find myself wanting to spend time with them over time with my friends from high school (especially because we are all going to different schools).  They seem to appreciate knowing what is going on in my life and what I am doing at work everyday.  

There are days (even multiple days at a time now) that I barely see them despite living in the same house.  This seems to be for the better though as we all appreciate our time together a bit more.  

I know this only kind of half answered your question, but I think I can‚Äôt give a full answer for at least another few years.  Then again, does anyone really see their parents as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù?  I cannot even fathom thinking of them in the same way I think of my friends I spend time with now.  There are a lot of different approaches to take with your kids and my parents use different ‚Äústrategies‚Äù with my sister than they do with me.  

I was ‚Äútoo cool‚Äù for my parents from ages 14-17 probably, but I have really begun to see how much they put into making sure my sister and I are properly prepared for the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù.

7580,"i went to school and hung around a girl that murdered her baby, to sum it up she had a baby in high school, that kid was taken away around 8 months due to brian damage from abuse. she got pregnant after that, like she was a tiny girl and was clearly pregnant and kept denying it. her and her boyfriend had no intentions on raising this baby and planned to murder it, baby was born they stabbed it in the heart and burned the body.

her social workers noticed her huge bump was gone and called the cops, cops found what was left, found a lot of search history on her laptop that made it clear she‚Äôd been planning the murder for months.

it was shocking that it happened but not super shocking, i mean she did abuse her  first child, her and her boyfriend were drug users and when we hung around in school she‚Äôd show pictures of her baby yet always seemed so disconnected when you‚Äôd ask her anything about the baby.

7590,"I interpreted it differently. I think it starts surreal, sad and heartwarming, briefly becomes creepy and sad and confusing, and then goes back to heartwarming. Massive spoilers follow, for anyone who hasn't seen the movie:

The ending is powerful because by that point you're acclimated to the surreal world you've been dropped into, you're invested in the characters and their bond and you're taking all the crazy shit they're going through just as seriously as they are. And then the camera zooms out, and you're thrust into this outside perspective from which everything Hank and Manny shared looks *creepy as all fuck.* What you'd experienced as two people overcoming trials, learning about themselves, and growing close to each other suddenly looks like a lunatic stalker puppeting a corpse around and making trash statues in the woods. These outside observers weren't there like you were. They don't understand that Manny is conscious, or that the trash statues were a way to teach him about humanity and act as a proxy for the human experiences he couldn't otherwise have, or that they're not at Sarah's house for stalker reasons. It's just some weirdass Buffalo Bill shit to them. And as the audience, you feel like you're waking up from a dream that felt magical at the time but now you realize it was stupid and embarrassing.

So there's Hank, in the same position you are. Worse even, because while you might feel embarrassed about being taken in by his story, he is the actual target of this sudden bombardment of social shame. He's thrust into the spotlight of all these disgusted stares, faced with the contempt of his father, the woman he had idolized/stalked, uniformed authority figures...It would be easy for him to give in to the shame and reject everything that had come before. He could let them take Manny away, pretend he's a normal dude who never made out with a dead guy, try his best to smooth things over with Sarah and generally make a return to the ""real world,"" at the price of recasting all of those magical experiences as a shameful break from reality.

But he doesn't do that! He doubles down. He's not going to give up on Manny. He's not going to pretend the adventure they shared wasn't real, just because it looks weird and gross and creepy to people who weren't there. So when he rejects the ""just crazy the whole time"" twist ending that most people were probably expecting, returns Manny to the sea against everyone's protests, and farts in front of him/everyone else to break the last barrier between them, it's both the proof of his character growth and a vindication of the magic of the first 9/10 of the movie.

7677,"&gt; nor was he some genocidal villain 

Supporting the concept of continuously forcing millions of people off of their own land or kill them because the color of their skin makes them inferior is rather genocidal. 

Your portrayal of the Trial of Tears skips past Jackson's long history of supporting such measures, and that the Supreme Court ruled in favor OF the Cherokee Indians. It was Jackson that openly mocked the Supreme Court Justice for not having an army to actually back up that decision and he who openly stated that he would not respect it. The idea that Jackson was somehow the good guy by forcing thousands of people off their land even after the United States government ruled they could stay there is absolutely bizarre, especially since what he did was very in line with his views on Native Americans throughout the entire course of his life. He wasn't someone who liked Native Americans and took the road that would cause less pain. He actively campaigned for it to happen because he hated Native American people. 

&gt; He signed dozens of treaties and negotiations with many tribes across the country

Yes -- treaties where they were pushed onto useless land that could not substantiate farming and many of them starved to death. Treaties that were signed in the first place by coercion-- ""either you agree to move to this shitty land a thousand miles away, or we'll move you ourselves"".  That's finding a legal way to steal, that's not progressive in the least lmao. 

_____


And racist people throughout history were absolute hypocrites. Hitler had a Jewish doctor. Stalin was an ethnic minority, yet targeted other groups because they were ethnic minorities. ETC. Pointing out Jackson's adopted kids seems very reminiscent of the ""but I have a black friend!"" kind of mentality.  Jackson having two NA kids does not prove that he wasn't racist, and the very reason why one of those kids had two dead parents was because of a battle that Jackson himself supported in the first place.



I know people who love Andrew Jackson, but have never -- anecdotally or through  contemporary historical sources -- seen someone try to suggest that Jackson wasn't racist against Native Indian people. Because he objectively was. He openly said that he viewed Native Americans as inherently inferior to another race, which is the most basic definition of racism that there is."

Walked into the living room and decided it was the keys fault, so in a rage somehow ripped the keyring apart with my bare hands and launched the keys all over the room.

Took my about 3 days to find them all, there were keys behind the television, under the sofa, in plant pots etc"

7761,"We had a guy working in our data center who was kind of odd, but he was alright.  One of his known tendencies was to be rather punctual, so one day, when he didn't show up to work, it caused immediate concern.  After a few hours, the owner told some of the managers to go to his house and check up on him.

The head of customer service and the head of sales went to his house, only about 10 miles away, and knocked on his door.  After no answer, they looked in the windows and saw the guy asleep on his couch.  They banged on the windows to get his attention, and when he didn't move, they called 911.  

The fire department detected heavy levels of carbon monoxide, and had to clear the area.  Eventually, the EMTs were allowed to remove the guy, and thankfully, he was somehow still alive, but he was hospitalized for a while.  The source was traced to a large diesel generator he had running in his basement, and had he not been on the upper floors when he passed out, he might have been long dead.

When he returned, he was never quite the same.  He always had headaches, was spacey, and his mood and behavior changed.  He explained to us that he was ""having a dispute the power company"" but did not specify what this dispute was, or how long he was without electricity.  Eventually, his job performance suffered too much, and he was let go."

7800,"I've told this story before, but this is a throwaway. 

This happened this year, in early August to early October.  

I'm in my sophomore year, and I'm in my school's marching band. There's this one freshman girl who I am *sure* was, and still is, into me. She was giving hints, but, ~~I like someone else~~ I'm not trying to get into a relationship. So, this wouldn't be so bad if *she weren't also in my section*. She plays saxophone, just like I do, and we had to spend a lot of time together. I use the bathroom during practice, she tags along. (I still don't know how she explained that to people.) I sit somewhere, she sits right next to me. This goes on for about 2 months, but this isn't necessarily the creepy part. 
 
The creepy (and kind of sexual assault-ish) part is that, starting in October, even when there were people around, **she would grope my ass** and whisper things like, ""damn, you got hella cake"". Luckily for me, there are *9* other girls in my section, and 3 of them (1 junior,  2 sophomores) saw her being weird like this. So, in order to rectify the situation, they talked to me about it, I told them I wanted to punch the shit out of her, and they decided that they would do something about it. I still don't know what they did, and she didn't have any (visible) scratches or bruises, but she hasn't spoken to me since. 

There was also that time in 6th grade when a girl grabbed my dick in the lunch line. 

Tl;dr: Clingy freshman girl in marching band likes being really close to me, starts grabbing my ass **in school**, gets caught by girls in my section, and most likely got cursed out. "

 It just led me to be stressed and burnt out all the time. I'd get angry and frustrated, because it was so much work and toddlers don't really have the ability to appreciate a sparkling house or a complicated home cooked meal. (Which is normal, and I didnt resent them for that).

I started cooking simpler stuff. The kids were happier because they were pretty picky to start with. I was happier because it was way easier. I stopped being so anal about cleaning.. my house is still clean, but it's just a normal house. This led me to be a lot less stressed when the kids made a mess. I stopped trying to micromanage my kids clothes, hair, etc. 

This came when my daughter was 4, and had never had her hair cut.. she had her 6 yr old brother cut it for her because I wouldnt allow it. At that point I was just like... ""what the fuck am I doing?

7829,"I have heard that at the end of life, a previously deceased loved one sometimes comes to escort you across the devide. It is actually part of hospice training.

 I was ED of a small retirement home. Guy named Al, 97, had been there for ten years, long before I showed up. Great guy. His wife had fallen and broken her hip, so he arranged for them to move in once she rehabbed. They had married at 18, and had never slept apart before. She was getting better, so he made the move and prepared a place for his beloved bride. He hung a plaque next to the door that said 'Al and Edith Olafsen.' She died in rehab. He kept the plaque hanging there for ten years to honor his beloved bride who never saw the place. 

So Al did not show up for dinner one day, and I went to check on him. I entered the apartment, and there sat Al, in one wing chair, facing the other wing chair, which had been moved to face him. I asked what was wrong, and he said, motioning to the other chair, ""she says she won't go to the dining room. I don't know what to do."" My blood ran cold, but I got it together, and suggested he come on down and eat with the guys, and I can do a room service tray for Edith. He looked troubled, and got up, and headed to the door. We got to the hall, and he stopped, and said ""Julius, I am really worried about her. Would it be too much trouble to get us both room service so I can eat with her?"" I went to the kitchen and ordered two trays for #11, as Al had a guest. Chef asked who the guest was, and I said ""Edith."" She teared up, and made the trays. 

We served them both three meals a day for three days, with Al getting increasingly concerned about his beloved bride not eating, despite his insistance, sometimes arguing with her right in front of me, but she just wasn't hungry, cause she had been dead ten years. Then came the day that we all new was coming. Sometime between dinner and breakfast, Edith took Al home to the place she had prepared for her dashing groom..."

7835,"Oh man hopefully this doesn't get buried.. but a few years back in college I took a theater class as my art elective. I took the class with one of my good friends and teammates like normal and the class wasn't bad. My teacher was very serious about theater but overall very nice and the class was not very difficult. 

So part of the class was going to see a play of our choosing off this list we were given at the beginning of the semester. My friend and I chose to go to this one show at Yale because it was close by. So we show up and we are a little out of place already. It's mostly a typical Yale crowd, most people are pretty upper class and it's actually mostly adults. 
Unfortunately we showed up fairly close to the starting time so we had to sit in folding chairs that were right next to the stage, like right next to it, my legs were touching it. So the play is about to start and they tell us that one of the actresses wrote the play and she is a student at Yale so that should be cool.

The room goes dark and the play starts.. I kid you not three college girls walked on stage naked just wearing underwear. I am literally so close to them I could touch them if I reached out. I had to look away for a second because of the pure awkwardness I felt and I made the awful mistake of looking at my friend sitting next to me. He must have been thinking the same thing because he looked over and we made eye contact. I'm sure you have been in that situation where you look at your friend and you have to laugh, this was one of those times. So we start laughing, trying not to, but just couldn't help it. I put my face in my arm and muffled it but I could literally feel the stares of everyone in the room. I got it together and with tears in my eyes I kept watching determined not to laugh. Only problem was the play was silent for the most part with just background noise sometimes. So we are sitting in a completely silent room, arm distance away from three naked girls, surrounded by very serious theater going Yale people. It was brutal, at one point the girls were screaming, taking a bath, all sorts of things. My insides physically hurt from holding back laughter but we made it all the way through. At the end everyone got up to applaud and I have never left anywhere faster."

He only has two hobbies: on Tuesdays, he bowls, and on Sunday, he plays a round of golf. One day, he arrives home and his wife greets him at the door. She tells him, ""Darling, you've been working so hard. I know it's a few months until our anniversary, but I wanted to do something special for you. So, I have a babysitter for the kids, and tonight I'm going to take you to a strip club"". Well, being a red blooded man, Chris is enthusiastic, and off they go. When they get to the club, there's a line at the door. However the doorman steps up, greets Chris by name, shakes his hand and ushers them in the door. When his wife thinks that's odd Chris just says ""oh, that's Mark. He's in my bowling league. Great guy, bowls 200."" Mollified, the couple enters the club and find seats near the stage. Immedietly, a waitress plops into Chris's lap and purrs ""Hey, Chris. Want your regular gin and tonic""? His wife glaring daggers at him, Chris pushes the waitress off himand explains that she also works at his golf course, and that he always orders a gin and tonic as he starts the back nine. They settle in for a show, although the wife is having second thoughts about her gift. As the first dance ends, a stripper leans over Chris , wraps her arms around him and whispers, ""Hey big man, we already cleared the VIP for your private dance."" At this point the eaife has had enough. She stands up, tosses her drink in Chris's face and storms out of the club screaming every insult in the book. Chris scrambles to throw down some cash for the drinks and races out after his wife. When he gets outside she's already flagged a cab. Chris barely manages to get his arm in the door, but he makes it in and is begging with his wife, trying to explain, trying to calm her doen, while she continues to call him every terrible word under the sun. Chris finally has her calmed down and almost convinced that the stripper made a mistake, when the cabbie turns around and says ""Goddamn Chris, you sure managed to pick up a bitch tonight!"""

7857,"My wife and I were woken up by a couple of guys screaming and shouting in the parking lot of the outside our apartment window. I looked out and saw there were two guys fighting and a girl yelling at them to stop. We called 911, gave them info about what was going on and kept watching as they would fight and then step back and shout at each other for awhile. About half an hour goes by and there are no cops. They're still out there shouting and fighting and we hear one guy shout ""I'm gonna fucking kill you!"" We call the police again and update/remind them. Another fifteen minutes goes by and the guy who screamed that gets the upper hand enough that he slams the other guy's head into the side of a dumpster and we see him come away with a decent amount of blood all over one side of his face. At this point I tell my wife to call the police and tell them I am a concealed license holder and I have taken my gun outside to stop somebody from being seriously hurt/killed. I go outside with my pistol drawn, take cover behind the corner of the stairwell, and yell to stop and sit down on opposite curbs in the parking lot and that the police are on their way. The bleeding guy sits down, the other guy yells at him ""you didn't tell me you lived by a fucking cop!"" and then gets in the car with the girl and they drive off. I holster my pistol and go talk to the bleeding guy to make sure he's ok and he says ""yeah, did you call the police?"" I told him yes and he said ""thanks"" and went in his apartment. The police showed up about 10 minutes later and lectured me about how I should have let them handle it. They didn't even try to interview the guy in my apartment complex. It was all I could do not to get pissed and say ""I called you THREE TIMES OVER 45 MINUTES AND YOU DIDN'T HANDLE IT!"" Instead I just went inside and started making breakfast because there was no way all the adrenaline was going to let me sleep."

Women have given birth successfully for millennia!""

Sure, plenty of women give birth without complications, but many of them do not. Childbirth can be debilitating or lethal for both mother and baby. And in the US, ""midwife"" is an unprotected term, so lots of people using it have no medical training. 

Not to mention that kicking women out of the hospital within hours of giving birth is barbaric.

The first time he came to my room, we had just started dating and he was hesitant about sleeping in the same bed with me, so he asked what I would rather do. I got upset that he didn't want to just sleep in the same bed right away because ""we're dating right now"" and he accepted, but I could tell he would have been more comfortable sleeping in separate beds. I still remember exactly what I said because it was so embarrassing in hindsight. I did a lot of other super cringy things back then--tried to kiss him while he was sleeping, drunk texted him, gave him tons of gifts and handmade stuff trying to get him back after he broke up with me a few weeks later.

I wanted to kill myself, and I didn‚Äôt see why I shouldn‚Äôt. He was one of the few people I actually trusted. I‚Äôd known him for 6 years at that point, had been to his house, knew his parents, his sister was friends with my sister. I was happy to at least have one person who at least sort of cared about me. 

So I was talking to him and he was sad about something, said that no one cared about him, and I told him that it wasn‚Äôt true, that he had friends, and that we were friends. It took him a while before he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really consider you a friend.‚Äù

8045,"Previous Leasing Agent here.  This tenant is the Facebook Anarchist.

* Came in every day and requested that we fax documents. This person did this around three times a day. They didn't have a job. They just tried to sue people all day. That is all they did. They were unemployed and on rental assistance. It was easier for us to just fax the documents than to argue with them.
* Posts on Facebook approximately 30-50 times a day. Personally, this is my favorite part. This person's grasp of spelling, grammar, and general sentence structure is such that reading their posts verbatim is gut wrenchingly funny. This person has, like, two people who comment on their posts. Most of the comments made on this person's posts are just them commenting on their own post. The content of the posts themselves are also incredible. They include, but are not limited to:
   * Anti-government conspiracies
   * Anti-women posts
   * how they are ""worth 100's of millions of dollars""
   * How they are a hall of famer
   * videos about politics
   * videos about aliens
   * videos about the conspiracies of political figureheads hiding aliens
* One time this person tried to organize a ""business leaders of the world"" conference at the shared pool. They invited stars and famous people such as The Rock. Nobody came. So he just requested that I take pictures of him by the hot tub. They posted them on Facebook.
* They once posted 72 pictures of themselves on Facebook on a single day. The only difference between the each picture was slightly different posture.
* We had a business center for tenants to use computers. This person used them most days for extended periods of time. I once walked by when they were playing very loud alien sounds and they had both index fingers touching the screen of the computer. I asked them to stop.
* We had roofers replace the roof on their building. We got several e-mails asking if the roofers could fix a problem on their balcony. I had to explain several times that they were contracted for a specific job and that the job they were doing was fixing the roof and not fixing their balcony.
* The issue of the balcony was regarding a panel they claimed was loose. There were no panels on the balcony. We sent maintenance over on more than one occasion and there was no panel. When questioned about the panel they usually tried changing the subject.
* US marshals contacted us and requested that if any gun shaped packages were shipped to this tenant to give them a call.
* This tenant tried to sue us on several occasions. They even used our own fax machine to fax the documents they were using to sue us. They faxed the documents to us. They used our own fax machine to send a document approximately 8 feet.
* Sent several lewd e-mails to one of the leasing agents. They were convinced that the leasing agent was trying to have sex with them. The e-mails are still in their file. Any time I needed a laugh I would read them.
* Makes poorly rendered Photoshop art mostly pertaining to Cleopatra.
* Calls themselves ""director"" because they make videos where they showcase their Cleopatra art paired with alien music.

There are probably more stories but I can't remember them right now."

Finally got knocked out by a grenade. They took him to a concentration camp, but he decided captivity wasn't for him and walked out the front gate.

He once took a Nazi-held village in Italy by surrounding it with 50 commandos and, in the dead of night, charged from all sides while having his entire unit scream **""COMMANDOOOOOOO!""** at the top of their lungs. The Nazis thought they were outnumbered and surrendered, allowing his 50 men to take 130+ prisoners and inflict an unknown number of casualties.

After the war he joined peacekeeping missions in Palestine, learned to surf in Australia, and provided archery consultation in Hollywood--he's even an extra in Ivanhoe!

Later in life, he would take the train home from his day job (not sure what the job was), and every day he would fling his briefcase out the window of the moving train.

Or worse,  send missionaries to spread the word of God to America, and then the plague kills like 80% of everyone there before they get a chance to hear about it.

Usually they'll overcharge you. And/or try to take you to bars, hotels, shops, etc. where they get paid a kickback for delivering customers. 

Another danger is if you put your luggage in their trunk and they hold it hostage, where they won't open the trunk until you pay them a ransom. So I always bring my backpack with me into the backseat.

If possible, try to go to a taxi counter where you can pre-pay for the fare. Or go to a dispatcher holding a clipboard and walkie-talkie who summons a taxi for you that will use the meter. In both cases, you should get a receipt with the taxi's data and a phone number to report the driver to the company if you run into problems.

Ahead of time, you can look up the airport's website and find a ""Ground Transportation"" section that gives useful info on transport options for different budget levels. This is standard operating procedure for me these days. Also, the hotel or hostel's own website will sometimes have directions and transport tips.

8166,"I got into it with a facebook friend once. She was constantly posting those pictures of cash where the guy promises to share some of the $17 million dollars he won if you share his photo. I tried to explain that these things were bullshit that served only to make you you look like an idiot to all your friends. She was all offended and it got into a whole debate about optimism and pessimism as a world view. 

""I'm as optimistic as you can get. I just happen to think those pictures are scams."" I shared a link to a website about click-farming, and she eventually agreed. But a week later, there was more of those pics on her news feed. Now I don't even waste my time."

8174,"Real talk, because I feel like ""oh, it's got a lot of space"" is a really tepid compliment and I want to add something with real meat, the source of a lot of things American citizens point to as why other countries are better than the US are actually only possibly because of the generosity of the US, which the US gets little credit for:

Let me preface this by saying geopolitics is complicated, and this aspect of the US is not a *perfect* good and there are certainly negative side-effects.

If Canada, Japan, and all European countries had to defend their own borders there would be an extreme pressure on their budget. The US not only contributes *far* more to NATO than any other country, but explicitly provides direct more direct military aid to its allies than any other country by a wide margin.

This effectively subsidizes the increased spending on social welfare programs those countries tout, and that the US is criticized for lacking, especially by its own citizens. Ironically, the American citizens who criticize America for having *less* social welfare than those countries are generally the same citizens who criticize the US for maintaining a military that allows them to provide the protection that enables those things.

Additionally, and in the same vein, the vast majority of global medical research is done in the *private* American healthcare community, not the *public* healthcare system of any country. It is exactly this medical technology that allows the healthcare system of our allies with social healthcare to function at a level that even approaches that of the US.

If you take the private US healthcare system *and consider the medical technology developed by that system and only that system*, you can make a very strong argument that it would be the best system in the world by far if you compare it to any social healthcare system *and consider medical technology developed by that healthcare system*.

Now, that isn't to say that the US's system is better *in aggregate*, it's simply to say that countries that are considered by many in the US to have a better system only have systems that are effective as they are because of the incentive structures of the US system and the benefit that brings them. And the US doesn't get nearly enough credit for that either.

The progressive ethos seems to be that self-sacrifice for others is the highest moral calling, but I don't think progressives have, in general, thought about this in a nuanced enough way in reference to US social spending. The US is *absolutely* self-sacrificing the enable their allies to grow and prosper.

And I would like to close by reminding everyone again, the yes this isn't *perfect*, and there are negative side-effects. Just like there are negative side effects to other systems.

I'm not making the claim that the US has the best system, only that the US doesn't get nearly enough credit for its generosity and self-sacrifice for the benefit of its allies, direct or indirect, from citizens of the US or its allies.

The US is absolutely a major force for world improvement, even as it is often a major source of trouble, and a world where there was only ocean where the the US is would almost certainly be a worse world (one single example: Nazi Germany, Communist Russia, Populist China, et.al., that the US has held in check)."

Point being. When we bought our house, we found it strange that all of the upstairs bedrooms had deadbolts and/or chain locks on the inside.

8187,"I haven't snooped, but have helped clean/organize his room, and I plan to do a big reorganization while he's away visiting his grandparents this summer. I would be surprised if there was anything, anything at all in his room that he hadn't told me all about, that I didn't already know existed. It wouldn't matter what the secret was, I would be shocked to discover he had a secret at all. Sometimes I think he doesn't have a single thought in his head that doesn't eventually come out of his mouth lol. "
8188,"Of course I only got one side of this story. This was in 1943.  

Pray tell how am I to describe this guy whom is deceased? My grandfather tried to be a decent guy and avoid the fight, and by ill fate he ended up killing a man. He saw this man's friends shake his limp body, knowing full well he just killed a man by accident. The only man, mind you, as he became an Avionics Technician during his service.  

I meant no disrespect *at all* considering he's the only grandparent I met, and my time with him was not much at all considering he passed when I was only 6.  

As for the man who passed away, I have no idea who he was but his death was unwarranted nor did he deserve it."

8195,"Friend of mine had recently broken up with her boyfriend and we both got pretty drunk at a party. She starts getting super flirty and was hanging all over me. We were getting looks from people at the party. She asks if we can go back to my place. I didn‚Äôt ever really think of her that way, we met while she was in a relationship and had established a friendship that wasn't romantic in the slightest, but she‚Äôs cute and I figured why not? So we get back to my place and she‚Äôs sitting on the couch. I go to make a move and immediately I can tell she‚Äôs not down. She literally just wanted to sleep on my couch instead of going to her own place. Was awkward and embarrassing but we laughed it off and we‚Äôre still friends 2 years later. I‚Äôve since learned that she‚Äôs a total flirt when she gets drunk and to not think anything of it. "

8200,"Was chatting with this girl I met online. We hit it off. A lot of shared interests. After a long while of texting unromantically, I broke up with who I was dating and we started adding some hot and heavy sexy texting. After a week or so, we went out. Made out in the pub, made out in the car, ended up having sex. I figured I wasn't into her romantically (sex was lousy and awkward, and got some weird vibes).


I tell her the next day. She's disappointed, but took it okay.

A week or so later, I get  a call from her. She wants to stay friends. I like her, minus the sex part, so I say that I would love that.


Fast forward a few weeks later, I am back from a business trip. Dead tired. She had a bad day, wants to go drinking. I warn her that I am tired. She's fine with it. We go out to a pub right under my apartment.


Everything g is great. I am tired, but having a good time. We don't flirt. We talk, laugh etc.

She says she needs some coffee before  she goes home. She suggests coming up for it. I say sure, but with jetlag and beers, I tell her I am just going to sit down.


I sit on my sofa, nodding off while she's making coffee. I must have dozed off.


I wake up, my pants are opened, and she's blowing me. I was horrified. Asked her to stop, she made a laughing sound and kept going. Had to push her off me. She stopped, looked Realllllly hurt, and left immidiatly.

I was more shocked than anything. And a little worried that I hurt her feelings. Was not traumatized or anything, but assuming because I never felt in danger.

I was 38 at the time. She was 34."

8214,"So I've got a story that involved CO.

I was doing flight training a few months back and my instructor and I were flying around. It was bumpy and I was ""under the hood"" (wearing goggles that kept me from looking outside, focusing on flying by sole reference to instruments). Sometimes I would get air sick if it got too bumpy and I was under the hood, so I ignored it. 

Then my instructor yawned, and said he had a headache. I said me too, and that I was sleepy.

Now we had absolutely zero reason to suspect CO poisoning at this point. 

Until he felt heat coming out of the AC vent.

We quickly suspected CO poisoning, turned off the AC (absolutely no reason it should be pumping in heat let along CO), opened the window, and headed back to the airport to get on the ground ASAP.

We get back and discovered lead in the air conditioning intake. (Lead is in aviation grade fuel, which means exhaust was getting into our AC).

As it turns out, the exhaust pipe that was at the bottom of the engine cowl, just recently replaced, was too short. And airflow was taking exhaust and putting it right into our air conditioning.

If I was alone that flight I might have died."

8243,I was in a domestic violence relationship and my dad told me I could stay with him. My 12 year old son and I left my ex while he was at at work.  I was also 4 months pregnant. I was with my dad a week. He was always smoking marijuana and I asked him not to around me since I was pregnant. He told me he didn't care if my baby died.  He wouldn't stop smoking.  He proceeded to kick me and my son out. I ended up losing my daughter. And I haven't forgiven him.  I haven't spoken to him since then.  That was in 2013.

Yeah, that shit is incredibly frustrating and such an emotion and time suck for everyone.

It's really shitty because there are so many people who suffer with suicidal thoughts that get really serious, and there are plenty of EMTs, cops, ER docs and staff that have zero patience because they just view it in relation to the attention-seeking stuff.

8277,"Sell things to businesses.

No, seriously, most personal selling to consumers is a scam. Not all, but most... There is very little money in it (compared to B2B sales), you are often being hired as a glorified floor clerk, and it is rife with scams.

Now, selling capital goods to businesses? Big money. Repeat business. Often just as relationship based as consumer selling... But for big things.

Example: you want to sell cars, because you like things with engines. You could go get a sales job at a dealership, hope people walk onto the sales floor, make a small commission off a $10-80k car or truck, and never see those people again in their lifetime (or if you do its for parts and service the dealership takes the money for).

Contrast that with selling commercial trucks to truck lines, or selling commercial engines to people who need them for trucking, construction equipment, generators, and ships. You sell to companies who a) buy dozens or hundreds of the things, not one b) use them up making money, so they repeat the buys every few years c) buy service and support contracts you get a cut of.

See the difference? Selling 50 Kenworths to Bobco Truck Lines every three years is a hell of a better deal than selling one F-150 to Bob every 10-15 years, no matter how well you sell the underbody coating. "
8278,"My wife is a contractor for a company that handles commercial properties and she has 14 major accounts. She has to post X amount of FB posts, X amount of Twitter posts, X amount of IG posts and X amount of Google ad posts every week for each account (which averages out to basically 1 post on each network for each account a day)  So one day she will schedule out all or most of her FB posts for the week, another couple days she will schedule out her IG posts, and then Twitter is more interactive so she has to do those pretty much daily. Some days she has a solid 8 hours of work, other days she can be done in 30 minutes. "

After the song ended, I criticised his band choice because his playlist had the original, and I prefer FFDP.

8349,"The legend part is quite good and creepy:

From Wikipedia;

&gt; According to one version of a legend that was already recorded in the Middle Ages, the scribe was a monk who broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be¬†walled up alive. In order to avoid this harsh penalty he promised to create in one night a book to glorify the monastery forever, including all human knowledge. Near midnight, he became sure that he could not complete this task alone so he made a special prayer, not addressed to God but to the fallen angel Lucifer, asking him to help him finish the book in exchange for his soul. The devil completed the manuscript and the monk added the devil's picture out of gratitude for his aid.[1][24][25]¬†In tests to recreate the work, it is estimated that reproducing only the calligraphy, without the illustrations or embellishments, would have taken five years of non-stop writing.[12"

8370,"I'm a big fan of this one. There's also the universal running track, which works off the same basic idea.

If you imagine a round running track, you'll see that there's an offset in starting positions. People running in the inner track start further back, relative to those runners on the outer tracks, due to the fact that the outside tracks are longer, so that everyone finishes at the same point having run the same distance.

Say you have a distance of one metre between each of the tracks, and you want to run a fair race. Runner A (on the innermost track) starts *x* metres behind Runner B (on the next track out), who starts *x* metres away from Runner C (on the next track out), and so on until you have your six runners. That's fine, if you're running in a standard 400m race track in your local high school -- but what if you were running a country-wide race, with the biggest similarly shaped track you could fit in the continental US? Or perhaps the solar system? Or perhaps the visible universe? (This assumes that the tracks themselves stay the same width, but the hole in the middle of the circuit gets bigger.) How far apart are the runners when they start?

(Yes, the answer is still *x* metres.)"

8415,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

8442,"I was best friends with a girl who is in prison for killing her baby.

She was a foster kid and that's how I knew her. My step-aunt was her foster mother. She would tell me about how her mom abused her physically and sexually growing up. Her mom also let men rape her for drug money. It bothered her but she seemed to be well adjusted and she always talked about wanting to have children. The doctors said her uterus was damages from being raped as a child but she got pregnant.

I lost contact with her when she got married and was pregnant but I knew about it because my sister told me. I was really happy for her and just knew she'd be a good mom.

Boy was I wrong.

She had a daughter and apparently became very jealous of her. She hated it when people would focus their attention on her daughter and not her.

Her husband decided that he was going to divorce her and they seperated. They had joint-custody so on a weekend that he was supposed to have the baby, she brought her to him. The baby was lethargic, her eyes were shaking, he couldn't get the baby to respond to anything. Then she started having seizures. He rushed the baby to the hospital where she died.

They did a scan on her brain and it was pretty much soup. The mom was angry about the separation and shook her. 

This girl was in child development class with me when our teacher was showing us what a baby's brain looks like after shaking baby syndrome. I had to leave the class because it was so horrific. She was sitting next to me when we saw it.

I just couldn't believe. I couldn't sleep for weeks knowing that this person I once loved and considered an unofficial sister could do something like that. My step-aunt who fostered her and gave her a chance was hysterical. It was just all around awful."

8461,"Honestly? I don't believe the things I'm about to say but I do *understand* the perspective. They believe that their homosexual children will have horrible lives and go to hell when they die if they don't change their behavior. They are convinced that their children will never find real love, never have children, likely get diseases and be hurt in other ways sexual and not. They are using a tool that people having been using since the dawn of civilization, social shaming, to try to get them to change. They think that by cutting their children off, it can apply enough social pressure to them that they will change, ergo saving their child's life and afterlife. And if it doesn't work, they don't want to watch it happen/ deal with the shame brought upon their family. All this hinges on the idea that there is something really horrible/shameful about being gay. If these people knew more happy, healthy gay people there would be more cognitive dissonance.

8526,"Copying and pasting my comment:

&gt;The actual only reason why DC was ""worse"" is that there was no transformer allowing easier transmission. AC was better because it was easy to increase voltage and decrease current so it could be transmitted long distances without voltage loss. At the time, DC couldn't be transformed like that so it couldn't be transmitted long distances efficiently. AC took over for mainly this reason. If we had transistors to allow for DC tranformation back then, DC would have been functionally identical and likely would have been the main transmission method. Nothing actually makes DC worse than AC, and DC is otherwise much easier to use


Totally agree that Edison was a shitty person, but its untrue that AC is better than DC in general.

Now I go to a cafe and sometimes every table is taken by a single person with a laptop and single dry cup (usually made of paper) that held a coffee probably an hour or two ago. The cafes feel as sterile as an office with an atmosphere as stilted as a library. Back in the day, if a cafe was full (rare), I would just wait a few minutes until people vacated a table and all was good. Now, I can wait lord knows how long and no one budges. I often need a back-up plan of a series cafes to go to until I can find some place to sit.

And it just doesn't feel urbane or cool and fun anymore. It used to be so nice to sit by yourself reading or working while people around you chatted and enjoyed their coffee and food, now you might as well be in a office full of cubicles as people all sit there with headphones on, pounding on their laptops with their take-out cups. It feels weird to meet a friend in a silent place like that where no one seems to be enjoying themselves.

I once borrowed my stepmonster's Chrysler New Yorker because my POS shitbox had literally burst into flames while driving down the road (just until I found a new car). I was coming back from an internship event and exited the freeway when I felt a tire go. It was a really tight-turn cloverleaf exchange, so it was a bit tricky hanging on to the thing until I got to the bottom, where I pulled over. 

Now, my dad wouldn't let us get our licenses until we knew how to change a tire, so I might be a tiny 5' 2"" woman, but I can change a fucking flat, right. But my stepmonster had only given me the door/ignition key (this was back in the very early 90s) so I didn't have access to the trunk to get the spare and jack and everything out. Fuck, what to do, what to do. There's no such thing as cellphones yet. I can see the truck stop buildings ahead and surely, would've managed to find a phone booth + some change to call my dad. (It was maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a mile, tops.) But I didn't even have time to think of that. This big semi pulls up behind my car and the trucker man and his trucker lady jump out. She runs up to me and says, ""I just told \[husband\], 'You better stop and help that little girl!'"" (I mean, I was 22, but I'm sure I still looked like I was maybe 16.) So sweet. I explain I can't find a trunk release button/lever anywhere inside the car, so if we can figure out how to pop that trunk open, I'm good to go. They invite me to go sit with them back in the cab (Which I wouldn't have done without the wife trucker) and the husband trucker does what truckers do: he gets on the CB and calls out to ask if anyone knows how to get into the trunk of a New Yorker without a key. I couldn't believe the response of pure, uncensored profanity that came back, LOL, but I'd been raised by bikers at the race track, so it wasn't like I'd lost my innocence or anything. Anyway, somebody suggests there's a button in the glove compartment and sure enough, there it was, trunk popped, problem solved. And this nice, kind trucker goes right on ahead and changes out the tire for me. Wouldn't accept any money, just my gratitude and off they went and off I went. 

Truckers and Bikers. Love 'em. Most will give you the shirt off their backs. "

Having studied musicology, i can say that there is definitely objectivity when it comes to good music. Consonance and dissonance, rhythm (time) and composition all have roots in behavioral patterns and story telling. Something which is embedded within us on a deeply evolutionary level. The modernists figured this out when they turned music from an aesthetic pursuit into a philosophical one. As it turns out, there are only so many elements you can take away from music before you require intricate and fundamentally flawed ideas of subjectivity in lieu of unexplainable aesthetic value.

The destination: sacrifice is an act of giving up something valued for the sake of something else regarded as more important or worthy.

So in order to be a sacrifice, something would have to be given up. Jesus knew he'd be back after a really shitty weekend. And he knew that dying meant a round trip ticket to paradise. So he gets beat a little, dies, spends the weekend with dad in heaven, comes back hangs out for a while, then heads back up north for a while longer 

Where's the sacrifice? If you told me that my son had the cure to EbolaCancerAids in his blood and they had to take a bunch to save everyone, but the result would be he will it'll really hurt, then he'll be asleep for three days, but wake up better than before (and while he's sleeping he will have the most realistic dream of paradise).

8771,"Back when I was fourteen, I told one of my classmates ‚Äì who was of a similar age ‚Äì that airplanes in flight looked small because of the air pressure they experienced.

The whole thing started when we were sitting on the top row of the gym's bleachers. We were only about eight or nine feet up, but the height was still apparently impressive enough to prompt my companion (whose name was Nick) to consider a career in extreme sports.

""Hey, do you think I could jump down from here?"" he asked.

I turned to him with a look of shock and alarm on my face. ""From up *here?* No way! That's, like, half a mile down!""

""What?"" he glanced over the edge again. ""No, it isn't!""

""No, really, it is!"" I insisted. ""I know it *looks* close, but that's only because we're inside. There's no air pressure.""

Nick gave me a quizzical look. ""Air pressure? What do you mean?""

""Well,"" I began, ""when you're outside, there's air everywhere, right? All of that air presses against things, making them look small. Have you ever looked up at an airplane and thought that it looked really tiny?""

""Oh... oh, yeah!"" Nick said, a flicker of understanding crossing his face.

""That's because there's a *lot* of air pressure up there. Most of those planes are only about fifty feet in the air, which is why it's illegal to throw rocks at them. You might hit one and cause a wreck!""

My companion nodded enthusiastically. ""Yeah! *Yeah!* I heard about that happening!""

""Anyway,"" I said, ""since we're inside, there's no air pressure. Since there's no air pressure, everything *looks* like it's a lot closer, because it's not getting shrunk down. If you jumped off the bleachers, you'd probably die.""

Nick didn't say anything else... but he slowly scooted away from the edge.

Also, 17 isn't a woman's physical prime. One specific ""prime"" doesn't really exist, but if it did it wouldn't be 17 years old. The human body is complex and has a series of peaks. Peak fertility is early to mid-20s and doesn't decline dramatically until the mid to late 30s. The brain isn't fully developed until 25 or so. Your prime in terms of strength is around 25. Surveys show women have more satisfying sex in their late 20s and 30s. When you get into emotional, social, and financial primes, it's later. It's possible you think 17 is a woman's prime because we live in a very misogynistic, youth-obsessed culture."

8863,"My SIL father grew up Amish.   When he turned 18 he ""jumped the fence.""  This is the term commonly used when an Amish leaves the church and starts living ""English.""  Her dad ran away from home and had only minimal contact with this family since.  When his dad died 50+ years later, he went home to attend the funeral.  He was not permitted to sit with the family, he ate the funeral meal in an outside barn with non-relative mourners.  Most Amish don't leave the church after Rumspringa because in most cases it literally means cutting off all ties with everyone you know.  Mother, father, sibliings, grandparents, neighbors, friends, aunts, uncles,....  It's not just their immediate family that will disown them but all the other families in the church will also refuse to speak to them or help them.  Most who leave don't leave because of some forbidden fun they experienced during Rumspringa.  They typically leave to pursue something the church forbids (education) or because their family is abusive.

The technology that is permitted varies from church to church.  The Bishop of the church determines what/if any modern conveniences the church will allow. For example, I have an Amish girl that comes to clean my house.  She used to have a cell phone for business purposes.  But their Biship changed the rule and now forbids cell phones.  Now only a phone that plugs into the wall is permitted for business use.  

For transportation, many Amish hire drivers to take them wherever they want to go.  For work (construction amish bosses), shopping (to Wal-Mart, the malls, etc), to appointments (medical, lawyer, etc.), they'll even hire drivers to take them on trips. The Amish actually travel often.  Niagra Falls, white water rafting, Florida, etc.  My Amish cleaning lady went to Switzerland about 6 months ago.  When she is at my house, she uses my vaccuum, listens to the radio or turns the TV on to a music station.  (But she usually picks a christian music station)

Church for the Amish is not held in the same building (church) each week like traditional religions.  Different families take turns hosting the service in their barns.   So church is always in a different place.  The sermons/services are very long.

Another tidbit, all siblings will usually have the same middle initial. Their middle name will start with the first letter of their father's name.  So if the father's first name is Joseph, his kids middle names might be Jacob, Jennifer, Jonas, Jonathon and Jack.

There is a lot of sexual abuse among the Amish.  When possible children's services does get involved but very often, the church elders/family blocks them as much as possible. The church will protect the offender from outsiders and punish them themselves.  Often the church will send offenders away to ""camp"" for 6 months then they just rejoin the community.  

Also they make amazing fry pies.  If you are ever driving down a road there is an Amish buggy sitting there selling fry pies.  Stop!  You won't be sad. "

She saw kissing as really intimate and should be shared between a couple which we were not. She felt I ruin the moment by trying to be intimate instead of ""taking"" her.  "

8896,"I worked in a cafe when I was younger and a gentleman came in who I recognized as a bit of an oddball I had seen around, waiting at bus stops or walking downtown. Teenagers mocked him for talking to himself and for his appearance- short and very tidy, with a neat moustache and a hat that made him look like Mario. He came in and ordered a ham sandwich with a few extra side orders of particular things, and a milkshake. He was meticulously counting out small change.   
I thought I‚Äôd do him a favour by not charging him for any of the extras. Maybe because he went everywhere on foot, maybe because he seemed a bit off. I rounded everything to the basic prices and undercharged him. When I went to collect his dishes after he left, the remainder of exactly what he owed (down to the last cent) was stacked neatly on the table. 
I felt like such a jerk. I hope he thought I just made a mistake, not that I was patronizing him or assuming he couldn‚Äôt afford his meal. He knew exactly how much he owed plus tax plus a tip and left it there even after being undercharged. I‚Äôve always hoped he didn‚Äôt think I felt sorry for him, but I guess I kind of did, and it turns out I didn‚Äôt need to because he was very noble about his ham sandwich and I wasn‚Äôt. "

8932,"No. No no no no no no, that's not what brandishing is. The idea that if you draw a firearm you MUST use it is incredibly dangerous and completely false. You must be willing to use it, absolutely, but if, for example, you're being threatened with a knife and you draw and they run away, you think you could be charged with brandishing because you DIDN'T shoot them? No.

I don't know where this obsession with the term brandishing in the CCW community came from, but it's absolutely full of misinformation. Brandishing isn't even a charge that exists in many states, and when it does it means the intentional, UNLAWFUL display of a weapon for the purpose of intimidation. Displaying a firearm to intimidate in self defense is absolutely NOT unlawful.

There's a huge amount of misinformation coming from ""instructors"" who took a few hours of NRA classes and repeat everything they hear at the gun store. Please, if you carry a firearm or even own one, or if you believe you might ever use force to defend yourself, get some competent training.

9015,"""Our last invention"" According to Scott Adams:

"" **Holodeck**  
For those of you who only watched the 'old' Star Trek, the holodeck can create simulated worlds that look and feel just like the real thing. The characters on Star Trek use the holodeck for recreation during breaks from work. This is somewhat unrealistic. If I had a holodeck, I'd close the door and never come out until I died of exhaustion. It would be hard to convince me I should be anywhere but in the holodeck, getting my oil massage from Cindy Crawford and her simulated twin sister. Holodecks would be very addicting. If there weren't enough holodecks to go around, I'd get the names of all the people who had reservations ahead of me and beam them into concrete walls. I'd feel tense about it, but that's exactly why I'd need a massage. I'm afraid the holodeck will be society's last invention. """

Toss it in the oven till it just about cooked (My preferred method is sous vide because it's amazing). While it's resting make a sauce for the top. 1 cup of wine 1 cup of sugar couple of orange peels reduced makes a nice one. Serve on some mashed potatoes or a simple side salad. Ooooh baby. Let me tell you, the way the crackled fat plays with the delicate and soft meat. The way the sweet and spicy dance with the nutty as if in some sort of immortal embrace. The wine sauce just red as can be, almost like a winters holiday SO Sweet!

9035,"Just wanted to add something to this.  One of the best things I've ever done was take a CCW class.  Most people that took the class weren't actually getting their concealed carry license, they wanted to learn.  

My instructor took us through the ridiculously easy accuracy requirements, which lasted about 30 minutes of our EIGHT HOUR course.  For thr rest of the class, he taught us what it means to conceal carry.  Once you pick up and carry that weapon, you lose all future arguments.  You no longer get in fights.  You cannot say inflammatory things.  You no longer have road rage.  If you're at a place and someone calls your wife a fucking whore, you will sit there and take it.  You will dishonor her.

Not because you're a pussy.  But because the only other option when carrying, is you drawing your weapon and killing that individual.  And words, rage, anger, none of your emotions you are feeling right then will rectify the consequences of killing someone.  You draw when you fear for your life, and for no other reason.  

It really was a great class, and I remember it every day that I carry.  "

9042,"My ex was like this. She was the life of the party to everyone else, but when we got home every little thing came out for hours on end. Don't get me wrong... some of it was legit stuff, but when she got to the end of the list, she would just go back to the beginning. I would try and get her to calm down and talk about it the next day, but she wouldn't even remember yelling at me all night. 
I didn't drink much so I was usually sober and would have to leave and go for a drive for a few hours hoping she would spin herself out and pass out before I got back home. 
We were engaged but things weren't going well so we went to couple's therapy, got better at communicating, but the arguing came up in a session and I was told I was stonewalling... I said that I just wanted to talk about things in the morning. The therapist said that was too long of a break, I was like, well, she'll still be drunk if we don't wait that long. The therapist's reaction was what made me realize that it wasn't normal. It was pretty heartbreaking for both of us. I didn't realize how much it was affecting me until the therapist made me talk about how I actually felt. I didn't realize that I was anxious when my ex went out (I had stopped going out socially with her because of the drinking.) and that I was basically hiding from her when she got home. Yikes. 
We worked on it for a while, but the drinking never really stopped, maybe a few days at a time, but never more than a week. 
We split up eventually and she moved back to where we moved from. 
There were a lot of factors that contributed to everything, but I'm happy to say that we were able to forgive each other and we've remained good friends. "

A lot of this promotes market inefficiency.

Mortgages from the time just before the housing crash.  When I was in the process of buying a condo, I saw the commercials saying stuff like ""Get a $450K loan for $500 a month"".  I thought, ""I can afford $500 a month, but I know I can't afford a $450K home"".

That child should never have to be abandoned again, because that is what it is every time she comes back and then doesn‚Äôt stay. She is abandoning them all over again and they are left wondering why she didn‚Äôt stay. Children will justify it themselves and take the blame. I‚Äôm still dealing with my own issues.

So they head on over there, and sure enough, his friends push it and push it until he agrees to drink one. Before you know it, the dude is wasted drunk. So his friends took him to a strip club to show him a good time. Anyways, he and a stripper mess around, and he gets an STD. Wedding proceeds as planned the next day, and the bride never heard anything of it. Well, as happens with couples, she ends up pregnant before too long. At some point during the pregnancy, it was discovered that the baby would be born blind because of this STD. So the husband fessed up, and the wife was completely devastated. They stick together though, and the baby is born happy and healthy, albeit blind. Before their daughter's 5th birthday, he asked her what she wanted as a present. She said ""I just want to be able to see."" The guy couldn't take it any longer, and he took his life that same day.

The only good work the portfolio contained  were hijacked pics of pieces done by myself and a couple of colleagues that had been featured in magazines around that time.   
He became upset, angry and denied it when I pointed out that I had done some of the pieces he was representing as his and tried to backtrack by saying they were in there as 'inspiration'.   


So I pulled the pictures(of the work he didn't do) out of the 'portfolio', and threw them in the trash. I followed that with a brief and belittling statement about ethics, law, and the possibility of accidental injury,  should he continue such actions before showing him the door.

As I was going back to work after eating at one of the local restaurants, I noticed a homeless guy convulsing and bleeding profusely out of a gash in his neck while crowds of people walked by. I ran over to him with my Wall Street Journal I had been reading, rolled him on his side and applied enough pressure on the wound with the newspaper to stop the bleeding. I also folded up my suit coat to provide a cushion under his head so that he wouldn't hurt himself more. 

His seizure stopped about a half minute later, so I just talked to him and told him to stay calm until the paramedics got there and took over. He had lost about a pint and a half of blood during the ordeal but survived from what I was later told when I called the hospital to check on him.

She‚Äôd often comment on how coming from an island and simpler landscape, that even though she‚Äôd been living in Paris for a while, she was still adjusting to technology like smartphones and apps and overexposure to ads. She has a friend who is significantly older and in a wheelchair and they travel together often. They went to New York together and I gave her a list of recommendations she acted on. At some point in her mysterious past she was in a Thai jail for two weeks. Her Paris apartment was a rent controlled two-bedroom that she turned the second room into a zen garden, one of her windows faced a major street and could clearly overlook the atm nearest my favorite bar. I write about gentrification a lot and it was interesting to talk to her about how her neighborhood had changed in the 10 years she was living in it looking out the same window. Originally she would only contact me to summon me to fool around and never routinely, it was always unexpected and spaced out and we had the system of fruit/tea that I described earlier, but there was one time that stood out to me towards the end of my time in Paris where she actually just contacted me for company because she‚Äôd hurt her back while traveling and we chilled without sex and used one of the food delivery apps (which she‚Äôd just discovered were a concept) to order tacos."

9297,"Citation very much needed.  The land of the Khwarezmian Shah *did not contain* 1/10 of the world's population.   Many individual towns were recorded as depopulated, but this meant that the soldiers were executed, the artisans sent back to Mongolia, and the rest enslaved.  Purposeful civilian genocide is only attributed to two towns, Samarkand and Urgench; casualties don't exist for Samarkand and are very obviously made up for Urgench, since that city was less populated than Samarkand, the capital, at the start of the siege, and so had less than 100,000 people in it.  Persian sources claim over a million deaths, very obviously bullshit.  Between 10-20% of the city probably fought and died, and a portion of the rest died, and it was genocide, but it wasn't in the millions.  The Mongols simultaneously pursued the Shah into other lands, and then alternately attacked or spared those lands depending on the information they gave up.  They were defeated in India.  The Shah finally died on the run from disease or heart attack.  

Cities would become depopulated, but that doesn't mean their populations were all slaughtered; it was routine to recruit men from one city to use against another city in a later siege, while others were seen as commodities or useful and incorporated into established areas already under Mongol control.  

Similar sketchy statistics exist for the invasion of China.  Census reports in China frequently varied greatly because they would not necessarily contain all the regions every time.  In comparing the population before and after Mongol invasion, it appears that 50 million people went missing, but this is easily rectified by including 40+ million southern Song Chinese back into the census.  

The Mongols were brutal, evil men, but their number of victims pales in comparison to 20th century wars.  "

So if you had exactly an exactly average attractive rating the world's mean sexiness level would remain the exact same. This means you are more attractive than average... and as you say the world would be 100% more sexy this means that you are twice as attractive as the world's mean sexiness level.

Sadly this still means that anyone that is more than twice as attractive than average is less attractive. So while you've improved the mean sexiness rating, you've likely lowered the max sexiness rating as I know there exists people that are well more than twice as attractive than average.

9440,"My husband works for a very large, well known company, and they changed their corporate work environment to be like this. It hasn't made anyone more ""accessible"" and it makes it harder for him to get work done, have private meetings, and to even want to go in to work - he takes most of his morning meetings at home now. 

Nobody has a cubicle, nobody has a desk, everyone is swimming in the ""general work area"" together at tables that hold 5-10 people each. 

It's driven people to work at home more, it increases stress and people-fatigue, and it's harder to concentrate. There are meetings rooms, but they have to be booked ahead of time, and can't be used for ""unofficial"" meetings - like work groups. There are ""private"" phone call rooms, but they have no windows, very cramped, and they also have to be assigned ahead of time - you can't use them just to get some privacy. 

It was much better before when the directors had offices with a mandatory open door policy (if not in a meeting, the door is open). It was casual, and people stepped in and out all the time. Very accessible. Lots of open spaces to work for those who wanted to stretch out. Offices were right next to the set of cubicles. Lots of personalization of spaces. Husband's crew even covered his office in aluminum foil one time he was out of town. It's changed the whole environment from happy and fun to solemn and people always looking for a way to get some privacy and a sense of attachment to the place.

9494,"Something similar happened to one of my professors. The college I went to was a top 10 school, and these professors were top of their field etc. 

However, this school is also somewhat notorious for students skipping class. Obviously in college no one really forces you to go to class, but I think a lot of students (myself included) felt justified because ""we're smart, and we learn better outside of class"" (not true for the vast majority of us). So it really wasn't uncommon to see at least half the class absent on any given day. We all got used to it, or so I thought.

My typical routine was to hand in my homework early (~5-10 minutes before class started) and duck out. However, I was running late and class was starting. I looked around the room, only the professor and 4 students were there (out of like 20+ enrolled). I felt bad and stuck around. 

Few minutes later, another student comes in, drops off his homework, turns around and heads for the door. The professor calls to him and asks ""Where do you need to be?"". Everyone was surprised by this, since we're all used to this charade at this point... the student was equally surprised and didn't know what to say, so he was just silent looking like a deer caught in headlights. Professor: ""What's more important than my class right now? What can't wait?"". The student started stammering out excuses and ambiguous mumbling. He then looked down and decided to just take a seat. 

At that point, I decided to always attend this particular class and at least make an effort for my other classes. I never fully got rid of my skipping habit, but this particular incident made me realize that despite all the successes of these professors - they do notice and certainly do care, at least sometimes.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So, Johnny and his girl Sally are going to prom this Saturday. But, before they can go, Johnny needs to make sure they have a perfect night.

So, Friday comes, and Johnny goes out to get his tuxedo. When he gets to the tux rental store, there's this ridiculously long line. But he needs the tux, so Johnny waits. And he waits, and waits until finally, he has his tux.

Next, he needs a limo. So he goes to the limousine rental shop and finds that there's an even longer line there. But he needs the limo, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he has the limo ordered.

Johnny realizes he needs some new kicks, so he stops by a shoe store to get himself some nice shoes. When he goes to pay, he sees the longest line yet. But he needs the shoes, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he's got his new shoes.

Saturday, Johnny's ready to pick up his girl. He drives over to her house, picks her up, and they head to prom. At the dance, they're having a great time, dancing, playing at the casino, hanging out with friends. Soon, though, Sally gets thirsty, and asks Johnny for a drink. Being the good guy he is, Johnny obliges.

So Johnny walks over to the punch table, and what do you know... there's no punch line."

They frequently told her that there was no way she'd ever ""succeed"" now and that her dad wanted to kill me. 7 years later we are still married, our son is amazing and we both have college degrees and make a fuck ton of money.

I can't believe she still speaks to them. I will always look at them and remember all the stories she told me about them when we were kids. It's hard for me to overlook any of that despite all they do to make up for it.

9524,"[The murder of Dorothy Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Dorothy_Jane_Scott)

&gt;Dorothy Scott was a 32-year-old single mother who had taken up karate and considered buying a handgun after getting repeated, anonymous calls from a stalker in 1980. The caller would profess everything from how much he loved her to unutterable and horrific violence, sprinkling in details about her day-to-day life that he could only know if he was following her.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;One May evening in 1980 after taking a co-worker to the hospital, Scott left to pull her car around. Her coworkers, soon after, watched her car speed away from the parking lot without stopping. Several hours later, and 10 miles away from where she was last seen, her car appeared in an alley on fire‚Äîwith no trace of Scott.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;A week after her disappearance, Scott‚Äôs mother received a call from the same voice that had been haunting her daughter. ‚ÄúAre you related to Dorothy Scott?‚Äù he asked. When Scott‚Äôs mother responded yes, the caller stated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got her‚Äù before hanging up. Similar ominous calls continued, each time the voice admitting he ‚Äúhad her.‚Äù At one point, Scott‚Äôs abductor even called a radio station to confess details about Dorothy‚Äôs last night that hadn‚Äôt been released to the press, while also claiming, ‚ÄúI killed Dorothy Scott. She was my love.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Four years later, in April 1984, the calls stopped abruptly. In August of that year, Scott‚Äôs remains were found by a construction worker in some brush. A week after the bones were identified, Scott‚Äôs mother got two more disturbing calls. ‚ÄúIs Dorothy home?‚Äù the caller asked.¬†

The first time I got in his car and he lit a cigarette I was curious and eager to impress him and asked if he could spare one, and in return he asked if I smoked. As a kid desperate to seem cool, I lied. He went along with it and handed me a pack. From then on he brought me a pack every time he picked me up to go on a drive, turning down the cash I offered because he ""knew how much it sucked to be an underage smoker and he didn't want me to worry about getting them from shady people"". 

Fast forward a year and change later and even after I had turned 18 he still brought me a pack every time we went on a drive, saying by then it was a tradition. One day even further down the line while talking about old memories I mentioned how the first time we hung out I lied to try and seem cool, and he tells me he knew from the start but found the way I looked up to him endearing and he wanted to have something in common, eventually continuing it as a staple of our friendship. 

I wouldn't recommend anybody start smoking but knowing he spent hundreds on me, keeping it up even after I could buy my own will always be something I think was sweet, even if ill-advised."

Look, it was so obvious I picked up on it as a naive teen. It didn't hurt that she was beyond fine too, so I got the courage to ask her out. I do it and she says she doesn't want a boyfriend right now so I panic because I thought she was going to say yes. 

I asked her if she had ever watched Armageddon because it was the only thing that I could come up with. She said no so I spoiled the whole movie for her, hoping she would forget I even asked before saying goodbye. Nope. Three days later I try to talk to her like normal and she completely stonewalled me the rest of the semester. I don't think we ever talked again come to think of it."

Self-esteem can take you places, but only when you've hit certain benchmarks in other departments.

People are shallow, especially at first. First impressions are extremely important, and the first thing people notice about you is your appearance. How fit you are, and how good looking you are are typical items 1 and 2 on the docket.

Now, sure. Some people can see past shallow things like that. It's definitely not unheard of. However, with regards to personality, self-esteem is only one part of the puzzle. Intelligence, hobbies, passions, ambitions, compassions, etc ALL influence people's choices, and are all largely independent of self-esteem.

9640,"Worked in several zoos and aquariums over the years, as an aquarist (zookeeper for fish).

- jellyfish tank overflowed in the night, started the day by picking up little jellies off the floor and seeing which of them were still alive

- seahorse daddy gave birth before we could get him into a separate tank; teeny tiny babies (grain of rice size) were sucked into the filter. It was really sad. :( I spent most of the morning plucking them out of the filter floss (like a loose sponge). Most of them survived that. 

- giant river otter escaped, ran around the aquarium before a coworker trapped it in the restroom. It bit him in the leg. 

- I was diving and got smushed by a manatee that decided it would be fun to body slam me into the floor. I elbowed her in the stomach until she moved. Very eye opening experience. 

- local animal control confiscated hundreds of tiny piranhas (quarter sized) from someone holding them illegally in their private home. They were delivered to us, and it was my job to care for them. I had to transfer them to different tanks as they got bigger; they kept eating each other, no matter how much I fed them. Transferring them (half dollar size), they chewed through all the nets, so I ended up scooping the last few with cups and my bare hands. That was fun. 

- transferred new sharks from a transport truck into the shark tank. That involved picking them up in a sleeve and running them down out of the truck, through double doors, down a hall, up a staircase, and down another hall, over a concrete barrier, and into the water. With a soaking wet, thrashing bull shark. 

- some idiot left a tarp on an area near the dive entrance to the shark tank (different aquarium) and it collected water. The floor there was otherwise a metal grate, water would go through to the floor below. Life support was working on some electrical, and a loose line or something (I don't know what exactly) electrified the water. We found this out when a coworker of mine climbed out of the tank and stepped onto it, and was frozen in place. Her dive buddy threw something at her to knock her off the tarp. She said it only lasted a minute but it was terrifying. 

I used to have so many stories. My mom told me I should write them all down, but I didn't, and now most of them are gone.  It's been almost a decade since I've been working. I don't miss waking up in a panic in the middle of the night, wondering if you left the wrong valve open, but I do miss the animals, and the diving. 

Edit to add: Just remembered another one. 

One place I worked at, there was this massive tank that had to be cleaned every morning. Fish fed, then inside of the glass cleaned of algae, and then scrub the fake corals off. One morning, during the feeding, one of the wobbegong sharks got too excited and snapped at one of the exhibit fish. It happens, nothing you can really do about it, but this time the fish it was trying to eat was too big. The shark was lying on the ground (ambush predator type shark, not swimmy around kind of shark) with half of a fish sticking out of its mouth. I was in the water, about to clean the glass, when my manager signals to me to try to get the fish out of the shark's mouth. 

We were about to open for the day, and they couldn't have that on display for everyone to see. So I grabbed the fish being eaten, held its tail, and tried to wiggle it out. Nope. I tried to twist it a little. Nope. It wiggles, and I realize I'm in a tug of war with a shark, using a live fish as the rope. 

It was horrible. The shark wouldn't let go. I ended up lifting it into the water and dragging it along behind me, then twisting, then pulling more. Finally it spat out the fish.  

I brought the fish to quarantine. He had a few scratches on him, but he made a full recovery! 

Edit again: remembered another. 

At one of my jobs, I worked in the quarantine building. That was my favorite. I was the only one there most days, but sometimes the vet tech was with me. 

The building didn't have air conditioning, and it was in a coastal city in Texas (I don't want to get more specific than that). This was the summertime. Usually we made do by opening the loading dock door, and sometimes we'd walk around in the big freezer for a few minutes. 

It was a fun job because I didn't have to interact with a single guest. Ever. And I got to take care of all the little things they brought in from the ocean - baby fish found in the seaweed, and rescue turtles and sharks. Most of them were later released, if possible. 

One day, the marine mammal stranding network found a dead baby sperm whale on the beach. They wanted to perform a necropsy (autopsy for animals). There was no place big enough... except at our facility. Middle of July in Texas, no air conditioning in the building. They had it in the bed of a truck in our loading area. The smell wasn't actually that bad, as it was fresh. It was awesome to have front row seats to a necropsy I otherwise never ever would have been able to see. I got to watch the whole thing as I walked past every 5 minutes, doing my regular job. That was cool. 

Another necropsy, not cool at all - someone in the main aquarium found a catfish that had been dead for several days, and somehow had been tucked under part of the exhibit (which is why they didn't find him). I had the lovely task (/s) of doing the necropsy. 

I don't get the point of it. It was severely bloated, skin rotting off, nothing to even make out among the mess of decaying organs and flesh. The smell was the worst. We had all the fans going, trying to move air out of the room, but it didn't really do anything. 

The worst part was when I cut it open. It appeared to be a fish the size of a small bean bag chair. We did not know that most of that was air, trapped inside its body. When my scalpel cut into its skin, a massive fish fart filled with decayed juice landed on my hand and face. The vet tech called it there. That was the worst thing I experienced, smell wise. "

This didn‚Äôt end there though, one day he lost it himself and told the school that if it wasn‚Äôt found he would have a dirty protest... he shit all over the toilets, smearing his shit in all the toilet stalls, taps and walls. Left a trail from the boys toilets on second floor down to the toilets on first floor. 

His mum finally got called in over this kids mental health and she said it was doing him no harm having an imaginary item and if we wasn‚Äôt willing to support him with it then she would get the local councillors in and take it ‚Äúnational‚Äù. 

Thing was, he was already in the special needs group and got extra help/attention. 

Lucky me got paired with him on a school trip to France as I typically had the patience to deal with him but on this trip he actually managed to buy an actual (100% real obviously) sonic screwdriver and he proceeded to hit me with it AND poke me none stop with the invisible one (his finger) and I lost it and threw his newly bought one in a river in Normandy. 
Didn‚Äôt speak to me for the rest of the trip and after when we got back to school. 

Edit - I still see him and have kept in contact with him over social media. He works in a ‚Äúgame workstation‚Äù (think comic book store). He‚Äôs grown out of his make believe sonic screwdriver and laughs about it now but he‚Äôs still not a full penny - which he says about himself.

9697,"I had a girl come into my room and try to have sex with me when I was passed out drunk. 

Didn't even find out it until a long time after it happened. I found out through my girlfriend at the time, when she got upset because she found out a close friend of mine and I had sex and I never told her about it. She then started asking about other girls I hooked up with that we hung out with and I told her that she was the only one. That‚Äôs when she said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me, what about ____?‚Äù I seriously had no idea what she was talking about and then she told me the story.

She heard about it before we started dating, because they were friends. Apparently, one day the two of them and another friend were on a porch swing that was in the middle of our quad. They saw me walking to the cafeteria and my girlfriend made a comment about how she thought I was attractive. That‚Äôs when the other girl started almost bragging about when she went to my room to hook up with me in my room and she started giving me a blowjob, but left because she couldn‚Äôt get me to stay hard.

The way she told it made it seem like I wanted it and just had ‚Äúwhiskey dick,‚Äù but the truth is that I have no memory of this happening and would have never wanted to have sex with her. I did not find this girl attractive at all, in fact I found her pretty annoying. Creeps me out thinking about it and the fact that she possibly could have done it to more people, because I had definitely seen her all over really drunk guys at parties.

My girlfriend was really understanding about the whole thing (she had someone try to force himself on her during he first semester) and apologized that it had happened to me. I never told anyone at the school about it because I felt like they wouldnt really do anything it anyway. I don't really have any sort of psychological trauma from it, just a sort of feeling of really being violated. Like it wasn't like I brought this girl back when I was drunk, she came into my room when I was passed out and tried to have sex with me.

I open my window to try to calm the dogs and see what's going on and there's an arm visible on the other side of my gate in the front of my house. Apparently somebody was trying, or just tried, or succeeded to enter my backyard for I have no idea what reason and was leaving. I yelled something but couldn't make out the reply. 

I went to my gun and headed back to the window where I saw him, then the front door to see if I could see anyone, then locked and checked the backyard and brought my dogs inside. Nothing. As I'm looking around doing all this I called the police. Police came, I let them know what had happened (no need to mention guns I had felt clear that anybody was gone at that point) and I even talked to some of my neighbors saying it was strange somebody seemed to be trying to go into my backyard. 

Well, I have cameras and had one still image of the guy. Cops found him a few blocks over, a meter reader for the gas company.

Right there in front of both of our spouses! Just a bunch of stupid incidences like that... and what turned me off to the whole thing was the time she came to me one afternoon questioning me as to why her husband was always coming on to me or trying to be near me and things like that. I told her basically 'that I don't dress in a revealing way. I don't wear low cut shirts and short shorts. It's jeans and a t-shirt and that I love her and her kids and I wouldn't do that. I put NO extra effort into getting his attention.' It seemed like that was enough for her at the time but I noticed that she kept an eye on me and she was more and more distant. Every once in a while she would accuse me again or ask me another question like that. I got tired of telling her all the time that I have never slept with her husband nor have I ever tried to. I eventually stopped visiting altogether after my husband and I split up. 

As an aside, the last time I saw my husband before he went back to his home state he asked me if I ever slept with her husband. I told him 'no' but he said everyone (our large circle of friends) thinks we did. "

He would butt into conversations, was rude, and acted like he owned me just because we sat next to each other.  Everyone took our breaks together.  He would push my friends out of the way to sit next to me on break.  Every day he would try to buy me lunch.  I would refuse because I had my own money and I didn't want to owe him.  Then he started bringing me little gifts like a single flower.  I wouldn't take them.  He kept pressuring me to go out with him.

My life went up and down on my way to adulthood. I became suicidal at age 8. While running away drastically improved my sense of hope, depression has become my resting state. I struggled with PTSD, nightmares, and seemingly random bouts of agoraphobia and mutism. I tried drugs, got way too drunk, couldn't set down roots, isolated myself, feared relationships, couldn't or avoided sleep, job hopped, joined the military...

I was extremely lucky to have stumbled upon people who were patient enough to love me and mature enough to teach by example. I am well off now. I have people who I love, and who love me. I have financial security. I am blessed with extensive opportunity. Even to this day, decades later, I feel like the torture I endured as a kid prepared me for the real world. Life feels like it's on easy mode in comparison. 

I'm still gripped with depression and PTSD, however it's much more manageable these days. I do have cancer, but I don't weigh it as terribly as most people do. Death is far from the worst thing in the world. I can't seem to keep roots down. I buy property with the intention of calling it home, but find myself moving and renting it out a few months/years later. I still feel my safety is at risk. I lucked into building my career and creating a new identity means giving up this entire life.

9869,"The world is controlled from the shadows by a secret cabal of Owls. Sounds crazy, right?

WELL LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS.

Owls are birds from the order known as Strigiformes, while true owls are apart of the family strigidae. The prefix 'strigi-' comes from the Latin ""strix"" which means 'owl'. Now, the word Owl is based on accounts of ancient peoples saying the sound an owl makes sounds like ""owl"". The sound we know nowadays to be ""Who"". 

ARE YOU STILL WITH ME? 

In most European mythology, owls are birds that represent wisdom, while in many other cultures worldwide they are also associated with death and protection. What in this world blends wisdom with protection and aspects of death? That's right, doctors. What organization is full of doctors? Yup. The World Health Organization. WHO.

BUT THE RABBIT HOLE GOES DEEPER

Owls are nocturnal animals with binocular vision, their ability to see at night is unmatched. Nothing in the shadows can escape the notice of an owl. This with their knack for wisdom invokes the idea of enlightenment, wisdom and the search for knowledge in dark places. Enlightenment is analogous to illumination in certain respects. This was a philosophy among members of the Bavarian Illuminati, a secret society founded in 1776 that many believe are the true masters but the strings don't end there, my friends.

The Bavarian Illuminati was eventually banned by decree (along with all secret societies) by Prince-Elector and Duke of Bavaria Karl Theodore. Karl Theodore would eventually acquire a celebrated secretary by the name of Cosimo Alessandro Collini, an Italian noble. Cosimo had one other famed patron before Karl, however. French philosopher Voltaire.

HERE'S WHERE THINGS GET REAL

Voltaire had it out for the Bavarian brand of enlightenment and shared his views with Cosimo. When Cosimo was hired by Karl, he plotted with Voltaire how to best eliminate the secret society. The idea would come to Cosimo years later when he became the director of the Mannheim Cabinet of Natural History. It's here he secretly delved into the history of owls... and the owls whispered in the ears of Cosimo. With Voltaire's blessing, Cosimo and his owl allies convinced Karl Theodore to outlaw secret societies. Using ancient pagan rites they were able to hypnotize Karl to enact this ban when he heard a secret word that Voltaire chose: hibou. The French word for 'owl'. This becomes important soon.

In 1806, Cosimo supposedly died. In reality, he was secretly sent to America to begin the strigian infiltration of the fledgling United States by the will of his owl overlords who were now fully in control from the shadows. Cosimo began a lineage of owl-worshipers who would eventually migrate west to California in the mid 1800s. 

NOW HERE'S THE RUB

One of these descendants traveled to San Francisco where they befriended an actor named Henry Edwards - the founder of the infamous Bohemian Grove. Through the clubs establishment in the late 1800s, Henry was manipulated into introducing owls into the clubs mythology through its iconic logo. From there, the annual meetings became the breeding grounds for rituals that would invoke the spirit of their unknown masters. The will of the owls came after many rituals, resulting in the UN's founding of a new world organization in 1948: WHO. The World Health Organization.

But the Owl elites know the WHO by another name... the World Hibou Order. Using the greatest minds in the world, owls manipulated the organization from their ""public mission"" of combating worldwide disease and changing it to the Owls true goal: taking rodent-born diseases from mice and rats and genetically modifying them to be human-hosted illnesses instead. This one-two punch accomplishes these goals: Less humans which means more control, and a near endless supply of disease free, delicious mice to sustain all owls. 

WAKE UP SHEEPLE!

EVER WONDER WHY OUR ANCESTORS HEARD OWL CALLS AS ""OWL"" WHILE WE HEAR ""WHO""? Because owls started to repeat the mantra of their grim organization to spread their manipulations through clever subliminal messaging. 

Each day we stray further from the light and into the wings of our new nocturnal overlords. WHO."

9974,"This happened while I was in high school. It was my friend's party.

Friend A had an abusive girlfriend. We all knew about it and we all tried to convince him to leave her. Easier said than done. The poor guy lived with the girl and her family (not sure how this happened but I wasn't close enough with the guy to ask), and she would have made his life hell if he dumped her. For some reason she DESPISED us. We'd never met the girl before, but she was insanely jealous of the fact that her boyfriend hung out with other girls, and she would shit-talk us in private, and call him every day at lunch (with long periods of awkward silence because neither of them had anything to say to each other), and scream at him if he tried to hang up. She did this minimise the time he was able to spend with other girls. No matter what we said or did, we couldn't help him.

One year, Friend B hosted a halloween party. Friend B is a girl and she though it would be a good idea to invite Friend A's girlfriend too, so we might have the opportunity to get to know each other, and ease this weird rivalry. Boy, did that work well.

GF refused to speak to any of us. She wouldn't smile or laugh or even drink to keep herself entertained. Instead, she held her boyfriend's arm in a tight grip for the first half of the night so he couldn't leave her, and stared tight-lipped at the rest of us. We tried to talk to her but she was so rude and blunt that she scared a lot of us off. Friend A was miserable.

But, thank God, partway through the night, Friend A escaped. When he finally broke free, he had a blast, laughing and joining in with the rest of us.

GF didn't like that.

Partway through the night, GF stomped up to Friend A and slapped him - in full view of the ENTIRE GROUP. She thought he had left her alone for too long and she was pissed. They left shortly afterwards.

I didn't hear about it until the next day (I think I was inside at the time), but everyone was FURIOUS.

GF, if you're reading this, you're a disgusting cunt of a person, and you never deserved him anyway. I can see why you needed to sink your teeth into him all the time - you knew he was too good for you. Sort your shit out."

Later she actually did invite me to her schools homecoming dance. We had a nice dinner together then went to the dance. Unfortunately, girls these days seem to be more into dancing with other girls rather than their actual dates, so that was kind of depressing to us guys that were there. I was able to do all the slow dances with her though, and we got pretty close during those. I kissed her on the cheek during one and she giggled, so I think we were both having a good time.

Unfortunately she dumped me a few months later when we were chatting on the phone and she asked me if I went to church. I'm not a religious person at all, so I just told her that it wasn't for me. Apparently she wanted a super religious guy that loved Jesus like she did so, so that was that."

10059,"I went to school with a guy who was rumored to be gang affiliated, for the sake of the story we‚Äôll call him Jay. I didn‚Äôt believe them at first because the guy was a total clown. However, around the time 8th grade started, Jay started writing really creepy poetry in our literature class. Lots of cryptic references to gun violence, death, etc. His personality also started changing. Jay was really hostile towards other students, disobedient in class, and started getting into fights outside of school. It was very disturbing but amazingly enough, none of my teachers ever talked to him about the content of his work, his behavior, or brought it up to his parents. I wish they had because maybe they could‚Äôve gotten him help before it was too late. 

Eventually we graduated and I didn‚Äôt see him anymore. 10 years later, I see his face plastered all over the local news. As it turns out, he was in fact a gang member and was wanted for shooting a man to death outside of local park in downtown. Jay turned himself in 12 hours after the shooting. The truly sad part is that Jay didn‚Äôt even killed his intended target, he got him mixed up with an innocent man who was cutting through the park to get home. It was unbelievably tragic. The guy Jay killed was a recent college graduate with a wife and 2 kids. This man had his whole life ahead of him and it got taken away from him because of some stupid gang bullshit that had nothing to do with him. 

If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, there was actually a string of similar murders (about 17) that occurred in the months prior the shooting.  All of the previous murders played out similarly. Late at night, in secluded areas, and all victims were killed via drive by shooting. Jay and his crew are currently the prime suspects in all of these murders. Last I heard they were all in custody and awaiting trial. I hope they all get put away for life. 

Edit: Realized I didn‚Äôt answer the second part of he question. I was shocked by the news but I wasn‚Äôt surprised that this is how Jay‚Äôs life turned out. The signs were all there, unfortunately they went ignored by all the important people. However I am saddened that his poor life choices resulted in the death of an innocent man and ruined so many lives. "

10171,"There was this girl in my high school who always seemed a little off. One day in English class, she ran out of the room crying and freaking the fuck out. Two of her friends followed. The teacher was like, ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù And one of the friends came back saying her dad was rushed to the hospital due to his cancer coming back or something. We all understood and told her to send our love to her, etc. 

So this happened in October-ish. Her friends knew about her dads cancer long before, but obviously the rest of us didn‚Äôt. 


I started to get to know the girl since we had nearly every class together and she ended up opening up to me about how hard it is to watch her father go through this, etc. 

Cut to May, I‚Äôm inviting people to my sweet 16. I invited her, but he declined because she needed to take a week or so off school to be with her dad since they were told he barely had a day left. I obviously understood and told her I‚Äôm here for her if she needs anyone, etc etc. 

Cut to June (almost done with the school year) and this girl is in the hallway having a total freak out. I rushed to her and her close friends thinking the obvious had happened... and that‚Äôs when one of her friends pulled me aside and told me the entire thing was a lie. The school let her have tons of time off considering the circumstances. And it was all a lie, she didn‚Äôt even come to a party to really sell the point. 

Everyone was like, ‚Äúwtf.‚Äù  She went to some serious therapy that summer because she clearly needed it. I hope she‚Äôs better now. 

TL;DR: girl in my school convinced everyone (as well as the school) for well over a year that her dad was dying from cancer. Made the whole thing up.

10180,"For me personally, it was long term therapy.  Confronting, processing, and releasing emotions in a safe, protective environment has made me much more capable of doing so in real time.  I grew up with an alcoholic parent.  I didn't deal with it in real time (because how can a child do that?) and so I had to deal with it later.  ""Dealing with it"" is like a workout for your emotions.  So confronting the false beliefs (""My parent doesn't care about me, I'm not a worthwhile person, if I was a good person my parent wouldn't drink and be emotionally abusive, etc."") is developing the skills needed to process new traumatic events as they unfold.  When I was younger I had a traumatic event in a hospital, and it took years to really understand how it affected me.  And because I didn't process it at the time because I lacked the ability, I had to deal with it later when I was facing other hospital experiences (childbirth).  So the resiliency comes into play when you know how to handle the new traumatic experiences we all face in life.  Because you've done it before, you know how to handle it now.  It doesn't mean it's not hard, and it doesn't mean you don't deal with it in an ongoing way,  but for me, it doesn't lay down new neural paths that I'll have to work on years later.  

As an example: 3 years ago I had a traumatic pregnancy loss.  Lots of hospital stays, my life was at risk, and it took over a year to become pregnant again.  Because of that loss, I had a lot of anxiety about my pregnancy and now child.  Instead of that festering, I can look at those emotions, say well of course I feel like this, because of the loss, and just mindfully let it pass without further traumatizing me.  

There's a lot of evidence (at least in my opinion) that resiliency is a higher level process, like you're not going to work on resiliency unless other base level needs are met.  Which is why it's not that common: if you're worried about your child eating and having a roof over their head, you don't have the time or bandwidth to figure out how to not fall into the same disruptive behavioral patterns you learned as a child.  BUT if you have the ability and the time, therapy is a huge tool to help develop resiliency."

10182,"Ah, now, that just shows the reach of the PTL. The Pokeball containment and distribution network is so ubiquitous that even criminals have to use it. There's no way to override the automated 7th 'mon recovery system. So they couldn't carry more than 6 pokemon if they tried.

As for 1 on 1 battling, that again is restricted by the same system. In a combat situation, pokeballs will not activate in 'Go' mode if a Pokemon is already active. It's the same system that stops you using pokeballs to catch other trainers pokemon. All pokeballs are connected to a global network that monitors battles and trainers, ensuring adherence to PTL guidelines.

They have relaxed these regulations in recent years, allowing for double and even triple battles, but there are still those who think PTL oversight is still too far reaching and more freedoms need to be granted to trainers"

THE MOLA MOLA FISH (OR OCEAN SUNFISH)

They are the world's largest boney fish, weighing up to 5,000 pounds. And since they have very little girth, that just makes them these absolutely giant fucking dinner plates that God must have accidentally dropped while washing dishes one day and shrugged his shoulders at because no one could have imagined this would happen. AND WITH NO PURPOSE. EVERY POUND OF THAT IS A WASTED POUND AND EVERY FOOT OF IT (10 FT BY 14 FT) IS WASTED SPACE.

They are so completely useless that scientists even debate about how they move. They have little control other than some minor wiggling. Some say they must just push water out of their mouths for direction (?????). They COULD use their back fin EXCEPT GUESS WHAT IT DOESNT FUCKING GROW. It just continually folds in on itself, so the freaking cells are being made, this piece of floating garbage just doesn't put them where they need to fucking go.

So they don't have swim bladders. You know, the one thing that every fish has to make sure it doesn't just sink to the bottom of the ocean when they stop moving and can stay the right side up. This creature. That can barely move to begin with. Can never stop its continuous tour of idiocy across the ocean or it'll fucking sink. EXCEPT. EXCEPT. When they get stuck on top of the water! Which happens frequently! Because without the whole swim bladder thing, if the ocean pushes over THE THINNEST BUT LARGEST MOST TOPPLE-ABLE FISH ON THE PLANET, shit outta luck! There is no creature on this earth that needs a swim bladder more than this spit in the face of nature, AND YET. Some scientists have speculated that when they do that, they are absorbing energy from the sun because no one fucking knows how they manage to get any real energy to begin with. So they need the sun I guess. But good news, when they end up stuck like that, it gives birds a chance to land on their goddamn island of a body and eat the bugs and parasites out of its skin because it's basically a slowly migrating cesspool. Pros and cons.

""If they are so huge, they must at least be decent predators."" No. No. The most dangerous thing about them is, as you may have guessed, their stupidity. They have caused the death of one person before. Because it jumped onto a boat. On a human. And in 2005 it decided to relive its mighty glory days and do it again, this time landing on a four-year-old boy. Luckily Byron sustained no injuries. Way to go, fish. Great job.

They mostly only eat jellyfish because of course they do, they could only eat something that has no brain and a possibility of drifting into their mouths I guess. Everything they do eat has almost zero nutritional value and because it's so stupidly fucking big, it has to eat a ton of the almost no nutritional value stuff to stay alive. Dumb. See that ridiculous open mouth? (This is actually why this is my favorite picture of one, and I have had it saved to my phone for three years) ""Oh no! What could have happened! How could this be!"" Do not let that expression fool you, they just don't have the goddamn ability to close their mouths because their teeth are fused together, and ya know what, it is good it floats around with such a clueless expression on its face, because it is in fact clueless as all fuck.

They do SOMETIMES get eaten though. BUT HARDLY. No animal truly uses them as a food source, but instead (which has lead us to said photo) will usually just maim the fuck out of them for kicks. Seals have been seen playing with their fins like frisbees. Probably the most useful thing to ever come from them.

""Wow, you raise some good points here, this fish truly is proof that God has abandoned us."" Yes, thank you. ""But if they're so bad at literally everything, why haven't they gone extinct."" Great question.

BECAUSE THIS THING IS SO WORTHLESS IT DOESNT REALIZE IT SHOULD NOT EXIST. IT IS SO UNAWARE OF LITERALLY FUCKING EVERYTHING THAT IT DOESNT REALIZE THAT IT'S DOING MAYBE THE WORST FUCKING JOB OF BEING A FISH, OR DEBATABLY THE WORST JOB OF BEING A CLUSTER OF CELLS THAN ANY OTHER CLUSTER OF CELLS. SO WHAT DOES IT DO? IT LAYS THE MOST EGGS OUT OF EVERYTHING. Besides some bugs, there are some ants and stuff that'll lay more. IT WILL LAY 300 MILLION EGGS AT ONE TIME. 300,000,000. IT SURVIVES BECAUSE IT WOULD BE STATISTICALLY IMPROBABLE, DARE I SAY IMPOSSIBLE, THAT THERE WOULDNT BE AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE 300,000,000 (that is EACH time they lay eggs) LEFT SURVIVING AT THE END OF THE DAY.

And this concludes why I hate the fuck out of this complete failure of evolution, the Ocean Sunfish. If I ever see one, I will throw rocks at it.

‚Äú... Before we went on, I saw Duke Ellington begging - pleading - for a ten-dollar advance. It was really depressing. After that show, I told the guys: 'That's it - we're breaking the band up.' We'd been together in one configuration or another for about five years at that point, and suddenly EVERYTHING looked utterly hopeless to me. If Duke Ellington had to beg some George Wein assistant backstage for ten bucks, what the fuck was I doing with a ten-piece band, trying to play rock and roll - or something that was almost rock and roll?"""

It's their way of figuring out who is easy prey, by initiating abusive behavior and seeing who submits to it. The poor girls who don't know they deserve better are the ones who fall for it. It's revictimization for the convenience and pleasure of the one willing to be cruel. 

It does work, in the way that most abuse 'works'.

10293,"Well, thanks to the dysphoria (that's been with me for as long as I can remember), an extremely strict evangelical christian upbringing (think: earth is 6000 years old, dinosaur bones were planted by the devil to trick us into believing evil scientists, all gays go to hell, etc.  the whole shebang), things for me when I was younger were pretty awful to be honest.  Lifelong severe repression, internalized homophobia and transphobia, self hatred, etc.  I was caught wearing women's clothes when I was 12 and sent to ""conversion therapy"" for the summer, where I successfully lied my ass off and managed to get through it.  When I was sixteen my girlfriend thought it would be a great idea to dress me up and give me a makeover, and of course my dad came home and the shit hit the fan, again.  I attempted suicide when I was 18, and thankfully failed.  After that I was kicked out of my father's house which was, honestly, the best thing for me.  I got better slowly over the years in terms of my depression, but I was still repressing myself and ruining relationship after relationship trying to pretend I  was something I wasn't.  I got divorced a little over a year ago because I have absolutely zero trust and simply can't open up to people - I ruined my marriage because I'm a totally closed book, even to the people closest to me.  Old habits for self preservation.

Recently began going to therapy, finally, and it all came up to the surface.  Even coming clean to my therapist was nightmarishly hard, but I managed it.  After a few more sessions, I came clean to my ex-wife (we actually have a pretty damn great co-parenting relationship and are good friends), and she was just insanely supportive and wonderful about it.  I was terrified, but of course I shouldn't have been.  If I had been able to trust her from the beginning, as I should have because I fell in love with a simply amazing woman, maybe we wouldn't be divorced now.

I'm still working, hard, on learning to be open with people.  Honestly, it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but it's worth it.

Sorry for the wall of text; even anonymously online communication about these issues doesn't come easily to me, so it's kind of a form of exposure therapy and I try to be as completely open and honest as I can.  Well, at least without doxxing myself."

My phone kept locking up so I gave her the password so she wouldn't have to have me unlock it every time. 

Well she and her husband spent the night, and we were sitting around watching tv after breakfast and I seen everyone on their phone. So naturally I was wanting to get on my phone and play around. I couldn't find my phone. I asked everyone if they had seen it. Pregnant girl says ""oh. I have it. I'm just browsing the internet. My phone is dead""

.....you are touching my phone without asking because you know the password now? I would have rather her go through my underwear drawer. Nowadays phones are almost sacred.

Oh and same girl, same day... I was making breakfast. A nice big breakfast like I always do when friends stay over. Eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and biscuits. Halfway through me cooking, she opens the cupboard and was like ""do you mind if I get me some cereal?""

Both times her husband gave her the death glare. And apologized profusely to me.

Edit to add: the woman specifically requested that breakfast from me. Everyone else wanted something simple. I got halfway through cooking and like she always does when I go out of my way for her, she changed her mind and decided she wanted cereal instead. Her husband made her at least eat some of the food when it was finished, after she ate the cereal because he was so mad at her."

**3. Being squished in the middle seat for everything.** It makes me feel useful though, so maybe it's not *tooo* bad haha. 

**4. People trying to put you down for being thin.** It's mostly only women saying this but other it'll be passive stuff like ""You're too skinny!"" or ""Maybe one day you'll fill out"" but there's always a little dig under the concern. 

**5. Being told to eat more.** 

**6. Getting plate shy.** I'll overload my plate so people see that I eat, though I'm not a big eater anyway. On the other side of that when I don't *clean* my plat I hide it under a napkin or another plate so people don't complain when I don't eat everything on it.

**7. Getting asked if you diet** (I don't). **Or if you have an eating disorder.** I love the way I look but I would probably ask myself that tbh.... I'm small y'all. 

8**. Not having enough calories or strength to do normal things.** I don't know what it is but I get a sort of muscle fatigue when I go too long without eating then my body cramps up or I pull muscles easily.

**9. BEING TOLD TO EAT MORE!** Oh I said that already? Oops 

**10. Not being able to complain about it.** I have absolutely no business telling people any of these points because being thin is being seen as good. It's like a pretty person complaining about being pretty; it's legitimate for them but a joke for everyone else.

Had a friend group of guys that I still consider brothers to this day. The youngest of us was actually a little cousin of my best friend and had been talking to this girl from another school. Well, turned out she had a boyfriend and he found out and had started sending threatening messages to the little cousin. We were all hot heads and angry teens, but we honestly didn't take it seriously enough and just laughed it off, told our buddy to leave the girl alone and that she wansn't worth it, and to just move on. He agreed - or so we thought.   


A few weeks later we arrive to our Wednesday night youth church service ( you were required to go at least once a month, it counted towards our grades. At the time I still cared about my school work and would go, however we all were just on our phones and in the back the entire time. ) As we get there, the four or five of us, we hear a shout from across the parking lot. It's the boyfriend, along with a handful of cars and about thirteen kids in total. Suddenly it became very real to us. They approach, but I guess they weren't prepared to instigate anything considering how populated it was and we just let the two talk it out because there was no reason for this to turn into some Outsiders scene. The talk went poorly, the cousin returned and told us that upon leaving, there'd be a fight. We walked there, and we were all too prideful to alert the church, parents, or authorities. We'd hadle this ourselves - this was our first mistake. 

Little background, we weren't necessarily the popular kids, but we were loved by all and had few enemies. So each of us sent a few messages around as well as checked in to see if any of our friends outside of the school might want to come assist. I messaged three or four, as did the rest of us. Now, I know the assumption of this being a church school probably leads you all to believe that it's some high matienance, uniform, or otherwise privledged school. We weren't a public school, however we weren't all that. In fact, it was the only private school in town the would accept previously expelled students, including yours truly ( Freshman year was rough. )  


So, our friend group isn't just church goers. My best friends at the time were two, 6'4 + twins who wrestled all through school, and my other calls for help went out to some stoners I smoked with, and some various misfits. One of the other guys and myself had a mutual friend who had been in his fair share of scraps and we asked him as well. Now, what happened next was about an hour of 'The Phone Game'. For those of you unaware, this is where you call someone and tell them something, they call the next, and the next and so on. The game however is how accurate the information stays when reaching the next person, of which it did not.   


This mutual friend, 'D' for the sake of reading, had two older brothers who were ex cons. I can't remember if they were under the assumption that this beef was involved D or not, but it was enough to convince them to also sound the horn and collect their own adult, gang related brothers in arms. This also happened with the stoners, and just about every head in count that we'd reached out to. Like Rohan arriving in the hour of need, this web upon web of unrelated heathens, thugs, stoners, metal heads, athletes, and army hopefuls were suddenly appearing in the parking lot of this unaware church. It was like if 'The Warriors' and 'The Breakfast Club' had a love child.   


People are patrolling, asking random attendees where is this person and that person, they're here to see them. The staff began to pick up on something. There's way more people here than ordinary just wandering halls and collecting in groups and that a good majority of them are not students - or even teenagers. At some point, they'd confronted the angry boyfriend and his club and scared the piss out of them because they all jumped in their cars and left. The problem? We now have a small malitia roaming for a fight in and outside of a church + school. Holy fuck.   


Things start going south. There no longer is a common enemy, and without orginaization everyone began to make assumptions about who they were here to fight. Gang signs are being tossed up, threats are made, chests are being pushed and the whole place reeks of dank kush. The staff and unrelated kids in attandence are now aware that the fan is covered in shit and they are in the middle of a potential brawl. Cops are called, kids are taking off in all directions. There is still infighting and people are even being arrested at this point. Things have gone to hell.   


Another hour has passed and my group has now been discovered to blame. Those they had managed to catch and question had divulged mostly that they were here because of us. We would later learn between talking amongst ourselves and the police that it was roughly estimated that anywhere between 65 and 80 people had shown up for this ultimate showdown. So we were questioned, some severe dicipline was dished out, and we weren't allowed to attend for a long while after. Not expelled though! "

1. You cannot extract as much liquid from the grapes
2. You cannot as easily extract the non-liquid part for disposal
3. It's cheaper in the long run
4. There's fewer impurities in the wine

**Source:** You can do a wine tour with John from McLeod's Wine Tours in Margaret River and visit the Margaret River Providore during their one day trip.  They'll take you to the back area and you can stand next to a hydraulic press that they use to extract the wine."
10401,"So we have a raven at our zoo. Ravens are very, very smart, but temperamental. 

She is trained to do certain commands for food, and one of them is ""pet"". She will lower her head and let you stroke her for a few minutes, then she gets a treat. 

Generally, our staff (and all zoo staff, really) are very competent and common-sense. And even in this case, the lady was more than capable of caring for the animals, but just loved them .... a little too much.

Coworker comes in, greets the raven and asks to pet. Pets the raven and coos  to her ... then turns away to start cleaning.

WELL. Raven was not pleased, and, after realizing what happened, jumps on the coworker's back and rips a huge hunk of her scalp off.

This same raven was removed from exhibit after throwing rocks at the neighboring animals, and luring wild birds into her enclosure and torturing them to death in front of visitors. "

10410,"I have attended a lot of weddings for friends and family. The most awkward thing I have ever seen was having a wedding singer during the ceremony. Picture the bride, groom, priest and 6 wedding party people all standing up there silent and immobile, trapped while some guy sings several entire uncut 70s or 80s love ballad in between each part of the dearly beloved.. kiss the bride portion of the wedding. It was an outdoor wedding and already pretty warm by the time it started. The singer had one external speaker which sounded like shit. There was no dance floor, no one in attendance was feeling these lyrics he was laying down. It was like if you had to sing for the worst audience in the worst circumstances and it was at someone‚Äôs wedding and you were interrupting the main ceremony. The bride and groom had the look of people in regret the entire time.

10533,"I was a 20 yr old guy in the Navy, stationed in Pensacola. I had a fake id, so every weekend me and my buddies would leave base and get a hotel room and some booze and go party.

One weekend we had hit the bars and were back in the room with about 10 guys and girls in our suite. One of the guys, name of Gunn, that was there was outside of our circle, so we didn‚Äôt really know him very well, and he was totally hammered. 

At one point he left our room. Nobody thought much about it until he started banging on our door and then the fire alarm in the hotel went off. Mind you, it was about 3 am at this point, so the faces of the people coming out of their rooms were not happy. They evacuated the entire hotel and called the cops. Turns out our dumbass buddy grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed it into a maintenance closet. The foam from it set off the fire alarms. 

We were all terrified, mainly because we were drunk underage and most of us had eaten some E earlier that night. The military will pretty much automatically piss test you if you‚Äôre involved in an incident, so our budding careers were over.

We held out hope that we could bullshit our way out of it, but all it took was the cops finding our suite covered in beer and liquor bottles and seeing our group of young drunks and they had us. Most of us were super polite, but the guy that caused the trouble was a dick to the cops. One of us rated him out because fuck him, so that plus his attitude got him arrested. The cops called shore patrol and we awaited our fate.

After what felt like forever sitting in the hallway outside our suite with the cops glaring at us, the meanest looking sumbitch I‚Äôve ever seen showed up in dress whites. I‚Äôm talking perfect creases in the uniform, totally shaved head, and a look that made us want to crawl into a hole in the earth. I‚Äôll never forget his name, Petty Officer Hacker. What a perfect name for the guy that‚Äôs gonna end our lives. After he got the cops story he had us stand at attention in the hallway while he absolutely chewed our asses. The cops left and he had us clean the suite and then get into the shore patrol vehicle. 

As we were loading up he looked at us and said, ‚Äúalright you dumbasses, here‚Äôs the story. I know that Gunn did the stupid shit and you all were just having fun. You being respectful to the cops saved your asses. So when we get back to base you have to go in front of the duty chief. None of you say a damn word and try not to breathe out of your mouths. The story is you all were sober as judges and Gunn showed up and caused all the trouble.‚Äù 

We showed up, went in front of the duty chief, kept our mouths shut, and got sent back to our barracks with a warning about hanging out with troublemakers.

Petty Officer Hacker is still my hero."

10547,"Despite the amount of downvotes I‚Äôll probably get, I have to agree with this. I have absolutely no empathy for a rapist, murderer, or anyone who commits violent crimes but I DO want to know how they think. I‚Äôve read books upon books about serial killers not because I idolize them, but it‚Äôs a good way to tap into what serial killers look for in a victim. People who close themselves off to this knowledge are naive. Use what they have to say as a tool to save yourself and others from a tragedy.

When referral sources only send a fax you accept it or you lose the referral. When a doctor that you need to sign an order only knows how to use a fax machine, you send a fax. When a long term care faculty your visiting requires updated patient record be added to the patient chart before you leave their building, but they won‚Äôt let you connect to the network to print, you send a fax.

10597,"I actually remember playing my character as pure evil until that moment. Always the selfish choice, killing people whenever convenient. Keeping Lydia around as a pack mule.

Then after I went HAM on the ice wraiths, allowing fireball to cause mass collateral damage, a dragon showed up and proceeded to take sloppy seconds on Winterhold. More fire. More indiscriminate spellslinging. My evil necromancy/destruction specialist was having the time of his life.

Then the battle ended. I stood by the smoldering skeleton of the dragon and waited for Ms. Sworn-to-Carry-My-Burdens to awkwardly run up and receive the spoils of my victory.

And she didn‚Äôt.

My Winterhold faculty are talking about the battle and trudging back to the college. I‚Äôm searching for my mount and my companion.

I found them both behind the inn, steaming away the last of their residual warmth into the cold air.

At that point I started playing as a selfish evil character with sincere attachment issues. He hates everyone except his followers. Losing them is unacceptable. I still felt like I neeeded to let it happen, not save-scum my way back unless I couldn‚Äôt survive myself.

Eventually I felt comfortable enough to take on another partner. Not just a pack mule, but a friend. J‚ÄôZargo was my snarky sentient housecat wizard buddy. We raided tombs and picked fights and took jobs of questionable morality. I‚Äôd even leave him behind sometimes if I thought a mission was too dangerous.

When I lost J‚ÄôZargo to the Falmer in a dwarven ruin, I grabbed what I could from him, moved him to a respectable position, and ‚Äúcremated‚Äù him with Wall of Flame.

I remained a loner from then until many game-months later, when out of boredom I hired a brigand from the tavern in Whiterun,using this dark elf female I viewed as expendable to assist on a Dark Brotherhood quest to eliminate a traveling Khajiit merchant. I expected to sneak up and kill him while he slept, and leave the mercenary waiting nearby in case of trouble. I placed her atop a nearby ruined wall, snuck up on the sleeping merchant, and did the deed.

I was instantly spotted, and ran. And ran. And ran. I was somehow lost amongst ruined walls and small hills. Eventually the combat music stopped and I found my bearings. I went to find that useless mercenary, and discovered that I hadn‚Äôt made it far, and she was missing.

I hopped off her wall, turned a corner, and witnessed a dark elf goddess, bathed in moonlight, standing at ease, the corpses of the merchant‚Äôs three bodyguards bleeding into the cobblestone surrounding her.

I asked Jenassa to marry me within the week. She agreed, and we made arrangements at the Temple of Mara. Here was a companion who understood violence and darkness, and could help soothe the cry for both in my character‚Äôs suddenly stirring heart.

We arrived at the temple on time, followed by guests - friends and acquaintances. And one former companion.

Lydia.

She sat calmly and watched the ceremony. She left without a word, and I couldn‚Äôt find her outside the temple.

Unsettled, I took Jenassa home to my modest dwelling in Whiterun, not far from where we‚Äôd met. We explored our new life and the world. Sometimes she stayed home and ran her shop I never saw. Other times she accompanied me on shrieking raids of blood and fire.

It was good. Then, one day, I came home to find her seated by our fire. She greeted me warmly. I walked upstairs to sleep.

And ran into Lydia.

She lived here now, with us. She was staying in the guest room.

I spoke with her, but received no answers. I checked her inventory, and it was like a time capsule from my more innocently evil days. Taking an item or two, I quickly handed them back, afraid of what foul taint might have corrupted them in her unnatural presence.

At at that, with my happy hearth crackling below, my wife seemingly oblivious to the abomination she‚Äôd let in, Lydia simply replied:

‚ÄúI  A M  S W O R N  T O  C A R R Y  Y O U R  B U R D E N S.‚Äù

She used vinegar to clean it and found out that a sizable flap of skin was just dangling over her right eye, she walked home with a gaping wound.

Her relatives convinced her that they'll be paying for it and she agreed to go. Doctor stitched her up and checked for any concussion. She gets out and she refuses to buy any of the medical supplies and medicine. She had to go back and have an operation as the wound got infected and she was basically oozing out blood and pus.

She was over 80 years old and the blood loss was too much for her.

As for anyone thinking where this happened, in the Philippines.

The woman was the richest in our neighborhood, she had a huge house and she came from old money, her kids were all successful and would send gifts to her monthly and she was basically a Scrooge, she hired so many caretakers and homemakers, but barely paid them as she added expenses, such as transportation and cleaning supplies cost."

10640,"I think the particular form of laziness that adults often accuse children and teens of is actually pretty rare. Doing nothing is boring to most people, regardless of age. But as a kid, you are used to constantly being told what to do, for example in school, often at the threat of punishment and without any good explanation of why other than perhaps ""it's for your own good."" So a lot of teens are perhaps not used to being given the freedom and responsibility to find their own work, to assess what needs to be done, and then do it for that reason, for its own sake, regardless of rewards and punishments. When engaging in their hobbies, they might seem a lot less ""lazy"", but when put in a situation where there are authority figures and that is a ""serious"" environment, they might just need time to realize this is not like school. The challenges at work arise naturally and require initiative and flexibility, in contrast to the artificial situation in school, and they are not created and put before you by your boss."

I was enjoying a jazz cigarette one evening, flipping channels, when I came across an elderly white man molding a face out of a giant mound of red clay. He said nothing, and had no musical accompaniment.  I watched, transfixed, as the form slowly came into view. An almost simian visage gazed back at me, with a look of dull confusion on its face and a crown of thorns upon its head. At last, as our artist finished slapping the Jesus into his clay, al logo appeared in the bottom right hand corner of my screen. The 700 Club.

10857,"I have drawn only twice, and each time the guy never really saw it, but I was able to give enough of a signal that they needed to back off.

The first time, I was leaving work at closing with some coworkers, all of us women. It was really dark out. They were talking outside of their cars as I was walking to mine. I looked down the staggeringly lit parking lot and noticed a man in a hoodie, hood up, face shaded to the point that I couldn't tell he had one at all. He was zigzagging towards us, walking at alternating speeds. He had gloves on. It wasn't cold. I quickly got in my car and pulled it between him and my other coworkers. They looked at me in surprised as I loudly said, ""Today was crazy, right?!"" I crooked my head back towards the guy behind me, my glock in my hand on my thigh. My coworkers eyes got wide and they wisely ran to their cars. I looked back to see the man had stopped moving or approaching. He stood maybe 100 feet away. He was just staring at us from a face I couldn't see. Then he just ambled away, like nothing had happened.

The second time I was at a gas station. Shitty area of town but not terrible as I grew up near there. I was parked and my then boyfriend, now husband, was pumping gas. He finished and told me he was going to run inside. I was hanging out in the driver's seat, listening to music, when a tall, unsettled man exited one of the stores nearby the gas station in a strip type storefront. He looked at me with eggageration - bending over and peering in the middle of a bright day - and began to side amble my way. He began to pace in front of my car, almost like he was deciding something.  I gave him a hard stare and very obviously grabbed something from my glove box - my glock of course - and placed it on my lap. He stopped pacing and stared me down back, very aware of what I had done. I shook my head very slowly, keeping eye contact. He narrowed his eyes again, peering at me from the side, before turning and walking away at a brisk pace. My husband returned and saw me and quickly asked what happened. I explained, handed him my glock (he's a CCW as well), and unhurridly drove away.

10875,"The buildup to the male orgasm is different than for women. At any point, we can suddenly get too close to finishing. The longer the stimulation goes on without orgasm, the more stable and predictable the buildup will be. We're constantly trying to balance ""not cumming yet"" and ""not holding back so much that it stops feeling good"" ‚Äî if there is no need to hold back, then the whole experience can be focused on pleasure rather than the stress of a balancing act.

This means that it's best to take breaks especially at the start, and pay careful attention to when he's close, and avoid getting too close to the edge unless you want to make him cum. Up until a certain point, the longer he takes to orgasm the better it feels, but after a certain time it becomes numbing and can even be difficult to orgasm. Try to be constantly aware of how close he is, this fluctuates up and down constantly. Basically don't let it go too down, or too up. Often, variety and taking breaks helps. If you keep doing the same thing over and over, it can have a numbing effect.

Make sure he knows when you want him to cum, or if you don't yet want him to cum. A guy will try to hold back, but if you push him over the edge he will come anyway, leading to an unsatisfying orgasm. So make sure he knows your intentions: are you building him up to orgasm? Then make sure he knows so that he can prepare for that and not hold back. Do you not yet want him to cum? Make sure he knows so that he will hold back and expect you to stop in time. Do you want him to cum more than once? Tell him. He may prefer to have one orgasm at the end vs. multiple ones. Personally, the first orgasm is the only one worth having, the rest feel empty and unsatisfying.

Also, the best feeling ever is the part before orgasm. If you go too fast, that part won't last long. So try to figure out when that part is, and slow down just enough to not rush to orgasm, but not too much to fall back either. You can also fall back and then repeat the part before the orgasm as many times as you like. That's like the best feeling ever. It's really nice to get there more than once, and be kept there for a while each time. This also leads to incredible orgasms.

During orgasm, make sure you're not going to let go or stop even for a moment. Be aware of when it's going to happen. It's good to slow down and keep a steady, predictable rhythm just a little bit before orgasm, because it will make it more powerful and last longer.

Personally, I love it when a girl takes control of my orgasms and decides when it's time. Whether she wants to make me cum quickly or keep me on the edge for hours, the best feeling is that she knows which one she wants and doesn't just let it happen randomly whenever it happens. That way not only can I better cooperate and prepare for it, but I also feel like she's in control.

Once I was with a girl and she was playing with me with her hand, and I told her I was close, hinting that she might want to stop. She looked at me straight in the eyes and said ""And?"". She got absolutely covered in cum, and knowing that this was what she wanted made it incredible.

Of course all of this is almost impossible to know unless you communicate with each other."

Medicine does taste shit.

One time my kid fell and split her chin when she was 3-4 years old. We had to go to hospital for a debridement and a stitch.  She was being prepped for  the stitch with a local anaesthetic, and then the freaking nurses lied to her. They said they were putting on a special coat to keep her warm - it was in fact designed to make her immobile. I stupidly went along with it. She immediately noticed something was wrong and completely freaked out. She was traumatized more from this than every other part of the accident. If the nurse had told me first, I'd have spoken to her and she would have been fine with the restraints - just don't lie."

If they sold it, all you need to do is run an analysis of all the pawn shops within 40 miles between 2002-2006 and find the people who worked there during that time. It's probably best if you can ask for their video camera footage during those years and watch for any of the contractors or their family members who might have come in and sold it... Once you find the video of the contractor selling it to the shop, it's simple, continue to watch years worth of footage until you figure out who bought the ring and get Facebook to run a facial recognition scan of the individual.

[u/gudkjon](https://www.reddit.com/user/gudkjon) puts it best by quoting the Oxford dictionary: 

&gt;The word gender has been used since the 14th century as a grammatical term, referring to classes of noun designated as masculine, feminine, or neuter in some languages. The sense denoting biological sex has also been used since the 14th century, but this did not become common until the mid 20th century. Although the words gender and sex are often used interchangeably, they have slightly different connotations; sex tends to refer to biological differences, while gender more often refers to cultural and social differences and sometimes encompasses a broader range of identities than the binary of male and female."

10958,"A decade ago I had a fateful break-fix job.  The job was routine anti-virus, and as was generally the case, the customer wondered how such a thing could happen.  ""Didn't I have anti-virus?"" he asked.

I gave the usual deflecting answer, pointing out that anti-virus is not proof against all viruses, especially if the user engages in high-risk behavior on the internet.

The customer considered my answer for a long moment.  A very long moment.  He'd worked with industrial plastics in poorly ventilated spaces since approximately when industrial plastics became a thing, and his only break from the fumes were to go out back to explore an entirely different sort of chemistry.  Finally he decided he'd like to have an answer because the only thing *he* used the computer for was to type invoices, which had always seemed safe enough.

I poked around in the usual places, looking for something obvious I could point to and get the hell out of there and on to the next customer.  A few porn sites popped up, along with a few other places that were just odd enough to warrant slightly more investigation.  That investigation yielded a folder full of media, both still and moving, and it was obviously porn.  Before giving my final answer, I opened one of the images to confirm and saw a girl, maybe 10 or 11, engaged in a sex act that would have been rather extreme for a seasoned adult.

Alt-F4.  Goddamn sonofabitch ALT-F4!

I excused myself for a smoke and promised I'd be right back.  That I had to buy a pack of smokes was a fine excuse to leave the premises, but it wasn't until I had a pack in hand (Marlboro Menthol 72s) that I had the wherewithol to consider that it wasn't my fault that there was porn, child or otherwise on that computer and thus *I* wouldn't get in trouble for it and, perhaps more importantly, it was *exactly* the sort of porn someone *should* get in trouble for having.

So I called the police.  That phone call turned into an invitation to the station.  That invitation turned into a *six* hour series of interrogations at which point they *finally* agreed that *maybe* someone ought to go and check it out.

It wasn't just electronic media.  Boxes and boxes of photos, tapes, burned DVDs.  Some of it even seemed to be *original*.  

The detective thanked me for reporting and I was sent on my way.  The bureaucratic nightmare seemed to be a fine price to pay for a good deed.

Except the nightmare wasn't over.  Turns out the physical stash was in a crawlspace above the shop where the shop's only other employee lived.  The burnout owner wasn't the culprit, and the case against the employee was beyond damning.  And yet I was called in for another interview, this time with questions such as ""Why did I go looking in random places of a hard drive"" and the like.  The detective was satisfied with my answers and confided that the case was as straightforward as anything he'd ever seen.

The villain's lawyer looked at the long odds and, for whatever reason, decided that he'd finally found a hill worth dying on.  There were interviews, depositions, dangerous letters, all supposing that the burnout or myself were to blame.  My life became a series of constant disruptions, missed work, and money shortages.  When he'd finally exhausted all the options, the trial went to court and I spent *six goddamn days* waiting in a room-shaped room on the off chance I'd need to testify.

In the end, the villain was found guilty, my meager cash reserves were exhausted, and my resolve to do the right thing, shaken.

I've found other things since, questionable only from a workplace appropriate standpoint, and I keep my goddamn mouth shut.  Finding out that the quiet man who dotes on his wife has gigs of hardcore BDSM porn is just an odd thing I know about him, and knowing that an affable older gentleman keeps careful reviews and documentation of various escorts was an amusing surprise.  Unless HR tells me to go looking or I find something actively illegal, I'm not going to die on a hill for your depravity."

Remember when he used to do some crazy shit with MC command blocks, and that animation series with Element?"
10960,"Fairly long, so skip down for the TLDR if you want. 

I'm an ED (Emergency Department) nurse now, but before my training I worked in a nursing/elderly care home. This place was already pretty creepy - an old 3-storey English Manor house that had been converted. The entrance hall looked like something out of The Shining. To add to this the home was being closed down and was mostly empty, with only about 5 residents left on one floor and the power turned off to the top floor.

We had a couple of residents who liked to wander; one in particular with moderate dementia (let's call her Mabel) who was incredibly stealthy - sometimes you'd turn around and she'd be stood behind you, just staring. Hence locked doors in/out of the floor and hourly checks on the residents. And of course, one night shift at around 2am, Mabel isn't in her room when checked... 

To be fair this wasn't anything too far out of the ordinary - as I've said, Mabel liked to wander. So we went through the usual procedure of checking all of the accessible areas. She wasn't in any of the patient's rooms, wasn't in the common areas or the toilets. We were starting to get a little freaked out at this point as we'd covered everywhere she could possibly be.

On a whim we checked all of the doors and found one of them unlocked - this door opened to a single staircase leading to the top floor. The entirely empty and powerless top floor. This place was already pretty creepy, and to top it off we didn't have a torch (this was in 2002, pre-smartphones).

My colleague and I ended up creeping around the entire floor with just her zippo to light the way. We worked our way around almost the entire floor without finding anything. On opening one of the last doors, we were greeted by the sight of an amorphous white shape in the dark, wavering strangely and humming quietly. My colleague screamed and my heart rate jumped to about 150.

It was Mabel. Holding up a net curtain that she'd taken off the window in front of herself and waving it around.

Jesus wept...

TLDR - an elderly dementia patient went missing in a half closed down nursing home. Found her in an empty pitch-black room holding a net curtain up and looking for all the world like a ghost. Saw the funny side but never quite forgave her for that mini-heart attack. "

10974,"High school sweetheart, we were together 4 years. We get into screaming matches over petty things. He laid his hands on me more than once, which left bruises, gave me a bloody nose, and he left holes in walls because he was mad at me. He was controlling, said I couldn't wear makeup and refused to speak to me until I took it off. He dictated what I wore and told me to never wear dresses around him. It was all about his needs (sexually and emotionally) and when I was upset, he wouldn't comfort me; he chose to ignore me to play video games. I had no self esteem because of him and the only nickname he ever called me was ""bitch"". My mental illness made me at an all time low the last six months and his actions did not help. After we broke up, he continued to threaten me and berate me to the point where I had to block him on all social media. He continues to make me feel like I live in constant fear when I'm at work and around the city where we both frequent. 

At the end of the relationship, I met someone a few days before hand. The guy was nice and he made me feel like my life wasn't in shambles. It's been a year now and we just moved into a house together. I like to think that if the events with my ex had never unfolded the way that they did, I wouldn't have met the actual person who I believe is ""the one"". I'm happier and healthier, and my life is on track and actually going somewhere. "
10975,"I used to have a cat who decided I was her person. She would ride around on my shoulders, I would carry her like a baby, she slept curled up against my chest every night. She wanted to be close to me constantly....unless I was singing. She hated that."

10979,"I've been carrying now for for going on two years. While I can't say I have drawn my gun before on a person, I can say it has changed my behavior. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible. Most people have these bizarre fantasies about what CCW holders actually behave like. The vast majority of us fully realize that using a firearm in any capacity will permanently alter the course of our life for the worse. Even if it's in self-defense, your life can still be turned upside down. I carry because I am transgender and thus have a target on my back. I hope I never have to use it, but I want to at least have a fighting chance if I am backed into a corner. Being physically weak, I can't exactly defend myself unarmed. 

I have, on one occasion, swept my house armed. A section of the wall came off and it sounded like someone kicked in the door. Thankfully, that's the only example I have. Even though this was a silly example, I was thankful that I had the option to defend myself if it came down to it in the heat of the moment."

The months after, it sort of became lawless in a sense that nobody could get fired, so whenever they had rude customers come in they just pushed it as far as they could without insulting them. Someone had broken into the place and stole some toys, so they blocked off the main entrance and had everybody use the exit instead with upped security. The prices started sinking lower and lower, soon enough they hit the 40-70% mark and everybody was flooding in to buy things while they still could, or buy things to resell them.

In the last weeks, they pushed everything to the front and closed off the empty areas. Most of the fixtures were gone and the employees were working their asses off to sell what was left.

None of the artist speaks english, only spanish, my friend speaks spanish danish and english.

Anyway, i'm hanging out at the shop eating a kebab or something with my friend. Some guy comes in and want's a tattoo today or tomorrow, my friends is like ""Yeah cool homie the artist will fix you right up. What you want"" and the wants, the number 5 with 2 wings and a crown on top of it with his girlfriends name inside the crown. Me and my friend just look at each other going ""wtf"". My friend starts asking him if he wants angle wings or demon wings, king crown or queen crown all these things, but none of us can wrap our head around the 5, i start to help because the customer and my friend starts to get frustrated and i don't know what the he wants to do with a ""5"" in the middle of everything. My friend gives the customer a piece of paper and tells him ""I know you're not an artist, but try to draw the 5 how you imagine it"" and he draws like a graffiti style 5, okay we get it, you want to be hard in your 5 man gang. My friend goes in the back and explains the idea to the artist in spanish, now i don't know a lot of spanish but when i hear loco and 2 guys laugh uncontrollably, i know it's going to one of those tattoos that is going to well executed, but gives just exactly what the customer wants and nothing else

The customer comes back a few hours later for the tattoo,bringing his gf... It's the most ctrl c+ ctrl v tattoo i've ever seen. I hate it, my friend hates it, the artist is just smiling saying to me in broken english ""New tattoo 3 weeks"". None of it looks pleasing. But the cutomer likes it so whatever. He places it and ask my friend to ask if the name is correctly spelled, it is. Then the artist in the most broken english i've ever heard, in front of the gf ""You sure tattoo? Tattoo is forever!"" and i'm so fucking close to laughing in their face, but i manage to hold it. They finish the tattoo, the customer is happy, my friend and the artist get's paid, i got a good laugh. All good. But my god the tattoo was so unpleasing to look at. It's been 4 weeks now and the guy hasn't come back, i guess he's still together with his gf, but we're all convinced his going to come back wanting a cover up.

11110,"Honestly, people think that it contributes to the sad and depressed, but relationships are more of an emotional drain than just being on your own. The last person I dated was SUPER depressed when we were together, and there was nothing fun about that relationship because neither of us were in a good place to make each other happy when we couldn't even take care of ourselves. It's so much better to go into a relationship as the best you that you can be so that if you break up, you have coping mechanisms to handle it, you don't put all of your dependence on that one other person, you won't be second guessing your self worth in the relationship. Taking care of yourself and finding your inner confidence is what makes you attractive to other people. Do what is best for you first, so you can actually enjoy the end result of eventually being in a relationship! "

11129,"I'm a little late, but hopefully someone will find this useful. Here are some bullet points, but they are not by any means exhaustive and instead of a mixture of theories in the field and my own experience.

I recently lost an old friend to suicide and I work in mental health where I assess risk routinely. It's incredibly hard to spot when it is out of context, but my advice based on my career and my experience would be to notice the following;

* Cutting off contact for no apparent reason.
* Attempting contact after a period of no contact.
* Upheaval in their life (calamity with job, relationship, health or finance) 

If any of those things are going on, I'd encourage people to just ask, ""Hey I noticed XYZ, are you okay?"" They may tell you the truth, they may brush it off. But asking can be powerful. Whatever their answer don't judge or push, people who are having suicidal thoughts already feel worthless and they don't need help making that worse.

**In relation to suicidal behaviour, there are risk factors to consider.**

* Suicidal thinking i.e. ""I'm better off dead.""
* Suicidal plans, i.e. collecting pills, buying rope, etc
* Hopelessness, a feeling things will never get better
* Feeling burdensome upon others
* Acquired capability i.e. Working or experience situations that de-sensitize us to physical harm and death, such as Doctors, nurses, veterinarians, soldiers, emergency workers, self harm.
* Unemployment
* Physical or mental disability

**What to do?**

* Listen (if you feel able, this isn't always easy if you are close to the person)
* Gently suggest a visit or call to, GP, suicide support services.
* Let them know your positive feelings about them.
* Involve friends / family who are sympathetic to the situation.
* Encourage them to engage with therapy if that is an option.
* Help them put together a hope box, a shoe box or similar filled with items that are mementos of happier times, photographs of trips, something their child made, affirmations from work, etc. They can then use this to look at when the thoughts get most intense, which is going to be usually when they are alone.

I'm basing some of this information on [Clinical Risk Assessment](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0iAJOQAACAAJ&amp;dq=morgan+clinical+risk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3z_2cw_3bAhWHI8AKHeP-A_4Q6AEIKTAA) and [Interpersonal Theory of Suicide.](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mlooAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=interpersonal+theory+of+suicide&amp;dq=interpersonal+theory+of+suicide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG2_a3w_3bAhUUZ8AKHfk8DjsQ6AEIKTAA)  

As they say an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. To that end at the wake of my departed friend, I instigated a pact with the (many) friends of that group.  If we ever felt like we would hurt ourselves, we would contact another (or all) members of the group to let them know how we felt before we did anything.  The one thing that stuck with us is that our friend who took their own life at no point asked for help and if they had, things may have been different."

11151,"I generally can't stand horror, but I love science fiction, and I stumbled across the science fiction short story ""The Things"", which tells the story of the movie from the alien's perspective. It was so fascinating I felt compelled to watch the movie in order to fully appreciate it, despite my normal misgivings, and I now am able to enjoy them both, although probably in a way much different than the typical fan of the movie does, because of the order in which I experienced them.

Reading your comment, I realize one of the ways the short story is so brilliant is that it takes all the body horror and psychological horror of the movie, and turns it into *existential* horror. The alien eventually comes to understand exactly what is going on, and for it, that's the worst thing of all."

11164,"Requiem For a Dream.  I know people on reddit always say they can't watch it again, but I would like to convince you otherwise.  It has tough subject material, but in my opinion it's one of the finest rewatch movies ever made because of how much attention to detail and subtle messages Aronofsky put throughout the movie. The first time I watch a movie, I like to just get lost inside that world and enjoy the story put in front of me. Re-watching is for finding the details. For example, almost every single druggie in the movie was actually a druggie. Jared Leto spent a few months living with heroin addicts to get the motions and the feels, and it is so apparent when he isn't the central character in any scene. Just watching his movements and actions(even when he is in the background) makes it seem so realistic and believable. On top of all that, Ellen Burstyn said she cried after numerous scenes because of how much effort she put into them. Her portrayal of Harry's mom is one of the best i've ever seen, and the movie deserves a re-watch just to watch her.

But my favorite part of the entire movie is the Requiem and when it happens. A 'requiem' in a Roman Catholic Church means a mass for the repose of the souls of the dead. It also means a token of remembrance. In a scene where Harry and Sara are arguing, in the background you can hear an orchestra turning up. It starts out soft and gets louder the more they argue. The orchestra grows louder because you can see their relationship falling apart, or ""dying"". And then there is the title song, Lux Aeterna. In latin is means eternal light, in the context of this movie, to me it means trying to find a way out of the darkness by any means necessary. The song plays whenever someone is either falling into the abyss deeper and deeper. Or it plays when one of the characters thinks they have figured out a solution and are working towards the light. The way it's presented, the speed, the pacing, the loudness, everything about this song and how it's used is, to me, perfection.

Requiem for a dream isn't about drugs, it's about addiction and trying to find a way out or around the mundane existence people accept for themselves. It's quite possibly the most beautiful movie ever made, even though so much of it is hard to watch."

He did not delete the payment info, and his computer got hacked. She got a few large charges, and reported it to her bank. Then she noticed smaller charges on her bank statement here and there from the past few months, all from Steam. Her boyfriend assured her it wasn't him, so she reported those charges as well.

What do you know, all of a sudden he got a vac ban from Steam for fraudulent charges. He starts claiming she had given him her card info again for a different purchase, and that she just forgot. He really wants the vac ban lifted because he plays a lot of Dota, and can't play multiplayer with the vac ban.

And it gets worse. A few days later, her grandfather gets very sick very quickly. They were close, so she's obviously devastated. She went to visit him in the hospital, and mid-conversation, he had a massive stroke. She and her family were basically shoved out of the room so the doctors could work. A doctor tells them he may be brain dead, but they have to wait and see.

My friend is distraught and calls her boyfriend while waiting. She explains what happens. This fucker says, ""That really sucks. Also can you make sure to call your bank so we can get that vac ban lifted?""

EDIT: I understand the math of i^i , I'm taking a class where we proved how it works and I understand how the substitutions lead you to e^-pi/2 . I moreso look at i^i as just a super weird concept in general since we're multiplying the square root of -1 by itself, the square root of -1 times.

Being a parent is something that is learned and acquired - no one is a perfect parent or is born one - but with a little love and readiness to learn on our mistakes and mistakes of our parents a lot can be done :)
Even the feeling that you don't love him yet is also normal.

Autopilot is also ok, your body is going through huge changes, both physically and mentally. And if you ever feel the need to talk or being overwhelmed - reach out to someone, talk with husband, friends, whomever will listen - having a child is a big and wonderfull event, but also very challenging. There is no shame in feeling inadequate as a parent, wife, whatever. That is also normal, given the changes you are going through.
You and your child are the ones that matter now and nothing else.

I hope you and your mother will fix your relationship (having a baby/grandson can do wonders in that area :)) and good luck. You got this :) "

11230,"My now ex girlfriend and I were hiking Salkantay Trail in Peru and were on the second day of what was to be 4 days of hiking. I‚Äôm a pretty fit fella, but was ill-prepared for days worth of walking at altitude, with a pack on, so I was keeping our pace pretty slow. 

After hours of steep incline, making the top of the pass, and descending all with wet feet, I was dying and we were behind schedule, which meant it was getting dark.  The trail we were on was truly beautiful, wide enough to drive a vehicle on but jutted with rocks and felled trees which would make doing so pretty difficult. The trail was moderately declined with steep drops to our right cut by a river of mountain runoff. Really, much of the Peru we saw was like this, absolutely amazing. 

It‚Äôs dark, it‚Äôs raining, we‚Äôre tired, and all we have are head lamps which grant us 10-15 feet of visibility if we actually look up to see what‚Äôs ahead rather than looking at our footing. I‚Äôm in front, she‚Äôs behind and slightly left of me and we‚Äôre talking about how far it could be to the village and what to eat for dinner.  That‚Äôs when she says it... ‚ÄúI hope we don‚Äôt run into any animal on the trail...‚Äù. Not 20 seconds later we see the broadside of mountain lion 10 feet in front of our path. We freeze, have enough time to say ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù, and it takes an annoyed look at us and slowly wanders into the jungle. 

The next hour consisted of me yelling every 10-15 seconds something along the lines of ‚ÄúHEY CAT!!!‚Äù  Or ‚ÄúYEEEOOOOO!!!‚Äù and either it was working or it was attracting other animals to my strange sounds, because twice more we saw the glow of eyes peeking out from the darkness.  

TLDR: Hiking in Peru, GF says ‚Äúhope we don‚Äôt run into an animal on the trail‚Äù, 20 seconds later a mountain lion appears. "

11235,"Not quite, you have 2 copies of each gene, call them A and B. Say B is the recessive gene that causes the albinism trait, but being recessive you need two B genes for it to be expressed. The possible combinations are:

AA

AB

BA

BB

basically any combo with an A gene means you'll carry the gene but becausd its recessive you wont be an albino. Only with two B genes is the phenotype (in this case the albinism trait) expressed in thd progeny.

This is assuming that the albinism is caused by a single gene, if multiple genes are involved in its expression or there are other variants of the gene (ie not just A and B, but maybe A, B, C, D and E where more than one can result in albinism), then the maths will be different."

After work on Fridays, around 2 am, I used to go round to another friends student houses and get really stoned. One Friday night I was coming home from my friends, high, opened the door to my house (which was very scary when dark) and immediately jumped into my room and locked my bedroom door. Something about being there on my own unnerved me, throw being baked into the mix and you have a paranoia cocktail. As I lay in bed I could he noises of what sound like people moving about in my house, which was terrifying, until I realised that it was actually next door moving around. Now this was at 5am-ish and I remember thinking ‚Äúgod, they‚Äôre up late aren‚Äôt they‚Äù before falling asleep. The next day I was woken up by someone furiously ringing the door.

11349,"Not posting experiences because I **was** that guy 5 years ago, although not Incel levels...thank god. Tools and the like that helped me finally overcome my shortcomings as a Nice Guy *TM

1) You're not entitled to anything from anyone else. Learn the nuance between reciprocity and entitlement. 

2) You ARE entitled to your own happiness. You are entitled to be around people that love and help you. You are not entitled to stay with negative influences. Let's face it -- a lot of us were,are, or will be stuck with friends that pretend to want the best for us but take every opportunity to prevent you from improving. 

3) Therapy is your friend and the surest bet to start taking 1and 2 into your life. 

4) No More Mr Nice Guy. This book will leave you with a road map for you and your therapist to start exploring solutions to deep seated issues. 

5) The Way of the Superior Man. It's like Eckhart Tolle in the sense that it has a lot of woo. With that being said, it will help you understand and adapt to reality. Everyone plugs NMMNG by Dr Glover but this book is equally as helpful if you give it the chance.

6) Assertiveness Training. A lot of our problems stem from not being able to assert ourselves properly.  The anger comes from feeling trapped, among other things. Assertiveness is the difference between having the wrong key in a situation versus trying to wait for a lock to rust off. You'll eventually learn how to get through that door. Some times you're just imagining the lock, to boot.

7) Men are lied to near constantly about women. Forget your assumptions. Forget what you've been told. You're getting no results so your "" knowledge"" is of no worth. Drop it and start building a healthy, accurate perspective with your therapist. 

8) You can't get self worth from anyone but yourself."

In that, something exists that *is* capable of making these patterns. And this can be easily demonstrated, very cheaply with minimal resources. Therefore is it more likely that it is due to otherworldly reasons, or these mundane ones?

The term [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) is when you have competing hypotheses, try to go with the one that introduces the fewest new assumptions. Think about *how many* new assumptions you need to make if you go with alien landings. The existance of said beings, technology we've never seen before that completely evades modern detection, that is capable of landing in a gravity-well without propellant, etc.

Vs...planks, ropes and people who like attention.

**Edit** - It's also worth adding that Occam's Razor is *not* a complete tool for getting at the truth. Only a way of filtering out unlikely scenarios. If aliens were to land tomorrow, creating a crop circle before mysteriously leaving, we would absolutely attribute it down to a bunch of guys dragging planks on a dare. But that doesn't count as a flaw against Occam's Razor. Because what points at the truth is not one single incident, but corroborative evidence and data.

Say, a crop circle appears in one area **AND** high altitude radar at the nearby airport detected something **AND** so did low altitude radar from an independent weather monitoring station **AND** two road cameras saw a reflective object move over the trees near that field **AND** there are multiple eye-witness reports of a disk shape object, which match each other despite none of the witnesses having apparently met.

Then you can look at it and go ""okay, something just happened. Time to investigate!""

She shouted at him and he took off, so my mom chased him all the way to the woods on the next property and then shouted ""if I see you again I'm getting my dog and I'm getting my gun!""

I'm aware that it MIGHT not be as effective as traditional floss (although I haven't verified this) but most of the time I can't be bothered with that but I do with the Waterpik because it's so much easier so I rather be flossing MAYBE less effectively daily than not floss at all.

A little bit of preface, my buddies house is basically just a party house, everyone just comes and goes as they please and the door is unlocked for anyone at any time. Unfortunately this girl decided she just wanted to party all the time and has been living there for almost 3 week's straight, without even paying any rent or anything,  Anyways, the other day she literally spent 45 minutes showing pictures of herself and each photo she'd say ""this is me"" and make us comment on each and every photo. Even if there are conversations going on, she'd stop everything that's happening and show us a picture of her from middle school or something,  and she does not pick up on ANYTHING we say. At first we thought that maybe the photos were important to her so we'd say it was cool, but every photo looked the exact same and the only description she'd give on them is ""this is me"". At this point when she starts showing us photos i say I don't care and she just keeps going and going.  Also when everyone is having a good time just talking she'll say something like""do you guys care if I put on some music and dance?"" Everyone there pretty much has a ""you do you booboo"" kinda mood so we say go ahead. She then dances and its not too bad but if you're not directly commenting on her dancing she stands directly in front of you and constantly says things like ""rate it out of 10"" or ""do you think I'm a good dancer"" over and over again. After awhile of this one of my friends straight up told her ""I've already said you're a good dancer, you don't need to keep asking me"" and she'll just go on to ask every other person in the room. And these aren't the only things she does, she does this kinda stuff every single time she's not the center of attention and its driving all of our friends insane.

My mother and I LOVE pranking my sister. Once we tricked her into thinking our car's trunk was fingerprint-activated. I would place my finger on the car's crest and my mother would surreptitiously use the key to open it. It obviously wouldn't work when my sister tried, so we brushed that off as ""oh, we haven't programmed your finger in yet""

That girl has an MD and a PhD, yet we managed to keep that up for two weeks straight. We told extraordinary lies, from speculating as to the placement of the wiring to me spouting off some nonsense about the mechanics of fingerprint encryption. She only figured it out when she went to the store with my father and proudly slapped her thumb on the hood of the car :p

EDIT: Now that I‚Äôm thinking about it, we really messed with that girl. After our little ruse was found out she obviously didn‚Äôt trust us anymore. So our next trick was for my mother and me to look supremely confident while speaking only the truth. Her paranoia had progressed to such a level that she couldn‚Äôt believe anything we said, so by constantly speaking the truth we slowly made her question reality itself.

11525,"No one is going to see this 9 hours late, but let me tell you a story of the time I held the door open for someone and it turned out awkward.

It all started innocently enough, I entered a mall, and held the door open for the lady behind me. This is one of those mall entrances that have doors to the outside, a vestibule, and another set of doors before getting into the mall proper. The first set of doors went fine, but I held open the second set for the lady, but she wasn't following me into the mall, she wanted to use the payphones (it was a long time ago) on the wall at one end of the vestibule. So I awkwardly held the door for too long before I realized this. This is not the end of the story. The lady actual had a young child, old enough to walk, but apparently not old enough to have any idea about its surroundings. So yeah, after I realized that the lady wasn't going into the mall, I let the door close, and her kid, instead of following her, decided it wanted to go into the mall. It walks straight into the now closing door, I hear a thud, and the kid starts wailing. The mom, up till now oblivious to her kid, turns around with the biggest 'wtf just happened here?' look on her face.

I felt embarrassed, and took off. I don't think anyone saw what I did, but I still feel bad decades later."

We heard a stick break and I looked in the direction of the noise. When I looked in that direction, my headlamp illuminated another black bear with an all black face. I yelled and screamed at him but he would not leave. He kept inching closer, while kind of pacing back and forth with his head down. I have seen bears before, but this one made me feel really uneasy and I had this feeling it was being aggressive. I kept yelling and throwing shit out, stomping and fake lunging at it, but this bear was not fazed. Well, that was until I hit him in the head with a rock on a good throw.

11569,"**TL;DR: Focused on career -&gt; suicidal -&gt; abandon career to go write.**

In many ways, I got lucky and was living ""the dream"", certainly luckier than it seems a lot of other millennials seem to have it.

Studied computer science. Internship while still in school. Job directly after graduating. A few job changes throughout, and I'm making what feels like an absurd amount of money for something I'm pretty competent at.

Ten years pass.

The realization creeps in that every day is the same as every other; I am literally nothing but my job. Every day, before work is spent in service of preparing for it, and after in recovery of it. Outside of a few standing dates, I have zero social life. More and more of my time revolves around corporate bullshit, meetings, and project management, divorced even from the coding which I used to enjoy. Every commute in, I fantasize that somehow I will die in an accident just so I can stop living and it won't be my fault. My entire existence is reduced to an incrementing account balance.

One day I realize I've started acting recklessly subconsciously. I'm becoming suicidal, and conclude that if I die, I'm so isolated that I don't think anyone would care.

I break away. I turn to something I used to do as a hobby, and begin to live off of those savings instead of enslaving myself to them. I quit my job and start writing full-time, publishing a free online web serial (at the risk of shameless self-promotion, link [here](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/17901/exhuman).)

Now my account shrinks every month, but I'm actually happy to be alive. Someday, I'll probably run out of money and have to go back...or some alternative, she says ominously...but until then, it's a relief just being able to stand being myself.

How it affected me -- ten years of encroaching social isolation and eroding self-worth do a number on a psyche. I'm an absolute shut-in, with basically no interest in playing the game or reintegrating into society again. I contextualize everything I do against death as an alternative, which is both really morbid and cynicism-inducing, but also extremely liberating. 

I'm in a better place now, but seeing how easy it was to walk into this lifestyle gives me this irrational dread that it's going to happen to me again, like a predator just waiting for me to lower my guard. *Utterly* irrational, I know, to think that ten years of poor lifestyle choices could just sneak up on me again, but that's how it feels.

My hope is that those who see this can take better care of themselves and not be so sold on the promises we all grew up on. There's a lot more to life than a successful career, and much of it takes consistent care to maintain. All that's required to fall into a story like mine is a simple lack of effort to keep your world broad and your options open.

But hey, if you do feel as I felt, don't be afraid to drop everything, either. Even if a career is all you have, sometimes it's still better to have nothing."

11610,"Not a sex therapist, but I lurk/post on r/sex a little. A few things I've noticed:

1. Communication - never be afraid to talk about your wants and needs with a partner. If it's important to you, it should be important to them to at least hear you out. By the same vein, listen to your partner's wants and needs. They are just as important as yours. Hiding what makes you happy is only going to lead to resentment.

2. Sexual compatibility - if you're into whips and chains, but your partner blushes if you say ""penis"", you're gonna struggle. You need to talk about what you like in bed, before you get too far into a relationship. This isn't to say that vanilla can't work with kink, just that there's going to be a lot more compromise to reach a happy middle ground.

3. Don't be afraid to break the norm - there's alot of pressure for people to follow ""normal"" relationships. Media and society say ""one man, one woman, missionary under covers, maybe a blowjob on your birthday, and the guy always has to be ready for sex"". We can all agree that these views don't work for everyone. If you feel you want to, experiment. Nobody has a right to judge you for seeking happiness, provided it's legal.

4. Set rules together, and keep them - this one is self explanatory. If you've talked about what you expect from each other, hold to it. Cheating might feel great in the moment, but the guilt and hurt leave massive scars, which will outlast the relationship. It's NEVER worth it. Better that you explain you aren't happy ahead of time, and seperate, before moving on with someone else.

5. NO MEANS NO. You can be married for years, but you don't get the right to someone else's body. It still counts as rape."

11643,"I don't think it's promoting obesity, at least the way I see  some. Don't get me wrong, you're right that in some situations it's promoted that way but mostly it means that if you're this way, you can be confident, you are valid and you can do whatever you decide to do. Many obese people struggle a lot, and hearing ""Well, it's for your own good! Get healthy! You're gonna die if you continue like this!"" is not going to help them. 

Just read me all before you start to see red. There's a tick inside their brain when passing from overweight to obese, it starts with small things like they can't find pants size to wear in a shop, when they try a diet but it doesn't work, when people stare as they're a disgusting piece of slime, when someone calls them fat and excuses themselves with ""It's for your own good!!"" basically telling them they can't think for themselves. They go to food because it's fulfilling, there are many studies showing that food produces the same reaction in someone's brain as any other drug. It's very interesting, look into it. When they hide in food and that feeling, it stops being a physical problem and it turns into a psychological problem. 

There are many way to combat this but the healthiest way and the one that produces a long term result (the one that makes sure people continue healthy rather than just losing weight and then putting it back on and even more) is combating that physiological problem, fighting that obvious depression that they have. And trust me, your comment, I get the point, but the way you say it won't help anyone. 

I think some movements like the one you mentioned are trying to work with this. They don't tell people ""Get fat"" or ""Stay fat"", they're telling you that you are a person too, you should love yourself instead of hating to look into the mirror ( to stop being absolutely and utterly disgusted of yourself, that's a mental health problem, yo you like it or not), to just accept how you are and when you work with your brain and your brain is healthy, your body will start being healthy too. You'll start going out more rather than just isolate yourself from the outside world, you'll start having plans, new ideas, enjoy the sun. Then maybe they'll realize they can make the change and they will. 

It's a tough process. Don't missunderstand this as I said at the beginning that some of those movements are not good either, but I do have faith the others are good. For someone's mental health. Someone that if you were always skinny you'll never completely understand what's it about, and don't rage about it for not being included in this club. You're lucky, if so. But don't trash talk people for trying to do a good. And don't excuse yourself with ""It's unhealthy!!!!!"". They fucking know. Fat people know it and even better than you. Think about what I wrote above. There's more than just fat on their bodies when their brain is unhealthy too (AGAIN, there's a tick, and it happens sooner or later, depending on the person). 

What I interpret from those movements is, and this is a message for any obese person that knows what tick or switch of mentality I talked about is, that you're capable of doing everything you want. You are a person just like any other, you are strong and you can go through everything you're suffering. It'll be tough but all the things you went through, that small but constant suffering thanks to the abuse, bullying and comments that you endured have a positive side. You can be the better person. You do not have to be in your ideal weight to have a voice, but once you go through realizing that you're much more than the words that some called you, you'll realize you can get there, you can live a healthy life, you can live without binge eating, that is just a drug that your body craves. You have the strength, just look inside of you.

Best of wishes for everyone, skinny, fat or whatever body type you have. This was a talk about obesity, but the mesaage goes to everyone. Have a good day.

That was a long ass rant. "
11644,"All the trashy LGBT stuff. 

I've got no problem with anyone just because of their sexual preference, but when you've got grown men wearing nothing but rainbow banana hammocks at a family friendly event. That's really not okay. Your nearly naked body is right next to children. Cover up a little bit. 

Likewise the message I receive from people waving dildo's around in public likely isn't the message they're trying to send. 

I know this isn't exclusive to the LGBT community, **but** criticizing this type of behavior gets you called intolerant or a biggot. I just don't want naked men and dildos rubbing up against kids.

11658,"We have a (very wealthy) friend who has a vacation home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It's a beautiful house in a place called ""Teton Village"" up the side of the mountain. He offered to let us stay there for free last winter, and we figured it could be a cheap vacation if we drove out there. It's about a 14 hour drive from where we live so when we got there all we wanted to do was have dinner and go to sleep. We get back from the restaurant ready for bed, but decide that we haven't really appreciated where we are yet so we step out onto the second story balcony that over looks the mountain. It was so beautiful, and an extremely blissful moment to be there with the love of my life and my dog looking out at this gorgeous scenery at sunset with wildlife everywhere and not another human in sight. It was starting to get a bit cold, though, and all we brought outside was our pajamas and one blanket. My boyfriend goes to open the door and gets the most serious look I've ever seen him have in our 13 years of knowing each other. The door locks from the inside, and we didn't bring a key out. Now this is the part in the story where I always have to answer the very obvious question - no we did not have our phones either.

Our stomachs drop and we start thinking of options. The doors and ceiling high windows are all glass so in theory we could break them but they're thick and large so there's a high possibility of hurting ourselves in the process (not to mention the cost - yikes). The balcony is easily about 15ft high which means it's not a good idea to jump down onto the cement driveway below.  Neither of us have ever broken a lock before, but we decide that's the least risky option to try first. We both take turns trying to figure out how a lock works and how to use our very limited supplies (sticks, a blanket, our own hands) to try to weaken it enough to open. When one person is working on the handle, the other is yelling for help. After about a couple hours we don't have any luck and completely destroy the outside handle with no progress made on getting it to actually open. It's dark now, and easily below freezing. Our dog had thought this was a whole lot of fun at first but now she's looking up at us as if to say ""guys, it's time to go inside now I'm not having fun any more"".
It didn't really feel that serious at first but when you realize you're all alone on the side of a mountain 15ft in the air with no warmth at about 9PM, it starts to get real. We sat on one of the patio chairs together with the blanket over us and the dog curled up on our feet (I had socks, my boyfriend didn't - there was snow on the ground) to conserve heat, with our voices hoarse from yelling, ready to accept our fate when all of a sudden we hear a voice yelling back. ""What do you need?!""

We yelled back and forth, needing to repeat ourselves often because this woman was clearly very far from us and our voices didn't travel well through the woods. Eventually after a lot of difficulty (We didn't even know our address!) the woman was able to contact the leasing office our friend uses to rent out the house. Someone came out and unlocked the door for us and told us not to worry about any damage we had caused and to get a good nights sleep to enjoy the rest of our vacation. It definitely put a damper on things for the rest of the week but it ended up being a funny story to tell our friends when we got back. We figured out where on the mountain the woman who helped us lived and brought her a huge basket of goodies to thank her for saving us from this very silly yet pretty serious situation. It really is a beautiful place, but needless to say we probably won't be vacationing there again any time soon.

Here are some pictures of the house/porch:

A guy who wasn't really much worse than his contemporaries (just way more successful) who was responsible for a lot of really good things in the long run. The fact that old dude is talking about the sack of Baghdad in 1258 as something that Genghis Kahn (who died in 1227) was responsible for is proof that you can say any old thing about Genghis Kahn and as long as it paints him as a dick people will just assume that it's true.

I think the most important thing is realizing that you have an issue, whether is a control issue or a jealousy issue, and trying to recognize when you‚Äôre indulging that issue.

I didn't know there was a fucking hot tub in our back yard. I guess the water level was low and he was stuck in it. I want to say that I pretty much never went in the back yard do to social fear. We have several people here that use it. If you can't tell, I still feel guilty that I didn't search better. Anyway all I can imagine is him in there sitting in 4 inches of water until he was so exhausted he slipped in and drown. I think about him calling out and I can't hear him. No one was there to save him. Holy shit. I just realized why that moment hits me so hard. It reminds me of when I was a kid. That suffering. That fear. Fuck. Anyway, after yelling at my neighbor I just sat in my truck. Punching the steering wheel, blaming myself until I just fucking broke down. That cat loved me and I loved him. I was fucking heart broken. It took me a long while to get to a point to get another cat. The cat I have now is great. He greets me every time he here's me pull up. Weird as hell. Very lovey and friendly. I love this dude. "

11728,"I can ask everyone a simple question - would you rather have a problem, or not have a problem?

The simple answer is - we would all rather *not* have a problem. Obviously.

However, my answer would be different. The reason is simple - *it is much more fulfilling to be engaged in the solution of a complex problem than it is to not have a problem at all*. 

Without a shadow of a doubt: life is suffering. It is endless pain, problems, trauma, and a lot of shit. At times it can feel as if it's a lot easier to either end it all or to not be alive at all, and in many circumstances, it's true. But, there is a way to attain a paradisical state of mind, which can only come from both *having a complex problem as well as being in pursuit of a solution*.

You're here on this planet. You're here on this journey. Some games are not worth playing unless you're all in, and life is an ultimate example of this - you are literally all in in this game, and there is no out. You are bound to die very soon anyway - so why not engage in the highest possible good you can achieve? It is in engaging in the highest possible good, and only in doing so, where the solution to this ""labyrinth of suffering"" (as a writer once eloquently put) will present itself.

This is why I abide by the principles in the Bible, with some modifications - not because I believe in God, but because I want to achieve my personal highest conceivable good. Every day, I strive to make progress towards the *solution*, and in this amazing game, if you move towards a solution with conviction, purpose, and meaningful speed, then I think *that* is true paradise and is *far* better than not existing at all.

11743,"Invited an old friend together with his lil brother to help me build my first PC when i was in uni.
I invited his gf, too, but she said that sounds boring and I understood - because wemd be geeking out for hours over hardware.
The day when he‚Äôs supposed to visit comes, first I hear nothing from them a(I‚Äôm getting nervous because I dropped 1.2k on parts for the pc and the return date is drawing closer and there is no way i‚Äôd risk to build it without supervision)

Then i get an update they are gonna be 4h late because the gf suddenly decided to come and they left late (came from out of state by  car) - at this point im a bit bummed out, because it‚Äôs getting really late, but whatever, he gave me his word and usually he‚Äôs good for it.

When they arrived, it was not the two of them plus the extra gf, but also plus the gf of the little brother. Which would have been nice to know beforehand, since i cooked lunch (which then became dinner)

Suddenly both girls bully up together and start insulting the food (it was spaghetti with a mushroom cream sauce) while the boys do their bet to gulp it down. The girls say ‚Äúewwww this is disgustinggg‚Äù and proceed to eat their spaghetti with ketchup.

We then start building the pc and for 1 1/2h things seem to be going well. Until the girls complaining grows bigger and bigger that its SOOO BORING and she wants to pack up and start the drive back home.

My pc is built half together and it won‚Äôt start, later i will find he forgot the secondary power source for the motherboard which could have been easily plugged in with an 8 pin plug.
I was worried i just sunk a huge investment over shitty people.

I was upset for a week but tried to calm down before talking to my friend. He was vey understanding and sorry - unfortunately he told his gf i was upset with how things went, because she started to berate me via instant message, how I should offer more delicious food the next time.

EDIT - ok I think I made my family sound very dysfunctional. This was when we were all living in the same house and several clashing personalities were trying not to clash.

We usually sleep with the windows closed, and we're used to that noise level. But one night it was just the perfect temperature and so we decided to leave the windows open. 

About 2 a.m., some cats started having very loud sex right outside the window. ""Yooooooowwwwwwwlllllll"" and so forth. My wife, forgetting that the window was open, thought that the cats were in the room and attacking our dog, so she yelled the dog's name and grabbed her.  The dog had been fast asleep. She was surprised, so SHE let out a piercing ""YARP!!!"" 

Meanwhile, I'm a heavy sleeper, so I woke up to:
""YOOOOWWLLLL!""
""HAGGIS!"" ( Our dog's name)

I sat up in bed and screamed. And once I started I couldn't stop. I yelled at the top of my lungs for probably 10 seconds straight before I finally realized where I was and that nothing was in the room trying to kill me. "

11809,"&gt;Someone offers you anything (a ring, a bracelet, anything) claiming you've dropped it or without saying how much it costs, it's a scam.

Can confirm, this happened to me when I was trying to visit the Sacr√©-C≈ìur (white cathedral) in Paris. There are steps leading up to it and it looked like the only way to get to the cathedral. There were a group of African men hanging out. You had to pass them, you couldn't avoid it. 

When one saw me approaching, he sprang up and held out a friendship bracelet, I tried to avoid him, but he kept blocking me and talking to me. I gave up and walked away. Annoyed that they kept me from seeing the cathedral.

Later, I read that they put the bracelet on your wrist and demand payment.

&gt;Likewise if someone comes up to you with a sign up sheet asking for money for things like schools for the deaf or a charity you've never heard of, especially if they're kids, it's a scam. 

This happened to me on the  Champs-√âlys√©es. A pretty young girl said, ""Hello"" in English with a smile and handed me a note. The note had some sob story and asked for donation. I gave back the note and walked on.  

One more. On my last day, I wanted to take the RER train to the airport. I was having trouble with the self-serve ticket machine. 

An African gentleman in a suit came up and said in English I was doing it wrong. He whipped out a card, stuck it in the slot, and a ticket popped out. He demanded some euros for the ticket. 

It happened so fast and it seemed like he helped me. So I gave him some money. 

Then I looked down and read the ticket more closely. It was an ordinary metro ticket for the Paris subway (within the city). Not an RER ticket for the longer-distance commuter train to the airport. Wrong ticket. 

I look up and of course the guy is gone. 

I gave up on the ticket machine and got in line to buy a train ticket from a human attendant. 

Man, it seems like a lot of the scams I‚Äôm remembering have happened in Paris. "

11854,"I was in band class in high school. With two friends who I'd know. For a while, guy and a girl who had liked me for ever, and I had repeatedly told her I was not interested, and deflected her advances. 

Usually there was a third person I'd hang out with in that class, and today she was absent. 

Keep in mind, this band class was in no way a band class. We hadn't used instruments all year, was a pretty poor school and everyone just basically sat around the whole period every day. The teacher did not teach. (He was later fired for having sex with a student(s)).

We're hanging out in the corner like usual, and I'm reading FML's from back when that was really popular. Were laughing then all of a sudden, she starts grabbing both my and the other guy's crotch. I don't know what to say or do. I've never experienced that before, and it certainly was not welcome or incited. After she stops because another student noticed, I get up, leave class, and immediately walk home since it's not far from school.

Fast forward; I was distressed clearly, and mom noticed and I told her everything. She convinces me to go to the principal and report it,  so we do.

Apparently, the principal had spoken to her directly and told her who the complaint was from, and that she needed to stop. She didn't receive any punishment, and immediately told our entire friend group. I was now alienated from everyone except one girl who I had been best friends with forever, who may have liked me; I never found out.

She transfers schools next year, and I am now left completely alone. All the cliques have formed, and I'm now all alone with severe issues I had not yet accepted or gone to therapy/worked through and going to school is miserable every day. I eventually dropped out because literally every excuse in the book I would come up with to not go to school. 

Sorry if I went off further than necessary, but I've never been able to get this off my chest and put it to words and to this day I am still upset that I ended up dropping out. I was a brilliant and innovative student, and now any sort of school I go to I severely struggle to make friends and isolate myself.

11862,"My interpretation is that both versions of Jake Gyllenhall are the same dude, a teacher who is literally living a secret double life as an actor/rockstar persona where he can indulge his sex and gambling addictions. His wife gets pregnant and the movie is a metaphor for him struggling with that idea of settling down. Teacher jake is overly boring, depressed, and anxious because that's what Jake fears we will become without his dark side. His dark side has the wife because that's how he thinks his wife sees him, and he fears even his wife won't like boring Jake.    
The spider shows up in the sex club and later represents his addictions and insecurities relating to that side of his life.

The wife sleeping with history jake is him beginning to understand that his wife will still love even boring Jake. That convinces him to  finally settle down and break off with the side chick and actor/rockstar persona, which is metaphorically represented by the car crash.   

However the giant spider showing up in the last scene is a metaphorical elephant in the room. It represents 2 things; both his realisation that even with his decision the same demons still haunt him and he still has those addictions, and also that there's a good chance his wife will one day find out about his double life. The spider will always be just around the corner, threatening to tear his new life apart."

11886,"No, I'm fine with your question. I think people need to hear all viewpoints from all perspectives. My son was someone who didn't want to be restricted by the normal rules of society. He had mental illness, the nature of which was never really diagnosed properly, in my opinion.

Due to circumstances beyond my control, I was evicted from the home I owned ( 2008+ recession).  This precipitated a series of events which had my son in motels, couch surfing and eventually in a program in a Christian Mission, which he loved ( but hated the religious part).  He thrived there, working in the kitchen, responsible for food prep when the homeless came in for meals. Graduated from that to a halfway house, but even before he left the program, had a plan to start using again. 

I moved him out of state  after he had burned all his bridges and the whole cycle began again.

He could not live with me because I was the target for his rage. He beat me so badly that I spent 5 days in the ICU, with a subarachnoid hemmorage ( spelling?) . 

I felt he would kill me if he could get away with it. At the same time and perversely, we had the closest bond, I absolutely adores him and when he was clean, was the best and most delightful company you could ask for.

But I couldn't risk my life to save him.

He had multiple opportunities to get on the clean path. Was days away from getting his own apartment and medical help. But didn't want it. He was not equipped to deal with this world. Highly intelligent ( which I think is a curse, as you want the things you can't understand) handsome, witty, erudite, well loved, etc.

But reality was a disappointment to him and he never could adjust to it and decided he wasn't willing to.

Sorry it was such a long answer. Hope it cleared some things up for you.

11897,"It's an empire with over a thousand military bases all over the world. This costs taxpayers around $600 billion annually, yet politicians claim they don't have any money for universal healthcare or affordable higher education or a higher minimum wage. The US has spend the last several decades overthrowing democratically elected governments and propping up military dictatorships all over the world and they're still doing it. They're engaged in wars all over the world, killing thousands of civilians every year.   

Their elections are wholly undemocratic. Their system is one of legal bribery and has been that way long before Citizens United in 2010. Politicians do the bidding of their corporate donors and that's why there's no correlation between the will of the electorate and the decisions made in Congress and why a recent Princeton study found the US is literally an oligarchy. They still use a system set up 200 years ago to appease slaveholder states to determine who gets to be president, resulting in 40% of elections since the turn of the century having gone to the person who got fewer votes. You only get two choices anyway, due to the way the system is set up, leaving people with nowhere else to go and voting for someone they don't agree with at all, just to stop 'the greater evil'.   

Meanwhile, both parties agree on all essential issues. The few where they don't are enlarged in the media to keep the people under the illusion there is a difference between the parties. (Example: virtually all Democrats joining the Republicans in voting for an additional $80 billion for the military, no debate, no questions asked; they found the money just like *that*. But no money for healthcare or education.)   

All media are controlled by the same six multimillion dollar corporations (due to Clinton's deregulation of the media in '96), which have a vested interested in keeping the status quo, because they have other economic interests beside their news departments. (All through the Iraq War, MSNBC was owned by a Defense contractor; the Washington Post is owned by the richest man in the world who has a $600 million deal with the CIA and sits on an advisory board at the Pentagon.) Therefore the news doesn't bring actual information to the public, but propaganda for the people in power. The left-right distinction is yet again wholly artificial. (There isn't a real left in American politics anyway.)   

The country has a two-tier justice system. People in positions of power never go to jail, no matter what they've done. Wells Fargo has defrauded millions of their own customers and the best Elizabeth Warren, the 'most progressive' senator can do, is recommend the management being fired. Not prosecuted, not jailed, but fired --and they can keep the money they made while defrauding people. No-one responsible for the economic crash of 2008 has been prosecuted. They were engaged in large scale illegal practices; they broke the law. Nobody goes to jail. But if you're selling cigarettes without a permit on the sidewalk, the police will choke you to death. And the police will never face any consequences either. Even if they got a bodycam recording with an officer saying ""I'm going to kill that motherfucker"" and shooting someone in the back who was moving away from him, the cop will still get off scott-free. Just like you're not getting prosecuted if you tortured people on orders from the US government. The president will say ""we tortured some folks"" and that's that. That's why nobody who ordered torture (or an illegal war) will ever go to jail. But if you smoke a joint, you'll go to jail. The US has 1% of the world's population but 25% of the world's prisoners. And they use them to do cheap labor from which giant brands profit. There are now more black people doing forced labor through the prison system than there were slaves.    

There's no healthcare for everybody. 30 million people are uninsured. The ones who are insured can't afford to go see a doctor because their deductibles and co-payments are ridiculously high. 45,000 die each year, needlessly. And when some politician proposes to do universal healthcare, the Republican party, half the Democratic party, all the media pundits and half the brainwashed population goes: ""how can we pay for that?"" How can the richest country in the history of the world get the same system that Canada has had for decades? The current system is twice as expensive than their system. And medication is up to five times as expensive as it is in Canada, because the government can't set limits on prices, like the Canadian government can. Because the US government is entirely in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry. But if you suggest that, the media will tell you that you're a conspiracy theorist. Corruption? Just because politicians take millions of dollars from corporations over decades? The corporations must be giving it out of the goodness of their hearts!   

The income disparity is off the charts. The income inequality is now bigger than it was in the Gilded Age. About half the country is considered poor or low income. Half of all wage earners earn $30,000 a year or less. One family, the WalMart heirs, have more money than the bottom 140 million people combined. Their employees however, have to go in food stamps, which means taxpayers are paying the richest family's employees to get them food, because their wages are wholly inadequate and haven't been raised since the 1970's. But people will shit on them. Regular people will shit on them, saying they should just get a higher paying job. Because God forbid if you work 40 hours a week, you're able to live decently. And so the people at the bottom keep fighting each other, while the top 1% goes laughing all the way to the bank. People are working two or sometimes three jobs to make ends meet. They never see their families. All in the richest country in the world.   

The gun violence never stops. There's been more mass shootings this years than there have been days on the calender. Because some people wrote 200 years ago that a well regulated militia may carry muskets, now people think a person should be allowed to have automatic weapons designed to mass murder people at a fast rate. Actually, about 80% of the country, according to the polls, support gun control legislation, but they ain't getting it, because the politicians are in the pockets of the NRA. So people need to continue to die needlessly while politicians who are getting bribed offer thoughts and prayers.   

And people say they need their guns to make sure the government isn't taking their rights away. But the US government has already taken all their rights away and they don't even realize it. Americans have no right to privacy anymore. Every email, text message and phone call they make is being collected and saved by government agencies. Their smart tv's and smartphones are being hacked, as WikiLeaks revealed. Big Brother is watching 24/7, just not the way Orwell envisioned, but he's watching nonetheless. He knows everything about you and can use it against you whenever he wants. People don't realize it, but Barack Obama signed away habeas corpus, which is the lynchpin of democracy. Habeas corpus means the government can't just arrest and detain you; they have to charge you with a crime and give you a fair trial. With the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, Obama signed that away; he revoked habeas corpus. Which means that every US citizen can now be detained indefinitly, no reasons given. And some people say: they would never use a law like that. Then why do these people think they passed it? Because they weren't gonna use it or because they were already using it? That is literally fascism. Not hyperbolically, but literally, and it arrived long before Trump. Of course, the kill list that presidents Bush and Obama used to order extrajudicial killings of terror suspects, including dual US citizens in Yemen, is also a fascist measure.   

And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. People in Flint and Chicago and all around the country, really, are drinking poisoned water. Their babies and children are having bodily defects; it affects their brains also. But they're drinking poisoned water for years now and nobody is doing something about it. The same way the instrastructure is falling apart and gets a D- rating. But, says the government, no money for that! Gotta drop the mother of all bombs on some goat herders in Afghanistan, even though one conventional bomb alone already costs $500,000.    

Why the entire population isn't literally surrounding Congress and the White House with torches and pitchforks is something I don't get."
11898,"At college. I'm in my third year. My first two years I had been roommates with a bunch of guys that were great. We got along well and had a ton of fun. Third year I become a resident advisor and my old roommates move off campus into a house. As an RA you get a room to yourself. So not only do I not have my old roommates, I'm completely on my own now. I'm miserable. Every time I do see them they tell me about these great stories of parties they host or the crazy antics that they get into and it makes me feel even worse because I'm not a part of it. I become a complete shut in. I never go to class. Stay up until 5-6am watching the same movie every night, playing the same video game for hours on end. My longtime girlfriend and I are just drifting further apart. I make plans to meet her for lunches and I completely skip them without a word why, something I had never done before. Everything is slipping away. I think if I give her a promise ring that will make things better. It doesn't. We break up a month later. I've only gone to a couple of classes all year so I'm failing everything. I actually start planning out the option of just packing up my car at the end of the year and driving away somewhere random rather than go home and face my parents. I've wasted 3 years and tens of thousands of their dollars on nothing. But I'm weak, a coward. I go home. 

They aren't mad. They understand. They are supportive and help me get through the transition of finding a job. I work for about a year while living with them before the interest rates are at one of their lowest and it's a good time to buy a house. I do so. Life doesn't really get good until I start dating my now wife. But just to have family that doesn't put me down and actually helps me through that tough time made all of the difference. If they had not been so supportive or if I hadn't gone home, I cannot say where my life would be right now. "

To quote the [Australian national prescriber service](https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/alcohol-and-paracetamol), ""There are concerns that therapeutic doses of paracetamol may be hepatotoxic in patients who regularly drink moderate to large amounts of alcohol. Critical examination of case histories reveals that overdoses of paracetamol were responsible for the hepatotoxicity in many cases. Experimental studies in which paracetamol was taken for short periods also show no interaction. Paracetamol is therefore a suitable analgesic for patients who regularly drink moderate to large amounts of alcohol but, as with all patients, care should be taken to minimise the chances of overdose""

We killed our engines and just sat there, and we thought it was an earthquake or an avalanche from somewhere else on the mountain.  We decided to nope out of there and startled making our way to the bottom of the slope .  There was an old road that was a groomed trail at the bottom of this hill, and we got down there it looked like a glacier had covered up the slope - the entire slope we were on shifted about 12ft downhill while we were on it.  I have never ridden so hard to get back to the trailer, but we decided to stay away from there for a while.  We found out later that some other riders the next weekend found that the hill had completely let loose, thankfully with no one on it.  


Another time we were camping during an elk hunting trip and we had a bear just stick his head through the open door on our camp trailer to say hello.  Thankfully he saw us sitting at the table in there and took off, but that was the last time I just left the door open. "

Some people were such bad hoarders of trash that there was a small narrow path from the front door to the couch to the bathroom. The kitchen/bedroom was just filled with trash.


Some of the disabled folks obviously had mental issues or otherwise should not have been living by themselves. Morbidly obese with stained gowns that they looked like they havent changed out of in months.

12103,"Went at a local gaming con a few years back and it was an absolute disaster, and ive seen my fair share of cons.

First off it was in mid spring, temperatures outside were cool and breezy, a perfect april saturday. Inside was hell. A mass of sweaty people heating up the place to a nice boiling point due to the AC being off. No water vendors in sight.

There was no age restriction, so most of the con goers were bunches of 11 year old unsupervised devil spawns running around. There was a cheetos or dorito event that gave free bags to everyone, and you can imagine how that went with unsupervised kids. There were also small pools of mass hysteria wherever somebody stared throwing LOL skin codes to the ravenous crowd. 

There were Esports events in the main hall, and a bunch of people got portable whiteboards and markers and gave out enemy team locations and strategies to their favourite team.

I was with a friend, and we both were in pretty uncomfortable to walk cosplays, but we saw they had a dedicated cosplay area so, we went on. The cosplay area was a few tables arranged in a square with a staff member in the middle who would guard the bags the cosplayers left there. 

Then the cosplay contests were delayed for an hour or so while the cosplayers were just informed to stand in a line in a narrow backstage corridor until they are called. 

There was this popularity contest, where people could go to the cons facebook page and vote for their favourite cosplayer. A girl in a fur bikini won as an Easter Teemo. 

There was no artists alley or any of the like. Just a very modest hardware expo, a minecraft stand, some LOL stands and maybe some sort of CS? It was a while ago, i forget.

12138,"I used to work fire rescue many years ago. My most haunting scene (stays with me still) was a call o responded to off-duty. I was heading home with my hand held radio on when my department was dispatched for a wreck on the same road as me. Long story short it was a little girl with her grand parents. As I approach the vehicle the first thing I notice is the grandfather trying to comfort the little girl in the back seat (maybe 7 years old). She‚Äôs sitting in one of those older kid car seats harnessed in. Grandmother appears to be deceased and grandfather doesn‚Äôt seem to have any major injuries. The little girl is crying but seems to be fine so I go to check on grandma, I‚Äôm trying to feel for a pulse or see if she‚Äôs breathing any signs of life really. All of the sudden I realize the little girl is no longer crying. I look in the back seat an she‚Äôs slouched forward, not moving or breathing. I check for pulse and I can‚Äôt get one so I pull her out and lay her on the ground and I started CPR and eventually we got a pulse after EMS got on scene. They called for a helicopter and as we were loading her she died again, she didn‚Äôt make it. 

I‚Äôve never understood why this one sticks with me so bad. I remember everything about that scene, even small details and it‚Äôs been over 8 years. "

When you spend enough time that depressed for one reason or another, you just want to stop. Stop hurting, stop hurting other people, stop getting in the way, stop everything. And then you find a way, one that doesn‚Äôt involve anyone else* and works right now: suicide. It‚Äôs exciting, just to imagine not letting everyone down, feeling like garbage all the time, not having a care in the world. Who cares what happens after, as long as it‚Äôs not **this**. So you make a plan, come up with the how, when, and where, maybe write a note to redistribute your stuff and say goodbye and sorry, and follow through before you can even stop and think that maybe, just maybe there‚Äôs a way to hold onto that happiness that doesn‚Äôt involve death. It just feels really nice to know everything is gonna be okay, even if it really isn‚Äôt.

/*at this point you‚Äôre not thinking about how your death will affect anyone else, not accurately anyway. You probably think most people will be happy, or just not care. And besides that, you don‚Äôt have to see a psychiatrist or talk to anyone, it‚Äôs just easier to take care of things on your own. Isolation is a hell of a drug."

He was misguided into thinking that making lions and hyenas equal would solve the ""problem"" he perceived in the Pride Lands.

He was wrong, and his plan failed, but I like to think that he threw the fight against Simba because death was better than ruling a dying kingdom (I mean, Simba hadn't been eating meat, he had to be pretty scrawny too). Scar wanted what was best and when it didn't work the way he thought, he just kind of gave up and rested on his laurels turning into exactly the thing he hated.

Yeah, you can produce a whole bunch of one hit wonders and they do, but the artists who stick around and really rise to the top tend to be more talented than others.

Made our way inside and as soon as we got the door open we noticed 4 foot stacks of newspapers, everywhere.

 This huge home had so many papers stack that there was only a small pathway from room to room. We got to the kitchen to find an elderly person under a pile of papers on the floor that had fallen on them while they were making breakfast. The bacon caught fire and set off the alarm, but didn't set any of the stacks in the kitchen on fire.

We clear the papers and start to treat the patient, all of a sudden we hear a huge cracking sound, and the floor shifts a couple inches. The weight of the papers was too much for the house to handle.

Emergency drag the patient out of path of papers to get outside.

Patient was ok physically.

Come to find out that the shifting we felt was actually the floor collapsing! Little did we know that the bottom floor was full floor to ceiling with newspapers and in effect stopped the collapse since the floor couldn't fall any farther.

Newish house had to be condemned, and ultimately torn down.

It was also 95 degrees Fahrenheit and humid this particular evening, too hot to turn on the stove at home, which  is why we were at a bar on a monday. We  were annoyed by the disruption at first but quickly remembered they probably did not want to turn their  stove on either. They sat in a quiet, out of the way section clear across the bar from us, which had no one else sitting on the other side. The son became overwhelmed very quickly and began to have, well, a noisy meltdown. Boyfriend and I kept eating and remarked on how it must be hard for them to do normal things like eat out. I turned around for whatever reason and there's a 50 year old man OPENLY STARING at this family while their disabled son is having a meltdown. Without even thinking I snapped at him, ""Don't stare. Shame on you."" He pretended to not hear me, and pretended to not have been staring by shifting his gaze upwards towards the TV. I couldn't believe I had to tell a grown adult not to stare at a mentally disabled person."

He thought his politics,  religion,  views on child rearing,  etc., had to be correct,  because he was smart.  He thought he could work in any field - once,  memorably,  wanting me to submit his resume for a job that required a PhD plus a decade of experience developing drug candidates,  despite lacking so much as a bachelor's in chemistry.  

Dad was a genius,  make no mistake.  But he made the very ordinary mistake of thinking a limber intelligence makes up for a lack of knowledge and experience.  I'm really smart myself, and in some ways,  it can.  I can bridge knowledge from one application to another.

Dust is actually a government-engineered chemical that instigates allergies, so that you're more likely to purchase anti-allergy medication, keeping you in a state of complacency. Think about it.

He was doing pretty well for himself, until the people above him began to realize he wouldn‚Äôt turn in all the alcohol he confiscated. He would instead keep cases of champagne and drink them alone, which was illegal and lead to him being fired. I believe he served some jail time as well. All the while he was not a US citizen.

I‚Äôm not exactly sure what lead to this, but he eventually became a ‚Äútax fix artist‚Äù for the mafia and other higher-ups.

Emphasising the waist creates an hourglass shape (assuming the waist is smaller than the chest/ass areas) which is what most women want and what most people find attractive. What do you mean move the waist up? The waist is the smallest part of the torso. It doesn't move. The top parts loose, tightens at the waist, and flares back out again. An hourglass.

12507,"Stayed the night at the Mavern Manor in Malvern, IA. Lot of history about the place, I won't go into now. It was around 1 or 2 AM and my small group went up into one of the rooms belonging to a deceased resident named Hank, a crotchety old man. His old clothing was left behind when the building was condemned and the owner of the building hinted that he didn't like people 'touching it'.

So, of course, we go up there and mess with his old clothing. Afterwards, I fold it all up and put it into his old dresser. I lean against the dresser and start listening to an audio recorder, and at the same time I start feeling this throbbing/burning heat up my neck. It started off real light and then became so intense that I was actually afraid something was biting me, a bug or bat or something.  I instantly started recording with my audio device, and I captured an old man saying ""I want you to go."" ""I want you gone.""

Got the whole sequence on camera. The only editing here is that I boosted the volume on what my audio recorder captured. The video is 3 minutes, but you can get the whole experience in the first 60 seconds.

The story was that this one student had to go home because her grandmother passed away. They didn‚Äôt live nearby, and she needed to take a plane to get there. In order to not lose course credit she informed her teachers why she would be gone for a week. Everyone was very understanding about it.

Anyway, a few months later in the same semester there was a big exam coming up, and that was around the time when her other grandmother passed away. So she once again let the teachers know she was going home for the funeral. She told professor so-and-so that her grandmother passed away, and he responded darkly, ‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù

It's just short of 23

Edit:

This is the Kempner series and the brief explanation goes (although this will ruin the magic):

As numbers get larger the probability of them containing a 9 goes up to the point that so few numbers don't contain a 9 that the series converges.

A 1 digit number has a 10% of containing a 9

A 2 digit number has an 19% chance of containing a 9

A 3 digit number has a 27.1% chance of containing a 9

And so on.

Another way to think of it is: if you picked a 100 digit number at random, would you expect at least one digit to be a 9?"

Careful, obviously, but put the bite under the hot water or press the hot metal to it. You don't want to BURN yourself, but you want to make sure you heat that spot as much as you can stand.

It will break up the protein that makes the hive and the itching happen. It will return but it usually takes hours and hours for the return of the itching and I just quickly do it again.

12605,"My mom is a professor. And if you ask her this, she'll tell you all about Jenny, who would:

- Text in class, even when told about the cell phone policy.

- Whisper to whoever was next to her (my mom teaches theater, and she likes to randomly assign seats each day).

- Put no effort into anything.

- Come in 20 minutes late, fast food bag and shit ablaze.

- Complain about her grade.

- Post rants about my mom on Facebook, which one of my friends showed me.

- Insult other students openly.

- Try to get other students to do her work for her.

- Constantly e-mail my mom after her final grade was posted. The e-mails contained really fake apologies and all sorts of pathetic nonsense.

My mom says she never enjoyed failing a student before or since. And I found out that Jenny got kicked out of the school for failing all of her classes. I don't know how true that is, since I heard it from a third party, but the moral here is don't be a bitch to your professor."

12652,"That's the one thing I always here people complain about and it isn't actually a plot hole. Assuming the scenes are in linear order, the previous scene says 2 weeks until the bomb goes off. That gives him 2 weeks to get to Gotham. The first movie already explained that he is very well equip to travel around the world unnoticed and with no money. Not to mention his company must have an office in most major world cities. It wouldn't be hard to go to the nearest Wayne office and enter his ID code (or secret code he set up because he's batman) to get what he needs. I don't know why people assumed he walked. 

Plot holes like Talia Al Ghul. She literally sets up a multinational billion dollar company from scratch just so she can partner with Wayne and create a bomb that she plans on killing herself with, while sparing Wayne himself. Because he needs to feel guilty for killing her father, whom she hated. Also, how does Wayne not understand that a nuclear power supply could be used as a bomb? Has he not heard of Chernobyl or Three Mile Island? Luckily the device is 99.99% safe, only a single person in the world knows how to weaponize it, and he ""died"" in a plane crash. But still he won't use it because it's too dangerous. So what does he do with this bomb? Destroy it or move it away from Gotham? No, just leave it under the city. This has to be the convoluted villain plot in movie history. The motivation is stupid and it's so overly complicated that it doesn't make sense. I can also nit-pick about the police in the sewer, the batplane, and Robin figuring out who Batman is (he has sad eyes, obviously Batman). "

So my boyfriend broke me, the first time we were seriously playing sexually together. I am multiorgasmic and a squirter. He is amazing with his hands and very observant. I am particularly sensitive to all sensations. He was able through various touching and observation bring me to about 300 orgasms in the course of 2 days and I think 3 play sessions. This is the story of when it all wrong. After our last session complete with a few forced orgasms near the end I discovered that I couldn't stop cumming. Every 30 seconds to 2 minutes. I could calm them and hold them off by breathing slowly and basically laying starfish on the bed with nothing touching me. This went on for about 45 min before we decided I should go get checked out. The doctor told us nothing we could do that it'd stop on its own eventually and to take hot baths and painkillers as needed. I was physically exhausted. I spent the next two days sleeping, smoking pot and trying to relax as my body desensitized itself. It got better gradually but there was a point where I couldn't stand up or walk with out someone there to hold me up if I started to cum again. Think it took about a week to fully get back to normal.

The driver shouted back that whoever was smoking had better put it out or the bus was stopping til the culprit got off. The guy continued to smoke and finally a really old guy said rather abbrasively ""you still smoking, aye??"" (I'm Scottish for the record).

The junkie got really aggressive and before long it escalated to the point both men were standing in the aisle shouting at each other ready to fight. Meanwhile his wife was shouting that her husband had a heart condition.

Now I wish this is where I stood up and bounced the guy off the bus like an absolute hero (so this could end up on r/thathappened if nothing else), but I was sat there thinking about my job and whether I was ready to put myself in a situation where I could be charged and lose it.

I figure that once they got rolling, my coin roller would be able to do about 80-100 rolls in an hour. Figuring that I'm paying them $15/hour (living wage, none of this $10.25/hr crap), I'd lose about 15-19% of my money paying this person. Until I could buy a machine to do it for me, that is. I don't know what a coin roller costs and quite frankly I don't care. I'll pay my coin roller to look up the cost of his own replacement. Won't be more than a few thousand, I assume, which means I won't need to pay this coin roller I've hired more than a couple grand before I can buy a machine to do the rest of the work.

Dollar store stuff sucks. Don't go to the dollar store. Buy cheap and buy twice, I always say. That's why I'll spring for a top quality coin roller when I get my hundred million pennies. "

12760,"When a straight person tries to cut off a conversation about the topic by saying something like, 'I'm fine with gay people but why do you have it shove it down my throat all the time?' it comes across as very restrictive to an LGBT person, like how am I supposed to know which aspects of *my life* are going to make you feel squeamish in a way you should have gotten over years ago? Especially true for people who are just coming out, when most gay folks are questioning their whole existence and trying to figure out how to fit in and not be consumed with doubt and misplaced guilt or shame. And, if I'm being honest, if I hear a guy say that phrase to me I always think he's battling some latent homosexuality within himself. As Vito Russo said, better blatant than latent."

Long story short, she picks me up, starts flirting with me ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm going to miss you so much!‚Äù Gets really close to me, that sort of thing. We finally got to her house, and we were chilling on the couch. I put my arm around her, and she gets this ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù kind of face.

I was genuinely enjoying an interesting convo with one dude who was taking a break at the bar (and who was clearly not interested in me in the slightest other than as a temporary conversational partner), and my brother was asked if I was his girlfriend. Naturally, he said, ""No! Nope, she's my sister, definitely not anything else."" My brother is straight, very straight, but oh boy he was mobbed after that, lol.

We all looked at yourself and were like wtf is going on. And then for shits a giggles we start asking him more questions like what‚Äôs our moms name and grandmas name, he literally starts saying all of your moms and grandmas name. At that point we were literally freaking the fuck out. Idk what was the point of his call, like he never stated what was the reason for him calling me but he just kept spitting out facts and everything about us. What year were we born, where we live, etc... We tell my friend‚Äôs dad and he didn‚Äôt believe us so we asked the guy on the phone to tell us info about my friends dad and he literally says everything about him.

His wife spent the next 20 years caring for him (reminding him to do basic things, preparing his meals, taking him on outings), all while maintaining a thriving career of her own. It was such a  deeply sad situation, to lose the love of your life mentally but still have him physically with you, but such a striking demonstration of love. He passed a few years ago and I've slowly seen a shift in his wife, Molly. She is more lighthearted, like a fog has lifted. She's traveled to Cuba, Ireland, the Galapagos, Turkey, and beyond.

It's more likely that the amount of time and money already spent was irrelevant.

Now when a grown person has a clean shaven vagina, I just cant. You're a grown human, it's weird that you don't have hair.

One day ""someone"" led the cops on a high speed chase in a car identical to mine.

She was a forty-something year old patient, if not older. She rarely made any fuss or even talked, but when she did it was always something prolific or profound. Anyway, on random nights she would be in hysterics, saying that her pillow was singing songs to her in the middle of the night (roughly 3am). We never thought anything of it until we found out that her bed used to belong to a male patient that killed him self in that bed. The song she always claimed that her pillow was singing apparently used to be his favorite song. The older staff said that he never spoke, he just sang that same song all the time. The same one she claimed she could hear. That was a big nope for me. 

EDIT: Just to add, this patient had absolutely no way of knowing about the patient that killed himself. This happened 5+ years before she arrived, so it‚Äôs not like any of the other residents could have told her about it or anything. This came solely from her, and not because she heard the story and got freaked out. Also, she would often talk about the man in her room. "

We were fostering kittens at the time so we had six cats (two of our plus the foster family) and a dog. We hurried and gathered all the critters up and walked outside with flames literally falling on our heads. 

Luckily the fire department responded quickly. Neighbors lost their shed and the tree, but our place didn't catch on fire. I still have panic attacks when I hear weird noises at night now. "

She lasted several days after the incident and there‚Äôs a video of her where she‚Äôs talking into a camera and she‚Äôs clearly dying and her eyes are like black from infection or something.

13077,"Yes and no.  

Everyone and their mum was using ground-based RADAR as an early warning for incoming bombers.  
As a response to the effectiveness of British RADAR and RAF interception against Luftwaffe bombers, they started sending their bombers out at night, and in bad weather. Because ground-based RADAR might be able to tell you that there's a bomber coming in over Dover, but unless you can *see* it, you can't intercept it.  

The ""new"" RADAR was Airborne Interception RADAR, which was a small RADAR setup in the plane itself, which allowed an interceptor to locate a bomber that couldn't be seen with the naked eye.  
The carrot thing was a deliberate misdirection, to distract German scientists from getting to ""tiny little RADAR setup in a plane"" as quickly (if memory serves, the only figured it out after capturing a downed RAF bomber)."

13090,"It's because of the ""winner takes all"" system in US politics. There is no prize for being second or third. This means that any vote for a third party is wasted since that party has no chance of winning.

Say there is a new third party that matches your political view perfectly while you only partially match with the democrats, would you vote for the third party? If they don't get a majority vote they will not win and if they don't win they don't get anything, your vote will have had zero result. And voting for them means a vote less for the democrats, resulting in an increased chance of a republican victory. And you most likely don't want that so you vote democrat just because you don't want republican.

And this doesn't include all the ways in which established parties try to throw up barriers to enter the political arena, which is also a big factor."

13153," This lesson better be learned by your 20s. I learned it with a girlfriend I was dating. 

It was my first girlfriend. I started dating her when I was 17. I was cautious of my every move. I was dating a girl that physically was ""out of my league"". I've never believed in that term, but I did believe that if you make the other person happy, then they would want to make you happy too. 

So I did everything I could to make life easier for us. I did everything I should to be a good boyfriend. I worked my ass off working jobs I wasn't right for, but they paid the bills. 

Then when I was 22 I started getting suspicious of her behavior. So I installed a keylogging software on my PC. She then used my PC to write a message to her best friend over AIM, that she cheats on me regularly. She told her I'm just the guy that pays the bills. 

I'm not with her anymore. I broke up with her in 2006, thinking I can get a better woman. Someone who does love me. I dated around for a few years. Nothing felt right. Some of the girls clearly weren't for me, and some I just didn't feel any kind of connection. Not until I met the woman I thought I would marry. Unfortunately, she didn't feel the same way about me. She saw me as a way to meet the guy I was best friends with. She started dating him behind my back, and when I found out, a lot of shit came to the surface. Such as the fact that he was one of the guys my ex cheated on me with. Also the fact that the reason a lot of the girls I dated didn't feel right is because he would try to sleep with them behind my back. 

This is a guy I'd known since I was 7 years old, and these issues were happening when I was 30. I thought I knew the guy, and I thought he had my back. I cut both her and my best friend out of my life. They're still together to this day. 

I however haven't even attempted dating since 2012. I've accepted I've failed at life. I'm only recently starting to accept new friends in my life. Still cautious, and distant, but I feel like I have to be wrong about everybody who gets close to me is just out to further their own agenda. I feel like I have to be wrong about that, even though that has been my experience thus far. 

I did nothing wrong, at least not with this, but I still failed at all relationships. "

Ultimately we'll know what sequence of synapses we perceive as something, such as the texture of Belgian waffle or the command over a language.

13212,"A nitpick, but: Being ""big boned"" in that your frame might just be larger than another person's is a real thing. It's just like how one person can be taller or have bigger feet than another, some people are just bigger and others are just smaller.

You can't big bone your way into obesity though. Having a larger frame is less something to think about when someone is overweight (because that's just fat) and more something to think about when a person at a healthy weight wants to get thinner. Sometimes it isn't possible for a person to get to the exact same size as their tiny friend, even if they starved themselves.

Though again, this is unrelated to being overweight. "

TLDR/ELI5:
Feeding birds only bread makes them fat but also malnourished and fucks up their growth which causes bent out of shape wings

WIKI:
Angel wing, also known as¬†airplane wing,[1]¬†slipped wing,¬†crooked wing, and¬†drooped wing, is a syndrome that affects primarily aquatic birds, such as¬†geeseand¬†ducks, in which the last joint of the wing is twisted with the wing feathers pointing out laterally, instead of lying against the body. Males develop it more frequently than females. It has also been reported in¬†goshawks,¬†bustard¬†chicks, and¬†psittacinebirds (budgerigars,¬†macaws, and¬†conures).[2]
The syndrome is acquired in young birds. Due to a high-calorie¬†diet, especially one high in¬†proteinsand/or low in¬†vitamin D,¬†vitamin E, and¬†manganese, one or both¬†carpus¬†(wrist) joints are retarded in their development relative to the rest of the wing; for reasons unknown, if only one wing is affected, it is usually the left one.

If she wants to learn something we do it. She can make her own toasted pb &amp; j, we store the fruit where she can get it. I have her plate her own food because then she eats it. My kid eats every vegetable we've given her. She asks for plain oatmeal for breakfast.

When we're out and about and kids cry I used to ask what she thought was going on. Once she realized the kids were sad, now she goes and gives them hugs or high fives. She is very interested in emotions, she asks me ""Daddy sad?"" type questions dozens of times a day.

13259,"Not parent, child in question. I was in a lot of stress and struggling in school and had to write my Matura (switzerland, if you go to ""Gymnasium"" you have to write a paper next to other things in order to receive the Matura which renders you able to go to University). I just became 18, so I could buy hard alcohol. I was fairly late to start my paper, and I bought a bottle of Jack Daniels to drink a shot to calm my nerves every night after procrastinating for way to long before starting to write. One shot an evening became two shots, three shots, half a bottle until I came up to the point where I'd drink a bottle of Jack throughout the day. That obviously had a toll on my savings, and the circumstance that my monthly savings accounts excerpts where sent to my home adress meant that my mother would see them.

I acted hostile to my mother about how she's violating the postal secrecy if she opened my mail because I didn't want her to find out I was spending upwards 800 bucks monthly for something.

Next time I saw my mail opened I changed my adress to a friends home whom they didn't know, packed my stuff and moved out.

I still attended school, I kept drinking more, I still passed and got my matura.

They didn't know where I was, but they knew from my twin sister who attended the same school that I apparently show up and attend classes.

I've slided into this shit and selflessy acted out against those closest to me to hide the fact I've had a massive problem.

My parents held a grudge against my best friend because they thought he'd been a bad influence. I made it perfectly clear to them that my best friend, while supporting me no matter what, had at any point of time advised against my decisions and tried his best to get me back on track.

My saviour was mandatory military service. In those times you got barely any free time and can't reasonably operate weapons under the influence. I've subsequently had to cut down from 1-2 bottles a day to 5 a week, 4 a week, 3 a week, until I've gotten down to regular going out.

I still drink, but I got a good grasp on my limits and don't get drunk.

I think there was anger, shock, self-doubt, sadness and even despair that I've caused and I also think that it took a great deal of time to make it up to them emotionally and also provide them with the explanations to put all those sorrows and self-doubts that were unwarranted to rest.

They've never did anything wrong to me, I just couldn't bring myself to own up that I had a problem and played it against them just to try to deal with it myself and keeping my face.

I like to believe that this experience has made me a more considerate person that tries to reach out and at the very least not instill any sense of wrong-doing in people who literally did nothing wrong.

13275,"People always talk about this one, but it's a lot more complex than that. ""His kids"" didn't write a book about his abusiveness; his oldest son, Gary, did. Gary struggled with alcoholism, and various other personal problems that Crosby had personal hatreds for because of how they'd affected his own life. Bing Crosby went so far as to encourage marijuana use because of his hatred for alcohol. He'd tell his children to ""puff some shit"" instead of drinking, if they must do anything. Yet drink they did. Gary wasn't ""just beaten"", he was also in constant conflict with his father because of various life choices which were, by almost all considerations, personally destructive. The book wasn't written by an abused child, it was written by a man with a poor relationship with his father, due to actions by both parties.

His son Phillip went on record insisting that Gary greatly exaggerated the supposed abuse, and that much of his book reflects Gary's personal issues more than their father's (a sentiment repeated by Crosby's child Dennis). All Crosby's children, including Phillip, confirm that he raised his children as he himself had been raised, which included corporal punishment that they feel was overboard. But not necessarily to the level that Gary wrote in his book, with Phillip even calling him a liar outright, and not to the exclusion of the many positive aspects to his character.

No one disputes that he used corporal punishment, and in fact it was a serious character flaw at times. But it wasn't just ""for the hell of it"", it was because that's what he knew. Nor was it uncommon for the time, which isn't a condonement, but like other figures historical context does matter. As a father he was flawed, but I don't think he qualifies as a ""terrible person"" overall. All but one of his children, while affirming that their father did have troubles, also affirmed that they viewed him positively overall. 

He also took intentional strides towards racial integration, treating his black costars as equal and insisting they be treated that way by managers, and was a cultural influence towards the acceptance of African American culture by the mainstream. He did a lot of good work, but also had some serious character flaws. His praise isn't entirely undeserved because of those flaws, and even all but one of his children went on record stating that. "

Dude was a bit..off.  Middle kid, older brother and younger sister, a year ahead of me in school.  Grew up a few blocks away, not a lot of kids in my neighborhood.  He was the kid whose parents built him a half-pipe, who let him do whatever; as long as he was out of sight.  He was a bit of bully, enabled by a few toadies or whenever there was a group around, he'd get going on some kind of delinquent shit to get attention - rocks at cars, fireworks in mailboxes, etc.  Teenage smoker, coke, weed.  He was given a new car at 16, and because I was nearby I sometimes got rides to school, but for some reason my parents weren't too thrilled.

He was that kid who did what he wanted and got minor consequences (suspensions, detention, that's about it) because his parents were fucking loaded.

He was in a few fights here and there, and I drifted away from a peer group that was more out of convenience than anything else.  

Then the news broke in the summer.  There was a bonfire party in the woods, a forest preserve.  Loads of high school kids - the ones who drank and smoked and all that shit - and a few of the hopeful ""cool"" incoming crop of first-years.  Looking back, it's kind of funny how ingrained certain American dynamics are.

Anyway, the news.  A ~~14~~ 13 year old girl had gone missing.  He was the last person to see her, as he was giving her a ride home from the party.  The police came to interview him, and caught him washing blood out of his car.  Claimed it was drink mix.

He'd stabbed a 100 lb, ~~14~~ 13 year old girl, over a dozen ~~17~~ times with a hunting knife, a K-bar, and left her body in a clearing somewhere.  His parents posted ~~bail~~ bond, and housed him in their ""summer cabin"", about 40 miles south of the town.  A week went by and he made threatening phone calls to the girl's mother ""I'm coming to get you next"".  Police were called, and found he'd left the cabin, loaded his car with a few guns and shit.  He'd headed back to the family home, where his older brother and younger sister tried to intercede.  He beat his brother ~~to death~~ with a softball bat and slashed his throat, and raped his younger sister (not in the articles, she was ~13/14, and there was a flap about protecting her confidentiality), before leaving for the first victim's parent's house.  He was arrested there.

It was after it was all over, that little pieces started to come out, how his violent outbursts here and there were played off by people, his manipulative history at home, and how seemingly no one bothered to notice this kid was sliding into full on psychopath.

Fallout didn't end there, it was like a ""violence virus"" got unleashed...over the next year everything was surreal.  Another kid from the neighborhood got stabbed a few times in the hallway at high school, a road rage incident left a promising student/star sportsball player dead, a teacher was discovered with CP, another (well-known steroid user) sportsball player started a lunchroom brawl with a PE teacher (and had his ass handed to him by her), a black student had died in a car crash and racist signs started appearing (one down, 22 to go...we had a whole 23 black students in my white-bred suburban school).

The whole thing seemed somehow post-apocalyptic and eerie. I was hiking alone, and for some reason the whole situation was freaking me out a bit. I decided to abort the hike and back out the way I hiked in.

But here goes. 

We work at the same place, James is getting his stuff out of his locker in the employee break room, it's before the store opens and we hit the floor (retail gig). Well, as he's going through his locker, this girl Brandy starts posting up on him, getting uncomfortably close and pushing up on him, he's backing up. Well, Brandy starts to get handsy and grabs his ass, then his package, then his ass, he's disoriented and doesn't know what to do, he get embarrassed as she starts feeling him up on the spot. She backs him to the back wall of the break room and basically corners him, he's trying to push her away, he's not enjoying any of this.  

Now one thing I haven't told y'all was that Brandy was maybe 20 and straight, my roommate was 30 and super gay, he was really not having this and was turning bright red, When it finally ended he rushed out the break room and broke down in the men's room. My roommate was crushed, humiliated, emasculated, it was pretty fucked up what she did to him, he didn't ask for it and he didn't want it. 

HR would get a hold of this incident and terminate Brandy the next day. A few months later I heard she went on to become a stripper at a local divey strip club.

The first one was a girl crying hysterically, and she was certain she was talking to her mother, even though I tried to explain multiple times that I was no one's mother and I had no idea who she even was, which upset her even more. SHe kept saying that she was sorry. She said she was at the police station and needed to be picked up. I told her to try redialing the number and she said she wasn't allowed to. Then a man came on the phone and asked if I could try calling her mom, and immediately rattled off a number that was maybe 11 digits, then hung up before I could ask for clarification.  I was only 13 at the time. I did make an attempt to dial the number, but got nowhere.  


The second call was a woman who was absolutely sure I was her daughter. I tried explaining her that no I wasn't, and that my mother was currently in the kitchen. She yelled at me for being cruel and said some other things, and then another woman got on the phone blasting me for being mean to my mother, and how dare I lie to them. Weird 0\_o"

13352,"Buckle up bitches, this one's gunna make your blood boil. 
 I used to work for a small cell phone company in an even smaller ""town"" in northern Wisconsin. It was my very first week on the job, I had been there all of 3 days at this point, and the first 2 were spent filling out paperwork and going thru the typical training period. So by the 3rd day it was actually really my first on the actual sales floor. I should probably mention, prior to this job I had never worked in face-to-face sales, so controlling my knee-jerk reactions was still something I was gonna have to test out. Anyways, the day is going fine enough, a few hiccups here and there, but overall not bad. Then Mr. Assman enters the store, and immediately I knew this was going to be a bad time. The conversation went something like this;
""Hello sir, welcome to [insert generic cellphone store name] what can I help you with today?""
""Well you sell phones don't you? That would mean I'm here for a phone, wouldn't it?""
Now, I think he's joking, so I laugh. He is not joking, so I say, 
""ok sir, I can definitely help you with that, what kind of phone were you looking for?""
""I dont work here, you do. You tell me."" Again, I think he's joking so I laugh. And again, he is not joking. 
""Ummm alright. Well we have 2 basic types of smart phones, Apple's and androids. What do you normally do on your phone?""
""Listen, kid, I dont give a shit. I want a smart phone. Are you going to sell me something or not?"" 
By this time I am completely taken aback by this fuckface's apparent lack of any and all social skills, so I did what was natural to me, and I fell back into my comfortable state, which is to be a bit of a cunt. So I take a breath, calm myself, and say, 
""well sir, it's certainly hard to give you the right product if you won't tell me what you want, or how you use it."" Mr. Friendly decided he didn't like that answer, because he didn't respond at all. So I take that nonverbal cue and can only imagine that this man was never loved once in his life by anything other than mosquitos, so I took him to the cheapest, piece of shit phone we had, and proceeded to sell him with a line I will never forget for the rest of my life.
""Alrighty, well if you're simply looking for something that makes calls and takes pictures, and you don't have a lot of money, here ya go."" And I stared at him. He never changed his resting, ""when I get home I'm going to take 46 years of pent up anger out on my dog"" face, so I clapped my hands and without any confirmation of any sort, said,
""Sounds great! I'll go ahead and grab this one for ya, what color would you like? Great. Be right back."" I went and got the phone, and proceeded to set him up, during which I continued my usual bullshit small talk with the other customers in the store, and completely ignored him. When the transaction was over, I thanked him for his business and he left without saying a word. 
The best part about this story, he then proceeds to come back to the store on a weekly basis because, ""this fuckin thing doesn't do what I want it to do."" Well, taint goblin, if you were even 2% more amicable maybe you wouldn't have the worst phone we sell, which btw, was actually a used phone, because fuck him and his self righteous indignation. I hope he enjoys the cancer he's giving himself from just being an insufferable wang."

Maybe it‚Äôs just my social circles, but interaction with my guy friends often involves constant insults, comedic hypotheticals, and substantive discussions about current events, politics, etc. However, we‚Äôre rarely nice to each other in an overt manner.

My mom pointed to the painting and said, ""do you know who that is?"" And what I thought Id heard her say was, ""thats baby Cheese!""

Now as time went on, I learned who Jesus was, but because of mishearing my mom, i figured there was ANOTHER important baby, whose name was CHEESE.

Fast forward to kindergarten in my catholic elementary school. We are all sitting on the floor and the teacher is doing a rudimentary religion lesson, holding up pictures and stuff. The teacher holds up a picture and lo-and-behold its the exact painting from my mum's church.

While I'm sure JOA (Amish who have quit Amishdom and become Mennonite or ""jerked-over to the Mennonite side, quite literally, Jerked-Over-Amish) are more likely to be the more conservative jean-skirt wearing types, I assure you there are large numbers of Mennonites who you can't tell from anyone else based on clothing. Likewise, every Amish community seems to have different rules. The one in Illinois from which my grandparents were jerked-over, they had country music blaring out of the buggies. They'd use motors on wagons pulled by horses to power farm equipment like augers, but they couldn't drive the wheels of the wagon. And they'd have electricity to power the dairy refrigeration units... Just not the homes.

For the record, the Amish split from the Mennonites in the 1600s for they thought burgeoning technology was sinful. Mennonites, at least the ones who aren't super-conservative and nearly still Amish, gladly keep up with technology."

Source: Been a work husband several times. Never worked out because it usually is just casual flirtation, but one time I did manage to break up a relationship and get the girl I was in love with for years. The guy was a douche, emotionally and physically abusive to her. It was a real Pam &amp; Jim thing. After we became a thing for a week, she dropped me over the phone and went back to her ex. It broke me, so I took a spontaneous trip to Vegas with my best friend after saying a lot of hurtful things to her. Cursed her out, called her weak and pathetic, said she was going to have a horrible life. She messaged me a few days later as I was leaving to Vegas asking if we could talk in person. I told her we couldn't, that I was leaving town for a few days, that we could talk when I got back but that I wanted her to know how sorry I was for what I said and how I just did it out of anger. Told her I may not agree with her choice, but I did want her to have a happy life. She apologized, too, and said nevermind to the talk. We both transferred to different buildings and didn't see each other again. Until six months later when I ran into her randomly. She was pregnant - that's what she wanted to talk to me about. She got back with him because he was the dad, not because she didn't want to be with me. She thought I wouldn't want to be with her if she were pregnant with his kid. I would have. I'd have raised a thousand of his kids to be with her. I never got to tell her because I went on that Vegas trip. We never talked again.

13506,"Not OP, but I got one.

At my last job I was a lead calibration technician. The company hired this guy who claimed to have a BS in biology, and asked me to train him.

He kept trying to relate the concepts I was teaching him back to biology, but the thing was they were all Bio 101 concepts. I know this because I failed Bio 101, and hence had taken it twice. I took literally no other biology in college, so it was quite humorous to me every time he tried to show off his ""knowledge,"" when I knew it was actually all shit a guy who got a D *on his second attempt* in BIO 101 also knew. Our boss was an accountant, so he had no real clue that this guy was full of shit.

His resume claimed to know how to use all this scientific equipment, which I knew would require calibration. He had no idea conceptually what a calibration even was. If he had actually attained that knowledge he claimed he wouldn't have needed to be taught many basic scientific concepts, yet he asked the most basic questions. I had to show him basic algebra, and even explain basic statistics concepts, in spite of his claims at knowing those things. 

I started making up scientific ""facts"" because he tended to just agree with whatever I said, just to further expose him as an idiot. That was for my own entertainment, when it was just the two of us.

The company sent him to a week long class teaching how to do job specific math, and he came back bragging about drinking with the guys in the class every night. Then he said, ""That class taught me that I still have a lot to learn."" I just replied that I had learned everything the class taught at university (not even a lie, it is basic math). He tried to get me to go over the book from the class page-wise and explain it to him again, but I just encouraged him to study it on his own and ask me questions about what he didn't understand. It became clear that he couldn't do that because he wasn't sure how much he was supposed to pretend he had learned in college, and what it would be safe to ask about. The book was really just presentation slide printouts, and he hadn't taken any notes, so he was basically fucked.

Our job required doing calibrations on manufacturing equipment, so we visited a lot of factories. The guy went around pissing off all the customers with arrogant bragging, and basically being ignorant about everything. Customers frequently asked me if he had been canned yet.

My employer didn't care, or couldn't see, that he was losing us contracts and I got tired of fixing his mistakes, so I asked them to fire me. They did, the idiots, and I collected unemployment while finding a new job.

I think the idiot got fired within 6 months, because he scrubbed his Facebook page one day and deleted all the bs lies about his supposed college education, and I saw a job ad for his position. I hope the company lost many more contracts because of him before they let him go, they were dicks anyway.

    So about two years into carrying I get off work early one day. I had a roommate who worked night's at the time, and partied a lot so it wasn't unusual for him to be sleeping a hangover off at 3pm. That was the case this day, his door was shut, and the house was empty otherwise so I decided to settle in and play a little Xbox. I'd been home for almost an hour, still thinking I'm alone, when all of a sudden I hear our back door open. No one uses the back door, so of course I go straight into panic mode, I jump off the couch, send the Xbox controller flying, and start running for the kitchen and the back door. I drew my pistol as I ran around the corner and level it at my would be attacker...and it's a girl, with no clothes on, trying her best to cover herself and looking very much, well like someone had just shoved a gun in her face. Turns out my roommate brought her home the night before and she was out sunbathing in her birthday suit. 
   Needless to say, I was glad I didn't have to shoot her, and even more glad that I didn't accidentally shoot her. (Proper trigger control is important kids) it did teach me a little about how I react in a panic situation though, so not a completely invaluable experience. "

Basically a bite from the lone star tick can ""reprogram"" the human immune response and cause a potentially deadly allergy to beef and pork. The lone star tick is native to the deep South but in the past few years it's been spreading beyond its original habitat and is [now found from Maine to Iowa](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/maps/lone_star_tick.pdf).

Ticks also transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a serious disease which (despite its name) is [more prevalent in Virginia than in the Rocky Mountains](http://www.aldf.com/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/).

Some rough looking guy with a shotgun came up to their campsite and stood around for a minute. First, he starts shining the light around the woods, looking for them. Then, he starts shouting that he knows they're out there, and that they should just come out and talk, cause there's nothing to be afraid of.


When they don't come out, the guy starts getting angrier, yelling that he's going to find them, and fuck them up. Then, he starts blindly firing his shotgun into the woods.


The whole time these two kids are wordlessly debating whether or not they need to shoot the guy before one of his random shots ends up their way. In the end, one tells the one holding the gun not to fire.

That reminds me of a time I too encountered excessive guano. 

In Austin, TX at least a few species of birds will migrate through every year. And, quite apparently, the birds like to wait till they're resting before relaxing and dropping a load off. 

So I'm walking out of an HEB one evening, and a large flock of birds has taken up residency in a single tree. I could hear it raining. But it wasn't raining. 

At a guess, every damned one of those birds was emptying a thousand miles worth of poop from their bowels while s~~h~~itting in that tree.

I was working the last Vans Warped tour at a concert venue, and as most people know, it was completely sold out. Like. Completely sold out.

However, 1 of my friends couldn't get to the show, so I had an extra ticket. I gave it to the little girl as the dad gets a free chaperone ticket.

13952,"Weirdest classmate:
She was a college friend who I thought I knew well. She seemed totally normal until she invited me over to her parent‚Äôs house one summer. We were going out to a couple of local bars and spending the day together. She had set up the day.

She invited me in and stressed that we would only be hanging out in the living room. No ‚Äúwant to see my room?‚Äù. No ‚Äúwant to meet my parents?‚Äù

We were only supposed to stay in the living room. And, since she offered for me to sleep over, I was only to stay in this room and would be sleeping on the couch.

It was weird, I thought, because she‚Äôs the one that had invited me over and now seemed so uncomfortable with the idea.

When I asked for a quick snack, she didn‚Äôt have anything. How about a glass of water? She said that she didn‚Äôt have a glass to put it in. When I asked to go to the bathroom, she had to walk me to it. I could hear that there were other people in the house but there was no offer for me to meet her family.

Shortly afterwards, we went out to some local bars. A bunch of hours later, we came back to her house. By then I thought, maybe he weirdest was in my head.

Nope!

When I went to go to sleep on the couch, she asked me if I had my period. It was an odd question as she put a dirty-looking sheet over the couch. I told her that I didn‚Äôt. She was so thankful because if I bled through to the couch, her mother would be devastated that her vintage couch was ruined. Vintage couch?, I thought. The couch looked like it had been taken out of a dumpster.

When my friend went to sleep in her bedroom upstairs, leaving me in this dark house with other people obviously in it, I was totally creeped out. But I couldn‚Äôt help needing to know what the hell was going on. I crept over to a closed door across from the living room, and tried to open a door. The door barely budged. I peeked through and it was obviously that there was dusty old stuff ‚Äî- board games, bicycles, furniture, newspapers, toys, a big wheel ‚Äî- piled all the way to the ceiling. 

My guess is that the rest of the house looked exactly like that. I tried to sleep. But I was creeped out sleeping in a hoarder house with, presumably, the entire family who couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt meet me.

As soon as she walked downstairs in the morning, I told her that I had to get going. She proceeded to check the sheets to make sure that I hadn‚Äôt bled through them.

I almost ran out the door.

We weren‚Äôt very close after that."

13965,"Yes and no! It's like comparing two different traditional bolt action guns, where the differences are very minor and boil down to which features best suit the shooter. (The length of a stock, the angle of a grip, how the rifle is balanced.) The caliber (size of the bullet) of the gun is generally the most important factor in choosing a rifle depending on what you're hunting.  

AR's are excellent hunting rifles because of how modular they are - you can swap out the grips, stock, handguards, and basically every other part for something that is most suited to you. They are easily changed, so anyone using the gun can theoretically build a custom rifle tailored to the kind of game they're hunting, and the environment they're hunting in, with relative ease. They are also largely inexpensive.  

Traditional bolt action rifles may be technically more accurate, but to anyone who is actually hunting there is no practical difference. For example, you could have a really nice bolt gun that can stack rounds inside a quarter at a hundred yards, but if you're out slogging through the woods in the wet and the cold, what you can actually achieve is very different.  

Semi-automatic guns also have the benefit of quick follow up shots. Lever action guns and bolt action guns do as well, but you have to break your shooting stance to put another round in the chamber. If you're hunting coyotes, for instance, you'll find yourself missing some shots on even the best of days. Even worse is when you hit, but not well enough, and the animal is in incredible pain until you place a follow up shot. If, for instance, a gust of wind throws your shot off target and you end up shooting the animal in the intestines and it slinks away, you've doomed it to a long, slow death. It's an awful feeling.  

TL;DR: They have the same benefits as basically any other rifle, if not more so."

- Assuming someone had to die in this situation and Magneto was completely successful, it logically makes more sense for it to be a little girl who dies so that Magneto can help all the new mutants with their new powers rather than Magneto dying and then probably more people dying due to the ensuing chaos and nobody knowing how to use their powers.

I doubt that Magneto had a clean conscience about that decision, but the fact of the matter is that it's a decision that makes sense in his position. He didn't want to kill all humans in the first movie, nor did he think that his machine would kill everyone that it turned into a mutant."

Time passed, and one day, one man arrives with a woman at his side. She is horribly unattractive and clingy. The other two ask what happened. He said ""I stepped on the purple cloud.""

With that in mind, the other two men tried to avoid the purple cloud as best they could. However, a year later, one of the other men showed up in the same situation. ""I tried not to step on the cloud, but I tripped and stumbled onto it!"" He said. 

The last day, the third friend shows up with a woman. This woman is hot as can be-total babe-and they were clearly together. Jealous, his two friends say ""What cloud did you have to step on to make this happen?""

""I stepped on the purple cloud"" the chick grumbled in response. "

In the UK he refused to get help with it until I dragged him into the university student support, from there I went with him to every doctors meeting and therapy session where he was taught it was something that would stick with him and essentially he had to learn to live with it.

14072,"I had a coworker -Mike- who was a little ""out there."" When I was a new employee, I didn't see it, but as time went on, it became evident. Mike was about 55, a former drug addict, and a former boxer. Mike lived in a house with 4 other guys renting rooms. Mike was about 5 foot 3, and had what I called ""short man syndrome."" He would walk around like a bulldog at a slightly faster pace than everyone else. 

Mike was a hardcore Christian. Sometimes when we drove together, he would slam on his breaks in the middle of the road (any road, freeway, highway, side street) and point to the clouds. He would say that God is in the clouds, he can tell because there's a cross in the sky. Mike would do something without asking his coworker if it was okay, and when he found out it wasn't, would say ""I just want to be on the same page, same page, same page"" and continue doing the same thing he was doing. 

He would say this 40 times a shift. Mike, we were all on the same page. You had your own page altogether. Mike threatened to quit 3 times - the last time, once before I became an employee, once where he threw paper everywhere and left in a flurry of rage, and the last, where he became irate because he was told he needed to keep the blinds open, and didn't want to. 

Where did we work?? In a shelter for the homeless. 

Edit: One time, Mike didn't show up for his shift (start time 1am). I left others manning the station and drove to his home. I knocked on the door several times, and after 2 minutes, the door rips open with Mike standing there in his underwear. He's talking a mile a minute, says he needs to shower really quick. Mike asked me to wait and drive him to work so he didn't use his gas in his car. I obliged and sat down to wait. His section of living space is littered with holy pictures, candles, and doileys reminiscent of my grandma's home. I (22 at the time and female), am staring off into space mentally telling him to hurry. Mike bursts out of the shower naked in the hallway seemingly forgetting I was there. He screams. I scream. He runs into his bedroom and emerges 2 minutes later, still talking a mile a minute. We hurry to work, I drop him off, and just before I drive away I look him dead in the eyes and say: "" I didn't know you had a tattoo there."" He starts yelling something as I drive away, laughing. "

The neuron path ways are short, like directly mapped from the eye to the spinal cord, and fire explicitly when they see a selective group of low resolution patterns that resemble things like snakes or spiders. The entire subsystem is evolved to do exactly that and do it well and do nothing else. On some real shit, this saves lives.

14139,"Late and not a tattoo artist. I was a barman in a local bar in a small-ish town. 

This guy in his 50s would come in every second day and sit down the end of the bar for a few solitary pints. He'd pop out for a smoke now and again; his moustache was this dirty old thing that looked like a shoe brush made of white and yellowed bristles, his hair hadn't gotten over the 80s, and he wore wife beaters religiously in the summer (changing to ragged rock band tees in the winter). He worked construction, always paid in low bills and coins, and never really seemed one for company. 

He had the word ""CORTINA"" tattooed over his heart and it poked out from under one of the sleeves of his tank top. For anyone who's not familiar with the name, a [Ford Cortina](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/1974_Ford_Cortina_2000E_%2823850365009%29.jpg/512px-1974_Ford_Cortina_2000E_%2823850365009%29.jpg) was a pretty popular car in New Zealand back in the 80s (I think, I'm a Millennial but it's a car model that would get some old petrol heads back home reminiscing when I was serving beers in the late-2000s). I always figured he might have worked as a mechanic or was just one of those bogan-type guys that loved the first car he ever bought and got it tattooed on his chest. 

Eventually, I ask him about it. _So, do you like cars mate?_ He gave me this _Why are you talking to me?_ look before giving me a flat _No_ as his answer. I was 20 and suddenly super embarrassed that my attempt at chit chat/bar banter had failed before it had even gotten started, so I stammered a quick, apologetic backtrack of _Oh, sorry. I saw ""CORTINA"" tattooed on your chest and thought you must be a Ford man._ 

Old mate looks down at his tattoo as if he'd even forgotten it was there and then looks at me with this look of contempt. _I couldn't fucking care less about cars, kid_ he says. I hand him his beer and tell him it's on the house because the beer is cheap and I don't want him sour at me for ruining his solitude for the next few hours. He grunts a _Cheers_ at me and heads outside for a smoke. 

Later, before he leaves, he comes up to the bar to say goodnight for the first time in the months I'd been serving him. 

_I've never owned a Ford Cortina but I'd fucking buy one before I ever get another whore's name tattoed on my chest again._

Turns out his ex-wife's name was Tina and changing it to the name of a car was the only thing he could think to do with it after they'd divorced. It made me laugh and for the next year that I worked there, I'd share a shot of whiskey with him as his last drink - both of us giving cheers _""To Ford Cortinas""_."

No because there isn't really solid consistency in what people think signs are. There's consistency in overall themes, but those overall themes are so fuzzy and vague that you can apply it to anything.

Disclaimer, I care about marine life more than I care about anything else, for real. Except this big dumb idiot. And it's not like an ~ironic~ thing, I mean it IS hilarious to me and they ARE THE BIGGEST JOKE PLAYED ON EARTH but I seriously fucking hate them.

THE MOLA MOLA FISH (OR OCEAN SUNFISH)

They are the world's largest boney fish, weighing up to 5,000 pounds. And since they have very little girth, that just makes them these absolutely giant fucking dinner plates that God must have accidentally dropped while washing dishes one day and shrugged his shoulders at because no one could have imagined this would happen. AND WITH NO PURPOSE. EVERY POUND OF THAT IS A WASTED POUND AND EVERY FOOT OF IT (10 FT BY 14 FT) IS WASTED SPACE.

They are so completely useless that scientists even debate about how they move. They have little control other than some minor wiggling. Some say they must just push water out of their mouths for direction (?????). They COULD use their back fin EXCEPT GUESS WHAT IT DOESNT FUCKING GROW. It just continually folds in on itself, so the freaking cells are being made, this piece of floating garbage just doesn't put them where they need to fucking go.

So they don't have swim bladders. You know, the one thing that every fish has to make sure it doesn't just sink to the bottom of the ocean when they stop moving and can stay the right side up. This creature. That can barely move to begin with. Can never stop its continuous tour of idiocy across the ocean or it'll fucking sink. EXCEPT. EXCEPT. When they get stuck on top of the water! Which happens frequently! Because without the whole swim bladder thing, if the ocean pushes over THE THINNEST BUT LARGEST MOST TOPPLE-ABLE FISH ON THE PLANET, shit outta luck! There is no creature on this earth that needs a swim bladder more than this spit in the face of nature, AND YET. Some scientists have speculated that when they do that, they are absorbing energy from the sun because no one fucking knows how they manage to get any real energy to begin with. So they need the sun I guess. But good news, when they end up stuck like that, it gives birds a chance to land on their goddamn island of a body and eat the bugs and parasites out of its skin because it's basically a slowly migrating cesspool. Pros and cons.

""If they are so huge, they must at least be decent predators."" No. No. The most dangerous thing about them is, as you may have guessed, their stupidity. They have caused the death of one person before. Because it jumped onto a boat. On a human. And in 2005 it decided to relive its mighty glory days and do it again, this time landing on a four-year-old boy. Luckily Byron sustained no injuries. Way to go, fish. Great job.

They mostly only eat jellyfish because of course they do, they could only eat something that has no brain and a possibility of drifting into their mouths I guess. Everything they do eat has almost zero nutritional value and because it's so stupidly fucking big, it has to eat a ton of the almost no nutritional value stuff to stay alive. Dumb. See that ridiculous open mouth? (This is actually why this is my favorite picture of one, and I have had it saved to my phone for three years) ""Oh no! What could have happened! How could this be!"" Do not let that expression fool you, they just don't have the goddamn ability to close their mouths because their teeth are fused together, and ya know what, it is good it floats around with such a clueless expression on its face, because it is in fact clueless as all fuck.

They do SOMETIMES get eaten though. BUT HARDLY. No animal truly uses them as a food source, but instead (which has lead us to said photo) will usually just maim the fuck out of them for kicks. Seals have been seen playing with their fins like frisbees. Probably the most useful thing to ever come from them.

""Wow, you raise some good points here, this fish truly is proof that God has abandoned us."" Yes, thank you. ""But if they're so bad at literally everything, why haven't they gone extinct."" Great question.

BECAUSE THIS THING IS SO WORTHLESS IT DOESNT REALIZE IT SHOULD NOT EXIST. IT IS SO UNAWARE OF LITERALLY FUCKING EVERYTHING THAT IT DOESNT REALIZE THAT IT'S DOING MAYBE THE WORST FUCKING JOB OF BEING A FISH, OR DEBATABLY THE WORST JOB OF BEING A CLUSTER OF CELLS THAN ANY OTHER CLUSTER OF CELLS. SO WHAT DOES IT DO? IT LAYS THE MOST EGGS OUT OF EVERYTHING. Besides some bugs, there are some ants and stuff that'll lay more. IT WILL LAY 300 MILLION EGGS AT ONE TIME. 300,000,000. IT SURVIVES BECAUSE IT WOULD BE STATISTICALLY IMPROBABLE, DARE I SAY IMPOSSIBLE, THAT THERE WOULDNT BE AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE 300,000,000 (that is EACH time they lay eggs) LEFT SURVIVING AT THE END OF THE DAY.

And this concludes why I hate the fuck out of this complete failure of evolution, the Ocean Sunfish. If I ever see one, I will throw rocks at it."

It can also stop him from scratching furniture, as cats will typically only do that as means of dulling down their claws. If he's still itty bitty, you should start touching and playing with his paws now so that he won't be confused and combative when you try to do it later on. Usually the soft paws claw caps will be last resort for when trimming the pet's nails is absolutely impossible. Some people have luck with them, others do not. Some cats can be very bothered by them, though at the end of the day, it's *way* better and more humane than declawing.

My entire act as the doctor was to keep the crowd on track somewhat (not give answers but at least steer you right when you were way off) and otherwise act like the virus was taking over (so I coughed, acted weak and dry heaved a lot).

We made it a long drawn out struggle so that with two minutes left she continued chasing people while I laid on the floor ‚Äúunconscious.‚Äù While on the floor, I popped in an Alka-seltzer tablet so that when it fizzed up, I backbended up like Linda Blair and spider walked after everyone.

They screamed, banged on the door to be let out, and collectively sounded like a herd of elephants. 

It was my most epic scare ever."

14494,"I can‚Äôt speak for them, but this is how I think of it.

Look at wine like a diminishing return curve.  There are few wines that I would say are undrinkable.  There are even some box wines that I would say are okay.  The more work they put in, the better it gets.  However the better they make it, the smaller improvements are made, the fewer people are able to recognize it, the smaller the market is.

I used to raise beef.  Similar process.  If you serve me a steak, I could grade it for you and give an approximate rundown of the animal‚Äôs breeding and life style.  Could most people do that?  Heck no.  Would most people be able to taste and feel the difference in the meat?  Heck no.  Would I appreciate it?  Yes.  

For most people, meat is meat, wine is wine, cheese is cheese, etc.  You can produce better products and put a lot more effort in than average, but that means the consumer has to be trained to notice the differences and (this is the big part) has to agree that the mild improvements are worth the money.  

I recommend that you watch the documentary Somm.  It covers a lot on the wine side of this debate.

Edit:  Removed ‚ÄúScotch is Scotch‚Äù since it seems contentious.  I personally don‚Äôt believe that, but I know people who can‚Äôt distinguish between Dewars White and something nice like Glengoyne 18."

14497,"Andrew Jackson was the first president that made major efforts to improve relations with various native tribes across the country. His administration established the Indian Affairs bureau. He signed dozens of treaties and negotiations with many tribes across the country. He even adopted two Indian sons.

The Relocation act for which he is so often criticized, was proposed as a more humane alternative to what his opponents sought, outright extermination and genocide. Even the trail of tears, and the brutality that occurred during it, happened under Martin Van Buren. Jackson had promised them rations, wagons, and doctors, but Van Buren only send soldiers, and only after the Georgia tribes refused to leave as agreed upon by their leaders.

This is not to say Jackson is a good person, or even a good president. He owned slaves, just as most men of his status did in that time. He personally killed and injured several people due to his predilection for dueling (mostly, he dueled people who insulted his dead wife). His personal beliefs on banks may have caused a major financial crisis. And he did introduce the spoils system, where he appointed party lackeys to cabinet positions, a detestable custom that lives to this day.

Jackson was definitely not some upstanding figure that we should put on our money (funny thing, he hated paper money, and he would really not give a shit about being on the 20), nor was he some genocidal villain."

I'm 18 on Friday and I will be able to go on the council house register and get my own place. I haven't seen my biological family since that night and I now consider my boyfriends family as my own real family

14523,"Sleeping with my best friend from high school.

We had a very, rock solid friendship. We talked on the phone on an almost daily basis, we lived a 10 minutes walking distance from each other, we hung out almost every weekend all through our high school years, etc. It was as cliche as it sounds: we were both outcast, with she being a goth and me a geek, I initially had a crush on her, however 1 year into our friendship she got a boyfriend (great dude #1). 

The best part is that I quickly moved on, and we remained best friends, I got a girlfriend, etc. She got me into liking artsy stuff, I got her into trying things such as dive bars and 80's music. She broke up with the guy, yet he became and remained one of my best friends, as well as the friends he and I had in common.

She got another boyfriend, and god damn was he a great guy too; we became good friends, he let me into his circle of friends, etc. In a way she was the center of a big social circle.  Future seemed very bright, and we truly pictured ourselves as this big extended family. This went on until we were 20. I broke up with my then girlfriend, as we were growing apart. She was having a rocky patch with her then boyfriend (great dude #2). All of the sudden I realized we hadn't talked to each other in 3 months or so, even her boyfriend let me know, and boy was she mad.

We started talking again, and I will never forget how a simple and playful ""Hi handsome"" escalated into what I am now. We started getting flirty, each time more overtly obvious then the other. We were ""The"" best friends, so I guess everyone went in denial, even if sometimes we were being very fishy. We go out for coffee one day, full moon, one of those nights were the moon looks a tad bit golden. We kissed, and boy did we kiss. One of the best kisses I ever had. I remember that day I gave her a painting I had made, maybe that had something to do. We agreed to never do it again. We agree to say good bye to each other, for everyone's sake, and we meet for coffee again. I remember it being a rainy day, and we come up with the crappiest excuse to go to my house to show her something I made for her, and I don't think I have to state the obvious.

And it began, a 6 month emotional roller coaster of an affair. For that matter, by the end of the second month, everyone knew, and the consequences were disastrous. Again, most of my social circle revolved around her, so I immediatly became a pariah and with a good reason; as for great dude #1, he got angry I was going out with his ex behind his back, so he got very distant.  By the 6th month I found out that she was trying to make amends with the great dude #2, and that was completeley fine, however I didn't feel it was right that she was kind of seeing both of us at the same time again, so I took the initiative and told her it was over. That has been the only time I've been slapped by a person, and she slapped hard. 3 times. In a row.

I lost most of my then friends and acquitances. However, during those 6 months I grew as a person like never before, and my confidence got in the right place. She was always inspiring to me, however in that time she pushed me to pursue my potential, to know myself better and to explore new things, experiences, ideas etc. I never considered myself smart enough for a STEM career path, yet she motivated me into pursuing a biochemical engineering degree. In those 6 months I read dozens of books, travelled, met knew places, new music, saved money, applied to university ( and got accepted), got in shape, and got laid like never before. I would never do something like this again. I do feel guilty for all the chaos that ensued by acting so selfishly and emotionally irresponsibly. But it's nothing compared to the gratituted I feel towards her for sharing this adventure with me. It was the boost my life needed to get in track, and it did.

I haven't talked to her in 8 years, and I wonder how she is. Last time I heard, she was engaged to a quite good painter. If it's true, I'm happy for her. As for great dude #1, we made amends about a year after the whole affair thing, he's still one of my truest closest friends.

tl;dr: Had an affair with my best friend from high school. We destroyed our social lives, yet we grew as persons at an exponential rate."

14525,"Yes, it counts.

Badgering someone until they give in is not acceptable behavior. It's not the same thing as them saying ""Yeah, I want to do this!"". It's predatory.

14526,"I didn't realize or understand how utterly soul-crushing a lifetime of work would be. I never saved or invested any money in my 20s. Not that I had much money to put away, and I'm sure I would have found a way to spend it if I had, but any effort you can make to ensure that you can stop working as soon as possible will be godsend as you get older. If I could get into a time machine and go back, I'd see if I couldn't make the magical abilities of compound interest do a bit of work for me. Then I might have had a chance to actually retire at 65, perhaps even sooner. I can't see that happening now. I've been pretty steadily employed since I was 14 (45 now) and I just want to hang myself because of having to work my life away like this. It wasn't something I thought about in my 20s. Now, it consumes me."

In chronic alcoholics, Tylenol (APAP) is bad due to its harmful effects on the liver.

Drinking alcohol and consuming APAP acutely won‚Äôt have much of an effect. Actually, in APAP OD, it‚Äôs theorized that alcohol might have a protective effect due to competitive inhibition of the CYP2E1 enzyme (which converts APAP to its toxic metabolite, NAPQI). This, however, is only theorized and the extent to which it is helpful is probably minimal.

Regardless, Tylenol (acetaminophen/APAP) is dangerous in high doses, and symptoms usually do not appear until a day or two after ingestion. Many people do not realize that it is in many other drugs as well, which sometimes can lead to unintentional acetaminophen overdoses "

My neurologist basically told me there's essentially 3 labs in the *world* that are set up to detect this particular antibody.. So it'd never be caught in regular blood donations and that if I do donate my blood it stands a good chance of causing serious issues.

Which really sucks because i donated blood nearly 20 times before this happened (this condition started when I was 25), and I really thought it was a good way of helping people. "

So people were always leaving and entering at different times. But that I would check it out.

So I went ahead and checked the cameras to see what was going on. That night our maternity ward was pretty shallow and we didnt have hardly any visitors for the ward. We had a feature on our cameras that could catch any movement and would highlight that time frame on the cameras.

An employee at a pizza restaurant was cleaning the pizza skin roller (basically a machine with large solid metal drums inside a contained unit that when you drop the dough into the machine it flattens it out to make a pizza). He decided it would be smart to open the door covering the heavy metal rollers and bypass the safety switch so the rollers could be turned on without protective door. He did this so he could apply pressure from a scraper to the rollers to clean the rollers, which was much faster than manually advancing the rollers a notch at a time. The result? His had slipped while the metal rollers were spinning. It pulled off two fingers completely and crushed them beyond recovery, pulled one finger off at the second joint, and crushed the end of the fourth one. His thumb was unaffected. In addition to the damage to his fingers his hand was completely de-gloved (all the skin from the wrist of his hand pulled completely off.

[Here's the Riviera in 2016 Tented](https://vitalvegas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/riviera_demolition_061916_5.jpg)

This is the Monte Carlo tower, constructed and opened in 1974 if my files are correct (what you see covered in plastic) It was discovered to have asbestos in the outside covering, so they did this and when it was removed, everything was bare.

Now curiously, the original building from 1955 was (is?) loaded with asbestos. I have construction documents where they mixed in asbestos fibers into the concrete to give it fire proofing. 

The two buildings you see in the lower corner of the photograph (actually one) are the original 1955 buildings. None of these got tented. The insides did have asbestos removal done, but nothing on the outside. So who knows?

Maybe they found nothing, but the property from the get go always was fraught with problems. Pictured Monte Carlo tower was literally sandwiched against the original building. Starting at the 4th floor (Mediterranean Tower North) you had a window, but it couldn't open for fresh air. Smack against the larger tower. The place was cobbled together over the years. Monte Carlo Tower was built first, then the Monaco Tower which came around in 1988 was ""notched"" to fit close to the Monte Carlo.

Starting with the Dunes in 1993, they pretty much just blew up buildings and many people are rightfully suspicious if asbestos blew out everywhere.

If you've seen mars attacks, you've seen the implosion of the [Landmark Casino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SiNeuuQXmM) (Note the temporary billboard for the galaxy casino in the bottom right of the video, this is the name of it in the movie)

Can't pin it down, but this is one I believe folks started getting pissed off at the asbestos issues. Just rumors, I can't fully vouch if they removed all asbestos or just piled the dynamite in and quietly pushed the plunger.

Hopefully he has some proof of the issues he experienced. Could make caesars recent bankruptcy look like childs play




EDIT: I forgot to mention that with the Riviera, in the late 80's or so, it started having to deal with regulations involving asbestos. The Versailles show room (home to Liberace, rare appearance with [Elvis In November 1956](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPxNnV_VMjw) In what was known as the Clover Room then) Had two choices: you either removed it ($$$) or used a spray in sealant and slapped asbestos warning stickers on treated areas. They chose the latter. 

I saw this in 2015 when I was documenting the property during a fixture sale. Some plans I found in a storage area showed it has a asbestos fire curtain, that was not existing in 2015. Long removed. This theater also had the long running show [Splash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1YMvxEiDw) in it.

Asbestos is still technically in many goods. Armstrong linoleum that I removed from where I grew up when I was 16 (house built in 93) supposedly had asbestos in it. No protection, just ripped it out, heated it up, scraped up, etc. That was 18 years ago, who knows what goes on...

Once we got underneath it, we saw it was a child's doll that had been stripped and hung in the tree by the neck. Its hair had been brushed forward, obscruing the face. It had obviously been there a while because the hair was matted and discoloured.

14686,"This is the part I don't get - you're in a public restroom, like at work or something.  You take the cup out, dump it into the toilet.  Then what? You look around for another place to put it down, like on the little trash can or on top of the toilet paper rolls? Maybe you even get it it's own piece of toilet paper to rest on.  You then wipe up yourself, pants back on (but now with no cup in?) and then you grab the cup.  You walk to the sink, where other coworkers may or may not be.  You wash the bloody cup off, maybe wipe it off too.  Go back into the stall - put the cup down again, pull your pants back down, reinsert it, pull pants up again, and exit stall for the second time, then wash your hands and finally leave?  And hopefully no one was waiting for a stall during this whole process.

Before we started making out, she admitted she had liked me throughout high school (as I had liked her throughout high school), and was wondering why I never asked her out. God knows what happened to that sentiment for part 2 but it got me thinking about how there are two people involved in the transaction and who knows how many times I missed the openings distracted by my self-pity.

She supposedly liked me for who I was at a time when i has resigned myself as a permanent friend zone fixture‚Äîthe problem wasn‚Äôt me, it was how I viewed myself.

After that, I tried to take the pressure of not getting any off and focus on what it is about me that I like. I figured someone would come along who also liked those qualities and, as long as I stayed true to who I am and what I was doing, the openings would reveal themselves.

Shortly thereafter, I met a girl on the train who I clicked with and asked out on the spot. She politely declined as she had a boyfriend but, for once, i didn‚Äôt let it get me down. We‚Äôd see each other occasionally on the train and chat a bit here and there, never forcing anything, just enjoying the company.

14694,"'my dog barked at me weirdly, now my dead husband is texting me??? [part 345]' didn't give it away to you?"
14695,"Well there are three main reasons why people who believe in a religion get upset or aggressive if you don't share their views.

1 - They are bad people who are using religion as an excuse to be bad. In every single religion in the world, there is at least one minority group that is very violent or oppressive. 

2 - They believe that their belief is the objective truth, and they feel insulted if you question it. Imagine if you were talking about how beautiful your bird is, and someone tells you ""Birds don't exist."" If it's one random person, it will sound absurd to you. But imagine if it's dozens, hundreds, thousands of people. You will start feeling insulted, because you know for sure you have a bird, and people are telling you that you're crazy.

3 - They truly believe that religion is good, and they just want to share it with you. All religions have this one thing in common: The afterlife will be filled with good fortune for everyone, but you have to do certain things to be able to enjoy them. One of those rules, in all religions, is to believe in the god(s). So if you tell someone you don't believe in a god, to them, it means you are less likely to go to heaven and they get upset. 

So yeah. I was raised very religious (Anglican) and my parents fall somewhere between 2 and 3. They find it slightly insulting to have their believes questioned, and think that bringing me back into religion will save me. The difference being, in Christianity, even non-believers can go to heaven if they are good. So they aren't too pushy with converting me back."

She was adopted by an Amish family at a fairly young age,and made to do such hard work,she almost couldn‚Äôt have kids, when she finally did leave and marry. She often talks bout how as teenagers,most of them would sneak out, change into normal clothes and ‚Äúcheat‚Äù. They would often use a normal neighbor to see tv and to drive them. But the reason a lot of them don‚Äôt leave, is because it means you never see the rest your family again. They purposely keep the children brainwashed and isolated. There is a lot of abuse and such but it‚Äôs never ‚Äútalked bout‚Äù. she essentially talks bout them years and years later as a fucking cultist most of them are. But they get away with it cause people see them as ‚Äúhomely people just wanting a relaxing life ‚Äú . Also we NEVER bout animals, from auctions, from the Amish, since if they were selling an animal it was in the last leg of its life. They use there animals hard. especially there horses. I seriously don‚Äôt get people who use loopholes in every area of there faking religion. Like god somehow won‚Äôt notice there use of loopholes,and Amish people are always doing that crap. They are just like any other group of people, some are good some are assholes, but what sucks bout the Amish, is that they use their religion to get away with some horrible culture shit. Fuck them, and all the other religions like them. You should look up there child adoptions sometime. It is essentially child slave labor, they use to boost there horrible inbred gene pool. It‚Äôs disgusting. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of ‚Äúgood Amish ‚Äú but it‚Äôs still a cult that makes it very hard for children to choose a new form of life. There year of fun is used as a loophole for parents to get modern conveniences, as much as the kids.

 I decided to stay in the car. Apparently her cart isn‚Äôt where she left it. Instead of looking for it for 5 minutes she decided to get a new cart and go through Wal Mart to pick out everything she wanted again.

In the book Manhattan leaves because he‚Äôs simply outgrown humanity and considers creating life like it‚Äôs nothing. When Adrian desperately asks him if his plan works out in the end, Manhattan responds with ‚ÄúNothing ever ends Adrian‚Äù and disappears.  

The movie leaves you feeling hopeful, but the book leaves you realizing how insignificant we are and how even a grand scheme like Adrian‚Äôs plot has very little impact in the long term. The stinger at the end where they find Rorschach‚Äôs journal adds to this effect and leaves you feeling hopeless about humanity. Compared to the book, the movie actually has a happy ending. "

14746,"Posted from a previous thread.

So it's been an interesting month so far.
2 months ago, i realized that i was depressed, and sat my wife of 16 years down to talk to her. I said that I knew that I wasn't being the best husband in the world, but I had eventually figured out what was wrong with me, and asked her to stand by me while I got help / worked through it. She looked at me, stood up and walked away. Fine ok, whatever. almost 4 weeks ago to the day, she asked me to leave, and said that she was filing for divorce. I was blindsided to say the least. It came as a huge shock.
I absolutely love this woman, more than anything. The shock. the disbelief. I asked for marriage counseling, and she refused.

So I packed my clothes and a guitar and I went and crashed on a friend's couch until I could make a plan to get somewhere to stay. I'm not proud of it, but I begged, and I pleaded, but she bluntly refused.
We have 2 kids together also by the way. 12 and 9.

So, with the previous depression, and this news it was all too much. I started drinking. Heavily! I called her one night to say goodbye, and to tell the kids that I loved them.
She talked to me for an hour, and the next day threatened to for me to never have / see the kids again.

So I got a physiologist, and quit drinking on the spot. Yay I'm 2 weeks sober. As you can imagine, there is no appetite, and no sleep, so I have been reading. Reading on how to cope with the devastation, and loss. How to become better. I mean this woman, and my children were my life. So anyways, I was reading an artical, and suddenly realized that I had been abused by her for the last 3 years. Oh the emotional abuse was fucking terrible, but also the social abuse, and lets not forget the physical abuse. I have pictures of my bloody lips, black eyes and scratches on my face., and I was making excuses for them at work. I am not a small guy, but how the fuck did I repress this? How did I allow this to happen?

So it came out last week that there is someone else. She admitted it to my face, but won't tell me who it is. I know who it is. I looked into my best friends eye, and I knew.
I just walked away, because I will kill him.
I hope they are happy together, but if they mistreat my children, there will be hell to pay.
I have nobody to talk to about this, except the psychologist. I feel a lot better today after the realization. She is a narcissist. So, back to the beginning. She was abusing me, I started drinking and withdrawing and became depressed. She blamed me for the breakdown of the marriage even though she is fucking someone else.
Sorry for the wall of text, but this is my life at the moment. So please reach out, say hello. I'm so lonely at the moment.

TL;DR Wife of 16 years, abuses husband, fucks his best friend and divorces him. So I cry. I cry a lot. :(

14796,"I have gone from being poor to being what is considered very well off in my neighborhood, and my neighborhood is one of the most expensive cities in America.

Things I do now that I did when I was poor:

**Bicycle everywhere.** My bicycle is a much better bicycle now though, and I have a bicycle trailer for carrying lots of goodies and a dog.  I bicycled with my Dad and it gives me a lot of happiness to do it. We didn't share much together but that's one of my long lasting memories of him. We live 9,200 mi apart now so it's the little things.

**Cook at home.** I cook with fresh ingredients more often because I can actually get to the store due to different living arrangements, but I cook at home because I enjoy it.

**Grow houseplants and kitchen herbs.** All the money in the world can't force a plant to grow. It can give it a better chance, but in the end some things just aren't meant to live. Nothing quite beats fresh herbs in cooking too.

**Eating strange looking and tasting food.** Before it was aunts and uncles offering me strange ethnic foods. Now it's that I seek them out myself.

**Go camping.** I use a $40 tent, a cheap blanket and a very old air mattress that still holds air.

**Helping people.** I was brought up that way. I give because I've received. I know what a difference that makes.

**Build things with my hands, especially when helping friends do it.** Main difference is the tools I use now are [Lie-Nielsen planes](https://www.lie-nielsen.com/nodes/4063/handplanes) instead of the cheaper modern [Stanley ones](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/4322255435086437752?lsf=seller:1135568,store:10420836360621222162&amp;prds=oid:10050239711189708576&amp;q=stanley+no+5+plane&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hnE2W42cLLyx0PEPhrya2Ac&amp;lsft=gclid:CjwKCAjwsdfZBRAkEiwAh2z65iW4oa7_5bRcMOgUNCRLr8cZa7_J_amn3iWnIKrymext-UXM2mfBBxoC_q8QAvD_BwE). Building things is cathartic to me.

**Eat McDonalds, in particular their super cheap ice cream cones.** Not that often, not very much, but like mac &amp; cheese for most Americans, the soft serve ice cream cones remind me of driving my mum to McDonalds and sharing ice cream with her.

**Use cheap cutlery, plates and cups.** Cookware and kitchen knives, on the other hand...

**Walk the dog, and take her to the dog park.**

**Buy last-gen electronics for many things.** Latest gen usually doesn't have the bugs worked out yet.

**Take a canvas bag with me when I go shopping.** I use a pretty fancy hemp one now, but it's still the same thing.

**My love of zip ties and duct tape.** Still the best way to semi-permanently affix many things to other things.

**My immense dislike of police and most authority figures.** You can't change negative experiences in the past with positive experiences in the future.

**Have a housemate if renting.** I'm pretty easygoing and I like coming home to someone else, even if we fight a little. We grow and learn about ourselves during moments of conflict and resolution."

14808,"I don't necessarily think character traits are, in and of themselves, a determining factor to ""great"" success. Luck has a lot to do with it, as do socioeconomic factors. We all love to believe in rags to riches stories because they sound nice, but to be perfectly honest, experience tells me that most kids sit on a typical bell curve and that the system is designed for most of these kids. Most people generally end up being average. Some will flunk, some will achieve great success. 

That said: Resilience is a word that has been thrown around a lot in the past 20 years.  I think kids who are resilient have an understanding that success requires effort. If you want to excel, you need to be able to (read: have the capacity to) bounce back from adversity, pull up your bootstraps, and do the work. This is harder for some than others, and there are many reasons (personal, economic, health related, systemic...that's an entirely different thread). I really believe in the [Carol Dweck](https://web.uri.edu/newstudent/files/Yeager-Dweck-Mindsets-that-promote-resilience.pdf) model of resilience as well as her stuff on the growth-mindset (every teacher should read) because it works with every level of intelligence, and is especially effective for gifted kids who have decided to phone it in because things suddenly got hard and they figured that this *gift* they were born with went away when things in school got a bit harder. 

Support systems go with work ethic, and this goes with everyone in every area of the learning curve.  Kids who have experienced poverty or trauma have been shown to be more successful when they have a thing or person to attach to...someone to give them meaning or a reason to keep coming to school every day. I don't see how this would be any different for any child. A lot of kids - outside of the norm or not - benefit from sports or arts because it provides them with that much needed stimulation as well as social connections that they might not otherwise have. Band class is a great social equalizer for an outlier (kids with high intelligence are most certainly outliers, but a lot of them flounder later in life because they have no social skills), and it also teaches them that they need to work (ie practice their instrument) in order to improve. They'll also be forced to learn some social skills with students all across the spectrum because teamwork is pretty much thrust upon them. Sports can have a similar impact. Any academic subject can, really, but music and sports are great for the brain and it tires them out. 

Take home message: Students need to know that work = improvement, and they need something to derive meaning and value from to keep them motivated. There are many reasons for this. "

That said, my wife is more than happy to fuck me in the ass until I'm rock hard and all revved up to fuck her right back. It really gets me ready to be a goddamn piston. Guess we're both switches?

14858,"Not exactly.  In that state of dehydration your kidneys are not receiving as much blood as normal (because you have less volume in your blood vessels due to water losses), so they are already working hard to keep up filtration pressure, and by taking NSAIDs you just inhibit that hard work and worsen kidney function.  Assuming you are healthy, you should still have some kidney function, but it will be diminished (the extent to which depends on how volume depleted you are and how good your baseline kidney function is...if you are old, diabetic, or hypertensive you can get in much more trouble).

There are other disease processes that create what is called ""low effective circulating volume"".  This means that the kidneys are detecting less blood flow and attempt to increase filtration pressure by altering blood flow to continue doing their job.  Heart failure causes low effective circulating volume since the heart can't pump blood efficiently through your body.  Liver failure does this because fluid leaves your blood vessels (called ""third-spacing of fluid"") and goes into places like your abdomen (ascites).

If you're well hydrated and you don't take NSAIDs chronically/often they aren't much of a problem (unless you have chronic kidney disease ...then you try hard to avoid them).  Do not take them before/during sports or exercise, and make sure you are drink plenty of water  (for the sake of your kidneys), and eat food (for the sake of your gastric mucosa) before taking them."

For teens- Not leaving the house. A lot of teens who do online school leave the house minimally. Also poor hygiene and self-care in regards to appearance. 

For young adults/adults- Sleep pattern changes for not-desirable reasons. Not like ""omg this Netflix show was so cool so my partner and I stayed up and watched 2 more episodes and now my sleep pattern is whack!"" or even ""I don't want the weekend to end so I stay up late Sundays!"".. but more so people who are tossing and turning, bad dreams, night terrors, general insomnia, excessive (or even regular) using of medication to aid sleep, etc. "

14976,"Yes, the basic idea is that the Old Testament commands are part of the Old Covenant and the New Testament is under the New Covenant. The Old Covenant revealed much about the nature of God and much of it was to be continued through all time, but some elements of it were just to show a distinctness between Israel and other nations or something like that.

When the New Covenant came along, the nature of God and his basic will is still in effect, but some of the extra trappings of the Old Covenant were fulfilled by Jesus and therefore no longer necessary for those under the New Covenant, and you are correct that most of what people know about the New Covenant comes from the New Testament.

There are some Progressive denominations that believe it was a prohibition against male prostitutes, but that really just moves it back a little further, because then you have to ask why single out male prostitutes? If the Bible were just being really progressive it would either mention both types of prostitutes or not mention prostitutes at all. Furthermore, it's not just that the New Testament mentions homosexuality, but that it reaffirms the Old Testament teachings on human sexuality in general.

Now, I don't believe all of that anymore, but I still maintain that even if the Bible has its problems, it's not inconsistent for a New Testament believer to believe certain parts of the Old Testament are for them and not others."

I thought that was an awful way to run things, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized they had to think that way because their resources were so limited they could only help the worst 5-10% of cases anyway.

They were banging on the door and screaming in the yard. Lucky my husband was home at the time and rang me at work. I felt so violated and angry for my son. I called the police who went and spoke to the father later that day. My husband answered the door while I was calling the police and offered to meet him down the street man to man to discuss it but as per a typical bully, he skulked off. Taught his son a revolting lesson on how to treat people with special needs.

15070,"That depends on the situation. If she is young, clearly nervous, edging away or otherwise trapped (either him leaning over, or due to their job e.g it‚Äôs a customer being creepy) then intervening is good. I am very grateful for the man who spoke up for me and told the guy to move on when I was being harassed at a bus stop when I was 15, for example. The creepy guy was making very uncomfortable comments and I was scared to engage. I think that is common enough - someone who is being creepy to a woman is being creepy usuallt because they are trying to actively intimidate her, or exert a form of control, or make her feel uncomfortable. In those cases it should be obvious why an outsider who is *not* being harassed, intimidated, made to feel small or made to feel humiliated could and should step in.  If I see someone being creepy but potentially ambiguously, I will at the very least give a small smile, move closer to the woman or otherwise show I am aware something might be wrong. 

Moreover most women do not engage because engaging can just encourage creeps - I mean, I avoid all eye contact because that encourages them. So a woman might not want to tell the guy to stop because it could incite attention, greater harassment, verbal abuse, stalking and even violence depending on the situation, or has been socialised not to speak up. In some cases, it won‚Äôt be clear if someone is being a creep - but if it seems obvious to you, just checking if the woman is okay, or standing in between her and the person, or otherwise making it clear that someone else is paying attention is important. I dont see why it‚Äôs up to the victims to defend themselves constantly, when they‚Äôre the ones being potentially harassed or intimidated. Moreover, a lot of the sleazy things won‚Äôt be said in front of the girl/woman, it might just be a comment to friends, in which case it‚Äôs up to the people he‚Äôs with to judge and tell him it‚Äôs not acceptable."

15107,"The midweek flights thing is only partly true, and much less so now that people think they've found a hack. It really depends on the routing. Prices are determined 99% by demand, not by the day of the week. Most airlines around the world have some kind of weekend surcharge so a friday-sunday flight will be a little bit more, but it's usually only like 20-ish dollars, depending on the route and airline.

The real determinate of cheap flights is how many people are booked on a flight. You just need to fly when no one else is. Often that is midweek, because the highest demand is friday through monday, but not always. Sometimes it's cheaper to fly weekends if your destination is a smaller one or you're going the opposite way to the traffic. 

The way to get cheap flights is to be flexible. Use sites that allow you to search multiple days at a time. Don't tie yourself to one airline if you can help it, and if you can, for international flights, use a travel agent. They often have wholesale deals you can't get online. "

One of the workers felt like this slowed him down so he cut a hole in the safety box to be able to just reach in and adjust the metal to the press... Except, the press came down ON his hand, leaving 4 of his fingers perfectly preserved inside the glove.

15130,"I worked rides for a few years in high school/college. One year I was assigned to a coaster that boarded while moving. Now, sometimes we would have company's buy out the entire park after close. This was one of those nights. 

I had worked an all day shift and the buy out so I was 150% done by the time close came around. One of the jobs at this ride was to group people into 4s before boarding so I was working that position. Since it was a buyout,  you basically loaded whoever was there though. These three girls come up, probably 7-11 years old and I get them on a car. Dad follows maybe 45 seconds behind and I tell him he can join his kids. Oh no no no. 

Dad proceeds to freak out that we let his kids board a coaster while it was moving. Hes screaming at me that it's dangerous and how dare we, etc. At this point, I'm done. I tell him I'm going to call a supervisor to talk to him and switch spots with a coworker. I call security instead and they tell me they will be over after finishing the sweep of the park. 

In the mean time, I call for a supervisor and this guy continues to scream at my entire crew. At this point he's watched his kids ride at least 4 times and watched us board countless other cars. Eventually he screams across the tracks at a coworker and I decide enough is enough. I call security's emergency line and call for a supervisor again. The supervisor sprinted across the park and starts trying to talk this guy down, showing him the operating manual, everything. Nope. Finally security shows up and escorts him and his kids to the security office. 

A while later I'm called to the security office to write up a report. While I'm there, I overhear the office saying this guy tried to fist fight the head security officer, a big dude, and because it was a buyout and they had the guys name, they were on the phone with the corporate office contact to explain the situation.

Then again then you'd have to spend your days selling pizza and you'd be limited to a pizza restaurant with one kind of pizza. But it works for Little Caesars. 

Where'as you could invest the $100,000 and make money from that pretty easily and just buy as much pizza as you want to eat. 

I guess i'd probably take the pizza because you could make more money from that in the long run. Make pure profit from you pizza restaurant and you'd probably have more money after a year than the 100,000 which you can then take and invest on top of having a pizza restaurant and infinite pizza. "

I‚Äôve worked with fighter pilots, hell I was raised by one (my dad). I can tell you that good fighter pilots don‚Äôt act the way maverick does. All of the ones I have met, had some foolishness, bravado, and an air of arrogance. When it was go time, all of that falls away, and there is only the mission. No goofing around in briefings, no disrespecting the one giving the briefing. 

Now, my dad has some interesting photos from intercepts that he flew, Russians holding coke bottles, waving, and such. Even though things like that were frequent, my dad was still ready to launch a nuclear rocket into the middle of that formation and kill every last one of them, to keep Russian planes out of American airspace.

By contrast, Maverick is impulsive, arrogant, and reckless. His antics put lives in danger, and he readily disobeys orders just because he feels like it. No one wants to fly with him because he puts himself before the team. His RIO is the only guy that puts up with him, until he learns that he needs his wingmen. Truth is, he never would have made it to Lieutenant, let alone TOPGUN. 

In fact, TOPGUN as a movie, has perpetuated the misconception of what a wingman is. There is a flight lead, and he has control until shit happens. After the flight engages, the role of wingman is taken up by the guy who isn‚Äôt engaged, in order to support the guy who is. It‚Äôs a role which can switch between people randomly, based solely on who needs their ass covered the most. It‚Äôs not a designated role outside of formation flight. 

Fighter pilots appreciate skill, confidence, and the ability to function as a team. "

What is important is it was a very professional environment. Everyday he'd put on a fancy shmancy suit and tie and work in a very fancy shmancy building. One day a new employee was promoted to his floor or something like that. The new guy was pretty young, like fresh out of college, almost. Turns out there were two other guys who worked with my dad that went to the same college as the new guy. I'll call them ted and teddy. Immediately the new guy started to look up to them. He'd go to them for advice and what not. After about three day's ted and teddy decided to play a prank on the new guy. So they decide they should tell him that the next friday was Hawaiian shirt day, but of course it wasn't. They tell my dad about it before hand and ask if he can email him about it too so it looks like everyone knows about it. My dad says he'll do it. So my dad emails the new guy about hawaiian shirt day. Then he email's his boss and fills him in on the situation, but instead of just ratting out ted and teddy, he and his boss organize an actual hawaiian shirt day and tell everyone in the office except ted and teddy. Mean while, my dad tells ted and teddy that the coming friday is corporate picture day so they'll dress super fancy.

That felt clap-worthy when we were on the ground. Another one where there was dense fog all the way to the ground and we were almost out of fuel.

15384,"I saw a theory that the whole thing was a metaphor for depression and humans‚Äô self-destructive tendencies.

Each of the women in the squad has their own baggage, and they each enter Area X as an indirect way of dealing with it. Their actions are parallel to how people deal with baggage in real life - some positive and others negative.

The psychologist turned to Nihilism, believing that the root of the problem is existence itself and that it‚Äôll never get better.

The tech girl tried to preach acceptance, but at the cost of one‚Äôs life. She wasn‚Äôt willing to do anything to fix her problem, so she chose to die peacefully and somewhat complacent.

The bear scene was a literal/metaphorical cry for help. She *wanted* to be herself again, but was fundamentally and irreversibly changed as a person.

The girl who got mauled by the bear was accidental collateral damage. The aforementioned girl lashed out and completely destroyed a friendship when all they needed was to stop and understand one another.

Natalie Portman on the other hand, wanted to confront her problems head-on. She didn‚Äôt want to wallow in her own sadness and instead went deeper into Area X the same way that someone would confront their fears to move on.

Also, in the scene with the alien, it represents how Portman gets in her own way, and that her only obstacle in life is herself. Once she realized that, she was able to ‚Äòdefeat herself‚Äô and escape Area X.

Edit: Hence, the entire movie had characters repeatedly answering ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù to seemingly obvious questions. When depression takes hold, it‚Äôs tough to really know why *anything* happens."

But her partner was well-off, and they would go on dinner dates once or twice a week. And she felt guilty. Because her family was living so limitedly but she had a fancy dinner out each week.

2) The movie would be over within minutes, because if they're following the Christian rules (see: the Bible), then they would go by the logic that Satan and his minions flee when resisted in the name of Christ.

The number of people afflicted with vocal tics is surprisingly small. Only about 4% of people who suffer from Tourette's vocalize. The tics themselves, be it an OCD style twitch, or facial blinking, tend to wax and wane as the person ages. It's entirely possible the interviewer had Tourette's, but for anyone stumbling on your story, Tourette's is still one of those afflictions people think are funny and are able to mock, and it's not. I don't mean to get on a soap box, but shit. Picture trying to contain a sneeze. That's what having Tourette's is, a perpetual sneeze held in that builds up and builds up until you release it. The fact that his coworkers were used to it gives me hope. 

I will never forget the day my brother's tic's blew up next to my then fiance. I completely forgot to tell her he had Tourette's, and she freaked out.

So he called him back with honors for leave time in hopes that her would have sex with her and everyone would think the baby was his. The husband didn't because Jewish laws about active duty soldiers said he couldn't. Frustrated David sent him to the front lines to die so he could wed Bathsheba and claim the newborn properly. Now he has blood on his hands. This was discovered by a prophet, who called him out, leading to some turmoil in the family. The newborn son died, but they had a second son. David loved the second son so much he claimed him as his heir despite the fact that he already had an elder son from another woman being bred for the throne. Elder son got pissed and staged a coup.

15643,"I'm going to throw another point out that hasn't yet been touched upon:

Firearms are ancient, simple technology. You can make an AK without power tools. The Khyber Pass has a cottage industry in hand-built firearms. There are families in the Philippines making handguns with files. Biker gangs in Australia turned to homemade sub-machine guns when the guns they used before became illegal. Gunpowder is high-school-level chemistry and in a home garage, a full-auto gun is easier to manufacture than is a gun that fires once per trigger pull.

People like to say that Chicago's gun control efforts failed because you can drive out of the city and find less restrictive laws, but all you need to make a shotgun is $20 and a quick trip to the hardware store.

My point is that the effort should be focused on preventing the causes of violence rather than wasting resources on a specific tool. Poverty, income inequality, lack of education, lack of advancement opportunities, a messed up jail system, social estrangement, media circuses glorifying shooters, ineffective suicide prevention programs, job cultures that disrespect employees, criminalization of addictive substances rather than providing care, a messed up healthcare system, and so many more factors contribute to violent deaths and can all be addressed.

Everyone could be armed to the teeth but if nobody had any reason to harm another human, nobody would. "

The first few times I took very seriously. But very honestly, the phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" became meaningless.

I can absolutely understand why she didn't react. And coming from my own personal experience, I think that anyone who enters into a relationship knowing full well that they are suicidal/depressed is really irresponsible. It puts an immense amount of psychological stress on the person that has to deal with it. Having a relationship like that ruined many of my friendships, I started neglecting important aspects of my life, and I started showing signs of depression. It's not right. Get help before you enter into a relationship. A boyfriend/girlfriend is not going to solve your problems, you're only going to pass it onto your SO."

Nowadays, your console is just a shitty computer. Under the hood, it's virtually no different than a (severely outdated) PC. And because devs tend to focus their development on the consoles first, you end up with games that could have been so much more, both visually and gameplay wise, but were held back by the arbitrary limitations of the console. 
 
And of course, the devs keep trying to push these consoles to their limits, but they often end up sacrificing either visuals or performance, leading to a dumbed down product in the end. And no, it is *not acceptable* for *any* game to run at anything less than 60 FPS. Ever. 
 
Meanwhile, getting into PC gaming is easier than ever, and no, you *don't* have to drop $3,000 on a PC just to game. I mean, you *can*, but you could easily get modern console quality graphics at 1080p or higher *and* consistent 60 FPS for around the same price as a console, if not *less*. Or you could just continue playing on a walled-garden console at sub-1080p, 30 FPS (on a good day) and with muddy textures.

15764,"This is the most important thing. Debt is what keeps people in poverty. Let's see the power of compound interest:

Suppose that, at age 20, you get a credit card with the most generous interest rate ever, 10%. For ten years you accumulate charges on that card until, at age 30, you owe $10,000. Which isn't much, it's $2.75 a day. And from then on, you ignore it and the card doesn't make you do any minimum payments. Then at age 65, you get ready to retire. You haven't made any more charges on that card. 

And yet you would owe over $280,000. They bought you a car; you bought them a house. 

On the other hand, suppose that you *saved* $10,000 by the time you were 30, and you invested in the S&amp;P 500 which has a historical return of about 10%, and that continued. Well, for going without $2.75 a day, you'd have that same $280,000. You would own it. 

But maybe that doesn't show you the power of compound interest. So one more thing. If you doubled those amounts, $20,000 in debt versus $20,000 in investments, you would, as it stands to reason, owe or own twice as much, $560,000. But remember that I said that 10% would be the most generous credit card interest ever. You might wind up with one that charges 20%. And in that case, with $10,000 left alone, you would not owe $280,000. You would owe $5,900,000. They bought you a car; you sold them your life."

And my step mom slept in the bed with my step sister (she and my dad felt weird sleeping together in the same bed so early in their relationship in front of their kids). 

Well, one morning I woke up to a squeaking noise. It was about 6am, so dim out... not dark. Not light. But still light enough to see silhouettes in the room. I opened my eyes confused as to what was going on AND MY STEP MOM HAD GOTTEN IN BED WITH MY DAD AND THEY WERE BONING!  I wanted to scream. Or make some sort of noise. But I was so traumatized that I couldn't move. Then when they ""finished"", one of them farted loudly. Then they made out. I was disgusted, traumatized, sick, and wanted to throw up afterwards. But I couldn't move and never wanted to go on vacation with them ever again. I threw a HUGE tantrum every time they suggested vacation. Of course they just thought I was being a brat, even though I told them they traumatized me that one time, and would often ground me and still force me to go with them and share a room.

15801,"Yes and no. There have been a lot of myths floating around about Margaret Sanger's beliefs in the past seven years. It's partly due to propaganda and partly due to changes in language.

When we say eugenics now, we're talking about racial supremacists, but in the 1920s it had nothing to do with race for most eugenicists, but more about living a clean, healthy lifestyle and having healthy children who are wanted by their parents. They thought cleanliness was a genetic trait. Hell, W. E. Du Bois supported eugenics, and he and Sanger worked together. WWII gave the word an extreme, negative connotation that it hadn't had before.

Sanger believed that people with genetic deformities or serious illnesses should not have kids, on the basis that it's wrong to bring a child into the world if you know they're guaranteed to have a terrible life. So yeah, she was a eugenicist, but not in the way you assume when you hear the word.

Republicans have claimed she was a proponent of racially-motivated eugenics, taking the first half of an unfortunate-sounding sentence out of context: ""We don‚Äôt want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs.""

She knew that in working in low-income, mostly black communities during a time when lynching was a serious problem, there would be distrustful people who would assume every white person was out to kill them and would start spreading nasty rumors. It would be better to work with local community leaders who could reassure people. She just phrased it really unfortunately.

There have also been rumors spread that she was involved with the KKK or Nazi party, which are completely made up.

For her time, she was quite progressive in matters of race. MLK Jr. accepted an award in her name, and praised her contributions to the black community and civil rights movement. He would have never accepted the award if she had advocated racial eugenics.

Like if a girl you barely know is coming to your house to hookup, chances are that she‚Äôs not on her period, and if a girl you already know is coming over, she either let you know beforehand, or has her own stuff. I mean seriously most girls have their own stuff on them at all times. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hookup with the kind of girl that depends on their hookups to stockpile tampons for them.

15809,"u/TheRealRaiden commented this when the story was reposted:

I'm sorry, but there's absolutely no way this could possibly be true. If a rapist was shot to death in someone's home, this is bound to be documented in the papers somewhere. Even if the victims' identities are kept private, there should still be some article published in 1995 that says something along the lines of ""The suspect, Julio Martinez, was shot by a home owner while reportedly in the middle of sexually assaulting his wife after breaking in"". There's absolutely no way this wasn't documented somewhere.
Except that article doesn't exist. Trust me, I looked. Unless this happened in some tiny village and for whatever reason didn't ever catch the eye of higher authorities (which it absolutely should have because, well, we're dealing with a murder and a rape here), this should have been documented in one of the bigger newspapers. The fact that it wasn't and there's literally 0 evidence to support it leads me to believe that, just like the stories about the guy whose son was raping their dog or the guy whose son was raping his mom who then killed herself, this is a made up story designed to shock. I assume that's also why the throwaway was used. As long as you're descriptive enough in your stories about a dark subject like rape or death (preferably both) people on Reddit are bound to believe you and spread your story like some sort of gospel."

The performance went really well, claps and cheers were had, and I was introduced to a friend of a friend who was quite lovely. I was openly flirting with her and it was all well received. The topic of potential significant others came up, to which she replied ""Well, monogamy just isn't really a thing to me"". *ding ding ding* That's the prize bell, folks! 

Shortly after, she invites me to stay at her place ""so I don't have to share a hotel with other bandmates."" I happily accepted the offer, and just to remove any shadow of doubt, said I wouldn't mind sleeping on the couch. She declined, said her bed would be much more comfortable *bow-chicka wow-wow* More drinks are had, my bandmates have companions for the evening, and we're all off to our respective rooms. As we laid down the mood changed... No affection, sad songs played on her phone, she was clearly missing some other dude, and my heart drops. I ended up laying there awhile and decided... fuck it, don't leave. Stay and just cuddle with the girl, which she was seemingly happy for. Woke up with a major case of blue balls and drove off to the next show. We kept in touch a little afterwards, I hope she worked out whatever she needed to."

Our party had gotten separated, we were all in some sort of trap house trying to get out, and in desperation my character picked up another player character who was a couple hp below zero (so unconscious and bleeding out), slung him across my back, and tried to run through three sets of doors (and avoid the traps around them) - now, my character was a fighter, highest stat was strength, second highest dex, so I normally had a good chance for carrying another character out, but the DM gave me severe penalties to all my checks on the traps for carting this other character with me (and because I was doing it running).

Bruce Wayne however, identifies much more with Batman than he ever did with the eccentric, millionaire playboy disguise he had on during the daytime.

Kill Bill quote:

&gt;Superman didn't become Superman. Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red ""S"", that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes. What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent. He's weak... he's unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race."

Everything is built from small things. What you have is yours, and yours alone. A small foam mattress may seem like nothing, but it's yours. Slowly, almost without you noticing, you'll gather more stuff. You won't even realize it. A book here (regardless if you buy it yourself or if it's a gift, or if it's found. Regardless if you read it or not...), some plates there, and all of a sudden you'll have yourself a little improvised home. Some things will be useless. Some things invaluable. What you will always have is *you*, and the stories you gather with you. Stories are terribly feeble when you experience them, but in hindsight, and most especially when we tell them, they are things of terrible betrayals, and wondrous adventures.

This too shall pass.

Everything changes. You won't be in this exact spot in 40 years. Things will have changed, for better and for worse. 

I'm sorry you went through that, it must have been awfully hurtful... I wish you all the best for the future."

16070,"When my parents were getting ready to divorce, they both made an agreement to have separate bedrooms. My dad used to pretend to sleepwalk (he used this excuse in case he got caught) and would just stand at the edge of my mom's bed to watch her while she slept. One night I slept in my mom's room with her and woke up to see my dad standing there. He obviously didn't realize I was in the room and freaked out. Nobody had believed my mom but from that moment on, I never doubted her.

A year later my father attempted suicide by gunshot and before he attempted to shoot the gun off, he told me he should have killed my mom when he had the chance. Which means all those times he had been standing in her room watching her, he was contemplating killing her. I still panic when I think about all this and just how unhinged my dad has become.

As a person that loves to cook, this is a bit of a misnomer especially for people just getting started. Building a pantry full of staples can get costly.

On the flip side though, I prefer the environments to Frozen much more than Tangled. I love Tangled‚Äôs beginning and end, but I felt like the middle dragged for a while. They were in an ordinary forest for quite a while and visited that random mine location. Whereas Frozen not only had beautiful winter scenes, but it was like the animators tried to take advantage of every idea possible they could do with the snow. I felt like with how creative those animators are, they could have come up with more ideas for the forest/environment scenes. Tangled does have some beautiful moments here and there (I mean that lantern scene OMG 10/10), but I felt like Frozen was consistently beautiful and appealing to watch throughout the whole film which is one reason I enjoyed it a little more.

16125,"After several terrible relationships that sucked the life out of me, I'll tell you the opposite traits of those people which are important to have in a guy and really any SO in general:

**They're trusting**\- If they're able to allow you to go out without interrogating you or making remarks that you're going to meet your ""other boyfriend"", then you're golden. But also, they believe the things you say and don't doubt you and/or your judgement.

**They stick up for you**\- If you're getting attacked by someone else, your SO should ABSOLUTELY step in and defend you, no questions asked. 

**They allow you to be your own person**\- If you have odd quirks, unique interests/hobbies, styles, whatever, they should be able to accept and appreciate those things. There should be no requirement to change and do something less (unless it's a negative aspect for both you and that person, e.g alcoholism). 

**How they treat retail and restaurant workers (yes, for real)**\- This may seem really small, but the way a guy or anyone for that matter treats waitstaff is a big indicator of the person they are. If they're polite, easy going, kind, and friendly to those in customer service, they're most likely worth keeping around. This includes how much they complain about the wait/food/staff when it's just between you and them. "

You feel they are trying to scare you so you pull off into an empty parking lot.  As soon as you turn off your car, the lot fills with cars quickly and again, every car has a straight couple.  They get out, and do strait couple things in front of you like holding hands and kissing.  Then you notice almost all the license plates are from the state you used to live in, but not the one you are in now.  Just like on the highway.

16154,"I worked at a very local California-Mex restaurant/bar. A family would sometimes come in, and I HATED THEM SO MUCH. They always had about 3-5 kids with them (I don't know if they were all their kids or friends too), and the kids were all dressed like little douche bags--pricey designer blazers over band shirts, expensive sneakers, fedoras and newsboy caps (these kids were a range of ages from like 5-9).

First, the parents would sit down at a table prepared for the party, but the kids would run off to a separate table. Didn't matter if it had a reserved sign on it, and the parents sure didn't correct them. After I had corralled them to an appropriate seating area, everyone would order drinks.

Parents: Oh, we want something like a margarita, but different, I think it had agave...the bartender knows what we like.

Me: Do you remember what the order was or if it was on the menu?

Parents: No...the bartender knows what we drink. Just go ask her. (includes a real nice shooing motion here)

So I go to the bartender to figure out what they want so I can enter it into the system, and she literally has know idea what they're talking about or who they are. I then go back to their table, and after I diplomatically deliver this news, of course they magically remember what drinks they want with no trouble. Then it's time for the kids, and these little fancy children order some pretty annoying things: root beer with grenadine and two cherries, sprite with grenadine and four cherries, you get the idea. I bring them all out their respective sodas with grenadine and three cherries each, and the youngest boy looks at me and goes, in the snootiest lil tone, ""I asked for *two* cherries."" Like, just take one out you entitled hellion.

So I'm ready to take their orders, but of course while I'm taking the parents' heavily modified orders, the kids all scarper to the bar area to watch TV. I ask the parents if they know what their kids want, and tell me the kids can order for themselves if I go ask them. Let me be clear, they want me to leave my tables to go track down each child and ask their order.

Eating is no better--the kids are throwing food at each other, demanding like three bowls of the complimentary salsas each and then not touching them, shooting paper straws, and just delivering an impressive amount of attitude. Do the parents do anything? Why would they?! And at the end of the night, with two tables just wrecked by food and wrapper, and having run myself ragged fulfilling tons of requests and modifications, their tip was shitty. Maybe 5-10&amp;#37; for serving two tables, custom orders, extras, and having to cater to little monsters and clean up their wild animal mess.

16197,"I went to work for a top 15 US bank. It was screwed from the very beginning. First job out of college so I don't know any better, I take it. It seemed simple, internal IT website support as a business analyst for an online auction. Nothing too technical. Turns out I'm customer facing customer support. Cold calling customers, helping them change their settings on their browser because our website is NOT COMPATIBLE with current browsers. It's only compatible with IE8. Also all our ""Tickets"" that we needed to resolve were tracked through this program called Microsoft outlook. Yes you read that right, we handled all tickets as emails, which I would receive 300-500 a day. Some were my responsibility and some were another team members responsibility but we had no tracker other than go through manually and make sure I respond. All emails were to be responded to within an hour, with a final resolution within 48. 

Now because our website was so fucked every morning we would have to come in and spend an hour on reports of information  to change information on auction listings. Everytime we did that, we would have to email the auction listings owner to let them know we changed something. We are talking having to email about 50-100 records every morning. It took me an hour plus to get it done. Since these reports were in excel, I started writing a script/macros to do it for me. I cut my hour plus morning time down to about twenty minutes. I let my boss know and offered to help out with her morning tasks. And ended up doing it for the whole team, making everybody's lives easier. 


The issue came was when they took that knowledge and ask me to do coding work to automate stuff for the whole department of like 50 people. It was a list of like 50 tasks such as creating an invoice generator out of an excel spreadsheet, creating access report generators through macros, all fun stuff. The problem was these were big projects somebody should be working on by themselves in their own job function. I was expected to do it while still doing my primary job of answering a crap ton of emails. 


It all came to a head when I got into it with my supervisor. I was working until 7 after working through lunch that day - normally I'm in at 7-45-8. I let her know that I'll be in late. I did all my morning reports at home before 8 and showed up at 8:30. I was asked why I came in late, and I said I've been working late on the project and I just needed some extra time to sleep and get ready slowly today. Her response was, you're expected to work 45hrs / wk minimum. And around 50-55 hrs a week normally. So you have your normal duties that last for 40 hrs a wk. ""Why do you think that it's acceptable to come in late?"" And then you should be doing the project on top of that. I then asked if I could get overtime because this isn't my actual job and I'm expected to work more than 40hrs a week. She said your salaried and you'll be working this much wherever you go and handed me the exempt non exempt labor  laws - like I'm a dumbass and in a very condescending way.


So being the bastard I am I decided would show up for my job 40hrs a week only. And do the most of my job function I could do in those 40 hrs. I ended up doing some research as well. I found out I was a different title than I originally applied for, I had different job responsibilities than I originally applied for, and they changed my salary structure to the different title. It was all a shit show. I bring this up to my supervisor and let her know that I would like to switch to a role that I am more suited for in the company after my year mark and I wanted to let her know so it's not a surprise. Because right now it's impossible to do my job function of answering emails and listening to calls while coding scripts for a whole department.  Her response? ""It would be selfish of me to stunt your career growth and I'd rather help you with this so thank you for letting me know""


That Friday at 4:45pm I get a lync message from my supervisor, ""hey can you come to room xxxii"" I show up and it's her and her boss. They have a performance improvement plan and some resources to make sure I get the mental health help I need to preform my job function. So I did what any reasonable person would do, I found another job with a 25% pay raise, closer to home with a better company. Once it was a done deal, I messaged my supervisor, ""hey can you come to room xxxxii?"" I handed in my two weeks notice, and this Bitch had the audacity to ask me to take my pto time during these two weeks. I was like nope, I'll work these two weeks and get paid my two weeks pto thank you.

Her friend then messaged me on the side saying ""holy shit are you blind?  She loves you"".

16209,"This is somewhat true. In the US, the FAA mandates all tandem rigs be equipped with an automatic activation device (AAD). There are a few different manufactures of AADs and they work slightly differently and the expected deploy altitude is slightly different. 

There is no danger to the skydiver or passenger during an AAD deployment. The deployment is the same whether skydiver initiated or AAD initiated. The only difference is the very first step of opening the container and releaseing the deployment bag (the bag the parachute is packed in). An AAD cuts the loop of fabric holding the container closed, whereas the skydiver pulls a pin that is routed through the loop of fabric that holds the container closed. 

While AADs are a great piece of technology, do not think they make skydiving fool proof. There are many scenarios where an AAD will not save your life. The main reason AADs were invented were to deploy the parachute of an unconscious skydiver. They serve other roles today, but it is not something to be relied on and an AAD fire almost always signals skydiver error. 

Edit to add: they are not installed by someone ‚Äúoutside the facility.‚Äù They do require a master rigger to install them but almost all drop zones employ one or more master riggers. "

This is important because many, and I would guess most, places which will refill your tanks charge a flat rate. Also, an empty propane tank will/may make a whistling sound when filling starts. 

Some places may weigh your propane tank for you if you ask nicely (if they fill by weight). But really, be aware of how full/empty your tank is. You don't have to refill it after every use, but it's never nice to run out unexpectedly."

16344,"You car works by creating little controlled explosions that push down on a can called a piston. When this can is pushed down, it also spins a bar. This spin is then used to spin your tires and move the car forward. 

High performance cars usually have a lot of pressure in the explosion space, which can make gasoline explode before the can is ready to get pushed. To prevent this, gas suppliers add a chemical to the gas to prevent an early explosion. This chemical used to be called octane. The more octane, the less likely it would explode too early. Now, they use another chemical but the octane rating system stuck around. 

Your car is designed to run on a minimum octane rating to prevent early explosions. Failing to use the minimal octane rating gas can cause early explosions that push the can down too early and damage the engine in the long run.

Newer cars have software programming to lessen the harmful effects of not enough octane rating, but you should avoid that unless necessary."

16347,"I was at a political convention around 2004, and was there with a couple guys from Windsor. For those who don't know, Windsor-Detroit is one of the busiest border crossings in the world, and a ridiculously high percentage of Canada's GDP goes over that bridge. The bridge congestion was an issue at the time, so there was talk of building a second bridge, or possibly a tunnel instead. 

The two Windsorites started talking about the issue around midnight - one preferred the bridge, one preferred the tunnel. They kept debating this until 6 in the morning, long after everyone(but me, because I was stupid) went to bed. The really scary part? They both agreed on the core issue - each of them wanted a bridge *and* a tunnel. They just disagreed about which one should be built first. "

""Hey, here's this amazing technology that allows you to go into people's dreams. Just swallow that because we're never going to explain what it is or how it works. That way we can make up as many arbitrary rules about it as we need to as the plot goes along. For example, why does time run faster in each successive dream level? Because we need it to for the plot and I ain't gotta explain shit. Isn't that convenient?"""

16351,"Ghostbusters. The trailer came out and people hated it. A very very very small segment complained about the cast being all women. This got picked up as the number one complaint by news outlets. Sony had two options, they could ignore all the misguided attention and release the film as is and hope for the best or embrace the attention. They opted to embrace it and go with the feminism route. 



I cant say it helped or hurt them because at the end of the day the movie is pretty mediocre. They were probably screwed no matter what they did."

Also forgot about this. When you read Columbus' journal, you see increasingly dramatic descriptions of tumultuous storms where he thought he was going to die. You go to the Captain's journal corresponding to the same exact days, where he describes the weather as average.

Me, I still like listening to ""classic rock"" but absolutely also love listening to more recent music.  For example, [MK, 17](https://youtu.be/OaFavPu3o0c).   Love that song. Makes me feel young again. 

Another example, I was really anti-gay (due to ignorance) until I was about 25.  Then I started dating a gal who's brother was gay and my attitude changed drastically (this was the mid 80s and the poor guy died from AIDS though).

[The last of the seven deadly sins are wrath and envy and his target is the character played by Brad Pitt, the killer cuts off Pitt's wife's head and puts it in a box, to be delivered to Pitt while he and the killer are talking. The idea is to get Pitt's character enraged enough to kill the murderer and ensure that his ""legacy"" (the murder spree) will be remembered. He ties up the Envy death in his own planned death as he is the envious one.] (/spoiler)

Arterial blood is at much higher pressure, and the vein walls cannot handle it, and if the pressure gets too high the vein can rupture. This causes arterial blood to spill into the brain. 
Sneezing, bearing down (like while straining to poop) increases intracrainial pressure. Having extremely high blood pressure can cause this as well, which is sometimes the reason for death during excessive activity (liiike sex)."

I like this interpretation mostly because it neatly wraps up *why* humans gaining knowledge of good and evil is bad: It somewhat undermines God's gift of idea of free will by binding us to God's idea of objective moral values rather than coming up with our own through experience, which was presumably God's intent.

If you take it in the context of Christianity, it also fits with the concept of the Holy Trinity, in which the one God is represented as three persons in way that's comparable to the avatars of Hindu gods. In this passage, it would presumably be the Father who is speaking."

some minimal investment up front(pots+soil, bigger pots/something that can be made into a pot and more soil if you're lacking a garden, some fertilizer and some seeds), but after a while you'll mostly just be re-using the stuff you've already got(except some fertilizer, but that can be really cheap), you can also save your own seed. and then it starts giving back in the form of money saved on buying vegetables. 

I do kind of wish it would take more work though, this time of year I'm mostly just watching my plants grow, watering a bit and harvesting, nothing more to do(no weeding, I only have a balcony so limited weeds, I mulch and by this time of the year everything is big enough that weeds can't compete well anymore).

it also combines well with cooking, I can grow more unique ingredients that are not available at the supermarket, and I have plants that do so well/are fun to grow that I'll be forced to think of more ways to use the harvest so it doesn't go to waste, and I won't get bored with eating the same things each time.

We're interested because we saw Tony become Iron Man, then have to defend against losing his life. Saw his rise, saw his almost fall.

In Capt. America, Steve is a little dude who gets shit on, we see him go through training and selection against others to become the first super soldier and we see his rise into fighting to free those captured and to stop Hydra. We see his fall into the ice and waking up a long time later in present day. Saw his rise, and his almost fall.

In Black Panther, T'Challa was already the Black Panther. We saw him become king, but he was already a prince. He didn't fight the prince to become king, he was prince who fought to stay becoming king. We didn't see his training to become Black Panther, or any fear of possibly not being able to lead his people. He had basically no weaknesses or doubts. The only time he was ever in danger in the movie about Black Panther, is when he didn't have the essence flower stuff of the Black Panther in him."

16637,"Quit drinking.

I didn‚Äôt want to keep feeling the way that I felt when I drank, but I didn‚Äôt really want to stop. I had resigned myself to an early death. When I ran out of alcohol, I ended up at the hospital with the DT‚Äôs. Several unsuccessful stints in rehab. As far as I could tell, I was 24 and had fucked my life up beyond repair and didn‚Äôt have anything waiting for me in sobriety. Hundreds of thousands in medical debt due to being uninsured, my family couldn‚Äôt stand me, nowhere to live, no job, my health was fucked, I had no idea what the extent of the damage done to my cognitive functioning was, endless guilt and countless failures, etc.

In June 2016, I had a seizure at my parents‚Äô place while detoxing and ended up at the hospital again. The seizure was a new development, but I still have no idea why that time I chose to do something different. At every turn, I took a step towards sobriety even though I didn‚Äôt want to and had no fucking idea where I was going to end up. It was terrifying and as far as I could tell in those first few months I didn‚Äôt really have any reason to stay sober, especially since it meant dealing with the fallout from the chaos of my alcoholism. It is so fucking hard to make yourself not take the easy way out when you aren‚Äôt sure it will be worth it.

I have been sober just over two years now, and things have turned out a lot better than I ever could have imagined. Not drinking these days is pretty damn easy, but convincing myself to continue choosing sobriety was definitely the most difficult thing I‚Äôve ever done. "

Guy shoots up school. etc. [Relevant video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K3VQULyT390)

Aside from that, I think the problem is mental health more than guns. There's a reason people commit mass shootings (well, the reason is commonly the aforementioned media coverage), and that reason boils down to mental health. Let's say that you live in a country that bans guns entirely, you have a low mass murder rate. Hooray! Sounds great, right? Well, if a depressed person can't take their anger out on someone else, what's stopping them from killing themselves? Or hell, they could just run people over with cars, or stab people, or strangle them, or use a bomb, or even use a Molotov cocktail. You can't ban cars, knives, hands, fertilizer, bottles or gasoline. How about trying to improve the problems that cause people to commit violence?

And I'm sick of people targeting assault rifles in particular. Handguns are used way more. It might have started out with good intentions, but it's become a boogeyman that Democrats don't even know why they hate specifically.

16662,"Yeah it's becoming a big problem especially since it's so new that there aren't a lot of laws written concerning it but that has been changing recently. It happens when one spouse is more technologically knowledgeable than the other and has most of the control over the ""tech"" stuff in the household like passwords and how the router works. And the division of labor/mental load is pretty common in couples and there's nothing wrong with that. But using this knowledge as leverage to abuse/control someone is where the problem is. 

It really bothers me how too many people on reddit are judgmental of the spouse who knows less about technology and blames the victim but I think thats just because *they tend to be the technological literate partner .* and judge anyone who knows less than them.

After learning about this kind of abuse I've been more motivated in including my partner more in tech stuff, at least in the stuff that would concern her. Even if she finds it a bit boring or hard to understand. Not that I would use it in an abusive way but It really made me realize how me taking over 100% of the time might leave her open to potential tech troubles or dangers from others if I wasn't around."

The problem with any degree of success is that people are always going to want a piece of it without doing any of the work. Word got around that we lucked out and they just started coming. Like wolves descending on an injured whatever wolfs eat.

First it was relatives asking for money and handouts. Big money, not just a tenner. Then the ""friends"" rolled around with the sudden ""inspiration"" for businesses or needing a loan to do this and that. Then my bitch mother started to try and leech off me after my dad told her to go back to her cave. People expect you to pick up the tab and will react negatively when you don't, Christmas and Birthday gifts are expected to be lavish, they expect you to dress and act a certain way, events get turned into who can get me drunk enough to get something out of me and so much more.

I travel quite a bit. At least once or twice a month, if not more. That's when you see people get jealous. They'll leave nasty comments on your facebook posts, berate you for ""wasting money"", gossip about you and just be dickheads in general. It got so bad that I left facebook and twitter. So has my wife. We live fairly quiet lives anyhow. Sure there are some luxuries here and there which is cool and all, but the price you pay socially is quite high.

Now, before you think, oh it's some stupid kid ranting that having some degree of wealth is terrible. It's not, it's great to not worry about finances. I still work as hard as I did before the success, I still have the same circle of close friends, many of which contributed to that success and now enjoy it with me, I still dress the same (ok maybe I've got a nicer suit now, but that's it. None of that supreme or equivalent brand shite), I still talk the same, I still take the train sometimes when I can't be arsed to drive, I take the bus when it rains and I can't ride home, I eat at the same chip shop I have for the past 5 years and I don't spend lavishly at all. My monthly expenditure for 3 persons (and one more on the way) is less that ¬£2000 which is not bad considering we live in London. Small flat, by the way, not one of those eye watering expensive houses. Has great security and is cozy enough for 3.

I did splurge a little when the money became a little more disposable. Got a couple of nice cars, a motorcycle and a flat, which I still owe money on. It's good for credit ratings to not buy cash. Couldn't afford to anyway. Got a couple of guitars, a nicer hackintosh and some audiophile gear and that was it. I don't waste money on fancy restaurants, I don't drink anymore and we cook at home as much as we can. There were a few friends that I did help, mostly providing small sums of money as a startup capital (Usually meaning that I take some percentage of the business, mostly miniscule. Think Shark Tank). There were some investments here and there and that was absolutely it. I didn't need to spend anything on my wife. Her family is stupid rich. Fairly down to earth though. Gotta love the Scottish.

Ok I've been ranting a little too long here, but I had to get this off my chest. Don't let the username fool you, it was my runescape handle and I used to work in a hotel. Honestly, the only thing I care about is my wife and kids. Everything else takes the back seat in terms of priorities. Oh and I get to buy better quality weed, that's what I splurge on.

In any case, I hope this answers your question and it feels good to get that off my chest. You've got something to look forward to if you ever find your pot of gold.

Well I throw the ""party"". At first it was just supposed to be a handful of friends but they brought friends and they brought girls. It was cool they seemed chill. Hanging out on the deck, grilling, swimming. Fire pit and horseshoes going. 

I'm managing the music over by the pool and I hear a commotion on the deck. The slider is open and a small group is standing half inside and half outside. Suddenly the outside group just hurls a large frosted cake into the inside group. Chaos breaks out. Full on cake food fight. Cake and frosting every where on the deck and all over the floor inside. 

I could not believe my eyes. I just froze in horror. I literally could not move or register what was happening. It was such a foriegn sight- the house had never been desecrated like that. 

Worst part, it was the kind of cake with that bastard blue frosting thats impossible to remove. Obviously no one thought to help clean it up, and suddenly that group was off to some other party. My core group was kinda deflated cause they actually knew what just happened, (or how it felt to me). I told them it was fine and to just go make smores or something- I wanted to just clean the kitchen and then Id join them. I'm a quick cleaner so I was out like a half hour later and  on my way out I just poured some boiling water on the bigger frosting spots on the porch on my way back down to the fire. Figured Id just do the porch the right way the next day and enjoy the rest of the night, which we did.

My ex-wife for example changed her name twice; once when we got married, because her Dad was a murderer, and once when we got divorced, because she didn't want to be affiliated with me.  The legal paperwork for that is a huge pain in the ass; I'm convinced that there's a business opportunity per state to have automagically generated paperwork for all the various services you need to engage with to change your name, and potentially to pay someone to go to the various locations and do them all for you post marriage.

A friend of mine has a PhD and several published articles, but retained her name after marriage. It would have been too great a pain to change her name and try to connect all the citations in research papers to her afterwards.

Finally, if you're a migrant to this country and you get married to someone that's not a citizen, changing your name can invalidate your visa. You have to leave the country, redo all your paperwork again with the new name... it's a huge pain in the ass.  Easier to just keep your name."
16753,"Mike was about 45 and was brought into our small rural hospital who'd rear-ended a tractor trailer in his little Datsun pickup truck one night out on the two lane in Podunk, SC. The tractor trailer had been hauling a mobile home and when he struck it, a blunt 2x4 wedged through Mike's upper chest under his collar bone, through the apex of his left lung and came to rest against the inside of his shoulder blade. Another 2x4 penetrated his lower left abdomen, through his colon without coming out the back. The seat back kept it from going through. Just missed his ureter. He arrived in the ER with both pieces of lumber having been sawed off by EMS/Fire Rescue prior to transport. He was awake.

He was taken to surgery where the wood was eased from his chest, his subclavian vein and artery were mended and his pack of cigarettes was taken out of the wound (they'd been in his left breast pocket). The surgeon and first assist spent some time picking tobacco off his scapula and lung before closure. He went to ICU intubated with a colostomy, chest tube and antibiotics. 

About a month later Mike left the hospital. I ran into him in town about 8 years ago. He passed away from cancer a few years back. He said he saw Jesus that night. Jesus told him to stay calm because he was with him. I am not a believer, but I believe Mike saw him."

Mind you, this was on the day that I had told my parents I would be moving out in a month or two. I was 19 and my mother asked, ‚ÄúWell, why didn‚Äôt you ask us permission?‚Äù 

Inevitably there was an argument with them like there always was and then my own father told me, ‚ÄúYour mother owns half of you and I own half of you,‚Äù after he made me sit down and look up at him while he decided to stand over me. 

At the end of it all, my own father attempted to physically assault me in order to ‚Äúput fear into me‚Äù. I left fearing for my life that day. Never looked back. Tried to give my older brother a chance and talk to him a few months ago, but he is still controlled by them and tried calling me while our father was with him (I have a burner app for this reason; I don‚Äôt feel like I should be this paranoid when interacting with others) despite being told that I would only talk to him if he wouldn‚Äôt tell our parents and try to convince me to talk to them. The most messed up thing about this is that he was abused as well (i.e. being beaten with 2x4 by my father when my older sister would make mistakes). 

Another situation I can recall is in 4th grade when we were all lining up for something. I went to a private, catholic school and I think we were all lining up to go to the parking lot to meet up with our parents. It was a small school with small classrooms where everybody knew each other.

So the original guy then goes to social media and posts about how impressive the worker is for doing decorations like that without complaining, how his perspective has changed, and how everyone should be nicer and live happier lives.

Her problem is shes gone as far as to show them me and my wife and daughter on Facebook. 

So this lead to a guy messaging my wife on Facebook and saying hey I know your so and so's sister in law, i haven't heard from her in a few days and I'm supposed to pick her up at the airport in a couple of days. Apparently my sister told this dude she was moving from Alabama to California to open a flower shop and she wanted to meet up with him and all. Me and my wife are kinda pissed and i call my sister and go off on her. She plays dumb, but i keep at it and finally find out what it is. Shes a catfish. 

A couple of months go by and it happens again. I strait up tell the dude what's going on and not to talk to her. He had even put in some money towards something she needed for when she got to wherever he was. I go off on my sister again. And I told her I dont care what she does but dont put me, my wife, or my daughter YOUR NIECE! In the sights of these guys from the internet. 

It hasn't happened since but I'm relatively sure it's still going on. I also know this was going on while she was in a relationship. To add to her attention seeking, she also lies and exaggerates everything to make sure shes the victim, why the other day someone in Publix (the classiest grocery store) asked her why she was dating a N-word (hes mixed).

11 years ago, returbing from the millitary draft, 20 years old and having worked my old job again for 3 months, for some reason i maxed out my credit and gave all the money away to different people. 

I had about what translates to 10,000 dollars in saved earnings and then lent another 10k. (120,000 DKK). I was basically homeless a few months later, and didn‚Äôt get my own place for 6 years. (I didn‚Äôt sleep on the street more than a few days a month but never had a home) 

I always wondered, looking back, exactly why i did it. I guess i felt like nothing had much value maybe. I distinctly remember feeling that i‚Äôd not live much more than a year anyway. It doesn‚Äôt feel sad to remember because i didn‚Äôt feel sad. I just felt like it was probably over. 

When i did it no one was really that surprised because my dad had never had a job anyway. I didn‚Äôt like him and he‚Äôd always received social security so i definitely never wanted to do that - another stupid choice that meant reentering the system later was much harder.

She comes over to my place and while I'm trying to tell her how I feel she keeps trying to touch and kiss me while I keep pushing her off. I want to make it clear that I was OBVIOUSLY not interested in reciprocating.

After I tell her ""I really don't want to do that I'd rather just hang out."" She starts crying. Like bawling worse than I'd ever seen. She wants to hug and I feel terrible for making her cry but I say ""I'm sorry I feel this way but I just don't want to continue the relationship the way it's going."" She uses the fact that I was holding her and trying to console her to push me down and try to kiss me.

I have Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. My muscles are not very strong but I can get through in day to day life. However, I was not able to push 200 pounds of human off of me in the laying down position that she dragged me to.

I continued to say no and attempted to push her off of me to no avail. She pulled off my pants and held me down while she put me inside her and just used me to achieve orgasm. After about 10 minutes of it I just stopped struggling/moving and didn't know what to do. She eventually said ""why aren't you coming?"" When I didn't respond she got up and said ""I don't understand, are you not having fun?"" I told her that I repeatedly said no and I didn't want that to happen and I felt really shameful and embarrassed. She said she didn't know why, I obviously wanted it because I had an erection. I think her exact words were ""You were asking for it, you wouldn't have gotten an erection if you didn't want me."" I told her I felt just dirty and I wanted her out of my house. She said ""I don't like what you're implying. I didn't rape you you wanted it.""

I pushed her out of my house and didn't hear from her for a bit. I got a call a few days later of her trying to tell me she was pregnant and that she'd never contact me again. (She was never pregnant, she lied to try to manipulate me)

17093,"I worked for blockbuster during a lot of Store closures. My store was in the 3rd or 4th wave of closures. We were super slow but great % of sales. Anyway, I had made walls of boxes of movies to ship out to other stores.
We got sent all the crap from closing stores that didn‚Äôt sell until they told us to throw it all away. Books and movies went in the trash, 20+ wolverine figures went in the dumpster... I got a ton of the books and kept those. Cook books and such. 

I wasn‚Äôt able to be transferred because so many stores closed that all staffs were full. My store manager got demoted but with the same pay until a new district manager took over. She got ducked over big time.

My district manager actually passed away. Blockbuster was his first and only job and worked his way up from customer service to Keyholder, shift leader, assistant, Store and then district leader. His passing was completely unexpected and very saddening.

As far as staying and holding out. I got a severance for 8 weeks but because dish bought blockbuster I lost my last little bit. I tried to do a class action but the list was so long, I said fuck it. 

Still not a bad job, I love movies. What did make me sad is 2 weeks after I lost my job, I was staring at a red box and some guy asked me for a recommendation. I said, ‚ÄúTHIS IS WHY I HAVE NO JOB‚Äù and walked away. "

Hope forward to our wedding shower. Everything is going great until he breaks a single ribbon on a gift. For those who don't know, breaking a ribbon on a gift at a wedding shower supposedly means you're going to have kids. My mom immediately screams, ""Yay! So when do I get grandkids?""

I hear a voice whispering ""I'm going to call the fucking police if you don't get out of my house"". Then ""you won't steal any of my stuff, bitch"".  Muttering like that continues with increasing volume.  While she continues to talk I can hear her moving around.   The nurses rush in just as she opens the curtain between our beds.  This lady is 80 years old and up out of bed after bypass!   I understand now that it's normal for such behavior in elderly patients.  She thought I was breaking into her home.

Now lets split that gigantic sum, $89,700,000,000 / 300,000,000 = $299.

I love Janice. They use her sporadic appearances very well to play her off for laughs, but also she's one of the best characters on the show if you ask me. I didn't really care for it when she cheated on Chandler with her ex husband, but it was a better character arc than most of the gang's exes got (looking at you, Emily and Kathy). She seemed to be a genuinely good person most of the time, despite that the gang made fun of her constantly. She holds a torch for Chandler pretty much the entire show, usually unrequited, and in return is pretty much just used by him whenever he's lonely or it's used to manipulate her into leaving so Monica and Chandler don't have to deal with her."

As my mental health got worse and worse I reached a point where I wasn't enjoying it anymore. I dropped the class midway through a semester. The director (who I also know personally outside of school) reached out to me to ask if I was okay. It meant a lot to me that she noticed the red flag that I stopped enjoying something that was once so important to me.

17470,Yeah probably. I live in a small country and not really up for a long-distance relationship though. Have a feeling I won't meet anyone based nearby. But I guess it's worth a try?
17471,"Love is important, but it's not the only thing. Just like with your life. Love is important in everything you do. But you still have to brush your teeth, work out, and have some way of life where you can sustain yourself. Love is a big part of it, but it's not all there is. In a relationship, yes you have to work hard to communicate, set aside negativity to elevate each other, love, care, work hard, etc. You can work on a lot of things. Who does dishes. How to co-parent. But it's not that hard when you're with someone compatible. It's disturbingly easy when it's right. All those ""yes dear"" or ""happy wife happy life"" or ""the way to please a man is with his stomach"" awful relationship tropes go out the window because those don't matter. It's not about trying to please someone else to be happy. It's about being yourselves and it just so happens you do that stuff anyway. And you just work.

And it might take a few tries to find that compatibility with someone. You might have to go through a few relationships to find it.

Some people get in relationships with just one person and they're their first, last, and only. And that's awesome. And it's cool if that just is. That shouldn't be some standard or idol, though. Nor fully looked down on, but not some sort of goal. The reason is people discover themselves through relationships. What to do, what not to do, how to treat other people when they're close, expectations, what's reasonable, how to be good to another person, how not to be bad to another person. They fail in relationships. And through those failures, they learn. We all learn. And we grow in these relationships. Sometimes we're the hot mess and they don't work out because of us. Sometimes they're the hot mess. Or, sometimes no one's a hot mess and it's just time to keep moving forward in separate directions, and that's okay.

A number of things can be cause to move on. Life goals is a big one. Like you realize you definitely want kids, but the other straight up is cemented in their opposite choice. All the love in the world can't make that work. Or that you're dead set on starting your business in your hometown and she gets the dream job in the city she always wanted to live in. Even all the love in the world will build resentment if you stay together just for the commitment. Or say she wants a sex den and you want your aging mother to live with you. 

There's religion and parenting. Do you both see eye to eye on that stuff? Say you grew up in an abusive home and think it's okay to hit your kids. She believes the opposite. Can you two see eye to eye on important issues like this or even come to a compromise. Or with religion. Your partner is a strict catholic and you are Athiest AF. Is it essential that you raise your kid with religious values? Do you leave that decision to the kid? What if the kid is gay and your current view of religion is to be intolerant of that? Can your co-parenting move past that or work through it?

Compatibility is there too. Say you two just spark like crazy. Sex in every room, morning day and night. And by the time a year passes, it's still great, but you two get to know each other. And you realize that you just don't like the other person. Not that they're bad. You just don't feel that connection or friendship that makes you want to spend time with them. Even if you want it to work because you're both awesome, it doesn't mean it has to if you're not feeling it. Gotta trust your heart.

Then there's discovering that you're dating... shit, I can't think of a better, more sensitive word so let's go with ""crazy."" You date for a while and it's great! Then something big happens. You win a dream vacation for one to visit Greece. And rather than be happy for you, she throws a fit, breaks some things, yells, and does something drastic. The next day, she acts like it's nothing. You cancel your trip and, though she's not-so-secretly pleased, she gives you shit about not standing up for yourself or doing what you want in life. There's probably a million underlying issues in a situation like this. And sometimes, the juice is not worth the squeeze. It might be better for you to move on and let them work on themselves. Because staying with them, maybe they think it's not necessary to seek self-improvement because they're already great enough for you so there's no need to bother. Even if you say otherwise, you're still there. Relationships like that are toxic. No amount of love is going to fix a relationship if both parties aren't willing to put in a massive amount of hard work, or if they're even in a spot in their life where they can understand why they have to.

Then maybe there's discovering mental illness. Say you meet someone you would consider quirky. Some months she goes on ridiculous shopping sprees. Some weeks she stays in bed all day and doesn't shower. But you love her and you think love conquers all and you like these sides of her. Then it becomes clear she has bipolar. And the highs and lows get more intense and she doesn't like how her meds make her feel, so she doesn't want to commit to taking them. And it's wearing you out over time. You may both love each other, but you don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to do their part to try and stabilize the relationship. Or, maybe she does commit to well-being and realizes that you were the one that was holding her back. Maybe you enabled her too much, or she feels she has to move past you to move on. At that point, committing further is not going to make it work. Or, say you discover you're dating someone who, over time, has been slowly getting strong delusions, calling your employers and ranting on their voicemails for hours about how they're the devil. Sending rambling emails to friends, accusing you of stuff. It's to the point where you're terrified to come home because you fear for your physical well being. And the only thing you can do is be there for her, but she needs to be committed to a long-term care facility. Her family pays for it and takes the reigns. But there are no signs of things getting better anytime soon. Maybe you're not married. Do you just, at that point, say ""fuck it, I'm committed to this relationship?"" Or do you give yourself the ability to try and find love that might better suit what you were hoping for in life? Not trying at all in this example to say anything negative of those who have to endure these hardships or that they can't work. It just takes extra work and you both have to have that conversation that you both want to be on board for that work. And none of these are easy decisions or experiences. They're generally more complicated than what I described and your experiences, personality, and past can make you better or worse equipped to make these types of relationships work.

Then there's just discovering yourself. Maybe you two were high school lovers. And after living together for three years during college, it turns out experience, travel, life events, all these things made you discover that you're someone different than you thought you were. Or that you wanted different things than your partner. And maybe the relationship feels like it ran its course. You're not ready to settle, they are. Or, you're ready to have kids and they're more interested in bars. You're ready to hit the next phase of your life and you need to find someone who's on board with you. The relationship may have run its course and it can end on a loving high note. It doesn't have to end in disaster or heartache.

And, of course, accumulation. You're young, in love, and you've made every mistake in the book. You pushed for a long-distance relationship throughout college and she resented it. She cheated at least twice, once that she knows you know of. You cheated once to get back at her. She goes through your texts. You go through her emails. You thought you were past it. You both committed to being better. Then you decide you want to quit your job and join a band and tour the world without her. Then, one day, you accidentally drop a glass and get into a five-hour-long screaming match. And these bouts of yelling happen more and more. And even though you both may love each other, the accumulation of shit is enough to make every little thing the straw that broke the camel's back. Even if there's a lot of love and experience, there's too much hurt to feel like you want to make it work.

Oh, then there's emotional cheating. Your partner starts getting extra attention from a coworker/friend and they like it. They become BFFs and that's cool. Then, one admits feelings for the other from all that close time spent. And you try to get things back together, but they can't stop thinking about each other. You try working on it, but it's clear they want out. You spend a year working on it. And everything is just showing that it's not working out. Quiet resentment. Yelling. Coming home feeling like they're waiting for you to fuck up. It gets bad. So they eventually bounce. A year later, your ex and that person are married. Maybe in that situation, working on it wouldn't be enough if they truly wanted out.

There's also being honest with yourself and just seeing if you're happy. And if the answer is no, you can love someone like they're your family and not want to spend your days with them. And that's okay.

The worst thing you ever can do is commit further to fix a relationship. Moving in. Getting pets. Having kids. Getting tattoos. That never fixes the underlying problems or truths. It just covers the underlying problems."

I don't know if my friend is STILL an incel...since I haven't had more than a single conversation in the past ten years, but Jesus, this was bad.    


We will call my ""friend"" Jake, and the girl ""Kaci"".  


To explain this, I need to give a lot of background info.  It's vital and important to be able to know this.

Jake and I were friends from 4th grade till the incidents in 9th grade.  We went to basketball camps together, one of us would spend the night at each other's houses every weekend, etc.  He was my best friend.  


Starting in 9th grade, my group of friends started hanging out together.  We were, and still are, extremely close to this day.  Even though we see each other once a month or two, we are still in constant contact.   What Jake did took him out of this friend circle for life.    


Kaci started spending time with our group in 9th grade.  Jake became obsessed with her.  He went too far the first time after Kaci's dad passed away.  It crushed her and she was barely getting through the days.  Jake comes up with a story, because that's what it was, a story.  He tried to convince us that he had been dating a girl named Sarah in 7th grade that killed herself.  Not only did she kill herself, she wrote Jake's name in blood on the walls when Sarah's dad, Jon, found her.    


Obviously, this was absolute bullshit and insane.  However, he always brooded and started writing terrible poetry and song lyrics about Sarah.  He would run to our lockers between every class or break and show us multiple songs he wrote.  They were absolutely terrible.  We humored him due to feeling confused and still...he was our friend, right?  


During this time, I grew close to a friend named Luke.  Luke is someone I can still call my brother to this day.  He and I have gone through a lot of shit together, when my mom passed, he was one of the first people I called.     


So, back in 9th grade, Kaci started really liking Luke.  They were a perfect match and we were all happy for them, except...how do we tell Jake?   We keep it a secret the rest of 9th grade (like a month) and most of the summer.    


Jake started putting pieces together near the end of the summer.  He had gone over the deep end.  During the summer, he sent Kaci twelve dozen roses and a note confessing his love.  Kaci had told him multiple times how much she did not see him as more than a friend.  Seeing how Luke and Kaci weren't officially dating yet, it was hard for all of us to sit by and not say anything.  We didn't, respecting Luke and Kaci's wishes, and not wanting to see Jake kill himself or hurt someone.   


Why did we think he would do that?  Because one day he showed up to a few of our houses and hung out with us alone and grilled us on if Luke and Kaci were together.  We all said we didn't know, and to each of us when he was talking, he pulled out a pocket knife and started flicking it around which made us each uncomfortable.   This made us shun Jake for the rest of the summer.  


Sadly, summers end and school starts again.  Lucky for me, my English class had me sitting directly between Kaci and Jake.    


Then...Luke told Jake one day at lunch.  Let me tell you, it was the most tense moment in our friend group we've ever had.   Jake goes missing after lunch.  Apparently he got his mom to get him out of school.  We think we can breathe for the day.  NOPE!  Jake comes into our last class of the day, English, and sits there not moving for most of the class.  Then he glares at Kaci for a good 5 minutes straight.  I try blocking him from seeing her and talk to Kaci most of the class.  The teacher sends Jake to the library to grab something for class, but when he leaves, rushes over to Kaci and I and asks if we are okay.  We waved her off saying Jake wasn't taking the news of something well.    


After that, multiple things happen.  


Jake intensifies his stories about Sarah and Jon.  He starts saying he is being followed by Jon and takes calls from him in front of us.  One time, I asked to borrow his phone, and when he wasn't looking, checked the contact.  No number.  Figures.    


A couple times he would drive a weird road or park somewhere and say he saw Jon's car so we had to hide.  Shit was getting ridiculous.   


Final straw was when Jake showed Luke this document of a ""hit"" he put on Luke.  It was a poorly written Microsoft Word document and Luke's Facebook profile pic.    


When the rest of us heard that, we were fucking done.  Most of us said we were going to blacklist Jake and he'd become too much to handle.  Luke and a few others said we should sit him down and confront him about everything.  


So we confronted him.  Told him we knew it was all bullshit, he was going way too dark and ridiculous and that we had enough.  He started bawling saying how his friends had betrayed him and don't believe him.  He left.   


He started acting not so crazy the last two years of school.  We were cordial with him and sometimes included him.  Once we all graduated, we drifted away from him.    


Haven't talked to him in 5 years, but last time I was out with a few friends, I asked them about Jake.  Apparently he tried hooking up with a friend's wife through dirty texts and very awkward advances.  Our friend wanted to beat the shit out of him, but we told him that we'd handle it.    We had another intervention and said what he did was not cool and we did not want him around us or our girlfriends if he was gonna pull this shit.    


He apologized and said he got the wrong signals.  (Nah, she clearly said stop multiple times and you kept saying more disgusting shit)  


Now there's a recent discussion about if we should invite him back to do things since apparently he has a gene or something that the doctors discovered where he can have Parkinson's in the near future.

17505,"Yeah wtf is up with this? It's way more than just the actual weight difference, too. It's like women kind of still support their weight even when leaning on/laying on someone, but guys just seem to sink all their density into the exact point where you are like dead weight almost. It's like the difference between having a 20lb dog on your lap or 20lbs of books stacked on your lap. The latter feels so much heavier."

So he was always just this unattainable popular boy who I thought was cute. 

I was about 18 and after us both leaving school, we linked up on social media and became friends.   I found out a few years after being friends that he too had had a crush on me through school too, but had liked me from afar too.  Turns out he was a lot shyer than his group of friends portrayed, and was actually a really good guy. 

I moved away after leaving High School (as did he and now he works away for months at a time), but when I moved back, I then got a job where his dad was actually one of the top dogs.  His dad is absolutely lovely. I loved working with him, and we get on really well.  Then one day he's talking about his kids ""James and Jill"" and ""James would be about your age is he not?"" I'm like ""hold up, you're James's dad, how have I never figured this out before"".  I thereafter found out that my grandfather had attended his mum and dad's wedding too, as my grampa worked with James's grampa for years when they were younger (and that kind of thing was done at weddings in the 80s). 

Until recently, we've never both been single at the same time, he works away for months at a time but even still, almost 20 years later there's still something there that keeps us talking to each other.  He looks older, obviously, but he's still got those sparkling blue eyes.

Highschool crush. We talked on AIM all the time. First time she had me over to a movie party with some friends, I claimed the love seat and stretched out because everyone else already had seats. She took me feet off and dumped them on the floor to sit next to me. Not a big deal.

She invited me over to her place for cookies one day. 

She stole my goth-kid gloves and put them in her back pocket.

After talking for a bit I worked up the courage to ask her out. She tells me, ""You don't know me well enough."" or something like that. I'm like, okay, she's not into me, that was a polite no. 

I ignore all future signs and signals.

Years go by. She moves down south, has a kid, but she's single .We reconnect on messenger and we chat some. 

Asks me if I think she's pretty. Tell her yeah. 

Asks me basically why I didn't seem into her in highschool. 

Bitch I ASKED YOU OUT and you turned me down. 

Basically, there were a bunch of signs, I don't remember, because I convinced myself they were all NOT signs because she TURNED ME DOWN. "

Her dad (who was my mentor) mentored him, allowed him to come over and shower since his home shower was full of garbage, helped buy him new clothes (instead of black jeans and shirts and trench coats). The kid changed high schools, but had to walk, so he walked 4 miles every day to school, even in the rain because his parents couldn't be bothered to sign a form for a bus. He did that for 3 years of high school and graduated with a 3.8 and went to a great college. It's amazing, it's also amazing how pissed off his parents are since they think he's crazy for working for a living (and they also hate his name is now ""nick"" changed name for privacy). So I feel bad for how he grew up, but he broke the cycle of disgusting gross behavior"

17712,"How close to them i am in our opinions of gun control. I have a concealed carry license. I hold my pistol on me when i go into highly populated places. I do this because when a public shooting happens, i want to have an option between ""running for my life"" and ""getting cornered and awaiting deaths sweet embrace."" I totally think that a gunless society has a chance to be a better society, but we dont live in a gunless society. If the lunatics are armed, i want to be able to make a formidable opposition to them.

They never understand that, even though i have a couple guns, i have these opinions...

1. we should not just hand out firearms to anyone with a heartbeat. If someone has some sort of legit mental disorder, or certain criminal records, they should not have a firearm.

2. Children should not be in control of firearms outside of responsible parental supervision in controlled environments, like in the backyard of a rural area, a range, or out hunting.

3. Automatic firearms really are completely unnecessary for a civilian (though, they really are damn fun.)

4. People should be sufficiently trained to operate a firearm before they are allowed to possess one. I mean legit standardized training. Not grampy showing you how to shoot squirrels while hes drunk.

Some anti-gun people will realize i have a gun and go on a tirade about how they hate guns and guns are bad and blah blah. Im kinda like CJ. When the ballas coming bustin caps in my territory, what do you want me to do? Throw shoes?"

My wife couldn't see the screen. I told her I couldn't tell. Part of it was hope that I was wrong, part of it was because I didn't want her to live in this world, where our child had died, if that makes sense. I'm kind of tearing up just typing this. I know that she was going to find out, but I didn't want her to have that sorrow for as long as possible. I don't know if that was fucked up of me. It hit us pretty hard. I held it together for her. But as soon as I called my dad to tell him, he said 'oh no!' And I just lost it, right there in the driveway. She passed the kid, and I buried them in the front yard, next to my favorite plant.

17728,"Imo, Cube Zero ruined the lore of the original to me. Just the way everything was so arbitrary and pointless in the first. They were in the cube because it was there. It was there because someone assembled the parts, someone assembled the parts because the parts were built. The parts were built because that's what the blueprints said. By the time you get to why the blueprints were made, everything is so many levels obscured that there's probably one guy who knows, but he's long since been off the project probably not knowing it was built, and maybe even retired or dead. After him, it was just people following the bureaucracy, keeping their heads down, not asking questions, and getting paid. It was just such a surreal concept to ponder. It wasn't malicious or revenge that got them all there. Just people following the chain of command, and at worst one or a few people callously designating a handful of people to drop in, just to keep the gears turning until it was out of their hands and someone else's problem. No one was watching. No one cared about them. They were just there.

Cube Zero had French aliens using one or more cubes to use people as test subjects and silence political enemies. People were watching. Any intelligent ideas were shut down. Oh, and the special needs guy from the first movie? Here's his backstory that has nothing to do with anything. It was just so...shit."

Or from men I've known or have dated. Ex boyfriends, uncles, brothers, cousins, friends who have complimented me, citing my lack of makeup. But I'm wearing makeup. And I have to convince them of it.

We explain that we were running a public event and they just missed it. Everyone left and that was that.

The second encounter was more fun. We were out there goofing around, not doing anything illegal, just taking long exposure pictures using the fancy astrophotography cameras. Cops show up right as we‚Äôre packing up again and the dialogue went something like this.

Cop1, to me: you guys have any weed?

Me: nope, we were just using the scopes and cameras.

17758,"To add to this what I've read in books on Buddhism, karma isn't some ledger with tallys or a mechanism of the universe... it's something we do to ourselves with the tendencies and subconscious attractions and aversions that we pick up along the way. After death and before reincarnation, one ends up in a rebirth our karma finds attractive... even if it would be an unfortunate choice. It wouldn't be a conscious choice (since one is dead), just whatever one is drawn to, what feels familiar.

It's not really practical to give examples. Perhaps if one lead a life of violence, one would be reborn into an even more violent life. Maybe ones learn to overcome it... maybe one becomes even more violent to compensate. If one were greedy,  one would be reborn into a life that looks promising, but ends up filled with loss. Or even more excessive greed that ultimately leaves one unfulfilled and unhappy. Who knows?

So I see karma as our minds' ultimately continuing to make the same sort of good or bad choices over and over again, even into new lives. It takes work and effort to purify karma in this human life so one will make better choices and experience better karma going forward."

Tony was a proponent of safety and security, not just for the Avengers but also for the good of society. 

It's a compromise that we make every single day in our society, weighing our liberties against our safety. But to categorize Cap as intentionally evil? I mean, I can just as easily say that Tony is a murderer at heart, because he wanted to kill Bucky without a trial, which makes him evil.

I am proud when I fumble around on the computer enough to figure out how to put in the instructions for her special dog and go on my merry way. Time passes and I eventually bring her the food. Her eyes immediately go to the coney dog. ""I can't eat this!"" She says.

Sometimes people looked up and saw one of our heads sticking out. I made eye contact with a dude who was getting a blow job in Terminator 3, he just gave me a thumbs up and I closed the window.

We‚Äôd try to rush up there because most of the time they‚Äôd be done pretty fast.

While I was waiting for my case to be called, the magistrate heard the case of a 40-something year old well-dressed man. These were her words exactly:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre an upstanding member of your community, you have positive character witnesses and are a member of the Lions Club (charitable organisation).

17920,"TL;DR below
For context, my mother had a huge falling out with my aunt and grandma. Big enough that she cut off all contact, even though grandma has been in and out of hospital. We aren't allowed to visit, she gets angry if we even mention them, and she made us block them on Facebook.

I had been out shopping with my mum and found a preowned plaque. It was a heart with a poem on it, basically saying ""I love you grandma"". I bought it secretly and hid it on the way home, and went to the post office alone to mail it to them (they live about 4 hours away, in Bendigo).

Grandma sent back a little card saying thank you and that she loved me and she was sad about the falling out, and I sticky taped it to my bookshelf so that I would see it every now and again (the left side of my bookshelf faces the door, and the right side faces the wall of my room, where you only go to access my wardrobe)

Somehow, even though she hadn't been that far into my bedroom for about 10 years, my mum found it and flipped. Her. Shit. You'd think I had personally threatened her. She refused to speak to me for a week and my father came in and spent close to an hour yelling at me, telling me how awful grandma was and how he looked forward to pissing on her grave.

TL;DR: Mum found a card from my grandma, who we weren't supposed to be talking to and treated it like I had slapped her."

17925,"I'm in a survivors group for victims of sexual abuse and assault, i  particular, for those victimized as young teens by teachers, or other authority figures that are not family (mostly teachers....and a lot of us are guys who were abused by women teachers...)

We had a new guy join the group, and for the first week, we were supportive, but then his story started to get...more detailed. And not in a consistent way. After his 7th week in the group (we meet 2 times a week) We all essentially knew he was...one of \*those\*. Someone who has noticed the attention gaining possibilities, and goes for it.

His story changed every week. And every week it happened at a different age, by a different teacher, and in some cases were so utterly different it was like listening to an entirely different person's experience.

We called him on it, and he tried to cover it, but eventually admitted it.

Now you might think we got angry, and we did, but we didnt kick him out of the group without first asking why he felt the need.

Turned out he was a Foster Child, bounced from home to home from age 8 until he turned 18, and had basically never gotten the attention he needed. He had never spent more than 6 months in any one foster home. We referred him to another group that meets in the same building, and he has done well with them."

There was no need for her to prove anything, because my manager was trying to listen and get the correct order so it could be remade. Or a refund. She was willing to do either. She kept apologizing, saying that she understood, and that she could fix it right away. Extremely polite the whole time. But the lady was already yelling at this point, and insulting my manager who then asks her if she could please keep her voice down. 

 Anyway, this made her so mad she actually picked up the food and started throwing it at my manager over the counter while yelling, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you do anything right?!?‚Äù It landed close by to me.

 I still have issues looking in the mirror, but at least now when I do I can see the changes testosterone has done, and actually look forward to the day my outside body finally matches what I feel inside. Admitting to myself I was transgender was one of the most difficult things I've faced so far, but it was also the most liberating and I would never, ever, EVER go back to before that day I literally jumped out of bed saying enough was enough, popped my hair into a hat and began my transition to living as the person I knew Ive always been inside.

18017,"Maybe different therapists have diferent approaches, or different philosophies, but for me, my therapist challenging me (almost aggressively) to question some of my behaviors was among the best things I've gotten out of therapy.

Challenging me, not in a judgemental way, but shining a very harsh light on some of the ways I was acting, some of the habits I was unwilling to change.  I saw these challenges as being out of concern and care for my well being, and I saw their bluntness as necessary to help me break through my own barriers.

I don't think I could trust or respect a therapist who held back from being brutally honest and truthful to me.  I come there for his professional wisdom and training and skillset, not to have these things dangled ""suggestively"" in front of me but left for ME to uncover on my own.  Respect me by being honest and direct with me, not by tiptoeing around saying things that may upset me.

**""Quit your bullshit""** is something I've had said to me, and I'd welcome it again if it was necessary.  He **raised his voice** when necessary.  He rephrased, with **biting sarcasm**, some of the things I said, to illustrate and challenge me on their logic or fairness.

GRANTED, this approach is not for everyone.  And I'm in my late 40's, so I think this wouldn't work with someone far younger.  I also think someone more emotionally fragile than me would react very poorly to this approach.  The fact that my therapist is male (like me) and is about the same age as my father, I think also lends to the benefit, because I often see his challenges as ""parental-like wisdom"" being generously handed me."

18050,"This one is about my stupidity. We were on vacation in Gulf Shores, Alabama, and went to the little zoo there. My wife is extremely phobic of snakes (bad experience with a copperhead when she was 5), so she's always a little skittish at zoos. We were walking along and saw what appeared to be a very large albino python curled up on the ground in the middle of an open area. She freaked out, of course. I assured her that there was no way that they would just leave a big snake like that unattended on the grounds. It had to be a fake. To prove it, I walked up and prodded it with my foot. As soon as my foot touched it, I knew I was wrong. It was a live albino python, and it looked right at me. I backpedalled as fast as I could, and apologized to my wife and kids for being an idiot. A zoo employee came up and asked what I thought I was doing. I gave some lame answer and asked him what the hell a snake was doing loose on the grounds. He gave some lame answer, and went to wrangle it back into its cage."

18076,"It's not the inability to respond to things moving around your room that's scary when you have sleep paralysis.  It's the things your mind will create that aren't really there.

Sleep paralysis mostly happens because you're laying still enough for long enough (not responding to bodily cues like itches etc) that your body thinks you're asleep (there can also be medical reasons).  So it starts to release the chemicals that cause paralysis during sleep and additionally the chemicals that make you dream.  Except you're actually still very mentally awake/aware.

Your mind is incredibly powerful and good at creating really fucked up intense situations around you to rationalise why you can't move.  This is where people who think they were abducted by aliens or were attacked by demons get their stories.  They are real enough that a lot of people actually believe something was there.  This stuff can be an incredibly terrorising experience even if you're telling yourself it's not real.

With practice some people can get past that loss of control/fear and manipulate it.  It evidently can lead to a very powerful lucid dream/out of body type experience.  "

18092,"My father did once... sort of. 

It was on my 15th birthday. He was taking me to get my learner‚Äôs permit that morning.  We saw my grandmother and uncle doing some renovations to a church near our house. We stopped to talk to them for just a few minutes and then went on our way.  

About a mile down the road we saw the town troublemaker wandering drunk and/or high walking in the middle of the road toward the church carrying a machete. We lived in a small town, and this guy was well known for being in and out of jail for a variety of things.  After seeing him, my dad turned around and drove back to the church in case the guy decided to make a stop there to cause problems. 

After making some small talk with my grandmother and uncle for a few minutes, the drunk guy came staggering in the church rambling on about something and just waving his machete around.  Unbeknownst to me, my dad was carrying.  Instead of drawing his weapon though, he just pulled his shirt aside to clearly display that he was carrying.  Didn‚Äôt even reach for it or put his hand on it. Just openly displayed he was carrying. 

When it became apparent the drunk guy wasn‚Äôt going to leave any time soon, my dad told him to just go back home and put away his machete before he got in trouble.  Crazy guy noticed my dad was carrying and decided that it was in his best interest to not cause problems.

So... my dad didn‚Äôt draw his weapon. But the mere presence of a weapon was the only thing to deescalate the situation.  We could have called the police, but we lived in such a rural area that it would have taken them at least 30 minutes to show up. "

When you get high on the stuff, and you manage to stay awake (usually after building up a tolerance) it‚Äôs kind of like being a zombie. Short term memory loss, like asking my sister and I how school was 3 times in a row, impaired motor function and reaction time, as in on the car ride home I had to reach over a few times and drive us around a curve to stay in our lane. Slurred speech, stumble walk, and they don‚Äôt remember anything when they wake up the next day. 

Sidetracking to finish the story, I made her give me access to her Walgreens account and she‚Äôs been doing good, but if I see any ambien or narcotics (she‚Äôs also had episodes with that) I go hunting through the meds cabinet and flush em down the toilet.

Shit is scary. Some doctors I‚Äôve talked to call it the ‚Äúambien spiral‚Äù and it‚Äôs what led Heath Ledger to harder drugs and eventually a fatal overdose.

Since my family and family friends are full of spiritualists and love occult things, I thought it was interesting. 

But I soon realized it was very much so an attention seeking story instead.  About halfway through the night, in front of everyone, she says to her mom ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been meaning to tell you this for a while but I can TALK TO DEAD PEOPLE.‚Äù In a very Sixth Sense manner. Her poor mother kept brushing her off saying ‚ÄúOk dear we‚Äôll talk about it on the ride home‚Äù but the girl kept saying the same thing, loudly, about how she could communicate with spirits.

18122,"Honestly I think Homecoming has been the best mcu movie by far (I haven‚Äôt seen Ant Man though), I feel like it has a lot of good dynamics, and a REALLY good villain. The difficulty of Peter keeping his identity secret, and having to deal with the fact he is a pretty nerdy kid who gets picked on pretty consistently is something you don‚Äôt really see much in the superhero genre and that kind of confuses me because who wouldn‚Äôt want to rub in the fact they‚Äôre a fucking SUPERHERO when they are getting bullied in high school. Tony‚Äôs role in the movie is also amazing and shows a lot of development with him trying to guide Peter in the right direction, and struggling pretty hard at it which is completely in character. Vulture is a great villain too, the opening scene with his business getting screwed over by the government is amazing and makes a lot of sense, he‚Äôs not some supervillain trying to conquer the world or become all powerful, he is just trying to get by and sees the unjust treatment regular people are getting in a world filled with superpowers and aliens. Throw all of this on top of the fact Tom Holland fits the role of a young Peter Parker/Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man perfectly and yea I just think homecoming is incredible despite most other marvel movies follow a pretty worn out formula. Definitely looking forward to see what they do with the next one.

A lady calls us and asks for out service. She fired her last cleaners and no one has been in there for a month. Two cats who roam free in the house. Pretty standard stuff. 

When we were inquiring about why she fired her last crew (for our safety; it was because of a restraining order against the owner from the cleaners before) she mentioned it was because they kept breaking shit. Okay fair. She mentioned she had a lot of nicknacks that she worried about, so just dust around them. We clocked this in as a 9 hour clean (4.5 hours for two cleaners). You can probably see where this is going.

Now my fellow maid had already gotten started for three hours by the time I got there and she was still in the same room she was when she started. 

Holy christ, guys, this house.

I entered and gasped. Shelves FILLED with antiques. Tables everywhere, stacked with books, and you guessed it, fragile items. Glass, china, etc. She had like this taxidermy owl collection right in front of you when you entered and they just stared at you as if they were like ‚ÄúI know man. Shits fucked here.‚Äù My favorite was the stair rail to the upstairs. At the base (you know that final wood pilar at the end of the stairs toward the end) there was a cherub lamp precariously (sp) balancing. I almost knocked it over five times while I was there. There was a pedistal in her ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù room that was probably 7ft in the air, wobbly, with a huge china vase wiggling on top of it. Shit like that all over the house. The cats were running everywhere avoiding me and my partner. It took us 7 hours, both of us (14 man hours) to dust this house without breaking anything.

Yeah no fucking shit your cleaners broke stuff.

I'm amused by the cheesy, over the top gore, but in between that we have scenes of her picking out a sword for 5 fucking minutes or characters just staring at each other for 30 seconds in between each line of dialogue.

As soon as she loses it I will say ""great, now what can I do to help you"" or whatever fits the situation that she was getting worked up over from the start. Yeah, I might be strict when it comes to that, but I don't yell at her, or threaten or whatever, I remain calm and wait for her to calm down before moving on. That compared to all but 1 of the 4 kids my MIL has raised (my husband is the quiet, oddity here) repeatedly get into, not only full blown screaming matches with MIL, but knock-down-drag-outs with her (and each other). I don't really consider myself a prude, but it's embarrassing how they talk to one another. MIL will call the youngest girl, 18 as of this year, a slut or whore or bitch or whatever and then be shocked when the girl talks right back to her, or wonders why her older druggie son (the 18 year olds father who lost custody to MIL...but he still at 40 lives with her) threatens to beat her and she screams back she wishes he would so she could get some peace or that she wishes she aborted him, it's all honesty really trashy and a huge part of why we have limited contact with MIL. Seriously, seeing the way she talks to her kids/grandkids she's raised, it really made me never want to speak to my kids that way and never have them speak to me that way, so when husband and I had kids we both agreed that we will be respectful and will expect the kids to be respectful before moving on in any conversation at any point (barring absolute emergency).

________________________________________________

throw away account cause this is really personal.

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs I was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life. 

I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter. 

I had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.

One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade). I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp. 

I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real! 

The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes.  I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused. 

at some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused. 

I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision,  he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says. "

18218,"This is not a woods story, but one time I was at the amusement park King's Dominion.  About a hour before the park closes there's a band that has a performance near the 'town square' by the gates.  A date and I went to watch the show before leaving.  

The band was setting up and starting to warm up as a crowd started to gather.  We weren't too far from the front, within 20 feet of the stage.  I was just kinda people watching and not paying attention when suddenly the crowd in front of me seemed to part.  I looked up to the stage to see all the band reacting to something and backing up.

A skunk had come out of the bushes as they were warming up and was walking across the stage towards the front.  I have NO IDEA why I thought this was 'part of the show'.  I watched the skunk wondering where they were going with this.  The skunk walked to the front of the stage, hopped down and started scurrying across the pavilion.  Went right by me and kept on trucking.  As I looked around seeing I was the only one still within 40 feet of the thing it dawned on me this was not part of the show.

It didn't spray me, just kept on trucking through a fence between rides into the bushes.

I guess I'm kinda a dumbass."

18222,"Ugh, I thought I'm just being a total cunt when giving my boyfriend that response. ""Well, why didn't you ask me to do the laundry/vacuum/feed the baby"". 

Bitch, because you're 31 years old. If you see that we have a pile of clothes in the laundry room, do them. If the floor has too much dirt or dog hair for your liking, by all means, vacuum. The toilet is gross? Pick up the fucking rag and fabulouso and scrub it. You're not my fucking employee or my kid, you're a member of this goddamn household and that means you should contribute. 

Guess what, buddy, we both work, but I have two other jobs with the kid and then chores/errands/making sure all bills are paid, appointments are made, birthdays remembered, etc. 

It's not that he won't do a thing that I ask him to. He will, half-assed. It's that I have to ask him to do it at all. And this is a gripe I've addressed with him multiple times.

Do you know I had to make it very clear to him last night that when I take a nap on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (his days off), he needs to actually focus on the baby instead of leaving him in his bassinet and playing video games? Then I had to explain that if you can't hang out with your own newborn for the 3 hours you have to deal with him, that's going to cause problems for when the kid actually demands his time? He has me take over feedings half way through because I ""can get him to eat"". Bitch...he eats, no matter who's feeding him. PUT THE BOTTLE IN HIS MOUTH AND HE'LL EAT, I PROMISE. 

Sorry. It's just nice to know that I'm not some controlling, crazy bitch when I get exasperated and figure I should just do it instead. ""If I don't do it, it doesn't get done."" *sigh*"

In the tenth of a second span while your brain is first trying to form all the shapes and colors into a pattern to figure out what's a face, what's a plate of spaghetti and what's an amazing pair of tits, your eyes are locking onto each of these things while the pattern recognition software does its thing.  

As a former waiter I used to actually get annoyed when I noticed I was going to have to serve a woman with a low-cut or revealing top because I knew there was a chance I'd offend her (and her jealous husband) if I dropped my vigilance for even the literal blink of an eye.  "
18229,"I did too much stuff around the house like dishes and cooking. She broke up with me and said ""I want a man who does manly things, not a woman cooks and cleans.""

I know right... How dare I cook healthy stuff for her kids a few nights a week because otherwise she'd pump them full of McDonald's.

A few weeks later her car broke down and she called me because she knew I could fix it. 

I laughed hysterically at the irony of it. Told her, ""Sorry love I'm just too busy baking cakes and painting my nails over here.""

Moral of the story is chores don't have gender association.  What needs to be done just needs to be done and you're no less manly because dishes and cooking need to be done more frequently than the car needs service."

18235,"Pretty much yeah. Girls absolutely will play-resist like this (ask to slow down while badly wanting you not to). You did the right thing of course - the ethical and legal reality is that you have to take it at face value, even when you can pretty well tell she doesn't actually want you to stop (and may actually get turned off or angry if you do lol; has happened to me). 

Best way to handle it IME is to act utterly non-butthurt and terse. ""no prob"" then check your phone or go back to watching TV (or whatever pretext you originally went into her/your room for....or if she's at your place you could even ask her to help you do the dishes lol) and then she'll probably paw at you or talk sexually a few minutes later (and if not, so be it). Then just reciprocate her foreplay and act like nothing happened.

Ofc if you sense she's too much of a cocktease or manipulative, you may want to peace out anyway. That sort of thing can kill your own genuine interest in the girl (and, although I've never had any issues with the following, I would bet it's correlated with girls who make malicious accusations later). There's a line between ""she doesn't want you to think she's a slut"" and ""she enjoys blueballing guys or seeing if she can make them beg and wheedle"". 

Ofc if she actually has a fantasy of some sort like that which she wants to play out, that's another story (but it's the sort of thing that has to be discussed beforehand...possibly in a text or email you have from her that you can save) "

18241,"Sort of happened to me. This is super long, so be aware.

 This girl had been sort of flirtatious with me all year while I had a gf, and she also was with someone at the time so I assumed that's how she was in general. So, about a month after we both broke up with our respective partners, a mutual friend was having a party.

That whole week she was even more flirtatious with me, commenting about my looks, saying that she was really looking forward to seeing me that Friday and I have her added on Snapchat and we had a streak, so we sent each other snaps everyday and the day before the party she send one picture taken like she had put her phone against her chin and the camera pointing down towards her feet. She was wearing a tank top, and as you can probably tell, a lot of cleavage was showing.

Now, come Friday. I had been misled before and definitely didn't want that to happen this time, although I was already pretty confident about my instincts. Cue a few drinks and all that jazz, I constantly have her hugged with my hand on her waist and she seems to roll with it, asks to take a picture, I kiss her on her cheek and she says she loves it. 

At this point I'm 100% sure that this is a closed deal, so I go up to her and tell her I like her, she looks sort of surprised but not really. We kiss for about a minute, she pulls away and says that she's sorry but she isn't ready because pf how recently she had broken up with her bf. I understand, tell her it's okay, she goes off with her friend and I stay there, lie on the grass of my friends garden playing back what happened and trying to figure out how I fucked it up. I also start drinking more and getting drunker.

About an hour later, she's going off to a bedroom with other guy, I'm basically dead. Five minutes later, she comes out crying, turns out she didn't want to sleep with that guy but he tried to. I don't understand a thing but let it be and go home. 

Later that night, she texts me and apologises for everything she did and says it's all her fault and she didn't want me to go through that and that she has a lot of problems and that I wouldn't like dating her. I tell her it's okay and I understand her decision and it's cool if she wants to proceed as usual, but keeps going over to the same thing.

I actually meant what I said, but later started to fall for her. A few weeks later she changed her WhatsApp profile picture to the photo I mentioned earlier where I kissed her, and it felt awful but I didn't do anything.

Eight months or so later, her best friend tells me that she actually liked me and she got freaked out because she didn't know how to respond to me liking her back, so she got mad at me for it and that's why she turned me down. And to top it off, she also said that I was one of the best guys she had made out with and that she would definitely do it again if she didn't have a bf.

TL;DR: She liked me, lead me on, made out with me, said she wasn't interested, but actually did like me and somehow got angry about it and send someone to tell me that she would make out again if there was a chance."

18266,"I only noticed this after watching Babadook.  In Babadook they use the house as a metaphor for the mind.  In Fight Club they do the same thing.  Ed Norton's character has built a nice orderly condo that is completely destroyed by his Tyler Durden personality, symbolizing his mental break.  

Tyler Durden's house is dilapidated, doesn't work properly, and is isolated from everything in society.  From the outside it is just the barest facade of a working house.  It's a metaphor for the first effects of mental illness on a person.

18268,"Big boobs do not live up to the hype. 

They are a literal pain in the neck and back all the time. Bras cost a bomb especially since I found out they need replacing really regularly especially if (you guessed it) you have big gals. 

I was badly bullied at school because I was an early bloomer and I just kept blooming. Also I like cake. Girls envied me I guess but they had no idea how awful it made me feel too. I‚Äôm pretty body positive though and I can laugh off most comments about how I must have had a boob job. I can ignore the stares, (looking is natural) but the stares are just awkward and rude. 

They‚Äôre in the way more times than not, yes you can rest your dinner plate on them at home but eating out is embarrassing if you reach for the salt and dip a boob in your soup. 

My role model as a kid was Lara Croft and now I realise if she was real and did all those things she would need an iron clad bra and constant ice lacs in the go for torn tendons in your breast tissue (yes it is a thing) from all that running around, flipping off ledges and generally kicking ass and taking names. 

If I could be a C cup again I would. If I change much more once I have kids getting breast reduction surgery is on the cards for the sake of my health. And I am shit scared of doctors and hospitals. That‚Äôs how serious I am about not wanting big(ger) boobs. 

I repeat: big boobs do not live up to the hype. 

I‚Äôm not against breast enhancement surgery as it can empower lots of people who feel they need it to feel complete but I hope that the consultants go through with them the real life changes it will mean for them too. Especially if they have drastic changes from their pre-op selves. "

Sorry, what?  Then the GPS popped up and it was moving slowly.  No way.  The restaurant was 2-3 miles away.  Uphill.  No way that they would send a walker.

1.5 hours later, doorbell rings, and standing there is an extremely sweaty and run down guy with a giant Uber Eats backpack strapped to his chest.  Tipped the guy 100 HKD for the trip, then deleted the Uber Eats app.  It wasn't even an issue of food, that's just not fair to anyone."

But what really grabbed me the second time was the way Chillingworth goes after Dimmesdale: He burrows himself in this guys' life and wears him down over 7 years... it really is a masterclass in revenge. Even Hester notices it: ""You search his thoughts. You burrow and rankle in his heart! Your clutch is on his life, and you cause him to die daily a living death."" Her exasperation in that dialogue really packs a punch, especially when you realize Chillingworth has no care of anything or anyone else but the surgical, mental and physical dismantling of Dimmesdale. The way he gains Dimmesdale's trust, by being a fellow lover of learning and intellectual pursuits (something not exactly found at that time period), is just brilliant and terrifying, imo. "

I sat in the room with him, doing the birth paperwork.  No reason I should have been in there, but it just felt terribly *wrong* to leave a baby alone, whether the baby was dead or alive.  While I was sitting on the bed filling out some forms, the bassinet rolled from out under the heater over to the window.  No idea how that happened, but it freaked me the fuck out.

I did have trouble before, like I had benefits for food that paid my way and I did get a job within a week or two of moving, but before that my girlfriend ran off with my best friend growing up when him and I wound up living next to each other across the US.

18383,"Struggling more and more lately. Using a secondary account that up until now I have used just to lurk.

For a few years I have been stuck in a job I truly hate, but cannot seem to get hired in my field somewhere else. Why is it so bad? I make practically no money compared to average in my field, my boss is incredibly lazy, and the office itself is dumpy. Why do I stay? Because if I leave the field, I basically assure that I won‚Äôt get another job in the field (and I still hold out hope to get a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job in my field), so keeping this terrible job to keep it current on my resume.

It sucks because I have a lot of student loan debt that I‚Äôll never repay, I worked my ass off and achieved very good grades at good schools, and I work hard, but I have yet to break into a real position despite applying to positions several times a week. I'm introverted, but I work hard to be more out going, and seem to make a good impression on people, but I'm still unable to land a new opportunity.

I lost my dog about 6 months ago. She was my best friend. She was 15 and developed cancer. Every day without her is hard. For several years she was my main focus. I did everything for her, and being able to focus my attention on her helped curb my depression because seeing her happy made me happy.

I am also involved in a charitable organization that has become more and more difficult to enjoy. I loved it for many years, but the politics and poor leadership make it near impossible to enjoy anymore. It has made me very bitter. I‚Äôm a relatively high ranking member in my local area, but those few ahead of me have neglected their duties and responsibilities to ensure a strong future for our organization. I have addressed it multiple times, and nothing changes because people are unwilling to have the ‚Äúdifficult conversations‚Äù with people not carrying their weight.

I only really find any joy in the hour or so when I go to the gym.

18442,"I used to have to help my grandma clean up these shitty rental properties she had. It usually ended up that the tenants would not pay rent, stay for months for free, trash the place and eventually leave.  
The worst one was a bunch of meth / heroin addicts who had gotten messed up, ripped a huge hole in the wall and destroyed the water line for the downstairs. It partially flooded the place and they shut the water off at the valve. And didn't say a word. So for months, they didn't have any water. And they stuffed every closet and storage space they could find down there with garbage and buckets of piss and shit. Not only that, but left broken meth pipes and used needles all over the floor in two of the rooms.  
So we had to pull out all of the carpets because they were still soaked and were growing mold. Had to have the place tested and professionally cleaned to remove meth residue. Had to drywall most of the walls because they had punched or stabbed huge holes into most of them. Had to get the water line replaced. Had to replace most of the appliances and light fixture because they had broken or disassembled them. And had to fill an entire dumpster with shit and garbage. After that, I told my grandmother that I loved her but I was not doing this ever again. I was helping for free and she was renting to some of the biggest scumbags on Earth.

I lost count of the number of times I would be on the factory floor and see people from the offices wander into a welders bay or the manufacturing shop in non safety shoes. The main culprits tended to be sales people but I more than once witnessed the Managing Director do it. 

The problem is, as any H&amp;S/OSHA professional reading this will tell you, what appear to be trivial safety rules are there for a reason.

""I am Alexander the Great,"" said the monarch to Diogenes. ""And I am Diogenes the Cynic,"" replied Diogenes

Alexander stood opposite Diogenes and asked, ""Are you not afraid of me?"" ""Why, what are you,"" said Diogenes, ""a good thing or a bad?"" Alexander replied, ""A good thing"" whereupon Diogenes said, ""Who, then, is afraid of the good?""

Diogenes asked Alexander what his plans were. Alexander answered that he planned to conquer and subjugate Greece. Then what? Diogenes asked. Alexander said that he planned to conquer and subjugate Asia Minor. And then? Alexander said that he planned to conquer and subjugate the world.

Diogenes, who was not easily dissuaded from a line of inquiry, posed the question again: What next? Alexander the Great told Diogenes that after all that conquering and subjugating, he planned to relax and enjoy himself. Diogenes responded: Why not save yourself a lot of trouble by relaxing and enjoying yourself now?"

18547,"Sure.

He's still America's weapon. 90% of those tens of millions killed were non american's killed, in the global eye, by america's weapon.

Call me crazy, but looking at the history of human emotional reaction I *really* have a hard time believing there would be a united global peace against Dr Manhattan involving the US. All they had to do for the story was only attack New York City with the threat of Manhattan coming back. That would have been much more plausible."

18558,"For me, it's because I spent basically my whole upbringing being infantilized as a means of invalidation in addition to physical and emotional abuse, and then (surprise surprise) I got into a relationship with a person who took this to a new level. My self-perception is not that of a grown woman, it's that of a scared and small child because I've essentially spent life being told that that's what I am.  
  
Working on getting past that, though."

18574,"I got a new phone with a new number when I switched carriers about 5 years ago. About a year after using the new number, I started getting calls from an elderly woman asking to speak to Delaney. I said she had the wrong number, and then read the number she was hoping to reach back to me. Same number. This was an inconvenience for me, because I had had the phone number long enough to where people I knew had that number saved, and it's a hassle trying to get everyone to save your new number, so I kept it hoping eventually I wouldn't receive any more calls. I was wrong. Apparently Delaney was very popular. I started getting text invitations to house parties. Her grandma called me almost every night looking for her despite me insisting she had got a new number, please delete this number from your phone, (hope you find your grand-daughter and she's ok). The caller ID always said calls were coming from a town about 25 mins away from where I live. Never found out if Delaney went missing or anything, and eventually the calls stopped. fast forward to now, and I run into an old friend at a restaurant and we start shootin' the shit. I ask him what he's getting into tonight, He says dunno let me get your number let's meet up for drinks, so I give it to him, and wouldn't you know he's already got the number saved in his phone as ""DELANEY GIMME BRAINY."" I literally scream-laughed in the middle of the restaurant and was asked to leave."

Most of the time though they were as you described, and if you got knocked to the ground someone pulled you to your feet almost immediately.  "

18579,"Well first off you need a good distraction. Pulling the fire alarm is out. Since everyone would exit the building and you still have the issue of trying to sneak the ham inside.

So you need something bigger. Where they have to hustle people inside. So you need a tornado.

Now to pull this off you need friends. You need people to see clouds to make rain. Others to cause hot and/or cold air. This is imperative to causing a major storm. 

Some black backdrop would help, oh and those giant ass fans that they use when filming disaster movies.

When you get it all going people will think a tornado is near. So they will have no choice but to hustle people inside before they even buy a ticket.

Once everyone is inside you need your friends outside to go wholesale with destruction. 

Like getting a giant crane to throw cars around. Ripping off the roof of nearby buildings. Someone to throw the odd cow around. All of this just to make it believable. 

Meanwhile your inside with that ham. And whose going to give a fuck. There is a tornado raging outside. It would be criminal to send someone outside during it. They would totally die.

Now when the ""tornado"" is finished, everyone is going to be surveying the damage and be glad they are alive. Heck some might even be feeling frisky after it so you have a chance to get laid.

And after you have sex what better way to show that you are a good person than by sharing that some of that honeyed ham with your new hook up."

18583,"I don't understand dieting as a whole. To me its far better to change your diet and your life style than torturing yourself with restrictive diets. Your body is a sensitive machine, and will learn do adapt. Going on a restrictive diet ""just for a while"" seems to me like it would confuse your metabolism. Isnt it better to just make healthy choices? "
