"This story from years ago by /u/VaginalBurp has always stuck with me.:

****

Before my step father killed himself with heroin and McUltra, he used to teach me manly things. One of which was that ""your animal is the only true unselfish love you will get. They only want you. They ask for nothing.""

One day my cat got hit by a car when I got home from school. I was 11. Her name was ""Max"" because I was 6 when I picked her out so everything was a boy. I ran inside yelling for help. She was screaming on the side of the road and I didn't know what to do. He came out, god bless him, he tried. I was in shock and wasn't even crying. ""He could totally fix her"" I thought. ""He fixes everything. It's a good thing he was home"". He picked her up, turned to me, and layed her in my arms like a baby. She quit screaming and started purring.

He explained to me that she was too broken. She was going to die. ""She needs you to hold her now. Till she passes. As long as you hold her she won't hurt. Just talk to her."" He then stepped past me and lit a cigarette about 10ft away. He noticed I wasn't saying anything and I was starting to lose it, so he said ""let's get her to the rabbit grounds"", so I instinctively started talking to Max about rabbits. We walked about 3 min before the purring stopped. She had passed.

I paused a step and panicked out a ""dad!"" He just turned and smoked out puff ""You got her, boy. puff That's all she wants"". So I kept walking till we got to the hunting grounds. I dug while he watched and talked about how ""you always hold your friends. Makes them forget the moment and remember yesterday. They don't panic when you stick with them. That's what men do, boy"". I layed her down and covered her. He asked, ""everything done?"" I nodded. ""You can cry"".
 Many years later, after the families had separated, he contacted us to let us know he wasn't doing too good. When I was able to get out there, what was once a 250lb mountain of a man, was now a crumpled 100lb piece of paper between world's. That night everyone was asleep around 2am. I walked over to his bed and sat in the chair beside him while he was having one of his hallucinations. I picked up his hand. He couldn't even open it, so I held his arm while his eyes darted around the room as he whimpered at past sins, or failed dreams.

I said ""you remember when we had to lay Max at the rabbit runs?"" We didn't talk about rabbits much lol. I just held his arm and talked about the old house. What 15 years of growth must look like. How the old shed he built was probably still standing. He stopped shaking when I started talking about the smell of that field in the summer. How mint grew on the west side and would blow into the house when we would Bush hog it. He just closed his eyes and went to sleep. He passed 24 hours later with only a few seizures, but no more whimpering. I like to think he spent his last 24 hours in that field with his 11 year old son. Watching the cats head out into the brush. Taking a draw on that red and telling me we would head back in a moment.

We stood there for an eternity.

EDIT: I posted this for the guy above and because everyone should know that you need to stick by your friends when they need you the most. I thank everyone who gave me gold and commented! I tried thanking you all one by one until someone showed me how to reddit."
I was hung up on a mistake I‚Äôd made and he simply said ‚ÄúYou fucked up but you‚Äôre not fucked up. Move on and forgive yourself.‚Äù Really comes in handy to this day.

"Having been overspending a lot lately and dipping into our savings, I discussed it with my wife and made a budget. Her response was ""I don't want to look at your spreadsheet"". "
"Whatever you choose I'll warn you about something Ira Glass once called ""The Gap"".  
  
So when you like something and decide that you want to try it yourself, for a long time you are going to have ""The Gap"", the space between your *taste* and your *ability*.  If you decide to learn an instrument, it will probably be because you like music, so you have *taste* that leads you to liking one thing or another.  
  
The problem is, the thing you like takes time, energy, expertise, and practice to create.  If you're learning how to do something, it's going to be a long time before you're able to make something you'll feel is on par with whatever inspired you to learn in the first place.  
  
The key is, *understand* that this gap exists and that it could take you years to cross depending on the skill needed.  Learn to develop a passion and love for the *activity itself*, and don't get frustrated that your output is going to be well below the work of the people who inspired you.

That you can have a bad day and that it does not have anything to do with her. That you can just feel a bit down and you just need some relaxation instead of whining that there's something wrong between the two of you or her insisting she did something wrong or whatever

"The dude she was cheating on me with sent me a long message on Facebook. He claims he never knew we were dating (we were in a long distance relationship at that time), was in way apologizing. It was a weird thing. I would have not found out at least for awhile, so in strange way I was glad he did tell me. 

Made me think of the Childish Gambino lyric.....""sorry that I fucked her, but now you know she's not the one."" "

"Ex gf, had to teach her to never lay an unkind hand on me.  She was physically and emotionally abusive.  Unfortunately, she had to learn the hard way, and then tried to have me arrested for self defense.  She also learned the hard way that police won't just automatically side with her because she's a woman, especially when she lies to them.  

I left very shortly after and I never saw her again.

Edit:  Ohh wow this kinda blew up.  I'm glad to have started a dialogue about domestic abuse.  If you, or someone you know is going through what I went through, they need to leave, as fast as possible.  It DOESNT GET BETTER!!!!"
"Getting ready to pop the question. Brought up a conversation about rings, yeah it's a little obvious but I'm hoping she will have forgotten about the conversation by the time I actually do it. She starts pointing out rings with fucking ridiculous (at least to a ballin-on-a-budget dude like me) price tags. I point out that these rings are expensive.

""Oh, well they say you're supposed to spend 3 months' salary on the engagement ring.""

MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE OF STARVATION?!

EDIT: I feel like I need to throw this out there. She wasn't super adamant about it and it's not like we had a huge fight over it. That's just what she had always heard from wherever she heard it. I can't blame her for wanting a quality ring, I think she's just a little naive about what 3 month's income actually is to a working dude like me, shes still in college. It's not a red flag, shes a great girl, so no, I'm not gonna dump her lol. Thanks for everyone's input and advice though, I actually learned A LOT from this comment. "

"I bury my father tomorrow. I learned of his sudden death while on vacation so I tried to hold it together. When I came home, I told my wife I'll be in the garage for a few hours and need some alone time. I got drunk, jammed his music he liked, and songs that remind me of him, and cried my eyes out. It felt good to grieve and I say allow yourself some time to. We all do differently but for me music helped me with my thoughts. 

Sort of like you, I rejected his last call to me because I was upset about something. I was also upset there was so much on my mind that I never told him because I wanted to forgive him so I never brought it up when we connected later in life. I asked the funeral home for a personal viewing of his body before the cremation. They allowed it. I got everything off my chest at that time and told him I loved him. That was a turning point for me and felt like I was released from the things on my mind. 

As far as you mom, just help and talk as much as you can. There will be a million things that needs to get done. Help. "
"My gf was out , so I was playing candy crush when messages started coming in , she had her Facebook messenger linked to the iPad. So while she out sending messages on her iPhone,  I got the full convo

"Her ass. I‚Äôve always been an ass guy... but when I met my wife, that was taken to the next level. She has the tiniest waist, with a very thick, toned butt. It is gorgeous. I would include pictures if she wouldn‚Äôt murder me lmao. But she hates it, thinks it is too big.... can‚Äôt find pants that fit well, etc. but for me... my goodness... was I ever blessed. 

I hate my ass as well lol. But she likes it... I have a crooked ass crack as a result of scoliosis so I am quite self conscious. But for her, it is genuinely something she enjoys looking at... although I think it is more for amusement than anything else lol."

"Stop viewing decisions as choosing what to do, and start viewing them as choosing who to be.

When the alarm goes for the gym and your hand is hovering over the snooze button, don't ask yourself if you want to sleep for another ten minutes. Ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person who is lazy and doesn't follow through on commitments.

I can't guarantee it will work 100% of the time, but it will be a lot more effective. And once you start living a life that is consistent with your personal values, your self esteem will rocket upwards."

He said, ""They're going to be right in your face, screaming at you as loud as they can.  They're trying to see what you're made of.  They're trying to separate the weaklings from the group.  No matter how intimidated you are, answer their questions loudly, confidently, and without hesitation.  If they sense any weakness, they'll tear you apart.""  He was 100% correct.  Drill Sergeants fucking HATE meek, timid recruits, more than anything else."

"I'm glad I can say I've never been cheated on, but my brother was cheated on by his wife. Their marriage had been less than good for a while but he was determined to work it out, then one day she dropped the news on him that she wanted a divorce. He was blindsided and immediately went to work trying to convince her to stay and try to make things better, but she wasn't having it and after a few weeks he got an apartment and moved out. 

Fast forward a few weeks and he stops by the house to pick up his mail and runs across some stuff addressed to a guy whose name he had never seen before. Questions are raised and the truth is revealed that she'd been having an affair for over a year and was already pregnant with the other guy's kid when she told him she wanted a divorce and had begun moving him in almost immediately after my brother moved out. 

My brother is a pretty soft-hearted guy, but he straight up hates that woman now. She had blamed him for her unhappiness in the marriage when she told him she wanted a divorce and let him beg and plead for another chance while she was spending her ""extra shifts at work"" going on dates and fucking the other guy. It fucked him up big time and he was a mess for months. He questioned himself, he questioned if she'd ever really loved him, he questioned if he'd ever be able to trust again, and was generally down in the dumps. Worse still, they had a kid together so he was (and is) unable to just cut her out of his life. Fortunately however, he has also grown more of a backbone, has a clearer idea of what he wants from life, and has started dating again. Even so, whenever he and I are talking and his kid is out of earshot, his ex-wife is referred to exclusively as That Worthless Whore. "
"Sometimes, she'll tell me something like ""I think I forgot my phone downstairs"" while I'm doing something and I don't really know what to say to that so I'll keep doing what I'm doing and she's like ""you could *at least* react when I'm talking to you!"" and I'm like ""ok, sure"" and she replies ""you could at least ACT like you care!""

How the fuck am I supposed to reply to or care about the fact that you left your fucking phone downstairs? You don't even care when I talk to you about my shitty work day, why should I care about your fucking phone? God fucking damnit. "

"I walked in on my girlfriend of a year with another man in our hotel bed in Thailand celebrating our anniversary/my birthday at the full moon party. Basically short circuited, closed the door, went back to the party and sulked watching the fire jump rope. Some Irish guys saw me and successful cheered me up after I told them what happened. We had an awesome night, figured don't let it ruin this once in a lifetime opportunity. 
Those Irish guys invited me to Cambodia with them and I drunkenly accepted and bought a ticket. i stayed at their hotel.The next morning I went to get my stuff. She claimed she thought it was me cuz she was drunk... Yeah right. I packed my shit and started a new adventure. 
Cambodia was amazing. Best week of my life. 

P.s (Bonus) Turns out karma is a real bitch. Upon returning home I went to my exs house to gather my stuff. She guilt tripped me, lied about being prego  the whole 9 yards of bullshit. Then told me what happened to her. I couldn't have even conceived such a punishment.
She lost her passport and wallet and ended up going on a coke binge with a bunch of Australian guys. Long story short she got a flight home and had a connection flight through HongKong. Guess on the flight she was withdrawing from the drugs and got sick. Cue the best news I've ever heard  THEY PUT HER IN QUARANTINE IN THE HONG KONG AIRPORT FOR 4 DAYS! justice. 

TLDR Got cheated on in Thailand, got over it, went to Cambodia had great time. Instant justice when she spends 4 days in Hong Kong airport quarantine. "
"He started acting weird, distant, distracted, evasive. He started hiding his phone and showering right when he came home instead of coming to see me. He started going on long bike rides to clear his head and would come home after 4 hours looking like he hadn't been biking long. I have been through enough of this bullshit in my life (my father is a philanderer) to know what was happening so I looked in his phone while he showered. Him and his ex had started sleeping together again. She didn't even know about me. 

I just walked into the bathroom and said, ""I fucking knew it. You have no respect for anyone. We are all just apart of your ego game."" (Something like that... That sounds wrong but the right sentiment.) He saw me with the phone and I walked out. When he left for work I packed and drove to my parents house and didn't come back to town for a month. By then they were dating and I found an apartment on the other side of town. Ran into them a handful of times and ignored them both. They broke up after a few months, ya know, when it's not exciting anymore because you aren't actually doing anything wrong. Some people live for the thrill."

I've been antsing to work on my game so I've asked my fiancee to bowl a few times. She always says no, that she doesn't feel like it. So eventually I stopped asking, figuring she just isn't going to want to go bowling with me.

That's fine, except she has, several times, commented on the fact that I don't go bowling as much anymore, and even said ""you're gonna get rusty!""

I know, babe. I don't have anyone to go with. I'm not going to go alone.

Recently she said ""I'll go bowling with you soon.""

So a few days later I asked if she wanted to go bowling.

She said ""Not tonight I don't feel like it.""'

Hey man I feel you on this one. My wife is a school teacher and before we had kids she did the same thing her first year teaching as well. I also worked long hours in a high stress field. Had a few similar incidents and we came to a compromise. First week and last week of summer she didn't do shit. That was her time. Just chilled out and all she really had to do was keep the kitchen clean. After that she kept the house clean for the summer and made dinner for most of the week. It wasn't that hard and she still got to relax most of the day. After that we both looked forward to Summer vacation because I didn't do chores or cook dinner and she still got plenty of time to relax.
Which of your dads are we talking about? 
"Fair play to that lad - I'm sure you're not going to see him as 'the good guy' in all this, but clearly he felt guilty as soon as he found out and did what he could to make things right. He also saved you future pain by finding out sooner rather than later. It takes balls to send a message like that when he has no idea how you'll react.

(Cynical me thinks maybe he already knew/suspected she was in a relationship and made sure to get his end away first before feeling guilty later...but either way he sort of did you a favour)"

"""Panicking doesn't solve anything. It's the worst thing you can do in a serious situation.""

My example that really drove this home was several years later when I moved in with my future wife. I'm sleeping because I'm a late sleeper and she usually has the house to herself and our dog Fred in the mornings. One time I hear the dog thrashing/ yelping and metal rattling like crazy. He sounded like he was dying. Then I hear my wife screaming in horror. I didn't just get out of bed, I got up and jumped up and over it to get to whatever was happening. I get to the kitchen to see my wife sobbing and holding her terrified dog. Turns out he walked into his crate and a door latch somehow wedged into his eye socket. While panicking he thrashed about but was still stuck TO the crate. It wound up getting tangled in the cartilage or tenden behind his eye. I calmly got the bolt cutters and went to work on the piece of metal protruding only an inch from his face. My hands were trembling but that's the only part that gave away that I was nervous. I snipped off the piece and we drove him to the vet with it still sticking out of his head. Took the vet over two hours to remove it and I even had to draw a crude example of what the object looked like. Kind of an enclosed hook piece.

My wife said how grateful she was that I was so calm because it really helped our dog relax too (as well as herself). I called my dad later that night to tell him that I finally put his proverb into practice and to thank him for it."

Out of the shower and now you have a choice. Sleep in clothing or sleep in pjs. Pick the clothing. Well, now you‚Äôre a bit more awake. Put your shoes on and watch YouTube. That‚Äôs weird? Watching YouTube with shoes on? Have faith. Watch YouTube for as long as you want. 2pm rolls around. You‚Äôve been awake for 7 HOURS! Still have your shoes on? Hm. Guess you can go to the gym. Once you get there if you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything, just turn around and go back home. 10$ says you don‚Äôt though. 

Wow. It‚Äôs New Years! 4 months from now. You‚Äôre waking up early, eating right, and probably starting to see some definition in your body from working out at the gym a couple times a week. You realize had you not started 4 months ago, you‚Äôd still be doing the same thing day in and day out waiting for motivation to do something with your life. Motivations a fickle bitch. She comes and goes, never dependable. You need to want a better life so much that you stop valuing fake shit and do what‚Äôs in your best interest. I don‚Äôt give a shit about you. No one does. You want a better life, then take the little steps. Or don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. "
"Oh...how did I react? First time I was married. Two kids. I went into strategy mode. Didn‚Äôt say a word. Spent months putting ‚Äòthings‚Äô into place. Moving money. Met w lawyers. Just tried to figure out best way to take care of myself. One of the smartest things I ever did. 
Second .... confronted him. Compulsive liar kept lying. And oddly I kept buying his bs. Until I didn‚Äôt. Then I walked out the door. Told him to donate any of my stuff I left behind. 
Third....I‚Äôm a mess. Can‚Äôt shake this one. Heart broken. End of story. Trying not to jump on a daily basis. I won‚Äôt but this one really threw me. "
When did my immediate and extended family get a reddit account?
"The first thing that came to mind is the girls who talk constantly. 

I used to date a girl like that. She was interesting at first (I was also thinking with my dick) but after a few months I was exhausted whenever I came home. Not from the sex but from the unstoppable torrent of words that came out of her mouth. "
"If you don't know how to do something there are ways of finding out rather than saying ""I don't know how to do this!"", Throwing your hands up after literally 5 seconds, and asking me to do it as if I was born knowing how to disassemble her side table."

"It's a little different. Talking on the phone is the activity, it's the thing you're doing. Talking while you're playing a co-op game online is no different than talking in person while playing that game, or talking at the bar. The conversation isn't the activity, it just happens. "
"""Competing with other males...""

Hookups notwithstanding, the marriage market is evened out by monogamy.  You're only competing with more appealing men if you're angling for the same woman as they are.  The deal is, we are supposed to figure out roughly where we fit on the bracket, what our strengths and weaknesses are, what we value in a partner, and use that information to inform our search.  You're looking for the person who best satisfies your most important criteria, whose criteria you best satisfy, within the parameters of people loosely on your ""level.""

There are a few things you can change about yourself - if you dress like a hobo, you can fix that.  With a little more effort you can get in better shape.  Crooked teeth?  Braces.  Shy and socially awkward?  Observe more adept folks and learn social skills from them, and put yourself outside your comfort zone and build up your endurance for social situations.  Kind of an asshole?  Work on that.

But in the other direction, ask yourself if you're aiming too high and ignoring people who might like you, over superficial stuff that you could live with."
"My SO loves my chest hair, which until we were going out I used to trim with clippers on a high-ish setting so that they weren't all gone, but significantly shorter. Now because she says she likes it I let it grow naturally."

"I take it the problem is post-piss drip.  

As the wise man has said,  ""No matter how much you shake and dance, the last drop always falls in your...""

The reason for this is that the channel from your bladder does an S curve, somewhat like the trap in a toilet.  Unlike a toilet, there are muscles to squeeze pee out of that 'trap', but they don't always do a perfect job, especially if not well coordinated with other muscles lining that channel.

Long story short, too much remaining pee in the trap is vulnerable to being forced out at an unexpected moment.

There is a little trick for this I have learned in my old age (55):  The bottom of the trap is located just behind your balls.  Press there and give one more shake before zipping up.  Less pee in the trap, less drips in the pants."

We used to give him Popsicles at the end because it was literally the only thing he could stomach. I will always remember, ""Get me another one. Green. I love green."" then he passed, just like that.

Couple weeks later I was at home, nodding off when all I could smell was the Arturo Fuente cigars he used to smoke, the rumble of his old pickup truck, and the sound of the tune less whistle that proceeded him everywhere I went.

"First off, let me say I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. You‚Äôre going to hear that a lot over the next couple of weeks and then it tapers out. My dad passed suddenly in 2015 when I was 23 as well and was pretty much in the same position you‚Äôre in when my father passed suddenly. 

This is going to be tough but there will be one of you in the group that will step up and take care of things. It sounds like you‚Äôll fit this role. Someone that will grieve, your mom. And someone that will support your mom. While you‚Äôre there, make sure you get as much organized as possible, the funeral, people coming over to bring your family meals, and someone to come and check on your mom every couple of days after you fly home. There will be a lot of moving parts, but you need to make sure to grieve as well. Go lock yourself in the bathroom and just cry. Go and sit in a closet and scream. You cannot bottle up these emotions. 

In regards to your mom and the house, it‚Äôs possible your father had life insurance, or has an account setup with his work that can help give your mom some relief. If you‚Äôre in a position to help your mom financially then go for it but don‚Äôt feel like you have to. Sadly I felt pressured to help my mom and it put a strain on our relationship. It‚Äôs going to be a stressful time for her in the coming months, just be there to listen and help when you can but don‚Äôt feel guilty if you can‚Äôt help 24/7. It‚Äôs okay. She will still love you. 

Finally, you need to take time to process this. My last conversation with my dad was me telling him that no one cared about his opinion. It killed me every day for two years. Don‚Äôt take the guilt of not calling with you for years. Life happens. But you do need to talk it out with a therapist and get your mind straight. 

IF YOU DONT READ ANY OF THE ABOVE, READ THIS AT LEAST. Write down any story that comes to your mind about your dad. You‚Äôre going to start to forget them over time. If you have any videos of your dad, back them up on Google Photos or Amazon Photos. There will be a time when you forget their voice. Lastly, hug everyone you care about and tell them how much they mean to you. There will be a time when you can‚Äôt anymore. 

You don‚Äôt know me, but I‚Äôm here for you any time you need to talk. You‚Äôre going to get through this. "

I set a pricewatch for the things I think I want. ( i use wirecutter/sweethome to find out what the best in class product is)

After a period of time I get a notification that the item is at or below it's historic low.

At that point I most often find I don't want the thing anymore, but if I do, I buy it. Smart locks are ridiculous and overpriced, but I want one. Right now I have a watch set up for the 4 models that are suitable &amp; will eventually get one, although I have a feeling that within a month I will discover I didn't actually want/need one that much.

Then I look at all the things I normally buy, and set up pricewatches for the same thing in bulk. It seems silly to buy sponges in bulk, but I have the best sponges, I pay half price, and I never have to worry about running out or buying more. I know I like uniqlo tees, when they went on sale last month I bought 10 because I knew I would buy them at full retail eventually otherwise.

You also have to know when to focus on quality and when to focus on price. When it comes to tools I buy the absolute cheapest piece of shit (harbor freight or china), and if I use it enough to break it I replace it with something good (with the help of camelcamelcamel).

If I'm buying something that is cheap, I cut out the middle man and buy it directly from china on dealextreme or gearbest. You can get a great unlocked android phone there dirt cheap (and put it on a prepaid/MVNO &amp; end up paying 1k less a year), or you can buy [Portable Student Pencil Sharpener Knife 10pcs](https://www.gearbest.com/other-supplies/pp_009515959305.html?wid=1433363) for 4.20$ and not have to worry about a box cutter for the next 10 years. (don't buy this if you have kids) 

for clothes I use nordstrom rack, filter search by size &amp; sort by price. I've regularly been getting compliments on nice clothes I spent 12$ on.

If you can trust yourself to be diligent, you can also subsidize travel by signing up for credit cards with big miles rewards, paying them off, rinsing &amp; repeating. If you buy on amazon they have a 5% reward card you should be using. If you don't care about this stuff at all, fidelity has a 2% reward card that deposits into a retirement account.

If you spend a lot of money on disposable razors, you'll get a fine shave &amp; save money with a safety razor. If you end up using your disposable for too long since they are so expensive you'll end up with a better shave for less money.

It's all about spending your money where it's most important to you. It's the total amount spent that matters, so spending a little more upfront will free up $ for your future self in a few months.

Fortune favors the prepared.

also I use [personal capital](https://share.personalcapital.com/x/dzroSC) (referral link) to keep track of my spending &amp; investments. It helps to understand where your money is being spent so you can direct your strategic spending. If you aren't thinking about your retirement yet now is the time to start, it's absurd how little you need to save if you start at 20 vs starting at 30. Every single day matters, even if it's only a dollar a day, starting today is the most important thing you can do for yourself. Sign up for personal capital &amp; take that 20$ bonus &amp; put it in a Merrill Edge no minimum retirement account.

I'm at 31 yo male and finding a woman my age with no kids is getting harder and harder. No stigma here. My preference lol.
A male groupie? You mean a stalker?
"Well..

Our usual group of friends were drinking at her house. My girlfriend Rebecca, her best friend &amp; her boyfriend, another of her female friends, and Rebecca‚Äôs best friends older sister we‚Äôll call Jessica. We had been doing our usual thing of drinking and dancing throughout the house..jumping in and out of the hot tub, and playing with the dogs. 

A few hours into this we break out my girlfriends moonshine. We‚Äôre all about 6-8 drinks in and this was a bad call but hey whatever, we‚Äôre mostly freshman at university with Jessica being 26 so we didn‚Äôt have much to do on a Friday night during the summer.

Fast forward 45 minutes and everyone is shitfaced. The other couple with us is out cold in one of the spare bedrooms and Rebecca had passed out in her own bed. That leaves two.

Jessica and I are sitting outside, piss drunk, chatting and somehow end up on the topic of my girlfriends infidelity(our relationship got off to a rocky start) I have trouble picking out exact details of the conversation considering I just took moonshine to the face for the first time but it eventually summed up to her stating ‚Äú C‚Äômon you must know by now..‚Äù which evolved into my prying out of her that Rebecca had cheated on me a few months back... right around my birthday. I sortve broke down. In front of Jessica. She started comforting me and one thing lead to another and I‚Äôm having sex with Rebecca‚Äôs best friends older sister outside on the deck while everyone‚Äôs passed out inside of the house...after that she walked home and I passed out on the couch in the living room because no way in hell I was driving home. Woke up around 8am and drove home with my things. Received a call around 2pm asking why I was being weird and I told her it was over. She still has no idea how I found out and ending up admitting to it during the phone call. 

Tl:dr 
Her friends older sister told me while everyone was passed out, then had sex with said older sister on girlfriends deck. "

Personality being too much... I‚Äôm not sure. I like women who are charismatic and have a lot of personality, but anyone can be obnoxious. I‚Äôm fairly laid back and not loud, so I can sometimes be turned off by someone who‚Äôs loud and in my face all the time. That depends too though.

"To eat a standard diet and exercise. My GF exercised decently before we started dating but it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to squat today‚Äù literally every day. 

Then we have the diet... the best way to explain it is that she had the diet of a 5 year old. She would eat Mac n cheese, chicken tenders and fries every day if the food choices were solely up to her. She also never cooked before we dated. 

However, my gf is awesome. She has never been big, she is tiny by nature and now switched up her workout and is getting small muscles everywhere and she‚Äôs proud of herself! She also cooks up some awesome food, even if she always likes to have multiple carbs with dinner like bread, potato‚Äôs and some sort of pasta. I prefer a lighter more meat &amp; veggie oriented meal, but if that is the worst of my problems, we are doing great! And yes I continue to dinners as well, it‚Äôs all about balance

EDIT: I don‚Äôt hate or *wish I didn‚Äôt have to teach* my GF this. It‚Äôs more of an experience with something both of us have worked on and compromised with to find a balance that works for us"

"Have your clothes tailored.

You don't have to use TruMaker or all those other tailoring ""apps"" with their $120 shirts and otherBS.  Just find a dry cleaner that also does tailoring.  Off the rack shirts never really fit anyone correctly, but you can buy inexpensive shirts that are similar in size, and then bring them to a tailor and have them redone for like $10-$20.    (Remember, you can take clothes IN but it's hard to have them taken OUT, so buy shirts that are slightly too large, you can't do much about a shirt that is too small.

Go get measured, have them alter your shirts and pants so that they fit right.  

Also, dry cleaning day is my favorite day of the week, just feels good to go pick up all your dry cleaned stuff, and it's not that expensive, lots of places do shirts for $1.50 or so.  

In addition:  

- Clean out (and wash) your car.  Then wax it.  Auto wax is like $10 for several cars worth. It takes maybe two hours of work to really clean your car, but it's totally worth it.  Dirty cars are embarrassing, and I suck at keeping my car clean throughout the week.  A clean car feels good to get into, and other people will respect it too.  We all know how it feels when you get into that one friend's car that is all gross and full of trash and shit.

- Go out to lunch (or dinner) by yourself occasionally (NOT fast food) preferably with a seat at the bar, get to know the bartender.  It's nice to have someone else prepare the food and do your dishes.  Become a regular somewhere.  Tip well enough that people will remember your order/preferences.  I did this at a restaurant in my town that is a nicer place (not crazy nice, but nice enough to take a date to) by coming in by myself or with male friends, now when I do take my gf there, they greet me by my name and start bringing out comped food and stuff ""compliments of the chef,"" because I have a ""guy"" there.  I worked with some really wealthy people in the past, and I noticed that those guys have ""a guy"" for everything.  Get your own guy, trust me, you will feel and look like a king.

He works at Nintendo. 
My dad worked nights and was home asleep during the day. My cousin was dating a guy that happened to live across the street from us. One day she came running through the door crying asking where my dad was. I told her upstairs asleep. She runs upstairs and the next thing I see is my dad briskly walking through the front door in whitey tighties and a wife beater. I run over to the window and see him walking over to the guys house. He goes inside and a few minutes later he's dragging the dude outside by his hair and gets down with a finger in his face and said something to him. He then tossed his head down and came back to the house and went straight back to bed without a word. Years later my cousin told me that the guy smacked her for not having his laundry done when he woke up for work and that my dad told the guy to stay away from her or he'd come back and kill him. It was surreal because that was the only time my dad has been anything other than an easy going hippy.

"Hopefylly, this won t get burried. 

So... I knew from the beginning that she was a bisexual or at least that she used to date girls. 

However, we got into a relationship and years go by. The first 4-5 years were amazing: sex was awesome, we used to cook together, go into trips together and so on. 

However, after a while, she started to change. She kind of quit seeing her friends and started meeting with a whole new set of girls. She told me they were customers of her from the hairstyling saloon she was working at. Started to go to music festivals, get stoned with weed with the girls, started to drink and so on. 

The she started to go on trips ""with the girls"". And soon after that, I ve started to hear quite often the name of one of the girls. She used to spend most of the day with her, went at her place and at her job. 

Meanwhile, one of her best friends (of the old ones) dies and she starts spending more and more time with the girls. At this point, I find it quite odd and start asking questions, although it seemed natural for me to let her spend time with the girls due to the recent loss of her friend. 

Things went out of control soon. She started staying at this friend of hers more and more. At some point, I tried to save the relationship and took her in a vacation to Cyprus, but even there, she was texting all day long to her ""friend"". 

After I started realizing what was happening, I started to focus on myself and what I love most: medicine. I also went to dancing classes, medical congresses and met a lot of new people and I just let the relationship die. Apparently, the now ex-girlfriend had been hiding a relationship with that girl for about 10 months. 

Although it affected me, I can t say that I was heart-brokern, maybe because the relationship did not die all of a sudden, but rather it took quite a while. You see, you can t make your brain understand that your SO is cheating with another woman. You need a whole lot of evidence to even consider this, but deep inside you know something is off. At the point you understand and fully aknowledge what is happening, you are kind of... free. In fact, after I realized what was happening, I was kind of glad when she did not come home because I didn t have to see her lying face pretending that nothing was happening and that I was free to do things to improve myself.

Sorry for the Grammar mistakes. The past tenses in English are killing me."

I dated an independent girl who didn‚Äôt prioritize our relationship so I stopped dating her. I felt like I was on the back burner like you described. But her independence wasn‚Äôt a problem, her outlook on our relationship was. She never allowed me to pay for her and she didn‚Äôt need me for stupid stuff. That part was really nice.

"There was a girl who became really into me really fast and came on really strong. By the end of our first date she was already randomly saying things like ""you're so amazing,"" and by the second date she was getting pouty that I wasn't saying it back to her. But she also made fun of me in ways that were weirdly mean and that she certainly wouldn't have put up with in return. Basically she was incredibly insecure and not emotionally ready for a relationship. (In fact, I later learned that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants, which explained everything.) There was good chemistry so I stupidly let it go on for about two weeks, and when I broke it off it was a more dramatic conversation than the end of any of my year+ relationships."
"Hey man, that's extremely annoying, but from your tone and reaction, it seems like it's not the first time. Have you talked to her about this kind of thing? Like, since she isn't working at all during the summer, you shouldn't work and then come home to house work? I think that's fair."

It can be difficult when one of you has a stressful job and the other doesn‚Äôt because it creates a gap in how you relate to one another... you really have to dig deep and try to sympathize with things from their perspective."

"I‚Äôm a twin as well, so while your other your dad is ‚Äúattacking‚Äù my dad, I‚Äôll get in the way of your other your dad. While he is sizing me up, my other me would run in from the side and People‚Äôs elbow your other your dad‚Äôs dick off. "

"Dude you fix that shit, otherwise it‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. You are essentially married to a 3rd person of which you have no personal gain.

"This shit used to happen to me all the time. For a few years I worked 3rd shift as an aircraft mechanic. I‚Äôd typically get home from work between 7 and 8 each morning. At the time my wife wasn‚Äôt working, and it bothered her that I would ‚Äúsleep all day‚Äù while she was taking care of the kids (they were toddlers at the time). NO SHIT I SLEEP ALL DAY....I WORK ALL FUCKING NIGHT! I can‚Äôt tell you how many times we had arguments after she‚Äôd wake me up at 1 or 2 in the afternoon after only sleeping for 4-5 hours. Like bitch, I fix airplanes, I need to be rested because I literally can‚Äôt fuck up at work. And don‚Äôt even get me started on all the Saturday morning‚Äôs I came home in the morning after working all night and had the kids dumped on me because it was ‚Äúher turn‚Äù to get a break. Fuck. "
"Yep, tell her you found out the website after a female power lifter online told you in a reply to your comment that specifies details of her ass. "
"I feel that way about all of my exes. But for good reasons.

Every woman I've ever dated was attractive, kind, and smart. And since I currently don't have anyone like that in my life, I find myself thinking ""WTF was I thinking letting X, Y, or Z get away!?""

I've evolved from every failed relationship. They helped me identify my shortcomings and I am kicking myself in the butt because things could have worked out if I had identified them sooner."

"My father failed to consciously teach me anything.

But I learned that when you fight with a spouse, you should make it a taboo to take anything personal, or get upset, or take offense, or goad the other person into getting angry to make your case look stronger than it is.

No accusations, no raising of the voice, no allowing your ego to get hurt. It's always you and your partner versus the problem, never you versus your partner.

I learned by watching him do it wrong."
"What women call ""plus-sized"" is not what men called plus sized. Hell, what one person in line for the bus calls plus-sized is different from the next person, so it's really subjective.

If you're grossly obese and you call yourself plus-sized, it's a turn off more so because you're delusional. But if you've got a few pounds on you, most men would just say you're 'thick', which could actually be a good thing. It's all dependent on the guy's opinion is of ""plus-sized""."

"Not particularly original I'm afraid, but I checked her phone.

We were both 27. We'd been together seriously for four years, and on/off for a while before that, making it about six years total. Long story short - she started getting a lot of messages from a co-worker, which she would read in front of me and talk about openly. Hiding in plain sight I guess. These messages started coming in at unusual times; v late at night, Sunday afternoons, etc. She eventually stopped talking about him, but made zero effort to hide the messages, so I didn't question it at first. Eventually curiosity got the better of me, and I checked her phone when she was in the shower.

Completely broke my heart. There were long back and forth conversations, both of them laughing and joking, clearly reveling in how 'naughty' they were being and the lengths they were going to in order to keep it secret from co-workers. And me.

I did my best to keep my composure and think about how to handle it. Our lives were utterly intertwined, almost all of our friends were mutual, our families were close, we were on the road to a proposal. But I had no choice but to confront her, and I did the following evening. I just asked her straight if there had ever been anything with said co-worker, and she quickly denied it. I pushed on though, and only after about an hour of strenuous denial, gaslighting, and attempts to make me think I had completely lost the plot (which almost worked) did she finally break down and admit it. Part of it anyway. Adding up her confession with the dates of the messages I had seen lead to the realisation that it had been going on for months.

I told her it was done and walked out. Or at least tried to. At the time, she was renting a room on the top floor of a four story town house, which took maybe a minute to walk the short flights of stairs to get to the top. It took me about 15 minutes to get down the stairs and out the front door. She was gripping on to me, blocking my path, screaming, crying, forcing her small body between me and doors to try and prevent me leaving. Honestly, that's the part that stayed with me the most, it was dreadful. 

She wrote me a long confessional letter shortly after, but my mind was made up. Bottom line - she never would have told me. I probably would be married to her now and it would have been her little secret, which still eats me up a little, I can't lie.

It was a few years ago now though, and I've got a lot better at trusting women after indulging in a somewhat (sadly predictable) promiscuous period."
Sounds like a great compromise. Much better than arguing.
"We just relocated for my new job.
She just hates it here.

"I think things like sarcasm, independence, being loud, being blunt, honest, can all be fine, depending on context and intent.

Sarcasm can be humorous if it's done with levity and certain tone, but if it's done purely to belittle someone, it can be a very different beast. For example, I know a guy who can't wait to make jokes implying how stupid he thinks his wife is, in front of his wife and others, and that's just being a dick. Someone else who makes self-deprecating sarcastic remarks or uses sarcasm to point out something that's a bit silly/ridiculous, that can be pretty hilarious.

Independence really comes down, in my mind, to: Is the person able to take care of everything themselves in life if they need to, but also able to integrate a relationship into their lives, including mutual support, sharing and such? Or, are they the type of independent where it's their way or the highway, and everyone just better stay out of their damn way. Both those people are independent, but one is a strong, respectable individual, and the other is a self-centered irritant.

For being blunt/honest, there are some people who are truthful and don't beat around the bush, but also employ tact, discretion and basic social etiquette, good manners and common sense. Then there are the people who have zero filter and spend their days being extremely rude to everyone they encounter, and just say ""oh, I'm just very blunt and honest; tee-hee!""

At first I used words and reasoning but it wasn‚Äôt until I showed her what a ‚Äúlittle gun‚Äù like my .22 can do to household objects and a piece of flesh using goodwill items and cheap cuts of pork and the occasional tree was it that she understood guns are not to be played with.

"This is what I'm teaching my kid. I was very gentle and kind when I was young. i got bullied quite a bit. Teachers would just tell me to come to them next time it happened or to even ignore them, that didn't help one bit. The only thing that helped was that I became bigger, stronger and no longer willing to take shit from anyone. 

I went from a bit of an outside to a popular kid by doing two things : making other kids laugh and not taking any shit from anyone. I don't like fighting or violence, eventhough I fought a lot when I was younger. It's just that some people - especially some kids - only respect you when you physically stand up for yourself. It's the only language they speak, they won't respond to reason.

I ended up with a bit of a reputation and less verbally gifted kids who were friends with me ended up being safe from those who'd otherwise love them as their target. The only issue was that after all those fights, I was close to being expelled. Teachers will always blame the one who ""escalated"", rarely the one who instigated."

"My dad hated that I wrestled in high school because he thought it was gay and he would regularly tell me that. One day, I had enough and told him to shut up about it because I enjoyed it and wasn't going to quit. He then wanted to make a deal: if he could beat me in wrestling then I would have to quit and focus completely on football instead. The man was delusional if he thought he stood a chance, he's 5'8""ish and I'm 6'2"" and even though we were similar weight at the time his wasn't muscle weight.

We went to the backyard and I proceeded to manhandle him for about 20 minutes, never giving him a chance to even think that he could compete with me. He wouldn't give up and I wouldn't finish it until I thought he learned a lesson, but I finally put him in a banana split and pinned him. He was very obviously pissed off and was trying to hide it but he never brought up the topic again.

I feel like I started getting a lot more respect from him afterwards and we now have a pretty decent relationship even though he's still not a great person."

"The best way you can help her stay in great physical shape is to help her stay in great mental and emotional shape. If she feels like she can talk to you about the stuff she's going through and that you'll really listen, deal with it and process it so that the urge to comfort eat and stay doing nothing indoors is lessened, you'll probably find she's much more likely to work out for her own enjoyment. 

Also just reaffirm her good choices with diet and workouts with praise, admiration and respect. Tell her how happy it makes you to see her looking after herself and feeling good in her own skin. No one enjoys putting weight on and getting out of shape. A lot of the time, it's not what they're eating; it's what's eating them.

"Any online place mostly filed with woman will always have strict *no hurting feels* rules. The worst thing you can possibly do is make someone feel bad for being the way they are. Even if they're a vile person.

It's been my experience the first thing a woman does when she decides she wants to hop into the men's room is to ask leaders to disallow criticism. They want to be treated equal. And by equal they mean they want everyone else to change how they behave according to their standards and have that classified as equality. Oh, and how dare you if you don't agree. How. Dare. You. "

"My dad was in his 40s when I was born. The pros are that he‚Äôs much more well off and I had a very comfortable childhood and he‚Äôs much more mature so he was a very good father. He‚Äôs been a great father to be honest. 

The biggest problem is that in my mid 20s he‚Äôs about to enter his 70s. He‚Äôs in great shape and I expect him to live well into his 80s. Except that at that age, even health can‚Äôt keep back sudden death for certain. He‚Äôs almost at an age when people will stop saying he died too soon. They‚Äôll say he simply lived a long happy life. 

The hardest part is seeing him notice it. He looks and acts like a healthy man 20 years younger, but people his age are dying all around him. He knows he‚Äôs creeping closer and I hate seeing it. He doesn‚Äôt seem to dread it, but the thought slips through his mind in conversation sometimes.

"Honestly I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre closer to each other than I am to my friends. I feel like there are certain things that 99.9% of guys think is weird.

Or help me pick out a nice outfit. 

Just because girls do those things on the regular without ever thinking twice about it isn‚Äôt a sign of them being closer to their friends than guys are. 

I don‚Äôt feel like girls that don‚Äôt talk to each other regularly can stay friends. I have certain guys I worked with or were close with in high school that I don‚Äôt talk to for months at a time. But when we see each other it‚Äôs like nothing ever changed. I don‚Äôt really see that too much in girls. "

"Well, you can start by thinking about where your heart lies. Do not just jump into whatever. Think. Do you want to create your own characters and worlds and write stories about them? Maybe you don't care about stories, but you have a few designs in your head and you want to draw them? Or maybe you want to play music like you hear other people do?

Don't be afraid to try things out and drop them if they don't work out for you. 

I tried writing. I like it. My big stories suck, but short ones are decent, imo. I will continue writing because I like it.

I tried painting Warhammer 40000 miniatures, didn't work out, so I think I'll drop it.

This Saturday I went for my first drawing class and I've spent 2 hours trying to draw a cirle just with my hand. I definitely need more practice, but I will try again and again and eventually, hopefully, I will be able to draw characters from my fantasies.

What I mean is, try things out. See what sticks.

And remember, no matter what you will decide to do, you will suck at the start, so don't get discouraged. Try again and then again.

But most importantly, even if you never become all that great, so what? You are having fun while creating something and that is what matters."

"Reading. Never been much of a reader and now my kids are putting me to shame. They talk about these elaborate worlds and settings as if they're the greatest things ever.

"I'd liken it to how people suffering from a stutter can often speak clearly if they sing it instead of just say it. It's something to do with distracting the brain from the task they struggle so much with which allows them to sing clearly

If I'm talking about life with my male friends and we're *just* talking, it's too much. We have no way to escape the feeling of vulnerability, no way to ignore the crippling uncomfortability that happens when we express the negative emotions ie sadness or fear or weakness or insecurity. The stuff we're not supposed to talk about with *anyone* except maybe our moms or sisters (I really wish I had a sister)

And if it's something really serious I'll be at risk of crying which i obviously could never do in front of someone else. 

But if we're doing something else, *especially* playing video games online so we don't even have to be physically in the same room, we can all kind of silently agree that we're **not** talking about life. We're playing a video game. And the talking about life is something that's just happening that we can pretend later never happened. I'm never at risk of crying because my mind is being stimulated and distracted by the game. And we have a built in escape. I can yell at them for not camping at the flag like they were supposed to if I need to stop the conversation. Or I can tease them about something. And it's not rude cuz we weren't talking about life we were playing a game and just bullshitting.

Honestly online gaming is a godsend for when I'm feeling alone or weak. Doubly so if the friends I'm playing with aren't people I've ever met or known irl, just internet friends. I can really open up to them in ways I can't to real life friends"

"Honestly not sure it should get to me, but she can be so unattentive (inattentive?) it just infuriates me.

When she vacuums I often have to redo large areas, not because I get down on the floor with a looking glass inspecting her work, last time I literal went into the office, looked beside my chair and found a big ball of fluff. Most corners hadn't even been touched, chairs not moved, just overall lazy work, makes my blood boil, it literally doubles the work because she can't be arsed to do it right the first time round.

2 days ago she brought some groceries home, 3 bell peppers to be used for the dinner I was prepping, first one out of the bag is completely rotten. Not just a little mark, it had a huge black spot, it was soft and it reeked, cutting it open mold was growing inside. Literally any minute inspection of it would've revealed this. But apperently that's too much work.

"I'm pretty fucking sure that most female slut shaming originates from females and most male virgin shaming originates from males.

I'm also pretty sure that most of the pressure of ""Noo, I must wear makeup or no male will like me!"" or ""Nooo, I must be muscular or no female will like me!"" was pretty much invented by that sex itself and more often than not the members of the other sex don't give a damn."
"I had a FWB recently that literally wanted to do it 3x a day, every day.

it got to the point where I'd come home from work &amp; she was waiting for me, which is terrible because I live in a gated community.  which means either the gate happened to be open &amp; she came in or she waited for cars to go through &amp; followed behind them."

I think men just appreciate whatever is exposed. 
"holy shit that would make me so angry.  

recently, a person very close to me had passed away.  i received the news while i was with my gf, and naturally i was very sad about it.  she immediately started bitching me out because apparently i never even told her he was sick (she didn't know him...i had never mentioned him at all to her).  she was hurt, and offended that i didn't open up and share that i had a friend who was dying...which means i really dont care about her and im ""shady as fuck.""  like holy hell, i just found out my fucking friend died can you at least wait til tomorrow before you start some shit?

fast forward to a few weeks later.  we're having a conversation (which is really just her talking about herself, and me chiming in with a few comments here and there to prove i'm listening).  i try to open up about a hard day i was having as it was the anniversary of one of my parents' death (coupled with the fact that my friend had died a couple weeks prior, the feels hit me).  she said, ""oh.  thats sad.""  then continued on talking about herself.  i'm just like...thats exactly why i dont fucking open up to you."
"Well, interesting. We had a son that was 4, and we'd already split up a few times as it was evident we didn't work, but we were one of those couples that when things were good they were fantastic, but when they were bad they were simply horrid.

So this guy at works name kept popping up into conversation more and more, I noted it and one day she called me at home from work as she's left her mobile at home and needs 'Keith's' number as he's late for work and needs to call him to find out where he is. So as I relay the number to her from her phone, I take it down myself just in case I ever need it in the future.

Fast forward two months, a Friday. I get a new job assistant managing a pub about 2 hours away, and in going to be living in and coming home at weekends. The day I am leaving, Karen is getting the house all clean and tidy because 'two female work friends are coming over tonight'. She never had work friends over and I start to get a bit suspicious, so I offer to help her in this unprecedented cleaning spree she is having, and as I suspected she would, she is reluctant to let me help (guilt - she was always moaning about me not helping enough when tidying, but now she really was insisting I sit and relax and get ready for starting my me job that evening), so I was about 80% sure of my suspicions at that point. So I knew what I had to do.

I left with my bag packed for a week and headed off to my new job and waited until 11.30pm, a time which would be guaranteed to  have her alleged friends there and went to the pub phonebooth, picked up the receiver and took my mobile out of my pocket with the other and called her mobile from the pub landline.

She answered and I did the pleasantries and asked how her night was going - it was very quiet in the background. She told me her two friends had come round and had gone out for a drink and are coming back shortly, and as she was telling me an anecdote about earlier in the evening in one ear, I set my mobile phone to 'number withheld' and called Keith's number and held it to my other ear. 

Wow, that guy must have been quick, because it only rang for about a quarter of a ring and cut off. And I could swear I heard a short ring on the landline at exactly the same time.

But that's not proof is it. Hell no. I could scream and shout infidelity all I wanted but I'd probably look a bit crazy off the back of a noise I overheard during a phone call. It wasn't much to go by, even though now I was at 99% in my own mind, so I decided I'd just get the guy to admit it to me without realising. So I waited until Monday afternoon and called him again, withholding my number.

It's important to note that even though we had never met, I took it he probably knew quite a bit about me, including the fact I was Scottish and had a voice that gave that fact away. Just as well I'm very good at doing voices and donned my best cockney accent for the call (imagine Harry from 'In Bruges')


Keith: Uhh, hello?

Me: Hello?

Keith: Uhh, yeah, who is that?

Me: it's the boyfriend of the girl you were fucking on Friday night, don't worry, she told me all about it you fucking little cunt.

Keith: (silence)

Me: Cat got your fucking tongue has it? Got anything to fucking say? She fucking told me everything

Keith: I.. I didn't...we didn't have sex, we just kissed, I don't know what to say, I'm... I'm sorry. I don't know why she said we had sex?

Me: Don't you fucking lie to me you little fucking piece of shit!

Keith: I promise! It was just a kiss, she said you were breaking up...

Me: Oh she did did she? Well I've got fucking news for you, we ain't, and when you see Tanya at work, you don't fucking talk to her, you don't go to lunch with her, you stay the FUCK away, you got me?

Keith: Tanya? 

Me: Yes, fucking Tanya, you fucking keep clear of her or I'll rip your fucking bollocks off and you'll be wearing then as earrings, you fucking understand me?

Keith: (slight relief in his voice) I wasn't with someone called Tanya...

Me: This is Steve, yeah?

Keith: (almost ecstatic) Haha, no, my name's Keith...

Me: Oh shit! Oh no! I'm sorry mate, I must have got the wrong number! How embarrassing!

Keith: HAHAHA! It's ok, I shit myself then, haha

Me: Sorry fella, that's so rude of me, but ha, you're actually fucking someone else's missus!

Keith: haha, not yet, but I intend to!

Me: Haha, alright, sorry again, and good luck!

Keith: Cheers, and good luck getting that guy!

Me: Don't worry, I will!

The second I put the phone down I knew he'd run through the conversation through in his head, and start to wonder about the coincidence of it all and wonder what the hell just happened. Had he just been played? Was it real? Should he say anything to Karen? Of course he wouldn't, he'd wait to see if she said anything to him first. Because if she didn't, then it must have been a real coincidence, surely.

So that's why I never said a word to her about it until I went home that following weekend.

Got in, showered, even made dinner and waited until our son was in bed.

We're sat on the sofa watching tv.


Me: So I forgot to ask, what time did your mates turn up last weekend? Was it a late one, you have fun?

Karen then goes on a ten minute story about her friends turning up drunk, kebab getting spilled on the carpet and other little bits of her imaginary night.

I let her continue. As I continue watching TV. Then I said

""That's funny, Keith has a completely different perspective of that night."" Still watching telly.

That double take she did will stay with me forever.

""Ummm... What did you say?""

""I said, Keith told me a completely different version of events. Didn't he tell you he spoke to me and told me you kissed?""

""......""

"" He really never told you? Haha, well he did sound like a bit of a dipshit, he probably didn't even realize he was talking to me. Anyway,  I'll be moving out on Sunday you cheating bitch.""

Took a sip off my tea and continued watching TV like nothing had happened.

"As a medical professional, I believe the official term is ‚Äúa very bad, no good thing to do‚Äù"
"If you shoot video, make sure it's shot vertically."
Well the alternative is never ever talking to women so it's not like there's really a choice
"Tbf people on r/relationships always say every relationship needs to break up no matter what happens.

SO doesn‚Äôt wanna work? BREAK UP

SO doesn‚Äôt wanna clean? BREAK UP

SO doesn‚Äôt wanna give you everything you want? BREAK UP

SO doesn‚Äôt wan-  BREAK UP"
"Hey hon, I was talking to some strangers on the internet about how hard it is to find clothes for your ass and..."
"I drive my SO batty, I ask all the time ""how did you do that?"" He thinks I'm being critical but really I am curious and want to learn. Doesnt matter what it is, cooking, car repair, painting..anything. To me it is fun learning from a loved one."
"Women get nervous because of outdated gender norms. The guy is suppose to pursue the girl, and then the girl is suppose to either reject or accept his advances. What these women run into who worry about these norms, is they realize, ""hey, so-and-so is really cute and awesome. I would love to hang out with him sometime, but he hasn't asked me out yet."" So then this woman goes back and forth about whether to wait around for him to ask or to just ask herself. Her fear is that because so-and-so has not asked her out, it therefore means that he is not interested because it is his job to pursue (which, of course, isn't necessarily true)."
"* Hair.  Everywhere.

* Also, that periods can be a real bitch, and to have some fucking empathy when they're feeling less than perky due to it.

* If she's venting, most of the time she doesn't want a solution to the problem right there in that second.  She's just wanting to vent feelings, so listening and (again) empathy is more appreciated."
Tell her it sounds like a personal problem next time for laughs
"A bit of both.  At a certain size, it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôd find her attractive. I don‚Äôt know what that weight or body fat % is but there‚Äôs a cutoff point somewhere. 

But how she carries the weight also makes a difference. Is she round? Does she have curves? How does the weight impact her face, ass, stomach, etc.  I don‚Äôt have specific criteria for each it‚Äôs more of it‚Äôs possible that I find the weight makes a feature unattractive. Or not. "
"&gt; . I'm too honest when they ask for opinion

I don't think anyone has ever thought ""This person is too honest."" It sounds like you may just lack tact."
"Either alot of women answering this one, or a whole lotta gay guys dating bi guys"
I absolutely do. She just did something incredibly hot and we're both turned on and kissing feels good. I can't think of a reason not to.
"I use good dishes and silverware. My husband and I got tons of beautiful dishes and silverware we got from family that belonged to his mother and my grandmother. Stuff that was barely ever used because it was saved for ""special occasions"". Well, I want every day to be a special occasion. I'm not keeping the nice dishes on the counter so my cats will inherit them after I'm gone.

It might be a small thing but it makes such a big difference to me. My one pot grub dinner looks way less depressing if it's in a porcelain plate."
"When it transitioned permanently into a patient/caretaker relationship. It became all about making sure her emotional health was kept on the level and my life and needs were left by the wayside. Sticking with someone through a tough time is important and should be encouraged, but not if it becomes permanent and is severely unhealthy for the other."
"A lot of the theorycrafting around how to interact with women.

Some people make it sound like romance and sex are this thing where you have to walk on an *extremely* thin line and women just judge men for literally everything without bringing anything to the table themselves. 

I agree that it's not nice to be the pursuer most of the time. But honestly, everything past that is also a matter of choice. You can choose to not engage with someone who is dismissive, entitled or just downright an asshole.
