"Marry her.

The officiant will say her name at the wedding. "
"* Everything is politically polarized and no one knows how to sympathize with the other side of the political spectrum.
* All the talk of generations.
* Misogyny and misandry.
* Nobody knows how fucking dating works anymore. 
* Everything you ever do ever is visible for all time on social media.
* How connected everyone always has to be."
This is a Seinfeld episode 
"Man that'd be nice. Would take a lot of guesswork out of the whole ""is she or isn't she interested"" ordeal. I've had openly gay men ask me out before. I always politely decline, because I'm straight, but dammit do I feel flattered. Male or female its feels nice to be desired...  "
"""What does it feel like in there?""

Have you ever been in the bath and had to get out for some reason, say to answer the phone or go pee? When you're temporarily out you're wet and cold, and slipping back into that warm bath is just the most pleasurable, satisfying thing. Imagine that, but concentrated squarely on your genitals."
"Her: “I’ll have a grande mocha blah blah blah.”  

Barista: “Name on the cup?”  

Her: “Anastasia.”  
 
Him: (sighs inwardly with relief, huge smile)  
 
Her: (whispering to him) “I always give a bullshit name just for fun.” 

(CUE LAUGHTRACK) "
"Size is a little relative. Not quite to the extreme of men who are growers, but a woman's size can vary with the time of her cycle and how aroused she is at penetration. I believe the term is ""tenting"". It is why some of the so called tightening creams are just mild numbing agents to prevent full arousal. 


That said, there is a difference in each vagina. Some are tighter, and while kegels help a ton, there are just simple biological differences. Tightness varies in multiple degrees too. Some women are very snug at the opening but less so deeper in, Others are a little more like a cone where they keep narrowing the further you go. 


Of course arousal is a big impact on wetness, but I have found younger women tend to get more wet all else equal. There's never really a point where too much wetness is a bad thing but it can reduce the friction to a point where it is slightly less pleasurable for the male. 


Texture is something you didn't mention but it is important. Some women feel like they were built by Trojan and they are ""ribbed for your pleasure"". Some are silky smooth. Some feel like they could snap off your penis with their pubic bone if they tried hard enough. None of these are bad or even necessarily superior, but they are distinctly different. 


As has been often repeated sex will be more enjoyable with an enthusiastic partner who cares about your pleasure. Some women love to be hammered hard. Some prefer more gentle action and a thump to the cervix means playtime is over. "
What do you guys think of the ban?
See how far you can go before confessing to her that you don’t know what she’s called. Then post her reaction here
Yeah I wish a girl would ask me out justs once
"Tried dating within a week of getting divorced. One of the dates ended up being my current girlfriend, we've been dating for close to 5 years and is she perfect for me in ways i didnt even know i needed. She was patient with me through my resentment toward my ex (i know you aren't supposed to talk about exes right away or much, but oh well), and she was willing to move as slow as i needed. She was responsible for the majority of the healing that took place in my heart, and she helped me find a better place, mentally. Shes beautiful and brilliant and funny, and i plan to propose in the next couple weeks. 

It took me a long time to even be okay with the idea of marriage after what had happened, but with her i feel hopeful and happy about it."
"I was a wrestler for years, so I weighed myself way too much. The post-shit weight was always disappointing. If you really want to see a big difference, you should go with the pre/post piss comparison. "
I had a girl ask me out once. We've been married for 21 years now.
"Go to a bar that IDs everyone, pull out your ID and make a joke about how dumb your photo looks then ask to see hers.

&gt; I suck at learning names and I’ve gotten to the point where if you tell me your name I don’t even try to remember it. 

Theres no excuse for this really, if you're that bad make a note in your smartphone app."

They can't see my bald spot
"Introduce her to a friend of yours, but of course you let her tell your friend her first name. This works best if you trust your friend to be in on the game, and make a big deal learning her name loudly in front of you.

Friend:“Hey OP!”
“Hey, it’s my friend [name]! Hi friend!, come over here!”

Now Alex goes to shake her hand, “Hi, I’m alex what’s your name?”

Easy."
Do you take Amy Hitler to be your lawfully wedded wife?
"It's your type the kind to look at you with disgust? No? Then she wasn't really your type. Move on, you'll be fine."
"I stepped up to my potential. Once I've made peace with my past and realized that the future is a lie, it became much better to focus on *today*.

Forget the wasted time, forget the anxiety to fuck up on the future. What can you do *now* to live up to your highest potential, OP? Take action."
I have to wonder at what point they stop feeling like wives and start feeling like women who live in the same building that I have sex with sometimes.
I just got used to it. 
You can see stuff at concerts while they can't. 
I usually just whine about it on the internet.
"Are you a virgin?  I honestly didn't start to think of myself as a 'sexual being' until I actually had sex for the first time (and then a few more times after that, since the first time was terrible).  It took a woman actively wanting me to have sex with her for it sort of really click with me on a subconscious level that 'holy shit, there are women out there who want me to fuck them'."
"Your dating pool is college kids, so... yeah. I can see why you don't have much in common with them, given your experience.

You need to fish in a different pond. Are there any groups for young vets like yourself? Or for any hobbies that you might have?"
"Rampant narcissism, especially in social media."
You needed a poop knife
Can see down low cut shirts while looking them in the eyes.
"That's a big no no for me. Social media isn't an excuse to air private matters out to the world. 


I think it is fair to have a conversation with her explaining that social media is not to be used to share intimate details, relationship problems, or seek advice on such things. If she wants to talk about relationship issues with someone else, she can pick up the phone and call her best friend. 


If she continues to do so, you won't ever feel safe confiding in her or sharing personal details. That's pretty much terminal to a relationship. "
"Watching them go on their tippy toes to kiss you. 


Being a big blanket when you're the big spoon.


Having a backpack when you're the little spoon."
Different opinion here...my fiancee and i share locations and honestly its pretty nice. We dont creep on each other but it is helpful for meeting up or any “just in case” scenarios. 
Ask her to add you on Facebook 
"PLEASE, let me know when you find the answer to this question."
Too wet is a frustrating problem. When you realise you can't really feel anything and there's a big mess and she's worrying about her new sheets and you keep slipping out and jabbing her in the bellybutton.
"I have close friends, but that doesn't satisfy the need for physical affection, and neither do I expect it to."
"It's 2018, this should be happening by now"
I like staring at my reflection in shop windows.
"i didnt weight myself, but i just want to brag. a week ago i took a 11 inch shit, thats basically a subway footlong. a little thicker than a hotdog. maybe a german sausage thick. i barely felt the last couple of inchs, it was like heaven. i needed to cut it up with a wooden spoon, it cost me 5 dollars to get a new one.

"The drug and alcohol culture in my country. I got sacked because the boss felt I didn’t fit into the “workplace culture”, which is going out and getting drunk together after work three or four nights a week. "
"Maybe you just date passive girls...

Try sticking your dick in crazy, see if you notice a difference."
"Sounds like a nightmare

1, sure. 2, maybe, if they like each other.  
3...That's a lot of fucking work man..."
"Politics is now on a Jerry Springer level of dialogue, and has devolved into a sports team mentality. "
I’d really like to avoid a real r/tifu post
"Took on a freelance web development job without signing anything. The owner of the company bailed randomly owing me $8000 in unpaid work, but I ended up landing a fulltime job with another company from it."
"If I'm ever hit on by a woman who I consider to be way below my standards, I get self-conscious about what it might have been that made the woman think she had a chance."
*Nein Nein Nein*
It's been eleven years. I'll let you know if it happens.
Cuddle with my body pillow at night and suffer through it during the day
I don’t think anybody cares but some probably like/dislike it
Speak for yourself 
Go to a coffee shop maybe? But I could see how that might backfire horribly. 
Self-improvement deletes the previous you.
My mom does this for my dad. He is a truck driver over the road. So it makes sense. She asked me to do it and I told her it’ll be a cold day in hell when that happens lol
"Honestly I think a lot of people have this mentality and rule out people based on first impressions. Yes a lot of people don’t seem as if they’ll be compatible to you, but there are plenty of people with your values going out with friends to meet people like you are doing. You have to start getting to know people in order to really weed the wrong ones out, rather than just on what they’re currently doing "

"I think your girlfriend's life kinda needs to be an open book to her therapist if the therapy is going to be effective. The therapist would have to keep confidentiality, I assume. 

Why do you give a shit what some therapist you've never met thinks of you? "
Beware the powers you summon
"One of my gay friends and I met this way. I was at a bar playing pool with my brother and he bought me a drink. Told him thanks, I'm straight and married and tried to give him the money for the drink. He declined and played pool with us for the rest of the night. Lol. It was hilarious."
"&gt;There is always so much talk about penis size, and yes women do discuss it amongst themselves (bigger doesn't always mean better) but where's the open discussion about vaginas?  
  
I think men talk about vaginas and their girlfriends way less than women think. Especially personal things. Talking about a womans vagina would be breaking trust, and nobody is really interested in hearing those things. The open discussion about vaginas is mostly, in my experience, campaigns with the message that all vulvas are good looking.   
That said, my experience has been: many women are insecure about their vaginas, and that insecurity is most often a bigger issue than whatever perceived issue she think I won't like about her. Wet is good. Women taste differently, some taste better than others. Condoms take away a lot of the feeling. Some women don't mind hitting their cervix a little, but many do. I haven't been with someone that didn't feel good inside, but the feeling varies."
But with slightly less bubbles. 
Ugh this makes me feel so single right now lol 
"It doesn’t really sound like you have a problem with accepting yourself, but rather you’re thinking being extroverted is more preferable to who you are, and that’s not necessarily true. 

You’re possibly noticing more extroverted people and it’s skewing your opinion. There’s plenty of introverts, you just won’t “see” them as much, but that doesn’t mean they’re not there.

Also you may not notice introverts when you meet them. I am introverted. I have friends, constantly partied, and had plenty of casual sex. But then I would rush home to unwind and be alone. You don’t have to cut yourself out of society because you’re introverted.

I’m of the opinion though that society in general is moving more and more towards introversion, as communication separates us now more than ever, constantly behind screens etc. "
"Sometimes when I am really really down, I watch that 3 minute end of the one Simpsons episode where Homer went back to his hated job as Marge qas pregnant with Maggie, and he was punished with the demotivational plaque (Don't forget, you're here forever) and he later used Maggies pictures to cover it in a way that it reads Do it for her. And cry for 10 minutes. Then the world is a better place. "
"Yes. I bet most nervous or shy guys are like this. I am super shy, and pretty much my whole romantic life I have always secretly wanted a girl to ask me out. I am living my life right now however it is going, so I’ve not actively looking for love. But damn if you see someone asking another person out it’s 99% of the time guys. I would be so fucking flattered if a girl asked me out. "
"As a lady who has accidentally done this to guys before, unless you actively puked on her it's very likely she wasn't actually disgusted by you. A bad mood and an expressive face is usually to blame. 

"
Or Alex just stands there waiting for you to introduce her name :)
"Some people told me not to go to the week long training for a job that only offered part time work.  To go to the training I also had to bail on a trip to visit some friends across the country.  My friends were mad but three years later and I’m in a supervisor position, have a ton of great mentors and I have probably found the profession that is my true calling."
I click exit and go worship my lord and savior Jesus Christ until my impure thoughts go away.
"Chew, then spit the skittles out.

Back in highschool, I knew a guy who came in .5 oz over...

Went to the bathroom for 5 mins, jerked it, and came back to weigh in just under the cut off line.

"* Leave some beer in the fridge ahead of time so it's cold by the time I'm home. Optional, but desireable: Also leave a silly note, with a little tiny heart;
* Cook me dinner;
* Ask me to join her in a bubble bath (with candles!);
* Plan a picknick;
* Send me a card at work;
* Plan a camping trip, so we can sit by a campfire, watch the stars and drink cheap wine;
* Hug me from behind and tell me I'm handsome;
* Slap my butt on occasion and tell me I'm hot.

EDIT: A girl I used to go out with once drew a heart with her fingers in the mirror in my bathroom. A few hours after she left, I went to take a shower and the steam from the hot water made the heart appear (I had no idea it was there). It was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done to me. I felt like I should add this here."
"Be sad about it, jack off, continue the search for gf"
"Quitting both of my jobs to live in a car and street perform. Worked part-time at an after school program and full-time at a group home for adults with intellectual disabilities and anger issues. Super rewarding work.

I had been doing both, 60 hrs/wk, for several months and things were going well.

But, too well.

I started to plan my life around when I would get promoted at each job and found myself imagining a life four years in the future that looked nothing like what I said I wanted.

So one night at the group home, we're watching TV and we stop on MTV or something. There's a music video for an EDM act and, as I know you've seen, the crowds can be huge. I've been writing stories and making music for as long as I can remember, even went to school for English, but here I was ignoring my dreams and playing it safe.

Like a lil bitch.

So, I quit both jobs, started sleeping in my car, and street performed constantly for about nine months to get better.

Four years later, I've published two books, and I'm working on my debut album.

Maybe don't quit your job.

But if you find yourself planning out an entire future that isn't what you wanna do, even when it's rewarding, don't be afraid to jump.

I make art all day."
"&gt; Everything is politically polarized and no one knows how to sympathize with the other side of the political spectrum.

This is my biggest issue with America right now. I hate that everyone I talk to just keeps parroting the same talking points and views it as ""us vs them"". It's like people forget there are shades of gray in there!"
Her next post will be about her being single I guess
"“It doesn’t matter how much I do for you, *never* feel like you owe me anything. I do it because I believe in you, and the only way you can pay me back is by believing in yourself.”

Really changed by whole outlook on life, relationships and goals."
Connections will matter until the day you die. 
"Actually, what you're doing sounds pretty great. Especially with what he's doing, he's equally supportive and responsive to you so I'd say he's happy with things."
"I wouldn't exactly advise someone in high school to creampie his girlfriend when she's been saying her new birth control has been screwy lately... It wasn't a wise decision.

But at least we made it work. I don't regret anything."
You can put them on your shoulders  during sex and start doing squats so that you don't lose your leg gains. 
"Another woman chiming in. It depends why she's asking for this. Is she a person who worries about your safety a lot? I wouldn't mind if my husband asked for this, as long as it's not a control or trust thing. My husband just got a motorcycle, which scares me honestly, so knowing he arrived at his destination would be a comfort if I needed it. That's a situation that I think it would be okay to want the location sharing. There are reasonable purposes to ask for this, and unreasonable. "
Can use them as mobile bistro tables. Put a plate of spaghetti on their head and have your lunch wherever you please.
He's from Chernobyl and has his dick growing out the back of his neck.
"When my now husband and I were LDR, we would travel 3 hours every weekend to see each other, leaving around 3 am on Monday morning to make it to work on time. We ended up turning it on with each other for the “dead in the ditch” scenario. Really helped when my car broke down en route and he could come right to me to fix it too. 

It has its uses, but we also had no trust issues nor did we use it to check up on each other. "
"Having a pet helps. 

That and alcohol and masturbation. "
We can solve that problem together like real men
"Hard agree. There's probably other ways to gain that knowledge, but being told to your face by someone that they want you, especially more than once, generates so much self esteem."
"Healthcare in the US. I pay a monthly premium, for a family plan so around 1000. I go see a doctor and just to go into the office is 25. I get prescribed meds thats another 10. Then a month later I get a bill and it's around 500 depending what you had done. 

This insurance stuff is bullshit, but if you have a family you need it. If it were just me I wouldn't have it.

This country has got to figure that shit out and the problem is companies are greedy, including hospitals/clinics, and have politicians in their back pockets."
Hell no. Mo wives mo drama.
"Do NOT go cold turkey on your meds, no matter what they’re for.

In my case, I straight up forgot to take my Zoloft for 3 weeks. It was Christmas, it was busy and a happy time, and I was already starting to come down on them. 

By the next time I saw my therapist we figured out I hadn’t taken them for so long that getting back on my 75mg dose might have more negative impacts than just stopping. So I stopped taking them all together.

It’s coming up on 3 years and I’m fine. I’m just starting to realize I can be sad again without being scared it’s the start of my depression again. I’ve never been more happy to be miserable.

All you folks out there suffering like I did, it does get better. But you have to want to get better, you can’t win without fighting. Keep it up, I believe in you."
Your story is already r/tifu material. The only question is how far you wanna take it.
"I'm taller than almost all girls I met. As for perks, according ro r/niceguy. Being 6'3"" makes me chad by default."
When I was in my car outside the bank waiting to go in to use the atm this lady knocked on my window saying she had to deposit her money but the inside of the bank was closed so she had to go to the drive through but had no car and asked if I could drive her. I didn’t even think about how this could go wrong so I just said yes she did her thing and instead of kidnapping me she gave me $10. 
Literally hand her your phone with app open and have her type it in 
"How superiors perceive you is so much more important than you think it is. It doesn't matter if Bill's  numbers are better every month ; if the boss likes you more, you'll be getting that promotion. Suck it, Bill. "
Nepotism and bullshit are much more persuasive than talent. 
"Only ever dated the girls who asked me out. All the ones I asked rejected me.

It's pretty great being asked out. And I never said no."
Saliva=weight. So skittles would activate salivary glands and the wrestler would spit the offending saliva out therefore “losing “ weight. Usually done right before weigh in before a match.   
"That’s awful

It’s also relatable"
"""Girl I'm smashing but don't know her name, make a mental note, I should ask her name before it gets too awkward, too late what should I do I know I'll make an Askmen post and hope they come up with an ploy that'll get me to learn her name without her finding out"" 

or something like that"
This makes me wish I had a dick so I could experience this feeling... Actually it kinda works for us ladies in the reverse. If he pulls out its a cold and empty feeling but when he goes back it... Warm full and heavenly. 
"""Forget the wasted time, forget the anxiety to fuck up on the future. What can you do now to live up to your highest potential, OP? Take action.""

"Social media has wrecked the world. The 90s and 00s were largely peaceful.

I can’t even look at my Facebook feed right now because some right wing motherfucker and some left wing imbecile are always on a rant about some fucking thing all the fucking time.

My life is still fucking good... I drove through Duchess yesterday late night and had a large hamburger with large fries. And then had kefta kabob for lunch and dinner. And my daughter and wife are also happy."
"I made peace with my past and look to the future, I don't know how old you are but I'm nearly 30. Still heaps of time to make good on that potential, you just gotta keep going.

Give her your phone and ask her to add herself as a friend on your facebook account
"When I met the most recent girl that I dated it was on Tinder and she literally asked ""would it be too forward to ask if you wanted text""?  She couldn't just ask for my number, she had to ask if I thought it was too forward to ask for my number.  It's 2018, in my mind ""being forward"" is, or at least should be, a thing of the past."
"She showed your texts? Did you know she also talks about you and what you do, how you behave, what you talk about, what you tell her, what you're like, how romantic you are (and not), what your parents and friends are like, and a million other things... That's what therapists do. But it's the texts that have you offended?"

Social Media was a mistake
When my girlfriend kisses me she has to get on her tippy toes.
"Here too! My fiancée share ours. It’s not so we can creep on each other (we have no reason to and nothing to hide from each other), it’s really just for convenience to save ourselves from making the “where are you, when will you be home” calls when one of us gets home before the other. But we’ve also been together for 3 years and live together. There’s a big difference in 3 years and living together and 8 months together. "
"How rude everyone is. 

So many people lack courtesy or the act of being courteous. Can't tell you how many  ""friends"" I try to hang with and their late and have no apologies for it. Or they aren't really listening to you. Or they're usually worried about the next thing they have to get to. "
"Find a niche thing you like to obsess over.  Hopefully that thing takes lots of time.

I have a step ladder. I never knew my real ladder.
"Or, if she manages to avoid the ID trick, walk away from the table to get drinks and have a friend walk up, saying he saw her with you, and wanted to introduce himself. Have that guy “forget” her name, she tells it to him, and when you walk back to the table with drinks all he has to say is “hey bud, just met xxxx, awesome bumping into you guys here.”"
"Well, it doesn't happen over night for sure. But you've got to brake from the cycle of thinking you're not desired, etc. 

For instance, I remember being in situations where I was thinking to myself: ""bro, I'm like a bum. No girl would get near to me if I'm like this"" and some days or months after that, I would find myself making out with a girl. In my case I just have more confidence in myself and just go with the flow. 

Of course, if I see myself looking cringy, stupid or funny, I will most certanly stop acting like that, but whatever man. We can't be scared all of our lives you know?"

Dating is just exhausting to me as a mid-20s guy. Every girl seems to think they’re super unique on dating sites or that I have to work extra hard to just be worthy of their time.
I don't care how neglected she bleats about being; if she's not single she's not for you.

"I had sex with a girl who used testosterone/steroids once and I’m not sure if it was her, or the steroids that caused her to be like this - but her vaginal walls were strong as fuck and it made sex impossible.

It was insane and not very fun. I feel like i can’t even exaggerate how strong her vagina was "

"I will skip leg day up to 3 times in a row before skipping a push/pull day.

"Start with a physical change. Get a good haircut. Put some time into grooming yourself. Shave or trim your beard if you’ve got one. Buy some good cologne for when you go out. Start a work out routine and stick to it even when you don’t want to. Doesn’t have to be anything crazy, it could just be sit ups and push ups. The important part is sticking to it. Try to improve your diet as well, learn to make a few healthy dishes and cut down on processed/junk foods. Look yourself in the mirror, but don’t look for flaws. Try and focus on improvements to yourself (does your skin look better, is your hair looking good, have you lost weight or gained muscle.) 

After you’ve built a little confidence, go out and do an activity you like or a bar or some event and try to talk to people. Doesn’t have to be all women, and you should avoid the mentality of exclusively trying to get laid or get a date. Don’t put the possibility out of your mind, just don’t make it your primary goal. If you click with someone you’re attracted to, put yourself out there. Buy her a drink. Get her number. Ask her on a date. You may get rejected. Actually you almost certainly will. It’s okay. It sucks, but it happens to everyone, and the most important thing is to avoid beating yourself up about it and giving up. 

When you get to a point where things are getting intimate, don’t let fear prevent you from making a move. Keep your mindset out of “I can’t imagine her wanting me. Im not sexual.” Focus on her more. Don’t stare at her intently or anything, just pay attention to her. Listen to what she says, pay attention to her body language. Is she laughing at your jokes? Had she touched you in any way? Does she smile at you? Is she leaning into conversation? Hopefully there will be a moment when you are just holding each other’s gaze, and in that moment kiss her. Hold her hand. Hell you could straight up ask to kiss her if you wanted to. Some women don’t like that but some do. You may be a little clunky or awkward at first, but approach the first move with confidence, no matter what you do. Commit, and don’t back out halfway into a kiss. You don’t have to be Mr. Suave Sexy Man to get a woman, a lot of them find a little shyness or awkwardness cute. With a little luck, it’ll be the start to a great night and/or relationship. 

But Again, it may not work out. She might pull away or say she doesn’t want that. It hurts, but don’t let it make you angry or too sad. Respect her. There will be other opportunities, and remember that women aren’t perfect. You could’ve done everything right but she wasn’t in the place to have that sort of relationship. You also may have misread signals, and she may have given some unintended ones. Learn from your mistakes and apply it to the next attempt. After enough trial and error, you will find yourself with a woman who wants you. The most important thing is to not force it. Remember that you’re there to get to know this person and have some fun, not just to have sex. Sexuality is always most enjoyable when it flows naturally, and when you and the other person have chemistry. 

Good luck, groom yourself to maximum sexiness, and put yourself out there. "

"You know that shooting that happened at a Madden 19 tournament yesterday? I'm nowhere near Jacksonville and that just... really bothered me. These were gamers like me, coming together to have fun and play a game together. To escape all the horrific shit in the world that we have no control over and don't want to be apart of. But evil came ramming it's ugly head in again. I couldn't stop thinking about that kid who screamed out on stream ""oh fuck what'd he shoot me with?"" last night. That was a normal person completely unable to grasp what was happening to them, just in such complete disbelief that he shrieked out a question, hoping to understand what was going on. Someone who never thought they'd ever be shot, just minutes ago. A real person, like any of us, who enjoyed a video game enough to travel to play with others, and he was shot and killed.

And then you go online to learn more info and everything gets drowned out in political arguments, most not having to do with the event at all. Everyone's searching for blame that we should know by now won't make us feel any better, won't bring anyone back, and definitely won't get us anywhere. Solutions aren't met with counter solutions, they're met with hate and dismissal. Nobody thinking about those who were killed or shot, only thinking about how this might effect THEM. Nothing will be done and the cycle repeats. Humanity can be fucking disgusting."

"Don’t take it personally. Maybe she was having a bad day. Of course, in my experience with Reddit, if she doesn’t brightly exclaim her desire to suck your dick that’s a disgusted look."
"It can be confusing to hear that penis size isn't important, and then so many women using ""small penis"" as an insult. If I don't make my partner orgasm I'm selfish, but if I care about her orgasm I'm putting pressure on her to orgasm. Looking for sex is seen as desperate or objectifying, but ""virgin"" and not having a girlfriend are insults at men. There's just no good way to be. 
And then hearing that, yes, many women talk about details regarding sex they have even when asked not to. What gets be bummed out is that it's culturally accepted to joke about mens bodies, and there's no way to bring that up because then that's an example of male ego fragility or something. But if I don't bring it up then I'm bottling up my emotions and that's frowned upon too for being toxic. I'm probably mansplaining this right now. Either way I'm doing something wrong. It's easy to internalize all this into self-flagellation. Global warming? Mens fault. Women feeling forced to wear make up, yup, that's my fault. Pandas refusing to breed in some chinese zoo, that's probably my fault too. And all I can do is smile, because being sad is unattractive. "

"I’m the same. I get very wet very easily and have never been with a man who hasn’t commented. Usually it’s when they touch me first with their hand after making out and they say something along the lines of, “holy shit you’re so wet!” enthusiastically, to which I reply, “mmm you turn me on a lot.” Of course I know this is bullshit and I’m just a moist lady but every guy I’ve been with has found this a huge turn on and ego boost. 

I always wondered if it made sex less enjoyable because of how slippy slidey it becomes, but if I get on all fours (doggy) the angle “dries” me out enough (gravity) for some friction to return, so I decided I bring enough variety to still offer a pleasurable experience overall. Something for everyone... a real crowd pleaser.... haha I kid. 

Stroking a guy’s ego during sex really does make it a much more fun experience most of the time though, regardless the design of my vagina. I like to make people feel good about themselves, it often has rewards. "
"&gt;I’ve got mad back issues so I have to re adjust a lot, and I need to be a certain temperature to sleep. A lot of dumb stuff, I know.

For fucks sake, man...can we seriously stop labeling our needs and discomfort as ""dumb stuff""? Being male doesn't mean you don't get to expect comfort or to have your needs considered.

&gt;So there are a couple of positions she’s been trying and they’re all just the fucking worst for me. 

So tell her that your injuries and sleep needs mean those positions don't work for you. 

It's great that you want to accommodate your new girlfriend. But don't forget that your needs are just as important as hers *overall*. And each of us should prioritize our needs over anyone elses.

In a whole-world sense, your needs and hers are equally important.
In an individual sense, your needs should be most important to you. Hers should be most important to her.

Cuddling you in the way she most enjoys is not a *need*. It's a *want*. Being able to sleep comfortably and not aggravate your back injury is a *need*.

So...not only are you willing to put her needs over yours, but you're putting her wants over your needs.


You're bad at self-advocacy. Or at least you  come off that way in this post.

&gt;what can I do to make her happy but also be comfortable myself? Is there a secret?

1. You get into a comfortable position

2. She gets into a comfortable position involving you that doesn't require that you move much, if at all

3. Fall asleep

4. If you get uncomfortable, you reposition yourself. If she gets uncomfortable, she reposition herself.

Neither of you should be sacrificing your happiness for the other's. Work together to both be happy and have both of your needs met."

What actually happens though is either a girl turns me down multiple times then suddenly asks me out when things finally suit her or a girl very obviously not trying to make it obvious invites me to go to the movies or something ""as friends"".  Fantasies are just that afterall."

Don't say we can be friends unless I mean it, and make sure there's a gap before any kind of friendship is attempted.

Keep the door closed. Don't leave any room for hope for a future relationship.

Depending on how long we dated for, you get one or two ""I still need to talk about some things"" sessions... but after a while that has to get shut down.   

After the breakup, don't tell other people details about our relationship, especially not things that the person I'm dumping maybe didn't know. People love gossiping about that shit.

I will say though that a lot of girls will flock to your interests if they see that you’re passionate about what you do. I have very manly hobbies but girls will embrace them on the fact of my dedication/passion. 

Girls who have these weird expectations like “make x money, be this tall, etc.” are not worth your time 99% of them offer very little in return hence why they’re after you to provide something for them. 

It’s not easy to stick to but give it time and let life happen, the right person will come along eventually. Do you, focus on you, embrace your hobbies and be around quality people. The best things in life find YOU.

His face turned red and his eyes swelled. Then he just calmly got up, slowly, walked out the door with no shoes (we ran after him) and stopped him short of walking into oncoming traffic.

He just kind of exploded after that, right next to the freeway. Crying, screaming, tearing at his hair.

In separate countries. Before Skype.

We couldn't wait, so after about 6 months of that, we decided to just get married. So she flew back, we got married, and we applied to have me join her.

Then I gave up everything I owned except two duffel bags and a backpack, and hitched a ride on a cargo plane.

It was then, and only then, that we both realized that we were thousands of miles from home, married to what might as well be a *complete stranger*. We knew nearly nothing about each other.

Our 14th anniversary is coming up soon.

"Staying for almost 2 years in a relationship I knew wasn't right.  That she would and was cheating on me.  We were in love, I knew she loved me and I was the best guy she'd ever been with (coming from her mother who fucking adored me in every way).

But it was nice to have someone.  She treated me great every day.  I just knew she was a liar and I didn't ever trust her.  Snooping her phone to confirm any suspicions I had etc.  It was toxic, wrong of me etc.  But I was surprisingly happy as well.  Because when it was good for months at a time it was great.

Fucking hell I was such an idiot.  Even saw myself marrying this girl.

Then I had proof she cheated...and it was over 2 months later.  And we had just over a month left of living together before our rental contract ended, so we stayed in the same place, separate rooms.  That was the hardest 3 months of my life, bar none.

I was a moron.  I admit it.  Classic fool in puppy love.

BUT.

BUT.

As a result of my stupidity and the heartache and the pain, I am in a place I never thought I would be right now.  My confidence is INSANE.  I have almost zero fear with women now, and I find myself doing things and saying things I never thought I would, and it's getting me some attention that I never had before.

Dated a girl for a few months, it was fun, she was adorable, and ALL OVER ME like I had never had before (like...throwing me against the door the second we'd get to my room on the weekends and being so sexually aggressive that drove me wild), but I felt no spark so ended it.  I just GENUINELY DIDN'T CARE what happened with us, and it drove her crazy sexually.

That wouldn't have been me 2 years earlier.  I would have ignored the lack of spark and stayed together.

Sometimes you have to destroy yourself to rise again stronger than you ever thought you could be, and I highly recommend heartbreak to everyone.  You learn SO MUCH about yourself and benefit from it moving forward."

"I remember reading a good answer in a similar askreddit thread. The user has deleted his acct but his comment stated up: 

""They all feel different. The fit (does it suction? does it grip? does it feel like you're forcing it in? does it feel like there aren't any sides?), the angle of entry (some women's vaginal canal is higher on the front of the pelvis, while others are further back toward the anus; this can dramatically effect whether a sexual position feels good too), the texture (slick/slippery, velvety, almost rubbery), the temperature (some feel like they're burning up with fever when turned on, others have trouble staying warm especially in the air of a cold room; just like your hands or feet, circulation is a concern), whether the opening squeezes or hangs loose, whether the flesh throbs from blood pressure, whether the muscles try to force you out especially during orgasm, etc. Then there is just overall size--size is sometimes but not always relative, for both genders. Getting the right fit is difficult at times.
But as with all such things, these characteristics can't exactly be rated. It's highly dependent on what sensation the man likes; some like squeezing, others yielding; plus what they're comfortable with.""

The sobering truth is you go out, you have fun, and you become a friendly ear to everyone and crack a few jokes. It may not be your forte, but you suck it up and put on the clown mask for a few hours because it is important.

After a while it doesn't become forced and you may even make a few friends. You can either do it, or write a post on askreddit about how you hate the fact it is this way. Better to accept it and grind your way to office glue guy."

I’m 6’2 and I’ve been good friends with a girl that is 4’6 for a long time and every time we go anywhere I always make sure to open the door for her and hold it open with my arm straight across so that she can walk under it with ease. It doesn’t sound like a huge deal but for the last 10 years every time we go somewhere we do this and it never fails to make some random smile. We always get a little laugh about it anyway.

"As someone mentioned, you might just be dating really passive girls.

That being said, part of it is probably cultural.  A lot of women are raised on the idea that showing lots of interest in sex is slutty or shameful, or that men are supposed to be the ones who initiate sex.

In my experience, most women I've been with definitely regarded sex as something I was supposed to initiate, and they had to become very comfortable and/or trusting with me before they would feel ok with just grabbing my dick, or telling me that they wanted me to fuck them."
"Yes. It's not uncommon.

I find that enthusiasm either makes, or breaks sex and, sadly, most women lack that. Maybe it's because they're more ""sexually oppressed"", maybe they're insecure - that's a whole debate to be had. The question is that, yes, *a lot* of women lack that enthusiasm about sex.

I've only had the pleasure of experiencing that raw, primal, animalistic and incredibly passionate and intense sex with a few women in my life, but my God, it was amazing.

If you're looking for a solution, I'm not sure I have any that doesn't involve reforming society, but as u/PolloMagnifico suggested, perhaps it has something to do with the more passive personalities. Best sexual experiences I've ever had have been with women that were... Different."

"Hi, 31 y/o extrovert of the highest order here. I assure you that all of the constant partying, huge social groups and casual sex hasn't been a thing since 2009 for me. All that stuff is an illusion of people's real lives brought to you by instagram, sitcoms and conformation bias. In the real world, after education, people get jobs - not careers, mostly just jobs. When they are not working those jobs, they are running their domestic responsibilities, worrying about money or resting because they are drained. I would love to party like I did ten years ago when I had zero responsibilities, but I don't. The people I do know who party a lot have lives that are an utter shambles when they are sober and no future to speak of, it looks like no fun at all to me. Despite this, I am the person that wrangles the small friend group that I can maintain, getting everyone together in the same restaurant or movie theatre is impossible, I might get half the group on a good day, maybe once every two months. I run a small business but work a fair amount of time in a shared office as well as my home office because people energise me (because I'm highly extroverted,) and although I enjoy talking to them and such, many have families to go back to and errands to run so spending time as a group outside work hours is hard even though we all get on famously. If the world really was as you believe it to be, then we would have no need for OKC or Tinder. The reason those apps exist is because *no one meets anyone new* any more, because we don't socialise organically as much any more.

So yes, we extroverts thrive on company and socialising, but you introverts are the real winners in the way modern life really operates. What you need to work on accepting is not that you're introverted and missing out, it's that you have an elaborate fantasy of how post adolescent extroverts live which you are comparing your own life to, and comparison is the thief of joy."
"Hold up. This isn't right. You don't have to leave your partner, y'all need to make a compromise. It is true it doesn't make him a bad person, but if you want to make the relationship work, then y'all need to sit down and discuss a solution that works for both of you. There us no such thing as a perfect relationship, but there is such thing as working to maintain a happy one, and that means discussing the issues and making a compromise."

"&gt; What makes sex more or less enjoyable? What does it feel like in there?

Imma differ from a lot of commenters and say that tightness *isn't* more pleasurable and the end-all and be-all in vaginas.  I vastly prefer tented, loose, wet and silky over crushing tightness, because I have a sensitive penis between my legs and not an iron locomotive piston. Tightness just means more friction, and friction drowns out all the softness, wetness, warmth and so on that makes a vagina feels so crazy good.

It's also worth noting that one and the same vagina can feel pretty different in many respects depending on position, period cycle and for how long penetration has been going on."

"I'm a therapist and I'm sitting here thinking about the tons of people who have shown me their SO's texts. It's so common. 

Here's one thing that can be said about showing a therapist the texts. We hear all sorts of stories in therapy. Maybe they're accurate, maybe they're not. (It's sort of not the point anyway.) But if someone is really distressed about some text exchange that went on, and they're known for having an inaccurate perception of stuff like that, having another perspective can be helpful. For example, people with social anxiety sometimes read too much into text exchanges. 

It can be really helpful to have a third party say, ""Hey, I totally get what you're feeling, but I think your perception is off here.""

They impact how you see the world, but therapy is supposed to help a person take off their metaphorical drunk goggles.

"I hate the way feminism and the goal of equality is moving along. Women fight to get rid of men in power and bring women in power instead, examples are ""the future is female"" and #killallmen. Men are supposed to stay out of debates like #metoo. But in reality, this only creates more diversion between sexes and will only make the fight worse. Instead, we should start to work on equality already!
It's the same with minorities like LGBTQ, everybody identifies _only_ with their group, and these groups become smaller and smaller, instead of getting rid of groups and try to realize that we only need one, namely humans. This way we create ever more hate."

"Hey OP,

I'm currently a man who enjoys sex once or twice a week with a woman who wants it twice a day, and we've been together for 8 years so I feel this is right up my alley.

First and foremost you need to sit down and decide he's worth it. My girlfriend has told me tthat while she wishes my libido was higher, shes really happy with how supportive I am of her in other areas. As she put it, I'm a B- in sex drive but A+ in everything else. So to her, it was more than worth it to try and settle our differences in sex drive. You need to decide if you're in a similar boat. 

His sex drive realistically wont magically increase and neither will yours magically decrease. At best, this will always be a minor inconvenience in your relationship - you need to decide if he's worth the hassle. 

Now that is out of the way, here is some things that we've done over the years  that might help you two out in no particular order.

1.) He might want to see a doctor to get his testosterone levels tested. It's a long shot but it isn't too uncommon for young men to have messed up levels which would affect his sex drive. He might re act badly to this though, heads up.

2.) Try to schedule your sexy time, as in, every Wednesday and Sunday etc. Theres a ton of info out there why this helps but basically it will help to reduce his anxiety knowing he doesn't have to worry about pleasing you every night, while helping to calm your libido knowing that no matter what, your getting laid on x and y days. Plus the anticipation leading to the deed is amazing in itself.

3.) He should try to masturbate and watch porn less for obvious reasons.

4.) You might want to look into going to a sex shop and buying yourself some toys. Bonus points if he comes with. My girl hated masturbating when we first started to get serious but after getting some toys she likes it's a lot more enjoyable and satisfying for her.

5.) Try to open up and find out what his kinks are. I love me some dirty talk and once I told my girl this, she tried to incorporate it more and started to send me some dirty messages while I was out or at work, getting me more fired up for it when I got home.

Most important of all is to communicate from a calm place. No good will come from trying to work this out in the middle of a fight. Find out what type of foreplay he likes, when are the bad times to try and engage sex, etc. As another commentor pointed out it's going to mostly you to learn and adjust to this but it's not impossible. Best of wishes "
"How nuclear everything is. Apps like tinder and OKC should have no market at all, we should move around in our communities enough to make new friends and romances organically - I mean for christ's sake why my friends who are Londoners need apps at all is fucking beyond me. They're *surrounded* by opportunity, all the time, yet they still manage to make no new social connections in their daily routine and are lonely and often isolated. That's broken. It's absolutely broken.

EDIT: This isn't a criticism of the apps as such, just the lifestyle (a product of the modern working and domestic environment) that the apps are created suit. A lot of people don't have enough free time, emotional or mental energy or money to create the kind of social life that the way the live makes it hard to cultivate. For these people, the apps are their own recourse, which is completely fair enough. It's just a great shame that they even need them in the first place, in my personal opinion. "

"Up through high school, I was one of the smart ones. Like it was expected that I would go to college and breeze through it to become a doctor, lawyer, engineer, etc.

Except when I went to college, I was stressed out of my mind, because tuition was spiking due to the recession, I was broke, I wasn't adjusting well, and on top of it all, I didn't manage my depression correctly. If you look at my college experience, I was basically a giant downward spiral until I was kicked out. Hell, if I hadn't of flunked out, I would have had to drop out because tuition had gone up 50% between my first year and the start of my fourth year.

You should have seen the look on my parents' faces when I told them I wasn't going to be going to school for the year. You should have heard the disappointment in every single person's voice when they told me that I ""would never be successful without a college degree."" There was the heartbreak on my girlfriend's face when she realized that her dream of me working at Microsoft while she worked as a teacher would be delayed at best. The glances I received from ex-classmates when they saw me in our college town. None of it was great.

And then my oldest sister called me. She told me that my college town had nothing to offer me. I was about to lose my job (true). My relationship was shit (true). All of my friends were going to leave soon (true). She told me I should move in with her and her husband in Portland. I could look for a job while living with them.

So I did. And I took a job in a shitty help desk for a bank. The pay was better than expected, but not great. It was full time and offered benefits, so it couldn't be too awful? Except the job was terrible. Thankfully, it gave me stability. And I felt pride when I was recognized for killing it.

After 9 months, I learned about an internal training program where we would be trained to be mainframe developers and hired onto a team. Was I interested in mainframes? Fuck no. But it was a chance to land a great career, so I went for it. And I got the job. It's been a lot of hard work, but I'm feeling like I made it. It's been 5 years since I was hired at the bank, and I'm making about $81K with my bonus. I'm on a great team working on interesting stuff. I have upward momentum and a clear path for my future.

Will I ever make big dick tech company money? Lolno.  
Am I happy with where I ended up? Absolutely.

I guess the trick was to never be happy with the shitty hand I was dealt. It forced me to push myself to be better. I knew I could be better. I knew if I wanted to have a family with a better life than I had, I would need to be able to provide. So I worked for it. And after getting pretty fucking lucky, I'm in a good spot.

You should see the look on my parents' faces when they hear about how I'm doing. You should see the surprise when I tell people about my successes without a college degree. You should see how much I've changed since I was the depressed and anxiety-ridden early-twenty-something. "

"&gt; I’m of the opinion though that society in general is moving more and more towards introversion, as communication separates us now more than ever, constantly behind screens etc.

This is absolutely the case. I go to great lengths as an extrovert to do as much socialising as possible to stop me falling into depression (which happens with too much isolation,) but people are so rarely free when I am. The introverts really will inherit the 21st century."
"All women are unique, of course. Just like penis size is not the only factor for women, but also shape, proportions, veininess, hardness, etc.

Some produce a lot of lubrication even if they’re only a little turned on, some produce just a little even if they’re a lot turned on. Amount of lubrication is *one of* the factors that determine how much I can feel. With more lubrication, I tend to feel less, but that also varies on other factors. 

Tightness is also a factor - really, it’s snugness. Out of 45 or so, I’ve only encountered one that I would say was actually a *tight* fit, and it was uncomfortable. Some are snug - you can feel every part of your dick being touched inside, and rubbed with the motion. With a little less lubrication, this feels like a “pussy job” - a hand job or a blow job, except with her pussy. My SO is like this, for me. She’s also very experienced, and has had *much* bigger dicks than mine, so the whole “loose = used to big dicks” thing is bullshit.  Some women for me have felt like I was sticking my dick in a bucket - beyond the entrance, I couldn’t really feel much of anything - again, this is partly due to lubrication and partly due to shape and snugness. I can feel my SO touching all of my dick no matter how wet she is. She has the *best* vagina in the whole world. 

Depth is also a factor - some women, I’ve topped out in, and I’m about 6.5”. That doesn’t so much physically feel good for me, as it is exciting for the ego stroke or the surprise. Some women really like having it reached, and it brings a whole different kind of orgasm, apparently, but just having a long enough dick isn’t enough, it has to be touched and stroked the right way. Women who know about this one really well tend to really like being on top for this reason.

Then there is individual shape - most men love having a woman get off on their dick, but that’s just as much a factor of their anatomy as it is ours. Some women have a deeper “shelf” where the G spot is - it’s located further in, so if your dick has an upward curve, missionary can be really satisfying for her if your dick strokes that spot. Similarly if your dick curves downward for doggy. There’s also the back of the vagina wall, so if she’s on her back and I push downward with my fingers - I have found this spot to be actually more responsive on some women than the g spot. My SO squirts hard when I rub here while licking her clit, and I’d love to try a MFM with a girthier dude so I can lick her clit while she’s getting fucked by a thick dick. Then there is the sides, near the entrance - the part that really likes girth - there is an internal part of the clit that extends down to here, you can feel it inside, like a tendon, and it responds a lot to being stroked and having pressure applied. Women vary in how sensitive they are in all three of these areas, as well as in how accessible these spots are to a given dick in a given position. 

Finally, there’s everything on the outside. Some women have very tiny, nearly undetectable clits. Some women have longer clits. The longer ones can stroke your dick during penetration, which surely gets them off, especially if you’re girthy for them - girth stretches things so the clit extends further down towards the dick. Women with small clits tend to need a good pubic bone on pubic bone grind. I’ve been in pubic bone pain for days afterward with one former partner in particular whose clit was very tiny. Some clits get hard, some don’t. The women whose clits tend to get nice and firm tend to be more orgasmic. Then there’s the inner labia - with some women you can actually feel these stroking your groin area while she’s on top, which again isn’t so much a sensation thing for me, but more of an exciting idea when it happens. 

My dick curves upwards, and is slightly above average girthwise. My SO loves two things in particular: one is during missionary, she bends her pelvis downward, so she can stroke her clit along my shaft and the end of my dick hits her rear vagina wall. That puts pressure on my dick from her pubic bone, and it’s like a heavenly “pussy job” with death grip. We both get off quickly and intensely when she does that. She also loves doggy - we do this with her legs together, like child pose in yoga, as well as her legs apart. They’re both different for me; the child pose version I find a bit tighter, and it also feels like I’m pumping her full of dick. She sometimes takes control in doggy and I stay still; this also tends to get both of us off quickly - it does feel physically different for me, but I can’t describe how. I know part of it for me is the idea that she’s either giving me a gift, or the idea that she’s just really turned on by my dick that she’s taking what she wants - but there’s a difference in physical sensation. She also likes just getting railed hard and comes quickly that way too.

"A few more criteria:

The angle and positioning: some vags feel very ""low"", with the clit downwards. Some are ""higher"" with the clit straight. That can impact how a guy and a girl feel during specific positions like cow girl (""low"" vaginas make it difficult to grind)

Aside from texture, the skin, especially around the clit seems thinner as women get older

Clit sizes obviously: from mini clits to pseudo-dicks

Clenching power: some women can ""clench"" their vags very strongly. If they can time it with thrusting pace, it increases sensations

Smell and taste consideration: even with similar hygiene and care, the taste and smell can vary greatly in person and in time

Indirect factor: leg lateral angle and title during sex. Some women spread the legs a lot which allow to go deeper. Some keep the angle tighter, usually because they are sensitive with their pelvix. Some tilt their hips upwards for more depth, some downwards etc...

But a ""maybe,"" a ""possibly,"" or even a ""probably,"" without any further explanation?  Fuck that. 
 I'm not gonna go through the effort associated with your attendance (e.g., cooking extra food, buying an additional ticket -- whatever) and then have you end up being a no-show because you got lazy, or because you found something else you'd rather do.  Sorry, I just don't operate in that world of equivocation.  If you find that you want to make the commitment at some point, then great!  Give me a call.  I'd be happy to have ya.  Until then, however, consider yourself excluded from the plan."

"When I look at men who are much younger than me and I'm amazed at how bad they look, and there's no reason to be like that, they should be going through their sexual attractiveness peak. But no, they are either going bald or having their hair thinning, they are shorter than me or only an inch or two taller, and they make themselves look older with thick beards, they are also overweight or too skinny."

Unemployed?  Fine, stuff happens.  But being unemployed, you'd think he be careful with  OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY!

Once dated a girl who legit tasted like someone added a hint of cinnamon. She was evil but the taste was nice.
great ideas! I might steal that one for myself actually haha
Hated my life .Was unemployed and money running out . Woke up one morning and on a whim flew across the country .Considering I never took risks it was big . Anyways got a job found my future wife and got into real estate before the market exploded . 10 years later my wife on a whim was getting tired of the city life and sold everything and moved back to my rural life without a job lined up. Actually the wife wanted it and I was sceptical but I just came home on day and said let's sell on a whim and go. 2 years later I bought a business and on a whim sold that for over 3 times what I paid for it to get another business and ended up in a job and life I would never ever give up on a whim
Yes.
"My first girlfriend and I ended our relationship because she was moving on the opposite side of the world. On our last date, she cried a lot and told me that if I have asked her to marry she would have said yes. She thanks me for everything I did and honestly I have never felt so appreciated and desired in my entire life.

As a side note I want to say fuck you to my second (and latest) exgirlfriend. That bitch never gave me a compliment, was so unsupportive and told me it was too hard for her to tell me compliments. Also when I broke up, I told her everything I thought. I told her I wasn’t happy and I needed time by myself. She told me « okay » only to piss me off. "
Wish some parents would get this and not make their kids feel like they owe them.

My GF of seven years was “red dress girl” in my phone for several weeks when we first met. I’ve got no idea how I finally figured out her name... I think I had her put something into my phone?

"&gt; that if you do what you love to do- Girls will find its way

This tends to work well **unless** you're into activities that have ultra-skewed gender balance. Like if you work in STEM, and your hobbies are Warhammer and male-only BJJ, it's gonna be tough. My advice is to consider starting loving some activity with at least one sighting of a person of feminine orientation every year instead of hoping to find that perfect ham radio chick."

"I worked at a Toyota dealership a few years ago and a pretty average looking guy walks in, none of the senior salespeople wanted to approach him thinking he'd just waste their time. One of the newer salespeople goes to talk to him and he ends up ordering 8 Sequoia for a fleet. "
I'm taller than most guys and I have never met a girl taller than me. Tall guys are generally considered sexually desirable so I get hit on fairly often so I guess that's a perk. The downside is anytime someone needs something off the upper self they come to the resident tall guy. Also people just assume you are a walking tank or something as they think you can lift a 200lb object without a sweat. 
That's so insensitive to this poor man's condition

"I was on a date with a girl at a bar/club but the chemistry just wasn't there and I guess it showed? Anyways while the girl I was with was in the restroom a random pretty girl on the dance floor came up to me and said I'm really handsome and asked me to dance. I told her I would have loved to normally but I was on a date and thank you anyway. She tried to give me her number but I didn't want to be rude to my date.

Anyways, that's enough of an ego boost to keep me going for the next year. Girls don't realize how much space they can occupy in a guys head with simple gestures like that."

I hate the word deserve. Mostly because people usually treat their opinion of whether or not someone deserves something as some sort of objective truth. And usually they'll say they deserve something because they want it.

"Sex is a physical at, so is making out and flirting and so on, it comes from a biological drive. Being all in your head and overthinking it will instantly kill your enjoyment.

Sex is NOT like what you see in the movies or porn. At the same time though there are a lot of young women who don’t realize that they should do more than just lay there and let it happen. So it sounds to me like you’ve just been very unlucky in finding decent partners
