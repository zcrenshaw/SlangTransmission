0,That's one hell of a deadline. Kudos for getting the bird down safe and sound. 
1,"It's IT's responsibility because:

1) It's plugged into the wall, the same as the computer, AND

2) It's plugged into the computer."
2,The server room door couldn’t be opened from the inside?!?!
3,"I once made a woman cry. over the phone I told her to press the RIGHT button.

she burst into tears thinking I was being mean and essentially berating her for pressing the WRONG button."
4,Not without a keycard. Stupid high security server room.
5,"If there's **one thing** Cisco equipment doesn't do, it's ""just work."" "
6,Thanks! I was pretty proud of that one. And now I know what a helicopter landing computer is. LOL
7,"Not a problem, you escalated from 'please come loose"" to "" you better come loose"" to finally "" can't be tight if you are a liquid"" in a methodical manner. "
8,"&gt; She locked herself in her office for the rest of the day, and wouldn't talk to us, or the client when they called, so it came to us. 

I'm sorry, but why the *fuck* was she essentially rewarded for this behavior by being moved to yet another management position? 

Yeah, granted, maybe she's better suited for a non tech job, but this is just basic lack of management skills and people skills. Anyone who flies into a rage over being disagreed with and then storms off to go pout in their rooms does not need to hold a position *anywhere* until they get their shit together. 

It sounds like she may be bad at telling customers no or bad at gathering information in general. And then possibly overreacts from the stress of being wrong. Still no excuse for acting like that. There are two year olds who behave better. "
9,"I really expected this story to end with automating him out of a job. What a pleasant surprise that the technology made everything better and the guy who originally was typing up lines is now able to do something rewarding with the data instead.

Thanks for the warm fuzzies from this. "
10,"Reminds me of the time I helped someone who was intaking folders at an office. Thousands of folders, each with a barcode. She had a barcode reader and was intaking them into excel, but needed them in a column and Excel was set up to move the active cell to the right for some reason, so the process was scan, set scanner down, arrow down and left, pick scanner up, then scan next folder. With the change of a setting the process became scanscanscanscanscan. Didn't even get a thank you."
11,"That’s strange. I’ve been in some super secure server rooms, and there is usually a ‘push to exit’ button somewhere. It might set off an alarm, but there should always be a way out of the server room in an emergency.  You want to lock people out, not in."
12,"3) It's not edible - they tried nibbling at it.

4) It's not a furniture - they tried sitting on it and it was uncomfortable.
"
13,"""Can you please write that down for me and sign it?"""
14,"These are the kind of things that make me want to walk outside, scream, smoke a cigarette, scream more, quit my job, drive to the nearest ocean, get on a boat, go to a tropical island, and scream again."
15,"Whoops, I meant to save this as a draft to post tomorrow. Hopefully, I don't get in trouble... "
16,"reminds me of the ""GO AWAY OR I WILL REPLACE YOU WITH A SMALL SHELL SCRIPT"" shirt"
17,"I'm glad you stood up for yourself, hope you gave yourself a good pat on the back for making that decision and sticking with it."
18,Try say right side and left side the additional word has helped amazingly.
19,"This is a great example of how the feedback loop fails (or doesn't exist), customer is angry, customer doesn't bother to call the creator of product, customer eventually stops using product. "
20,"I had PTSD flashbacks to the [iPad commercial](https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY?t=53s) when you said

&gt; $PI: What's a VLAN?"
21,Wish I'd thought about it back when this happened. It's been almost 6 years since then and I've changed job twice since then. I'm now happily employed as a backend developer. 
22,"&gt;""I found a rubber mallet in the cupboard so I used it to help me.

Instructions unclear, now I have a dead employee on the floor and the darn machine doesn't work!! Send help, I need the PC fixed now!"
23,"I have a t- shirt for that: **I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.**"
24,"I put copies on the primary and secondary hard drives, on our network drives, emailed a copy to the captain, and myself. It's nice to know that the vendor had copies of everything. Amazing, really. "
25,Port and starboard.
26,You just tripled her workload expectations.
27,"From what I've seen (aka the flight courses in old MS Flight Simulator 98 and COF), there are a ridiculous amount of variables to keep track of in bringing a helicopter down gently enough to not screw something or someone up. And that's just on land; those pilots must have nerves of steel (and really good computers for throttle/vectors) to try hovering over a helipad floating on top of water that could be bucking up or down 10-30 feet at a time."
28,"My own two year old handles stress better, lol. The ward more to it than that, though. They were going to move her to a non managerial position, but she claimed they were doing it because she was a lesbian, and all kinds of other crap. It was just easier for them I suppose. Either way, I'm long gone and happy now,lol."
29,I'd rather scan three times as many folders than have to stop after each one and hit a few buttons.
30,"6) It's not a tv, although it has flashy lights and images, it does not pick up HGTV. 

7) It's not a charger, although it has wires and electricity, it will not charge my phone.

P.S. Unrelated - one of the imaging techs needs a new phone."
31,"It does work, if you consider work as "" The lights came on when I plugged in the power, and are all flashing orange""."
32,"It's outside your scope, but it's not got radioactive stuff in it.  It's basically like a TV tube designed to fire out X-rays, rather than *not* fire out X-rays which they kind of do by default.

220V is too low to do you any harm but the ~30kV supply to the X-ray tube is a bit nippy."
33,What do you fear the most? The computer guy with a torch or the engineer with the root password?
34,"We have a firm policy in place, we do not touch medical equipment. I don’t care if your X-ray machine uploads to your EMR, you need a support contract on that machine and get them to work with us. I don’t need myself or another tech accidentally messing up some setting and causing harm to someone down the line."
35,"You’re story reminds of a trip to a PEMEX oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.  Fly from BDL to Mexico City.  
Drive to some distant coastal town.  
Heli ride to a rig.  Walk into control center.  

Find computer.  Yep, PC looks on, but nothing on display.    
There’s your issue; push Power button on Monitor.  System was alive just needed to open her eyes.   $7,500 to push a Power button.  

Made $22,500 additional to go check the other 6 units.  Yep.  At least one component at each site didn’t have a power turned on.  "
36,"I would have paid HR a visit the moment he said ""ching chong name."""
37,Sue.
38,"Hm...  

The DOT is a Government agency, and that often means job security. You get in, and stay in until you retire or someone notice that you died a decade ago...   

So it's not unheard of that older workers began back when computers were rare. They probably used terminals for many years, and only switched to PCs before Y2K(A lot of systems were rewritten for new platforms then) . 

And a lot of PC systems back then were DOS based or a horrible 'we need to ditch the old iron, get it working NOW!' cludge where interoperability and adherence to OS design standards was not just ignored, but openly laughed at by soe developers...   

I remember the training people at my office got when the old Tandberg terminals disappeared and they got PCs instead...   Just the bare necessities.

And we never made it mandatory. A lot of users were 'too busy' to waste a day on training.  

The same users were also too busy when we switched to WinNT4.0, then to WinXP.  

But when we went to Win7, we made it mandatory. No one got their PCs updated until they had been through training. And it was hands-on.  And we made certain that some of the more recalcitrant users still had OLD PCs. 'Sorry, you're slated to get a new PC when we upgrade'. 

(Had a 6month 'no replacement' period, Only if the PC physically broke did we swap it, and then usually for a just as old PC.)   

The Heldesk reported a significant drop in 'general usage' requests afterwards...   

Can't call in users for whole-day courses?

Consider running a series of nano-learning rounds. 

(google it. great system)"
39,"I didn't go quite so far as actually cutting or melting the nuts off. I merely applied heat to the nut to cause it to expand enough to allow the bolt to turn. :) When reassembling, we applied a GENEROUS amount of never-sieze to the bolt. 

Had the bolts not come off after heating the nuts, the next step was to cut them off. "
40,"So the system involved something similar ( I believe ) to an aircraft carrier meatball. There was a green/amber/red light on the deck and a green/amber/red indicator on the landing system. The landing system would read in wind speed and direction from the weather computer ( anemometer and wind vane ), position and course over ground from the GPS, and roll, pitch, and heave data from the motion sensor. All parameters had to be within spec to get a green light. 

This involved the captain turning into the seas to minimize roll and heave as well as having calm enough wind and sea conditions to minimize pitch and windspeed. If the pilot got the green light, he was okay to land. It was nerve wracking for all involved. "
41,And all the tectonic plates clapped
42,"More than ""stupid user"" I think this is a case of ""very bad communication by us"". I wouldn't expect a user to know that some software can be modified or give them more information than they're used to, maybe they think of it like an iPhone App and you just get what's in the box. 

At some point communication has completely broken down and this client stopped understanding the actual point of having a database in the first place. "
43,"Lol, his REAL job was to interpret that data."
44,"That's the most surprising part to me (aside from you clearly being a wizard). They held onto this tiny .cfg for a decade and it actually came in handy. I'm also surprised the phone number on the card was still active! This would be a fantastic short movie, filmed like an action thriller from your perspective.

*I'm in.*"
45,"Err... the engineer with root password, hands down! But I probably fear the programmer with a screwdriver as much or more than the engineer with root password. "
46,"It was a few weeks of ""Don't get yourself locked in again"" and various heat-related jokes but it died off after a while. The guy who bailed me out still reminds me whenever we bump into each other though. "
47,"I don't wish to detract from the glorious instant karma Sleazeball got when you dropped his present, but I'm going to need more details on this part:

&gt; [...] a pretty cool utiliskirt a sewing genius friend of mine made for me, think a kneehigh belted skirt made from tough cargopants material with enough pockets to carry a serious doomsday-prepper’s EDC kit with pockets to spare.

...because I've seen some kick-ass utility kilts in drill or similar heavy-duty cotton, but I'm always keen to check out something new."
48,"We gave the requirements for cooling (in BTUs) but the casino contracted a different company to install the AC and the casino didn't specify redundant cooling. I don't know what the actual cause of the failure was, but the unit was completely dead with nothing on the screen at all and no air movement. The redundant AC was installed soon after. :)"
49,"All that redundancy, but only one AC?
Great recovery! What was the root cause? "
50,"&gt; sends me pics of her rack

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
51,"Use that as a warning for what a career choice in tech support will be like, except real life users are a lot more petty."
