1,"100$ is a great price for what you sell.. They'd make very good test servers. I wish I were employed with you. I'd buy a couple.

PS: *.... In case you may sell the ones up to the husband's specifications, I may quit and move over there to join your company to buy them.*"
2,"almost sounds like a different timezone and she doesnt understand what timezones are

4,Because browsers can keep cached versions of websites to make them easier to pull up later. Clearing the cache and cookies gets rid of the cached version of the site and can clear the error. 9/10 times it fixes the problem for the customer. 
5,"""I have a PhD in an almost-related field!"" is always ""I have fucked this up well beyond mortal comprehension"" (or if I'm feeling nice ""I know just enough to make things break really badly"")

Something tells me his materials science background didn't teach him shit about algorithms either"
6,"To be honest, it probably has to do though our webpage being written badly,  but it's not like I can access the source code for the site and fix everything. "
7,"Idiot tax applied.  When pricing services, caveat emptor.  If you get a price too good to be true, prepare to get shafted."
8,"If you work in the Tech Department, you get an even better deal: you can take whatever the F you want home for free, as long as it's not something that should be deployed elsewhere.

I currently have a desktop from 2012, an all-in-one from 2014, a convertible Windows tablet from 2015 (in terrible shape from the teacher who left, otherwise I would have kept it as a loaner), a similar convertible tablet from 2014 for my wife, two SFF desktops from 2011 that I'm using as media center PCs and another that I'm using as a NAS, an ancient iMac for troubleshooting Macs that I get in for my side gig, a small LCD for my workbench for my side gig, a color laser AIO (consumer level) that we got used as a donation, an 802.11n wireless system with enterprise controller, and a 24-port managed gigabit switch, plus several older laptops that I was using before my 2015 tablet and was too lazy to wipe.  I even have an old netbook that I used to use to plug into my car for datalogging and tuning.

Unfortunately for you, we're not hiring, unless you're a high school student that we can use as a summer intern."
9,"""Because, when your *child* turned 18, (s)he became an adult.  By law, adults do not get free reign over the private business of other adults without permission.""

No reason to get technical with them, just plain language. "
10,"&gt;Then a couple of months later she threatened to kill my mom and blow up a bunch of autistic kids.

Charming... "
11,"She was grateful for the loaner, but didn’t understand it was for her to use tomorrow? She doesn’t (want) to understand she has to bring it back. Get ready for an epic meltdown when you call her!"
12,"My guess is that she was Chinese, they force the whole country into a single time zone even though it spans 5. 

Mao decided In 1949 that all of China was to use Beijing Time.

13,"I've heard it as ""Well, if you know more than I do about this why are you calling me for help?"""
14,"Oh yeah that was exactly it, not sure how that concept is so difficult to grasp"
15,Do you have 4G available?  Your phone is a hotspot but also Google Translate can do real time text translation using the phones camera.
16,"Serious question though, why would clearing cache and cookies resolve this problem? "
17,There would be far less of these stories if people just think first before calling.
18,"I like your priority scale.

Someone getting service they shouldn't? TOP PRIORITY - SOUND THE ALARM

Someone not getting the service they're paying for? Meh, a tech will be there within the week."
19,"&gt; We eventually got her set up on dial up, because she refused to pay for anything more. [...] Then a couple of months later she threatened to kill my mom and blow up a bunch of autistic kids.

Dialup. Not even once."
20,"Any system issued to end users should have all ""delete"" functionality removed. They'll always delete the wrong thing. "
21,"Web developer here. Yes, it is totally our fault. Cache busting is important, but it is annoying to implement, so these problems happen. You should forward these tickets to the web developers."
22,"Lady: ""Hey, I know someone that owns a small business, so I'm going to everything I can to fuck him/her over and not pay a fair price"""
23,"... and then you woke up.

RwP"
24,"Well of the company, but hes kinda just been with the owner since the start. He's the shark kinda salesman"
25,"&gt; ""About 1 1/2 years now""

And they didn't think to bring this issue up with someone?

Why am I even asking that question..."
26,"   This, You can also download language packs and use them off-line if you don’t have any Internet access. I think it may be the most Star Trek like program we have right now."
27,Wow that may actually be correct
28,always right before closing? sounds shady somehow like shes avoiding parts of the job she doesn't know.
29,This is a great story. Will there be a .. Sequel??
30,"That’s why I always check the uptime first before restarting, and give the friendly reminder that maybe 59 days is the reason why your computer is a little sluggish."
31,"""What??!! Listen here, crazy lady! Your bullcrap just cost the firm eleventy hundreds of thousands of dollars! Uranus better not be in retrograde, because that's where these tapes are going now!!!"""
32,I think the dialup got to her
33,"She probably thinks he's giving her great service, he's probably finding a way to fuck her over (or just fuck her)."
34,"... I'm preparing to get fired from my current consulting job - nothing malicious; there's nothing left to code so they'll fire me with severance, both parties agreeing. There's a GIS data collection job that uses my licensed program but I have to do nothing for that job either.

Unpaid internship accepted. Where? /j"
35,"Drill hole, pour in a little sand, start up drive, done."
36,"The 90s called, probably about wanting their internet back, but they couldn't get through because I was online."
37,"Knowing this guy, everything you said is likely to be true."
38,It's their system though.  They have some kind of VM management tool that they just deleted the virtual machine in... Can't fix stupid.
39,"Honestly thought I'd be packing my shit when I went upstairs.

In my book it was an unforgivable mistake.

I really believe that the thing that saved me was that I went up with not one problem, but something closer to six, all completely avoidable if things were done properly.

I essentially still got away with blaming the guy before me, mainly because by this point his reputation for cowboying was the stuff of legend."
40,"I actually got contracted to deal with a similar aftermath to this.

Picture this:  Small optician's office, previously cheaped out on network cabling.  Inefficient application that doesn't play nice with anything less than gigabit.  2 ports routinely cabled with 1 wire (which you can do if you're prepared to forego gigabit speeds).

I had a proper networking contractor come in and quote for re-doing the lot with 2 ports per desk with fully certified Cat6.  It was pretty obvious with even a cursory glance that precisely nothing was worth trying to salvage.

My client didn't bat an eye.  Nobody pretended it was a cheap job (it wasn't; it was very expensive) but that the whole point of the work was to ensure they wouldn't have to do it again.  I can only imagine what a nightmare trying to get anything done was before we fixed it up."
41,"What are you trying to say here? I am paying for his/her tuition I have every right to know whats going on with my kid, I don't give a shit about this FRERFRe crap, are you OR are you not going to give me the info I want? /s"
42,"for a second there i was almost going to say time for the third envelope...

but good job there getting them to start looking after their servers properly!"
43,"The owner of my company applies an asshole-tax.  If a customer fucks over an employee, suddenly they're getting invoices an extra 20-50% depending on how angry he is."
44,"&gt; “So I’m good enough to pay the bills, but not good enough to talk to?”

""That would be a question for your child."""
45,"Also, the grammar sounds a lot like a Chinese speaker - they don't use all of the same connecting words English does, so people with Chinese as their first language who learn English often omit them in practice, especially if they're not great at the language. Same as how Russian speakers will frequently drop a/an/the, because Russian doesn't have articles. "
46,"I worked for a company that supported POS systems and had someone try to pull this shit on me one day..

""You guys are awful support, all you ever do is get us to restart the machine""

""Does it fix it though?""

""Yeah but that's not the point, it's lazy and you never fix it permanently""

etc"
47,"For classified data at US Government facilities, there is a whole book on proper discard methods all dependent on time. 

Just need to throw some old drives away? Degausser and drill some holes in it. 

Don't have a degausser? Drill holes and then 10-pound sledgehammer

Embassy is under siege? Literally shoot it with an M4 until unrecognizable. Or thermite if available. (I wish this was a joke). "
48,"Smack it real good with a rock hammer or other pick, enough to put a hole over the platters. Submerge in ocean water, or water and drain cleaner in a liter:bucket ratio. Brew for a month. Serve and enjoy."
49,"&gt; We buy desktops and laptops on a four-year rotation, for about $800 a pop (yeah, I know, we're cheap)

That is... exactly what you should be doing, not cheap at all. I've seen so many places that struggle with 5+ year old equipment and refuse to replace it. Then when they do, they want the cheapest piece of hardware possible."
50,"The priority scale is 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. (Irrelevant, Low, Medium, High and Extreme) I’ve only ever seen the extreme priority valid once in my two years at this job. "
51,I always say i submited a ticket to MS and they will contact them when they aprove the changes. 
52,"How do you write a query that takes 20 hours, and not think ""there's got to be a better way""? Depending on the tables, I'm generally impatient at around 10 minutes.  "
53,"I work in a retail store that handles a lot of computer repairs (where I do most of my work) and have plenty of entitled customers come in, by far my favourite was the customer asking for a copy of the data back up (hard drive replacement) of their 20 year old daughter's laptop. Keep in mind this was after the daughter dropped it off and paid for the service"
54,"My wife does photography as a hobby/side gig. Doesn't charge much and not nearly enough to replace her current income. Just something she enjoys and basically charges for her time being out there taking pics. She drives to whatever location they choose, doesn't make you purchase pictures, gives a full copyright release with all pics on DVD and does all the editing. It just takes about a week or two to get it all done b/c career and life come before hobby that isn't paying any bills.

With that said, someone wanted her to do some business photos with their employees that they could use for advertisement. My wife said she would do it for $50 for up to 4 people, $25 per person after that plus compensation for them taking up an entire Saturday at a local park.

There were 18 people, all would be in costume and some would require costume changes. They wanted 4 - 5 poses per person and a few poses of all of them together.  That's $400 and my wife waived the time limit (for what was essentially a giant wedding party) as a friendly gesture for a family friend starting a business. 

Everything was booked and ready to go. That is, until the Friday before when said person calls and asks if my wife can lower the price to $100 for all 18 people. My wife said yes, but she would only be staying for 1 - 1.5 hours for that price. A couple of poses per person and a couple of group poses is doable in that amount of time. Or, if money was an issue, it could be broken up over a few weekends so that it wasn't so much of a hit to the wallet all at once. Neither were good enough. They wanted the agree upon poses and unlimited time for the not agreed upon price. My wife shut it down right then. They found someone to do it for cheaper than that, and it shows.

The funny part of all of this is, they have a thing on their site that says ""Hiring a &lt;insert thing here&gt;?"" Then it goes on to list what you think you are paying for (this one thing) vs what you are actually paying for (this long list of things that goes into making that one thing including time, talent, experience, etc.), which is understandable and reasonable. Then it mentions why asking for a massive discount, more time for free or just free in general is a bad idea and unfair.

I'm sure the same thing happens to all of us here in TFTS. *""Hey, can you come set up my new computer, home network, Alexa, cellular hotspot, and 15 devices? I'll buy you a beer and pizza next time we all go hang out.""*  Knowing that you will be avoided like the plague when you come to collect on said beer and pizza.

People who know you are ridiculous sometimes."
