1,Why haven’t you fixed the thing that you don’t know about and I haven’t told anyone to fix? *stamps foot* 
2,"I feel that this showcases the advantages and pitfalls of working in IT:


1) The good side: The users believe everything you say.


2) The bad side: The users believe everything you say."
3,Be rude. Don’t work for free.
4,"3) the users don't listen to what you say and make it up in their heads anyway.

5,"They needed to make the phone call to progress the quest line, but doing so opened up some side quests. Clearly, we're dealing with a completionist."
6,I... have no words
7,"&gt;$User: I have dirty whore pictures on my desktop, I want to send them.

It's nice to see that he's open about his collection and doesn't have them hidden in %appdata%\\Roaming\\Intuit\\TurboTax 2011\\user_data\\completed_forms.7zip"
8,"Well at least he thought to leave his desk while you were working on his computer. If there had been a problem, that would have been very helpful.

I don't work in IT, but cleaning a running computer under an occupied desk doesn't seem easy."
9,"The dive shop I work at has someone that dropped off an oxygen bottle for inspection and cleaning. Every 12 or 13 months he calls and asks if we still has it, has us dump the gas and inspect it and refill it. 4 years this has gone on. I asked if I could have it when I took a course, but since its an ""active"" customers, no luck."

11,"Doctor: I'm afraid your son has the knack.

Dilmom: The knack?

Doctor: The knack. It's a rare condition characterised by an extreme intuition about all things mechanical and electrical. And utter social ineptitude.

Dilmom: Can he lead a normal life?

Doctor: No, he'll be an engineer.

Dilmom: Oh no!
"
12,They’re VPs. What else do they have to do? Work?
13,And why grill *you?* It sounded like you were at the bottom of the food chain. It all seems unprofessional to fry somebody in front of other high-ranking officials; unless they get their jollies in doing so
14,"Back in the day when I was helping my dad with his repair shop you had 30 days once notified. Notification was verbally telling them on the phone and saying they have 30 days to pick up and pay or the item will be sold to cover the cost of repairs.  
There were a couple times people were late and I took things off the sell wall and let them pay the cost of repair. Others would come in 3 months later. Sorry man, look around there is zero space here and you were called every week until the 30 days was up, your item is sold.   
This was long before flat screens so TVs and Monitors took up a lot of space. If a PC came in we would give the monitor back as we had our own to test. Space was an issue. Those book shelf stereos were a thing too. At least the VCRs I could stack with padding in the middle. "
15,is this person paying you guys despite not picking it up? If they're not paying then they're not a customer.
16,Such a momentous occasion should have automatically imprinted your offspring with the Tech Aura. Expect them to follow in your footsteps.
17,"""My son thinks he could do better""  If that was truly the case you would not be here. Point blank."
18,"Yeah... If you were a plumber, would you fix some rando's pipes for free?

Tell them to Google it. Otherwise you are their free tech support forever. And you should have a talk with your family."
19,"My dad has a motorcycle in his garage that was dropped off for work in 1973. There was a dispute on the charges so it has sat there for 45 years, the business was sold in about 1998, original owner died in the 2000’s. 

It’s still sitting there. "
20,"Total shit show. However, to play devils advocate, the way you should have handled it is to do everything you did, right up to the DELETE step, then take all of it and show it to your supervisor and say something like: ""We can spend the next week doing this, or I can send this command and be done in seconds. What do you want me to do boss?"".
"
21,He's Q from MI6 keeping prepositioned gear all across the world.
22,"well, now that you've installed a Linux OS on the laptop, you now qualify to be her IT Technician."
23,Or put in ticket then 1 hr later complain why isn't this fixed? It has been broken for months!!
24,I count 4 words.
25,Doctors. One of like five people you REALLY don’t want to be lazy when they work on what they work on. 
26,"... She meant the ""disconnected dino"" of Google Chrome?"
27,"If you don't call back, then your family member looks bad for you not doing something you never agreed to do.

If you call back and can't figure it out, then you apparently don't know what you are doing and made your family member look bad. 

If you call back and do a good job, you are tech support for this person for life, along with anyone else that asks this person about computer problems, along with anyone else that your family member mentions your skills to.

Draw your lines early and keep to them or deal with a lifetime of trying to establish them and getting random calls/emails/texts from people you know nothing about and, if you are lucky, may thank your relative or send you a gas card in the mail...

I have the husband of my dad's cousin that wants to know if I can hack the annoying kids out of the web based poker game he plays on a decade plus old website.

28,"I always love customers who think you're just bullshitting around and trying to get out of the ticket, but never give you time to get some very obvious questions answered. But I forget that customers always make sense in their tickets and always provide enough detail with proper wording so why would we need to call them other than to try and get out of work?"
29,"I don't care how technical somebody is or is not: Every human on earth should understand the concept of ""If you don't use it, it can't work.""

(Yes, there are exceptions, but those would more be things which you use passively.)"
30,"The executive director AND our operations manager (a former IT guy) forced me to acquire all user passwords and keep them in a book in case we need them. At this point, this was my first year at the company. I told them that's an absolutely absurd idea, and a huge breach of security. I just flat out said it wasn't going to happen, because (to me, at least), it's an ethical no-no, and I could find work elsewhere (didn't actually say that, but sure as hell thought it in my head). They almost fired me for insubordination until they hired an external consultant (because they didn't believe a word I said, despite the fact I am a professional) who told them the idea of storing user passwords in a notebook is a horrible idea, and we would fail a security audit in a second.

I'm still here, and they finally respect me"
31,"So some of the higher ups then:

""I already told you this would break our security protocol, and you want me to do it anyway???""

""No, we cannot access passwords. No we won't give you access to stored passwords. No we aren't changing the passwords to text files. Yes I know you are the CEO... Its just not happening. Cool, you do that""

Some of them really don't learn. Others are great though. "
32,"The guy with the popcorn speaks to me on a spiritual level. I wonder if he knew what the problem was and was like ""well, this'll be a shit show of the highest magnitude."""
33,"I'm not sure I agree with /u/coreyxample's suggestion to be rude, but 100% do not do this for free. For anything beyond minor fixes for family and *close* family friends I charge $60/hr (first increment covers 90min,) which is low enough to be a deal but still enough to discourage people from pestering you with every problem.

Fortunately you also have a number of good ways to dodge this entirely; starting with asking 'do you have a Mac?' and 'have you bought a copy of or subscription to Word?' In particular if the answer for the second is no, tell her you can't help and send links to buy/install Office (MS had made this crazy easy.)

I have no doubt that you're technically capable, but if you're in college for CS you can also pull the 'this isn't actually the kind of computer work I'm at school for' card.

If you do decide to help Jane, do yourself a favor and don't talk her though anything over the phone other than getting connected to you via teamviewer. Being the one driving can make the difference between making a few easy bucks and wasting an entire day.

Oh, you could also install Libre or something, but I suspect that would just cause more headaches for you down the line.

One other thing I noticed. How is it rude for you to not take a call during a weekday while you're in college and this was dropped on you with no heads up? I know it is unpleasant, but you may need to have a talk with your family about when and how to recommend your services. Better to do it now and get it through to the family that these cases require investment on your end than before this is a regular occurrence.

""Of course, try using your correct username and password!""

36,"A friend once had a client store their entire business records on a single laptop with no redundancy.

HD went bad and client freaked out because their small business was about to crash and burn, millions of dollars worth of client data, etc...

""What do you mean you can't do anything? Those data recovery people want to charge me $6,000!""

herp derp , at least it's potentially recoverable. what if your laptop was stolen? what then?"
37,"So she left her files on the local drive, refused Citrix, then complained when Citrix, which she chose not to use, respected her wishes.

What a dingus.

I wish basic tech literacy was a requirement of employment for jobs requiring use of computers... you're an accountant? Great, you have to understand file storage, security practices, and credentials. You can't be bothered? Your resume goes in the round one."
38,"That's way to specific, is that your own stash location or is there a story of discovering someone else's?"
39,"I'd love to, but the price for me is one high-intensity guilt trip when my refusal makes **FamilyMember** look bad to her friends. 

I have to think about it, but I'm very, very displeased that my services were offered out to third parties like that, particularly for stuff I have no experience with. "
40,"Well, his PC is under his desk so, if I had actually had to work on it, he would have needed to move out of the way. He was just being considerate and finding somewhere else to be."
41,"&gt; Otherwise you are their free tech support forever.

Worse yet, anything that goes wrong with it in the future is somehow your fault because you touched it now."
42,"Classic case of ""I call you to help me but you are not giving me the answer I want"" syndrome..."
43,"Story time. Back in the old days when networking protocols other than TCP/IP were still widely used it wasn't uncommon to set up a DMZ with 'protocol breaks', where multiple network segments were chained with different protocols. Ideally the systems in there would only be capable of speaking the protocols used. The idea was that this prevents exploiting weaknesses of a specific network protocol to gain access to the internal network.

At the point of this story pretty much the whole network already got migrated to TCP/IP, and all network protocols other than that were uninstalled from all computers but the IT ones. We had one DMZ where the connection to the internal network was through NetBEUI. We had a dedicated connection to that network in case we needed to change something on the gateway.

I noticed at some point that we made daily tape backups of the gateway, despite it doing nothing but moving packets on application level between a NetBEUI and a TCP/IP network - so after the initial setup nothing should've changed. 

Turns out, because of that dedicated link combination with NetBEUI this was the only computer in the company compliance department couldn't access - even though they could get a link into the network, their computers no longer had NetBEUI. So IT used it to store the departments mp3 collection, which obviously needed to be backed up."
44,"The butterfly is lack of money. 

Probably Rent-A-Centre people."
45,"At a certain point I think I'd just file a mechanic's lien so I could sell it to get paid for the work, the storage fees, and to just get the damned thing out of there."
46,"You know I never thought of that, but could you imagine how handy it would be to have computers and stuff stashed around the world, and continually serviced so they always work."
47,"And then wait 6 months for someone to Ok it because no one has the balls to. Then wait another 6 months and repeat yourself, show evidence of testing, backout and proof that it will work etc etc.
Then maybe they might think about letting you do it! Win!! /s"
