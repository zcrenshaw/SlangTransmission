0,Likely predicted the rent hikes and locked in really good rates for long term leases. That’s how you know they are legit.
1,"I don't go outside until October, problem solved."
2,How long is your mother planning to stay?
3,"I hate it more when I'm here, then travel home or somewhere else and miss all the good parts. 

The cruelest thing will be leaving some day and missing all the amazing parts of the city and kind of forgetting the things you hated about it. "
4,"Live in LIC, it sounds like you've never been there. There's high rises going in everywhere, blocks of brownstones have been slowly bought up and leveled to build new apartments, more and more restaurants are opening instead of former hardware shops, etc. Just within 2 blocks of my apartment there's been 4+ new restaurants. 


Astoria is happening as well, just a bit harder because of some of the roots there imo"
5,No.
6,Just wanted to say congrats on doing some awesome things and well done on the self-care!
7,"The WNYC guy described the weather as ""soupy""."
8,"The answer to your question is of course, yes it's rude. In the greater scheme of possible train-related offenses I'd say it's a more minor one though. Just keep waking them up. "
9,"I read the article which kind of neatly sums up the explanation as, ""there's more demand than we think."" But I think there's a little more to it than that - a reason that the psychics the author interviewed would purposefully not communicate.

I can't recall the source, but I read that the psychic's business model is a lot like freemium gaming. Their walk-in income is negligible. Instead, the true purpose is to bait in a whale - a desperate and vulnerable enough individual which the psychic will cultivate co-dependency with. It's this long-term, repeated client that is the true source of income for the psychic. Like, $100s an hour for phone calls that occur multiple times a week. This might even resemble more of a therapist/life coach relationship, except it's shitty because instead of providing any real source of help, the psychic is probably preying on their vulnerabilities even more."

11,"I KNOW THIS ONE!!!  Holy crap!  I just talked to the author of a book about this and asked him this very question.

So, the palm reading business is run by Romas/Gypsies in New York.  They make almost no money on the palm reading but what they do do is find bigger marks through it.

Let's say you go to a palm reader because you are a lonely widow and you want to know if you will find love again.  You can become a target for people preying on this: anywhere from a romantic man will come along and scam your for money or to straight up burglary.  

Names are passed around the community, people work together, etc.

Basically the palm reading places are just a way to find long-term victims.

(The author worked extensively with the cop who was on the Gypsie beat in NYC.)  "
12,"In my opinion as an armchair sociologist, it's basically due to proximity of the Lower East Side / Soho. The bohemian/alternative/punk scene in those locations decades ago more easily spread to Brooklyn and that's what set off gentrification. First the artists, then the gentrifiers. Western Queens, by comparison seems to get the working class people in the arts as opposed to the artists. Unlike parts of early Brooklyn which felt more like poor artists moving into affordable neighborhoods and making them ""hip"", Queens gentrification feels like more stable young-professionals realizing these nice family neighborhoods are convenient and slowly bring in ""hip"" culture borrowed from what's going on in Brooklyn. 

LIC is different from all of this though. That's just new development for really rich young-professionals. More of an extension of Turtle Bay/ Murray HIll types than anything in my opinion."
13,It's difficult to run a restaurant from a 3rd floor walkup closet. 
14,[Booed at Yankee Stadium on his birthday](https://sports.yahoo.com/rudy-giuliani-booed-yankee-stadium-birthday-monday-212441887.html).
15,"NO! He was despised up until 9/11 and then had a brief reprieve when he became ""America's Mayor"". Then after trying to politicize 9/11 during his campaign for President back in 2008 (I think), many New Yorkers began to dislike him again.  That deal was sealed when he full-throated-ly backed Donald Trump in 2016. He is despised by many once again.  "
16,"Top hats and tails, for the most part."
17,"Just a heads up, Long Island and Long Islsnd City Are two very different places. Long Island is outside of the city, and is a lot of suburbs and smaller towns.

* hard to recommend a place without knowing his budget or salary. It would be an easy commute to work from Sunnyside or Astoria though (just a couple train stops). Sunnyside is quieter and more peaceful IMO, Astoria is younger and more hip. 

* most people take the train or bus. Biking is a possibility if he is a good biker who isn’t scared of riding in traffic. NYC kind of lacks in terms of bike lanes and safety. 

* the cost questions is way too dependent on what he likes to do...clubs and drinking are expensive for example, but there are cheap things to do as well. 

* most places he’s liable to end up are going to be fine. I doubt he’ll hVe any reason to find himself in east New York."
18,"&gt; There wasn't a single time where we accidentally got on the wrong train/in the wrong direction

Happens to me from time to time and I've been a New Yorker for 30 years."
19,"I live 1 block from my station, I'd say I was at about 99% just from that alone."
20,"Go to Albany. NYC is incredibly unforgiving and you'll blow through your savings very fast. Get your feet set in Albany, get your education sorted out and move to NYC later on. "
21,Bolt Bus or DC2NY. Never take Megabus. Their buses are death traps and they treat customers like cattle.
22,"Eat some food at [Veselka](http://veselka.com/), then ride the Staten Island Ferry and watch the sun rise."
23,Honestly it's ok to just stay inside during daytime for another three weeks until the heat breaks.

25,"What a unique question! I've never heard of a floor collapsing, so unless you're planning on storing multiple 50-gallon drums of mercury, I doubt it would buckle. 

In any case, I have no useful answers to your question. "
26,today was the first time in my life where i consciously rerouted my commute in order to walk under shade as long as possible. 
27,"I know that sucks as a parent and you want everything to be the best it can be for her. I've been there--my MIL refused to refrain from smoking around my kids. It was maddening. 

But when you're not used to being around smokers, the tiniest traces of smoke smell really strong. It's a plus of living in a mostly non-smoking world. There was a total sea change when it was banned.

Your baby is not being exposed to meaningful or harmful amounts of smoke. Perhaps get a good air purifier and run it right by the ac unit that's letting the smell in. But try not worry too much. You're clearly a good parent and she's in good hands. Unfortunately, you can't control everything. Trust me, I've tried. 

Edited: Thanks for the gold! Just trying to share what I've learned from 18 years (holy shit how has it been 18 years already?) of parenting. "
28,Sounds like a social anxiety exercise. 
29,Half the time I aim for these fools. That and the people that put their bags in the middle seat in a packed train so they don't have to touch shoulders with someone. I plan on sitting and going to sleep myself... I'm not going to stand for an hour long ride because you don't want to move your butt and sit up a little. 
30,"Honestly, Times Square at 3am is really fucking cool. No crowds, lots of open space, bright lights. As much as I avoid Times Square during the day, when I used to work overnights I'd park my emergency vehicles out there, grab some fries, and wait for a call.

It's also a really great opportunity to bike up and down some of the usually busy streets, you can have a really invigorating bike along 5th Ave, or any other major street. This emptiness also makes for some amazing street photography opportunities as well. 
"
31,"Yup.  From Williamsburg, you jump on the subway, and the next stop is East Village.  Or you cross the bridge onto the Lower Eastside.  From LIC, you jump on the subway, and the next stop is...  Midtown.  Or you cross the bridge and the onto... East 61st.  Very different vibes."
32,"I had to bike to work shirtless in order to prevent sweat stains. 

I'm not even that well built or anything but holy hell, people really like to cat call at shirtless guys. Its hot out, let me live. "
33,"A lot of newer buildings seem to have huge bathrooms, which is something that I couldn’t care less about.

Also everyone else here is on crack; I love my dishwasher and it was a key part of deciding to take my current apartment "
34,"I am in Queens but yes, this happens also constantly to me.  They [just got kicked out  of NY anyway](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/27/17622846/spectrum-charter-cable-internet-new-york-kicked-out) 
"
35,Those days are long gone. 
36,"I always assumed these and massage parlors are fronts for other stuff, especially because I've seen police investigate or forcibly enter palm reading places at least twice.

How are all the NYC souvenir stores in midtown paying rent? They're all street level, mostly empty, and sell the same stuff."
37,"Yes. Very rude. 

I understand the desire for personal space, but you can’t have that expectation on public transit. Don’t be these people. "
38,"I always romanticize leaving New York City for another cheaper city, but I know it won't happen.

I only took the LIRR 2 weeks ago and half way into my trip I knew I couldn't move away."
39,"Do you have any friends that can get you a quick off the books job (landscaping, private construction, etc)? It may require some real manual labor but it would help in the mean time. If you know divorce is imminent and you have evidence of an affair, it may be advantageous to try to get a free consultation with a lawyer if you can. Doing this could also help with your child support situation. 

As for your friends wedding, you may have to miss it unless your friends are willing to help pay. In your current situation it would be a really dumb move to blow the very little cash you have on someone else’s wedding. If you’re close enough to the groom to be a best man, you should be able to explain your situation and have him understand without hard feelings. "
40,"Hell, just 10 years ago, most of those high rises didn't even exist. And 10 years before that, it was pretty much all warehouses and industrial zones. "
41,OP can you post a pic of the tub when u arrive? I'm curious.
42,"The Cloisters seem up your alley, though on the pretty and low-key side of things. The Heavenly Body Show is amazing. "
43,"Drop your bags at the hotel first, they'll hold them for you until check in. And they may have an early checkin room depending on how busy they are."
44,"Tenement Museum actually has a lot to teach about the immediate post-Civil war era (one of the two buildings was constructed in 1865 iirc) and every time point past that--you can even use it to teach about the decline of NYC in the 70s and the regrowth up through gentrification.) And immigration patterns, of course. 

One of the oldest buildings in NYC is the Wyckoff House museum in Flatbush. Built about 1652, it was constructed as a one-room cabin for the Wyckoff family, who were hired as caretakers for Stuyvesant's farmlands there. (I am descended from the family.) Can use that to compare-and-contrast immigration policy and early Colonial life. In order ""emigrate legally"" in 1630s, you had to get permission from either the Dutch West India Company, or the King of England. 

There's a very old Quaker meeting house in Flushing that dates to 1690s. Still an active meeting house.

Merchant's House museum is very cool in that it has only had minimal upkeep and is extremely close to how it would have been in the 1840s when built. It begins to paint a really authentic picture of early New York life. 

Just studying the map is fascinating. Have them figure out where all the NYC place and street names came from. Wall, Canal, Brooklyn, Flushing... every name tells a story. 

But as far as very old buildings, there actually aren't many. Even the grand old cast iron buildings in SoHo and up Broadway are the second or third structures on those sites. Buildings don't last very long without extensive maintenance. "

47,I actually didn't think this morning was that bad at all relative to most of the days we've had this summer. I was a little warm but didn't sweat much on the walk in this morning - while there have been several days this summer where I've genuinely considered going back home to shower and change.
