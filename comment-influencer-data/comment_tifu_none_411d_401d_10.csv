Girl get you a dildo. There's no telling what kind of bacteria is on that brush. They make ribbed ones.
Your manager probably decided that 1.5 days of missed work and a few white lies was well worth being able to tell everyone about the time he got an employee so drunk they fled the country. 
i only read the TLDR and i thought you tried to slap a homeless person in a hurry.

A throwaway isn't going to save you if your cousin reads reddit. This is so specific that they are going to know.

"Even if you've chipped your tailbone (coccyx) you're extremely unlikely to need any kind of medical intervention. I'd suggest that, unless you've got any neurological symptoms (tingling, numbness, weakness, incontinence) that you save yourself the trip and dose up on painkillers!

That being said, if you DO experience any neurological symptoms you need to see a doctor immediately.

Oh, and even a bruised coccyx can take a good few months to stop being sore. You have my sympathies!

"Give it some time. Sometimes life and the people in it can surprise us. I didn't speak to one of my best friends for 9 months over an all-out brawl of epic proportions. I was 1000% convinced I'd never speak to this person again.

They were mad at me, told me to ""lose their number"", I called their bluff and blocked on every social media known to man, as well as texts, calls, etc. Months later, they created a dummy account on social media and found me, apologized, and asked to talk. I unblocked social media and found months of messages asking to re-connect. I also realized I had forgiven them.

Our relationship never was the same, but it didn't have to die either.

Live and learn, man. Live and learn."

That is what I was thinking. That has to be emotionally draining for the rescuer. Why were they put back on the same spot?

My theory is if you can’t laugh and joke with your partner during sex you’re not with the right person. 
my favorite part of this story is the nonchalant notation that prostitution is a once a month thing.....naturally. 
"Omg,  My mom and I would have laughed so hard.  My family would have insisted I marry you just so we could poke fun of you for years over this!!!"
Honestly this story pisses me off due to the fact you didn’t even end up seeing your friend.. like might as well go through with the plan after buying tickets and 6 hours plus on a plane

"Was once with a few friends visiting another friend at college. Drunk as hell around 4am we walk passed an idling coach bus with students on it. I ask the person in front where the bus is going. He says it’s the (insert student group here) trip to Washington DC and asks us if we’re supposed to be on the bus. Obviously we say yes and proceed to board the bus. 

We’re sitting on the bus quietly laughing it up about how we totally just talked our way onto a bus to DC. One of us (definitely not me) poses the question, are we gonna be good with this when we wake up hungover in DC in a few hours. 

We then stepped back off the bus. "

"Do *not* use peroxide if it's colored carpet - it *will* bleach it.

Oxy-Clean (or other oxygenated laundry additive, since I am not sure if that's just a US thing) and water mixed in a hair coloring bottle (or any other squirty bottle really - can't be a spray bottle) does wonders on bloodstains. Saturate the stain, let sit for a few minutes, then grab a towel and start blotting it up. *Do not* rub. Just blot, then put pressure on the towel (sit or stand on it) over the stain for about ten minutes. Repeat as needed."
Spit on the stain. There's an enzyme in your saliva that will break down the blood.

"This could have gone so much worse!  I had to drive my partner to the ER with second degree chemical burns on his junk, from using Nair.  

2/10 do not recommend.

He was in the bathroom doing his thing with some Nair, and I was cooking dinner or something.  He screams out from the bathroom, ""Hey, Clumsy, is it supposed to feel like this?""

He didn't sound overly concerned or anything, so I ask him what it feels like.  He can't describe it to me.  I tell him if it is even anything remotely like pain he needs to get it off RIGHT NOW.

Guy decides... 'Nahhhhh it's not THAT bad' and keeps it on for ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES.

When he finally did go to rinse everything off, several layers of skin went, too.  We didn't have enough gauze to cover the area, and couldn't stop the bleeding right away, so I helped him get into the loosest pair of sweatpants I could find and had to practically drag him down the stairs to the car.  Loaded him in the back seat, apologized like fuck every time I hit a bump and he whimpered.  It was awful.

Thankfully he had no permanent scarring or loss of function, although I was certain that was going to occur.  He spent the next week splayed out in a computer chair with no pants on, had to call off work and everything.  I think it took about 2 months for him to be able to walk in clothes without pain.

"It’s really mentally taxing rescuing a person, most places specially relieve lifeguards who’ve had to rescue someone drowning because it takes time mentally to handle it. I’m sorry this happened to you, this is just an unfortunate timing of events and not your fault. 

I hope you’re okay! "
"So, OP, I was in a similar situation as you not too long ago.  I'll preface my story by saying I'm happier now.  Below's what happened.  I hope this'll help you and others in the same situation understand how to navigate through their feelings.

I was going through a pretty rough time.  Graduated not too long ago, but the degree felt basically worthless when job hunting.  No one wanted me so I had to settle for one shitty job after the other.  This lasted for years and I was struggling with bills, loans, and a bad home environment all throughout.  Eventually I got kicked out of that home and was stressing about how to not be homeless while dealing with one of the worst jobs I've held to date at the same time.  As you probably know personally--*and others in this thread have failed to understand*\--constant shit like this, both during the day at work and at night at home, can weigh heavy on you. It *really* affects your friendships.  The last thing you want from a friendship is for someone to screw you over like she did so when they do, the one bright spot you were hoping so desperately to help distract you from the shit that is your life turns just as shitty as everything else and this really fucks you up.  I totally understand why you ghosted her.  My friends... they were there for me at times, other times they weren't.  You can bet damn well that I fucking miss the good times I had with them.  But they're gone now--out of my life because I pushed them away.  I did that because they made me feel shitty, but at the same time it also fucking sucks being lonely.  I'm sure you feel just as awful right now as I did back then because of this catch-22.

So how do you fix things?  How do you get to a better state of mind?  You accept it.  She doesn't want to be your friend right now.  You've tried your best to fix it, but you just pushed her too far away this time.  Now is the time to focus on yourself instead of that failed friendship.  Maybe you'll be friends again in the future, but don't bother trying to force that future now.  Find something that will make you happy again.  You might be thinking right now, ""She (or my friends) makes me happy,"" but that's wrong.  Right now she's making you sad.  Forget about her and **find something that makes you happy**.  Learn to dance, focus on finally getting a decent job, whatever.  Get yourself and your life back in a good spot.  *Then* you can try to make new friends and this time you'll know how not to lose them--how to really appreciate them despite their flaws.  You'll have learned to forgive them.  If you're in a happier place, forgiving them will come easier.  It's all about learning how to be happy again.  First with yourself, then with others.

Edit: A few things to hopefully make the message clearer.  And: You'll get through this, buddy."

"Hi. I work at a gym/swimming pool leisure centre. Shit like this is extremely serious as you're aware. I'm really late to this thread but I'll throw my two cents in:

1. Chances are they won't know who you are as you're relatively new, and probably won't be able to identify you unless your membership has photo ID. Or, whether anyone could recognise your name from whoever signed in that day. Saying this in case you think the police might just show up at your door lol. Relax on that.

2. They will DEFINITELY remember your face though, so don't rock up again at the pool pretending everything is fine.

3. My best bet would be arranging a meeting with the manager so that you can explain what happened. It's the lifeguard's word over yours otherwise and they'll probably ban you outright if you don't get your side in. Perhaps bring in the swimming shorts to show them and explain. I can't say whether this'll stop you getting banned, but it looks better on you to do this than just creep off, because that's what an actual pedophile would do.

I think that doing this may salvage your access to the gym at least. The pool may be more difficult. I wish you luck anyway as it's a tricky situation. I hope it turns out well for you

Edit: My advice is based on OP wanting to continue using the place, which it sounds like he does, based on knowing how my workplace would handle it. If he has legal concerns I'd advise him to speak to a lawyer first. Where I work we wouldn't push this legally anyway as we have no proof that he did this **intentionally**; the police wouldn't be able to do anything. "

"OP, at least your joke was temporary.  I was drunk one day and had the clever idea to get Gonzo the Muppet's eyes tattooed in a strategic location down there.  Thinking it would be the funniest thing.  

This was a horrible idea and two situations always occur.  Either girls ask about my tattoos and I tell them about them all and that I have an additional one that they'd have to get me naked to see, or I forget to tell them about it altogether.

""Why is this a horrible idea?"" You might ask.... Well the outcome when getting nakee for the first time is never all that good.  The last thing a man wants when a girl sees his junk for the first time is for her to crack up laughing at it.

One of the worst was when I completely forgot about it, and after going down on her she flips me over and starts making her way down to return the favor.  We are in my bed and all the sudden I hear her yell ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT??!?!"".  Forgetting all about the tattoo, I'm wondering to myself, ""what the fuck IS that"" as well, thinking maybe there is a bug or something in the bed with us.  So I rapidly wiggle myself away from her, accidentally kneeing her in the face, while looking frantically for something in the bed down between my legs asking ""WHAT IS IT?  WHAT?"".  And she just keeps saying ""that"" and pointing.  It took me far longer to realize what she was talking about than I'd like to admit, but we had a good laugh even though she got kneed in the face. She couldn't look at it without laughing and just hopped on me instead.

Proceed to go home and tell her how angry you would be in her shoes right now, that you'd be embarrassed in front of your boss, gutted at the expense and waste of your time, and that she has every right to be angry as hell over it.

Then you tell her what you should have done, that you know that now and next time you will not be a lazy ass. You will do next time what you should have done this time.

Tell her you love her very much and that you would never hurt her intentionally and that you really hope she can bring herself to forgive you when she calms down. End all of that with another ""I'm so sorry"" and hug her.

You will probably still have to listen to her tell you how angry she is. Listen. Don't defend your mistakes. Just empathy and contrition. Then more hugs.
