Could I do that?
Are you going to be bringing lawsuits against some of the websites that spread this defamatory information?
"Are you now, or have you ever been, a mass murderer?"
"Possibly.

Gateway Pundit misidentified the Charlottesville driver who hit the protester and is suing them. If you end up getting doxxed or harassed by idiots IRL then you probably have a case.

RIP to your reddit account tho fam, its gonna get nuked by QAnon idiots."
Feels the same old
"Seems Reddit should keep it's day job and give up on the whole cyber detective thing.

"Just wanna comment and say hi to the Gateway Pundit because they’re probably reading this.

how does it feel to not have committed murder?
I like talking to idiots

Truly the greatest minds of reddit. 
"from the gateway pundit story now:

&amp;#x200B;

 **UPDATE:** The anonymous Reddit user with the name “ravenchamps” wrote tonight on Reddit that he was not the shooter. We welcome him to contact us. "
T_D and other similar subs identified him as the shooter based on his name being raven(MD football team) and the shooter being from MD
have had 3 news sites ask for a phone interview. 
"I'm feeling great, time to grab the vodka "
Doesn't your account being active already disqualify you as the shooter on account of the real shooter being dead?
Sounds like they are super sorry about their error /s 
dumbasses
"&gt; and shut in NEET.

Extra points if you call yourself an incel in the interview."
"See if you can wrangle this into some interviews.  If you get harassed, you may even get a book deal."
"I'd leave man, right now. Call up a buddy and go talk it out at a Denny's or bar or something. Don't expect your money back unless you go through her parents either, if she's devious enough to cheat on you for months and sleep soundly next to you, she's gonna fight tooth and nail about the money. Leave a note too so she knows exactly why you're gone, she'll be reeling (maybe) which will give you time to think about your next move."
r/TopMindsOfReddit
you should really go chat with the people in the subs that are still claiming its you. That should blow their minds completely out of the water.
"The same guy that got James Gunn fired already has 20k retweets about your profile.

I hope you don’t work for Disney."
I was surprised how smart some people are to figure it out themselves that I'm not him.
"I read your post history (sorry), and realized we are similar and browse a lot similar threads. Started to think I was a murderer. Thanks for saving me from weird thoughts lol"
Not even a little bit. Me and my mom were the only two people who didn't cry at the funeral. In fact we almost broke each others hands squeezing so hard because the speakers were pissing us off. He was great at being fake towards people he needed. Life is far better now that he's gone.
Where you dude? Want to go for a beer?
I always knew it
"My name, like honestly that's the only argument "

Glad you're alive my friend. Karma's real. Did you stay in touch with your dad after that night?
"I think i'll fly out 1st thing in the morning and just disappear. Its her dad's birthday tomorrow too. 

Its a shitfest. And i dont know how am i gonna face the next few weeks/months. Fuuuucckkkk. "

"I was stuck with him up until he died (when I was 16, so 2 years after the gun thing). My parents were divorced, and I was week on week off, and when he was abusive he didn't leave marks so authorities couldn't do anything.
I was actually the one who called the ambulance when he got sick, and I rode there with him but in the front seat, I sat next to him for a couple hours staring at the floor not talking at the hospital, never went back and 28 days later he died."
"No problem, you vape?"
"Yeah he's awesome. I was hoping he was still awake so i could have a heart to heart talk about it than having to leave in the morning without an explanation... 

I was saving up to buy her a ring.. guess i dodged this one"
I'm doing my best with this!
"She hasn't treated you with the respect and loyalty you deserve - you don't owe her anything. It's doubtful you'll see the money, but stop supporting her immediately. She's on her own now, she's made her bed. You need to think about #1 now, put yourself first again. Leave, vanish, do something for yourself and escape the toxicity that she's created! You deserve better - you will be ok. x"
"Ah, a fellow loot hoarder."
How does it feel knowing you were misidentified? Does it bother you that complete strangers have been reading through your post history?
"Yes, it's just a complete coincidence how often they do this.

Someone assumed his reddit handle belonged to the madden shooter and a few news outlets ran with the story. Quite the shit show. 
If you want to fuck it up for her dont just leave. Write down the other dudes number and text him when you leave. That way she wont have support from you and not even from him ;)

RIP your inbox tho.
"What's really disturbing is a number of Trump-supporting commentators with a huge following just ran with it, reporting it as news on Twitter and elsewhere. I think a couple conservative websites even ran articles assuming that this guy was the shooter.

"--Username references Baltimore Ravens

--History suggests he lives in Maryland

--History suggests he plays Madden 19 frequently

It could have been literally anyone from Maryland who plays Madden 19. Which is probably like 20 people who aren't the shooter, and 1 guy who was. "
so give me some contact information you fucks
Not always.
What ‘proof’ did they have that you were the shooter?
I like the ones you get for free in Hotels. They smell like holidays and good times 
He could really play up the conspiracy theorist angle too.

"Aw man. First things first I'm sorry to hear that your missus is a total cunt. That's rough. Your freaking out a bit and quite understandable too. Breathe. Now, you need to move on and up away feim this bitch, as some one in a previous post said. Take the other dudes number. You might not use it but it gives you options when you have had time to clear your head. I would take pics/screenshots of the messages. She has complete deniability unless you have proof. Now you have all you need to move on. There are a few different ways to tackle this one.
1. ""The ninja"" - you disappear into the night and they never hear from you again.  Money is lost. No closure.
2. ""The Stinger"" - As above but you leave a note for the dad explaining the situation and putting it in as tender terms as possible about his daughter being a filthy cum rag. Also explaining the financial conundrum this puts you in. Dad might make daughter pay back money. No closure.
3. ""Tsar Bomba"" - You stay the night, wake and get ready. Hopefully you have breakfast at a table, with everyone together. Just as everyone is settling down, you explain that you can't stay to eat as you have been up all night and feel sick. The inevitable ""why"" will be retorted in the form of said messages. You apologise for having to drop this on the fathers birthday but you can't go on with this sham. You're hurt, emotionally and financially and you have already booked a flight home. She dies. The dad dies. Depending on the father you may get your money back. 
4. ""Silent Kill"" - You stay for the birthday,  you try your best to keep up appearances but explain you must leave straight after the party as something has come up. You allow the dad to enjoy his day and the following day forward all the messages to her dad and explain to other guy you were talking about marriage. She dies. Dad respects you for not dropping the bomb sooner. Other guy cools off. Chance of money recovery higher.
There are a few different connotations within each but I hope you find the one that works for you fella. Good luck man. "
I should do that
Pleeeeease sue Jim Hoft. You'll be my hero lol. There's some information on the existing defamation suits against him here if it helps.

"The only additional requirement in the process of a single person was that I had to be at least 25 years old... for some reason a married couple can adopt younger? Don’t know the logic behind that particular state law. As I wrote in another comment, nothing about the paperwork or interviews was any more difficult, but being matched with a child was more difficult because Case Managers preferred a dual parent household when they could get it. So, it ended up being about 13 months extra waiting before I met my boy.

When I started thinking about adoption, all my reasons were about me. I was ready to be a dad. I was financially stable enough. I had a big house with room for kids. I had spent years in childcare and teaching fields preparing to parent. Adoption was never something I had considered in my youth, but I started seeing signs (I believe from God) that it was going to be my path. And my decision was reinforced over and over as my family, friends, and colleagues supported me all the way through. As I started getting closer, I realized my reasons had changed. It wasn’t about me getting to become a daddy, but my kid having somebody to come home to every day. I saw my home as a safe place for him to grow up. I recognized that I can take all my experience and become the person who helps this kid through the trauma and anxiety of having been removed from homes. Everything I can do for him is so much more important that what I am getting out of it. "

Gotta live life happily. This definitely motivated me to kick bad habits and bitch ass “friends” out my life. But that blackness I explained, is scary as fuck.

Your logic with this is flawed.

&gt; Give him a ticking time bomb to deal with

He only deserves that if he already knows about (and therefor is ok with) it. If he already knows, then he already knows. It doesn't matter if you tell him or not.

&gt; He can give her a better life than i can

He deserves to know that the person he's trying to build a life with isn't faithful. If he wants to try and salvage the relationship after he finds out that's his right to try. If he chooses to end the relationship that is also his right.

If he doesn't know, you should tell him."
