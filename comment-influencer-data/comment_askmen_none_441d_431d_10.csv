"All right. Here we go. I'm basically a step dad to 13 year old twins who have rhyming names and are at each other's throats. For privacy, let's call them Mandy and Brandi.

I just had to address this issue yesterday so it's fresh asf in my mind. Mandy significantly better looking than Brandi purely due to genetics. This is a sore point for Brandi and her sister flaunts it in her face. Brandi found a boy in her summer program that she has a crush on. Said boy also liked Brandi and they would SC all day long, it was adorable. Mandy had her little boyfriend dump her before summer and went thermonuclear dramatic about it. Mandy didn't like that Brandi was getting attention from a boy when she should be getting attention. Mandy 'stole' said boy from Brandi by being a ho and sending inappropriate pics. We dealt with that STAT.

Brandi was rightfully mad. Brandi got even. Brandi put a used tampon in Mandy's shampoo bottle, did bad things to Mandy's pillow case, and put umami mushroom powder seasoning on the pizza in the fridge. Mandy has a severe allergic reaction to mushrooms. That's just the stuff we've found so far. We think there's more Brandi did because she's smug about it whenever we ask if there's anything else.

They're both grounded. Mandy also is pumped full of allergy medication and steroid cream.

"Holy shit dude, if she‚Äôs causing you pain you need to sort it out. But don‚Äôt tell her you haven‚Äôt told her, because then she‚Äôll start wondering about all the other things you aren‚Äôt telling her to spare her feelings.

Pretend you nicked it while shaving or something, then guide her on what to do since you‚Äôre ‚Äúin pain‚Äù and you‚Äôd prefer she do it a different way. This way, when she actually does hurt you, you can react and it‚Äôs an ‚Äúokay, try something else‚Äù attitude. Final step of the plan is to keep it going for a little while (week or so) and then just tell her you love the way she does it now and you don‚Äôt want it to stop.

But I‚Äôm a marginally manipulative piece of shit so maybe weigh the comments and figure out if honesty is the best answer too."

My dad should have plenty to say. But... I think time causes amnesia. I recently brought up how moody and horrible I was as a young teen and while my mom nodded and told me she thanks the lord I grew out of it my dad looked at me like I am crazy and said I was the sweetest girl ever.

""I miss my old 1976 Grand Marquis.""

""I hope the kids fall asleep soon because I want to get you naked and bend you over.""

"
"I‚Äôll add one more reason to the pile that I learned from another guy friend. They sometimes use the wife as an excuse to get out of things because they think other guys will accept that more than if they just say they don‚Äôt want to do it. 

I was good friends with both of them for all of my 20s and always thought she was a homebody that needed to go home early a lot. Then, I finally had one on one time with her on a trip and she said, ‚ÄúI think everyone thinks he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs extroverted, but I‚Äôm always up for going out and doing stuff and he just really likes to be pampered at home.‚Äù

I know some guys say they have relationships with their wives where the humor allows for calling them ‚Äúold lady,‚Äù but my parents always drilled into me that you never say anything insulting about your spouse in front of a group of people, even if it‚Äôs a joke. I feel like for most people this is a really good rule. Things too easily change from jokes to veiled complaints to actual griping. "
"Tradition 1: my husband makes me pancakes on my birthday. Every single year without exception. He doesn‚Äôt cook that much so it‚Äôs really special for me.

Tradition 2: Valentines -  if last year I organized our Valentine‚Äôs Day events then next year he organizes everything, and year after that it‚Äôs my turn again and so on. The one who‚Äôs turn it is to organize, has to get a gift as well and treat the other one like a princess/prince!

Tradition 3: we have a beautiful, hardcover journal and each year on our wedding anniversary we take a ‚Äúselfy‚Äù, print it, paste it in the journal and write something about another year spent together. It‚Äôs sort of a documentation of our life together."

"When my sister was in her teens she got busted for drinking and when she came home my dad and her got into a huge fight. I don't remember exactly what was said during the fight, but my sister ended it by saying ""I'm not sorry and I'm never going to be"" then storming off to her room. My dad was so angry he couldn't speak. You could practically see the steam pouring out of his ears. Years later I asked my sister about the fight and if she felt differently now. Her response was ""I'm still not sorry, and I'm still never going to be."" "

In fact, the only real difference I can see is that some women (who  seem to feel entitled and that they should get whatever they want) become very ballzy around me and are aggressively flirty. As you can imagine, these women are not the kind you want to be approached by.

On the bright side, girls are more willing to continue a conversation with me, which is great when I find someone I want to chat up!"

"Being attractive provides people an opportunity to focus on your looks rather than your personality. 

This has the interesting effect of them basically disregarding aspects of who you are as a person until they get pretty attached. 

Then, when they realize that they are not nearly as fond as who you are as they are of how you look, they start trying to adjust you, rather than adjust their idea/expectation of you or adjust to you."

"I'm attractive and I feel that since I am quiet people assume the worst, like they think I'm too good to talk to them or I'm an uptight snob. I actually suffer from social anxiety and it's hard for me to be comfortable around people so I clam up. The girls at work are attracted to me but I can't even talk to them without one of us falling for the other and it's just a mess. 

I won't deny that being attractive makes certain things much easier. I can get away with a lot thanks to my looks. I used to be fat and remember how people wouldn't give me a second look, they just don't care about ugly people the same way. It's fascinating. But life is not perfect, there are always going to be problems you face. I wish people wouldn't assume that my life is amazing because I can assure you it is not. "

"That looks are far more important than people want to admit. And by looks, I don‚Äôt mean genetically (although that helps).

Sister would always would pull stupid shit like sleeping around, getting drunk, high,  attempt bank fraud, etc. It was never her fault and we clearly didn‚Äôt care for her that why didn‚Äôt believe her. 

After years of this, one day we hear from her friends they want my father dead. Why? Because of what he ‚Äòdid to her‚Äô. Think told her friends he molested her, but god knows. I trust my father hundred percent, but that‚Äôs a horrible accusation to make. "

"Not a father but a brother to a really shitty sister. Well two shitty sisters but this story will cover one. I'm also the oldest by a decent margin so I was pretty removed from a lot of things.

For the sake of privacy we'll call my sister Holly. 

Holly had decided her senior year of high school that she wanted nothing to do with her family and everyone was beneath her. She had an attitude with everyone, constantly fought with her sister, absolute nightmare to be around. Nothing was good enough nor was it enough for her.

Graduation came around and she informed our mother she didn't want to spend a moment with any of us for her graduation and would rather go out with friends instead of having a party, going to dinner, or anything like that. My mom wasn't happy but agreed hoping this might make her happy and gain some ground on her.

Well Holly turned around and told her best friend's parents that her parents refused to acknowledge her graduating, wouldn't be getting her a gift, throwing a party, nothing. She was expected to get a job, move out, and she didn't know what to do. 

Bare in mind this is after she squandered a scholarship she got to school which would have paid her way by simply not filling out the needed forms on time to finish applying. Also my mom wasn't telling her she had to move out, just that she finally had to get her first job since she'd soon be 18 years old plus that she was graduating and college wasn't gonna happen straight away.

So Holly's friend's parents decide that not only are they gonna get Holly a graduation gift and throw her a party (by including her with their daughter) but they'd also let her move in with them so she wouldn't have to deal with the stress my mom was putting on her.

Holly moves out without saying a word. She left her dog behind that she had recently gotten because she wasn't house trained yet and was a major pain in the ass. She did trash her room and took what she wanted before bailing though she kept the cell phone my mom was paying for. She wouldn't answer calls from my parents, blocked them on Facebook, she just tried to disappear.

Fast forward a month and some change later and Holly suddenly moves back in without saying a word. When my mom approached her on the subject Holly told her they were never to speak of it and that she had moved on from their fight so my mom needed to get over it. 

Shortly after that she met a guy named Ryan (name also changed) who was a like almost 30, a convicted felon, meth addict, and just enough motivation to land himself in prison a few years later after fathering another kid with some other girl. 

Holly thought she'd show my mom what's what by moving in with Ryan and proceeding to let him knock her up.

When he bailed on her my mom stepped in to help Holly out by letting her move back in, getting her what she needed for the baby, and helping her every step of the way. 

Two years later Holly met some rich guy she ended up marrying, didn't invite anyone from her family to the wedding, made sure it was on the day her sister was going in for her c-section so she couldn't be there, and has pretty much disowned her family outside of her sister who tolerates her crap for some reason. 

Told my mom she had the worst childhood ever and she'd never forgive her. When my mom asked what she did Holly couldn't really remember anything beyond my mom got her clothes that made her look like a dork and we got yelled at a lot as kids (though she forgets to mention we got in trouble a lot and rightfully deserved to get yelled at). 

Kind of expanded past her being a teenager and into her being an adult but still it's been an insanely shitty course of things she's done all stemming from having a major attitude her senior year of high school."
Call her dude. Some girlfriends wouldn't like that as a 'cute' nickname. My wife doesn't care.
"Female companionship. The platonic intimacy that many women tend to share with each other.

I‚Äôm actually really lucky in this regard. Most of my friends and all of my roommates across the years have been women, so I get a lot of exposure to this, but it‚Äôs an experience I wish more men could share.

The dynamic is COMPLETELY different. The physical affection, the constant emotional concern and introspection, the lessened emphasis on externalized activity and the near-absence of constant competition‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not like these things are necessarily missing from all male/male relationships, or a feature of all female/female relationships, but it‚Äôs so much more common among women.

One of the biggest differences I noticed is that women dote on their friends. There just seems to be this instinct to care for each other. My female roommates always tend to be as concerned about my morning cowlicks as they are when I seem distant.

If it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm in some kind of emotional distress (or even elation), I will very often be asked about how I‚Äôm feeling, and summarily given a stage upon which to confront and handle my emotions. It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ freeing, to be free to explore one‚Äôs emotional state, instead of repressing and shying away from it. My stressors are acknowledged, my passions celebrated. People actually care about how I feel. I can only describe it as cerebral.

Conversely, male relationships so often feel like they have this sort of barrier to the heart, where each person‚Äôs emotional state is strictly their own business. No one wants to share or pry. It‚Äôs almost like emotions are treated as an inconvenience to everyone. The most you‚Äôll often get is a ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre feeling better, bro‚Äù, or an offer towards a distraction, like beer or video games. Rarely ever a direct confrontation of the issue, and even then it‚Äôs so often angry or tangy or dismissive (‚Äúyou‚Äôll get over it‚Äù, etc.)

The physicality, too. There‚Äôs just so much more platonic physical affection. Hugs, cheek/forehead kisses, holding hands and locking arms... It‚Äôs incredible how common these things are in platonic relationships with/between women. And the doting extends to this too; women are constantly fussing over my appearance and attitude, always wanting to make sure I‚Äôm presenting the best side of myself possible. It‚Äôs done wonders to my self-confidence; I‚Äôm pretty decidedly average, but I always know in the back of my mind that there‚Äôs always something I can do to make myself shine just a tiny bit more.

And for real, I get the sense that women just get a kick out of physical care. There was this one time I was helping a roommate dye her roots while we were both chatting about our days, and I entered what I can only describe as this sort of mutual-care zen. It‚Äôs addicting, knowing someone trusts you implicitly to make themselves physically vulnerable enough so that you can care for them. A connection forms there that I can‚Äôt really put into words.

I think most men lack perspective on the whole physicality aspect because it so often gets interpreted as romantic. It certainly explains why men rarely express physical affection with other men. And it goes both ways, too. I noticed that women tend to only get physically affectionate with me when they implicitly trust me not to make a move on them in response. The specter of romantic expectation is a huge filter that hangs over any potential platonic cross-gender relationships.

Everything I‚Äôm saying probably sounds hyper-exaggerated to any woman reading this, but‚Ä¶ I dunno. Maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm a guy who didn‚Äôt grow up like this, but it all feels magical to me. I feel incredibly blessed to be a part to this relationship dynamic on such a regular basis over the years. It‚Äôs something I really wish I could explain to my male friends, and the only ones who seem to really get an inkling of what it‚Äôs like are ones in relationships.

And hell, on that note, it‚Äôs my theory that this is a huge reason why men might seem so desperate for relationships. Our culture of masculinity has created a society where men are typically emotionally-deprived of a base level of affection and intimacy that‚Äôs normal for women. They think that the only way they can experience said level of affection is romantically, so they seek to secure a permanent source of it through a committed partner."

"I once went to lunch with my coworkers who are all female.  Somehow the conversation got around to discussing what levels of attraction are, and they asked me if I could ever date a man.

My answer was something along the lines of

""I'm attracted to the feminine form, so if there was a guy out there who looked like You or You (pointing towards the two skinnier girls at the table absentmindedly), then maybe I could date them"".

It didn't really cross my mind until later that I had unintentionally implied that I didn't think that one of the girls at the table was attractive.

So I guess it was more of what I **didn't** say that was insulting.

I apologized to her later, and she laughed it off. "

"I think the college experience does have value, but it's probably not worth six figures worth of loans. The relationships you build in college tend to last a lifetime, and those relationships tend to build the network on which we build our professional lives. It's also a great time for people to experiment and learn about themselves; college is the time where we have the highest contact with peers with the most access to adult independence. It's where I learned what I wanted to be and what I wanted to do and how to be an independent adult. That would have been delayed for me significantly if I had chosen to stay at home."
"How much about your relationship/SO do you share with your friends?

In some past relationships, I thought things were private between us by default but some girlfriends thought sharing everything with their friends was the default. Sexual performance, work, finances, health, personal insecurities and fears, family secrets, etc.  

Was uncomfortable with how much her friends knew about me. 

Edit: I really appreciate the thoughtful responses. Gave me lots of insights. "

"Bodybuilder here!  Graduated high school 5'6"" 110lbs.  31 years old now, same height, should be pushing 180lbs with a soft 6 pack here by the end of the summer.  I've learned a couple good lessons over the years.

- Diet is number 1.  Diet makes you bigger or smaller.  If you don't do any kind of exercise and eat over what you need - you get fat.  If you do exercise and overeat - fat and muscle.  Similar effects for under eating.  If you eat like a rollercoaster - expect your results to be like a rollercoaster.  Consistency &gt; accuracy....and that's the hard part.  I know roughly what kind of macros and micros my intake is every day now but I'd be lying if I said I know exactly.  What I do know is that I eat the same measured foods cooked the same way by me and if my body doesn't do what I want, I can adjust up or down.  

- Cardio makes a big difference but you don't need what I call 'murder cardio.'  Low intensity cardio like incline treadmill walking, cycling, stuff like that will still have major benefits for the average sedentary person.  And being low intensity it can be done every day...consistency!

- Keep modest expectations.  It's easy to read about someone who puts on 20lbs of lean body mass over 3 months of clean eating and lots of exercise.  There are so many unknowns there and then add in that everyone's body is different...it's easy to beat yourself up over not accomplishing the same thing others say they can do.  

- Enjoy it.  So many people do fitness as a means to an end.  They just focus on that end result and all of the work required to get there is *work*, therefor not fun.  Nobody who builds a racecar hates working on cars.  Novelists don't hate writing.   Carpenters don't loathe the lathe.  You really have to enjoy the work that goes into it.  One of the most inspiring things to me is that I know plenty of folks that can't do what I do.  I don't feel like it is my duty to do this because they can't - but when given the chance to do something that others can't...that makes it feel kind of special.  

All in all - it's a fun thing to do, to carve yourself a new you.  Don't beat yourself up over your progress but do be consistent, take your measurements or metrics of success, and keep working toward your end goal. "

We‚Äôve grown up looking at ourselves in a mirror for the majority of our lives so we are used to seeing ourselves that way.

"Most attractive women seem to have at least one dude in their lives texting them regularly who clearly has unreciprocated romantic feelings, probably thinks he has a shot, but isn‚Äôt quite in a proper ‚Äòfriend‚Äô category. This can include an ex boyfriend or a guy who‚Äôs been into her for years. None of this is really any surprise.

But what might be surprising is the frequency in which women text these dudes straight after they‚Äôve had sex with another guy, using the input of said guy to construct the text. 

It‚Äôs absolutely savage.

We've been doing it for about a year and some of the dates have been concerts, tasting menus, comedy/improv shows, professional sports games, couples massages, pottery classes, cooking classes, bowling, etc... it's a perfect balance because you essentially have 2 months to plan your date.

While we could do all of these things anyway, we always try to one-up each other when its our turn so its been a great way to make sure we put in the effort.

I see lots of guys wondering why they never get laid and the reality is there's a large incongruity between their behavior and verbal claims.

"Reminds me of an old [Dave Barry piece](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/420173/DAVE-BARRYS-GUIDE-TO-GUYS.amp) :
CHAPTER II

Contrary to what many women believe, it's fairly easy to develop a long-term, stable, intimate and mutually fulfilling relationship with a guy. Of course, this guy has to be a Labrador retriever. With human guys, it's extremely difficult. This is because guys don't really grasp what women mean by the term relationship.

Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.

And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: ""Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?""

nd then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want or isn't sure of.

And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.

And Elaine is thinking; But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . . . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?

And Roger is thinking . . . so that means it was . . . let's see . . . February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means . . . lemme check the odometer . . . Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.

And Elaine is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed - even before I sensed it - that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.

And Roger is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieving cretins 600 dollars.

And Elaine is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.

And Roger is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90-day warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the scumballs.

And Elaine is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.

And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it . . .

""Roger,"" Elaine says aloud.

""What?"" says Roger, startled.

""Please don't torture yourself like this,"" she says, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. ""Maybe I should never have . . . Oh, I feel so . . ."" (She breaks down, sobbing.)

""What?"" says Roger.

""I'm such a fool,"" Elaine sobs. ""I mean, I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse.""

""There's no horse?"" says Roger.

""You think I'm a fool, don't you?"" Elaine says.

""No!"" says Roger, glad to finally know the correct answer.

""It's just that . . . It's that I . . . I need some time,"" Elaine say.

(There is a 15-second pause while Roger, thinking as fast as he can, tries to come up with a safe response. Finally he comes up with one that he thinks might work.)

""Yes,"" he says.

(Elaine, deeply moved, touches his hand.)

""Oh, Roger, do you really feel that way?"" she says.

""What way?"" says Roger.

""That way about time,"" says Elaine.

""Oh,"" says Roger. ""Yes.""

(Elaine turns to face him and gazes deeply into his eyes, causing him to become very nervous about what she might say next, especially if it involves a horse. At last she speaks.)

""Thank you, Roger,"" she says.

""Thank you,"" says Roger.

Then he takes her home, and she lies on her bed, a conflicted, tortured soul, and weeps until dawn, whereas when Roger gets back to his place, he opens a bag of Doritos, turns on the TV and immediately becomes deeply involved in a rerun of a tennis match between two Czechoslovakians he never heard of. A tiny voice in the far recesses of his mind tells him that something major was going on back there in the car, but he is pretty sure there is no way he would ever understand what, and so he figures it's better if he doesn't think about it. (This is also Roger's policy regarding world hunger.)

The next day Elaine will call her closest friend, or perhaps two of them, and they will talk about this situation for six straight hours. In painstaking detail, they will analyze everything she said and everything he said, going over it time and time again, exploring every word, expression and gesture for nuances of meaning, considering every possible ramification. They will continue to discuss this subject, off and on, for weeks, maybe months, never reaching any definite conclusions, but never getting bored with it, either.

Meanwhile, Roger, while playing racquetball one day with a mutual friend of his and Elaine's, will pause just before serving, frown, and say: ""Norm, did Elaine ever own a horse?""

"Our issue is that Mandy got very pretty very fast and is having trouble dealing with the new attention from even 15-16 year old boys (not cool). She's been acting out for a few months and we really are trying to work with her to get through it without being destructive.

"This may sound weird, but be thankful when you miss someone who passes away. I recently had an epiphany after losing my mom: if she and I hadn't been so close, losing her wouldn't have been as hard.

"Oh they're pretty? That changes everything. 

Lol, I'm lying - so the fuck what if they're pretty? They are questioning your sexuality because their ego can't handle the notion that you simply don't want them.

They're hitting on you. You politely tell them no. They assume you're gay. This is the height of hubris and they deserve to be knocked down a peg or nine. You worry about being ""rude"" while they openly disrespect you for exercising your right to choose who you date (or don't date, in this case).

"I have been out of the dating scene for 15 years, and I never, ever plan on going back into it. I am very happily married and for some reason the wonderful woman that married me seems to agree with the sentiment.

Today is my 39th birthday and Im feeling chatty so here are a few stream of consciousness things from an Introvert who for some reason never had a problem getting a girl.

First, people in general can smell desperation, desperation drips off of you and maybe it is hormonal but there is nothing in the world less attractive than desperation. You could walk into a room smelling like last weeks trash and wearing your dead grandmother's clothes and if you were confident about it and true to yourself, you would fare alright. Nobody likes desperation, any ""Men on the prowl"" are deluding themselves.

Be active in SOMETHING, I don't care if it is chess club, coaching little league, being a scout volunteer or creating a paper airplane league and throwing paper airplanes around an open field at your college. Be active in something that doesn't involve looking for a date, ""picking up chicks"" isn't a hobby. Do something interesting, be something interesting.

Don't fall into the friend trap. You can be a friend, but don't be a puppy. If you make your intentions known, that you are interested in having a relationship with someone and they don't reciprocate... you can be friends, you can be friendly, but don't follow them around like a puppy in love hoping they will change their mind. They won't.

Most women that I have known that spend a lot of time on their appearance and that 'everyone is jealous of' have fractured and out of balance personalities. If their makeup is more of a mask, it is hiding a lot more than their face.

Everyone gains weight after highschool and college, especially cheerleaders, drill team, and girls involved in sports. Some never stop. I dated several really beautiful cheerleaders in high school and college, when the cheering stopped, and they weren't burning 3000 calories a day anymore... yea. Never ever date anyone based on their appearance alone, be happy with what is behind that appearance. 

A lot of women are amazingly over sensitive about their weight, more so than just about anything else. Even though weight isn't even close to a good indicator of health. They worry about their arm size, their thigh size, their muffin top... it is mentally exhausting for them.

Women never forget anything, ever. A girl will remember the obnoxious boy in 1st grade that made fart noises in class when she sat down in her seat. She will remember the boy that laughed when she tripped on the stairs in 3rd grade. She will remember the time that her best friend in 5th grade liked the same boy she liked and got to kiss him first. Seriously, women never ever forget anything. Also, if one of her girlfriends asks about you... be aware that the woopie cushion you put under her butt on the school-bus in 5th grade is going to come up on conversation... when you are 30.

Women are just as interested in sex as men, and probably think about it just as often. But they are generally FAR more selective.

When you meet a girl know her name, and don't forget it. I have literally been naked in the back of a pickup truck with a girl and had her ask me her name... Thankfully, I remembered it. ;)

Women talk about everything, and most are secretively in constant competition with each other... ESPECIALLY friends.

Most women's restrooms especially in nicer places have couches. It's fucking amazing.

For the most part, women are all the same from the neck down. I know that sounds silly, but honestly it is something to remember. Fall in love with a girl for her face, her eyes, her personality and her spirit. That is what matters.

I found this out as a 'friend' as opposed to first hand, but If you ever cheat on a girl, ever, know that you will always be known as a cheater. Even if the girl cheated on the guy first, even if it was a horrible relationship, whatever. It doesn't matter. Girls talk, and will totally abandon a guy if they find out he is a cheater. You might as well wear a dead goat's head around your neck if you cheat on a girl in a small town, a college, a high school or any other closed environment. 

Gossip ain't no joke. for the female of our species, gossip is an art form. It is the political game by which the girls, girlfriends, women, wives and friends run the world. They are the master of it, be the subject of it as little as possible.

Secretly get a paternity test before you sign a birth certificate. Always, even in the most healthy and happy relationship in the world. Women have all the power when it comes to children, protect yourself and don't ignore the onesidedness of our legal system. Always get a paternity test, they are cheap now, and she never has to know about it.

There are a GREAT many women out there who are and will ALWAYS be looking for 'the next best thing'. AVOID THEM, seriously. It is a personality fault and one that cannot be repaired.

This one is obvious, but 'never stick your dick in crazy'. Acknowledge that any time you have sex with a woman there is a possibility that you will have to deal with this person on some level for the rest of your life. If you haven't been around her long enough to know if she is crazy, you shouldn't have your pants off. This will save you from all sorts of problems, psychotic people, crazy husbands/boyfriends/ex-boyfriends, paternity, STDs, child support, getting murdered... seriously, never ever stick your dick in crazy.

You have absolutely no choice or say in the matter if she gets an abortion, even if you would take the baby and raise it by yourself. I will just leave that one alone.

A lot of women keep score in a relationship. You gain points by not being an asshole, you lose points by being selfish. Do the laundry, wash the dishes, clean up after yourself.

The best wife, is a companion, not ANYTHING ELSE, a companion. If you marry for any other reason, you will probably regret it. Crazy sex, beautiful body, money, power, friends, whatever... if she isn't someone who you can literally and seriously see yourself sitting on a porch when you are 90 years old laughing about some stupid shit that happened 50 years prior, then she isn't a companion, and you shouldn't marry her. Marry a life companion, someone to share your life with.

Women in college who recently lost a lot of weight are generally dtf, especially if you were nice to them when they were bigger.

If you ever are in a hot tub with two girls you like a lot, and 2 other guys... and things start to get hot. Don't let that opportunity pass you by... I will just leave that one alone too. 

Be nice, be polite, be respectful, but don't be a puppy. Don't ever, ever be a puppy. Women like to pet puppies, but they like to take men for walks.

Think of the children! Think about what sort of children the pair of you will being into the world, women think about it a lot when getting into serious relationships.

Mid to Late 30's single women, almost always want children if they don't have any. Be aware of that and don't waste their time if you aren't interested.

Self confidence outweighs looks, always. Be confident in who you are, what you are and how you are. There is nothing more attractive than someone man or woman who is self confident.

There is NO SUCH THING as 'out of your league'. I am a normal, average, reasonably looking guy. I have dated cheerleaders, models, band geeks, amazingly rich girls, the girl next door, actresses and any number of other 'desirable' women that people put on a pedestal. In the end we ARE ALL just people, the money, the looks, the bullshit piled on top is just that, bullshit. ALWAYS ask the woman out if you are interested, the worst she can say is 'no' and you can move on. Don't be intimidated by anyone, or anything else in her life, just ask the girl. 

When I was 15 I walked across a crowded dance floor, and asked a girl to dance, she was very, very beautiful, clearly very much out of my league or so I was told by everyone, but she was alone, and nobody was dancing with her. Intimidated I guess? So, I asked her to dance. We had a slow dance, and that was it, the next week at school she acted like we had never met, and that was fine, I didn't take it personally. But it turns out, (I found this out MUCH later) I was the ONLY guy that asked her to dance that night. This girl was a cheerleader, she was popular, she was beautiful, but I was the ONLY kid in school that had the balls to ask her to a dance. Two years later we dated for quite a while, it didn't work out... but it was high school, shit never does. 

I have a lot of stories like that, stuff I might tell my son one day, but the point is that seriously, nobody is out of your league. Be you, be a real and whole person, don't be a stereotype, don't be desperate or broken. Women have no interest in solving your desperation.

If you are confident in yourself, and are active in a social space, the women will come to you. There is really no reason to 'seek women out'. Women are not gazelles, they are not prey, they are potential life companions, be you and let them come and see if you are one too.

"We do a lot of semi-adventurous stuff all the time, but neither of us are big on birthdays/anniversaries/etc.  So for those kinds of things, we keep it small... our anniversary celebration is making dinner together as fancy as we can, each of us making the other person's favorite things.  It's small and sweet and perfect."
"It's weird. I am pretty confident in saying I have one of the healthiest romantic relationships among all of my friends, and we are IMMENSELY comfortable around each other, but I think that gives the impression that we are mean/abusive to each other. We will insult each other over almost ANYTHING. She makes fun of my gray hair and small butt, I call her fat and tell her I'm going to divorce her as soon as something better comes along. I will call her a bitch to her face, or to my friends behind her back. She'll say she's going to kill me as soon as she makes sure the life insurance is paid up.

However, I think all of this is just because, after so many years, we've realized how inconsequential words are. Our true bond is so deep that it cannot be expressed by such primitive means. There is nobody else that means more to me than she does. We're not even married yet, and she tells me EVERY morning in person or via text just how many days are left before the wedding (16, btw), and it's unequivocally the greatest part of my day, because it reminds me that there is someone in this world who is so excited by the notion of spending the rest of her life with me that it's the first thing she thinks of when she wakes up. I really can't ask for more than that.

I just don't think it would work between me and a woman who lets years of genuine affection get derailed by one comment about how wide her ass is."
Tell her what you enjoy vs what you don't.  Vocalize while she's doing it.

She was not the brightest crayon in the box, so she was completely flummoxed. She skimmed by in life on her looks alone. I compensated by doing well in school. I went to college; she didn‚Äôt. I wanted to make her look like a loser, and I think I did. She died from ALS five years ago, and she was still mean to me until the very end.

News to me üòÇ

I don't actually think most women have that knowledge. At least with the vast majority of my female friends, they don't actually think that too many men are into them. I recently had a conversation with one of them who is extremely attractive, even objectively speaking. She was legitimately worried that she wouldn't find anyone who was attracted to her. Many of my other friends have expressed similar sentiments. If anything, they *lack* confidence and are generally insecure of how they look.

Then again, this is just anecdotal. Perhaps I just have a really insecure friend group, but I've seen this with a lot of women I've interacted with. There's definitely a few who are hot and know it, but for the most part it seems like they don't recognize that guys are into them."

"This. I never had an issue with my husband playing tennis in multiple leagues until i found out he was using it as a way to meet women and would ask them out to dinner on nights i was working. But it turned into him telling all his friends that I wouldn‚Äôt let him play tennis. He still plays. 

Same with cars. My husband is irresponsible as shit with money. He‚Äôs gone through a shit ton of cars bc he gets ‚Äúbored‚Äù or wants the next new thing. But he tells his friends that i won‚Äôt let him have nice cars. So at a company work get together, a guy came up to me and asked why i wouldn‚Äôt let my husband be a car guy...there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. Like, really?? "

"I've been told I'm attractive and have a nice body often (thank you dad and uncle for taking me rockclimbing since before puberty). But there has been a period when I was very sick and needed to take medication for a few years that made me gain weight and bloat a lot. My face became chubby, I got a slight second chin and even mantitties. Because of that I took care of myself less and didnt't look very appealing.

The difference in how both men and women treat you is astounding. It made me sad as fuck to experience that knowing there's people out there that are treated like that constantly for really no reason."

"Sometimes I feel like a lot of people on here are posers.

Why come on a site with thousands of other people with thousands of different opinions if you don‚Äôt want to be open to them and why censor your own opinion just to please a bunch of people you don‚Äôt know. Personally if I was asking for advice or opinions I want the truth not some vanilla, perfect world politically correct answer. Tell me how you really feel. I‚Äôve said some shit that can be viewed as inappropriate on here and other communities and I‚Äôve been down voted for saying something that wasn‚Äôt PC but it was the truth and I respect the ugly truth more than I respect bullshit."

"The *exact* same philosophy applies to depression; if you try to ""get back to healthy"" in leaps and bounds you'll fail and will consequently get discouraged. If you make literally embarrassingly small goals, though (ones so small you have zero excuse to not meet them), then you'll make steady (if slow) progress.

I think of it as like climbing a ladder vs walking up a ramp; the ladder is quicker, but a single slip means catastrophe. The ramp is much slower, but a single slip is hardly the end of the world and is *way* easier to get back up from."

"I am a young adult in their twenties who wasn‚Äôt a teenage girl long ago. My poor dad, here we go‚Ä¶

My parents told me they could only afford in state tuition for college. But I absolutely insisted that I had to go out of state. Luckily, I did get a good scholarship, but it was not the full price of out-of-state tuition. So basically I‚Äôve always been the most costly kid (not even including my two high school drinking tickets) 

My junior year of college I wanted to borrow my dads new Scion FR-S. I mean this thing was absolutely spotless, still smelled like new car. I just wanted to look cool up at uni and at my new job, and maybe drive faster than I can in my jeep (that he bought for me). He let me borrow it for one weekend. I went to my new job at a Japanese restaurant on my night off in the car to eat dinner and see my friends/coworkers. That was the first time I ever tried sake. I had like, two of the smaller?containers of sour green sake with some soup. Being both an idiot, as well as blindly ignorant as to the strength of sake, I decided it was totally fine to drive home less than 1 mile away at 8:30 PM

A car swerved in my lane to attempt to lane switch with out checking, I swerved out-of-the-way but then over corrected and ended up sliding up against the side of their car at the red light. Somehow their car had essentially no damage, but of course the entire side of the Scion was dented and scratched. I hit them, as the police report stated, at 5 mph. I was told that had I not been any inebriated I would have not been the official cause of the accident, but that didn‚Äôt matter because my dumb ass gave consent to breathalyze.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: the other car was a young black couple and the female on the passenger side was pregnant. She did not appear pregnant what so ever but apparently she was. Even though the ‚Äúimpact‚Äú was essentially non existent and from the driver side not passenger, and even though an ambulance came to check them out and take the girl to the hospital upon her request. Unsurprisingly they later threatened to sue for injuries. In addition to my dad paying all the lawyer fees, the damages to his and their car, he also had to pay each passenger somewhere around $10,000 each to settle. I am not actually sure how this works myself, and I think neither did the Young couple, as they still tried to initiate a real court case with the damages of up to $250,000 for their pain and suffering. Good thing she went to the hospital though, because my lawyer was able to find official documentation that no one was injured and there were zero complications related to a 5 mph accident.

About a year later with a very expensive lawyer and my dad standing next to me in court,the judge was able to see the great deal of compensation the other party received and all other details (Low BAC, no past record, obvious remorse from me) so he graciously decided to dismiss my DUI and re-write a ticket for reckless driving. My dad took me to breakfast afterwardüò≠This entire experience fills me with so much shame, I cried so much and offered to quit uni to help pay, again and again but he refused. He doesn‚Äôt even want me to pay him back, he says he just wants me to learn from it. Ever since I have made an ongoing effort to be the best person and especially daughter possible because I have the best dad in the entire world and I don‚Äôt deserve him in the least.

TLDR; made a lot wreckless and expensive mistakes from 15 to 20. Some dads are worth their weight in gold. Not only for financial reasons, but for putting back together their daughters when they fall apart.

Also kids: Even if you are incredibly close to home, even if it is before 9 PM, even if you are driving and feel fine, please DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE"

"Man, I barely know how to deal with it myself. One of my best friends and old roommates died suddenly 9 months ago. He was one of my groomsmen and I was one of his. 

It sucks. It was the worst day of my life when it happened. It still hurts every day and I still think about him all the time. Wanting to text him and talk to him. It hurts a little less each month. 

Keep talking about him with your mutual friends and his family. Keep his memories alive. Tell stories and share memories. 

My other friends and I met up with his parents and walked around our old campus and shared memories. His parents appreciated knowing how much we cared. 

Keep his memories alive. Cherish the time you had. 

I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. "
"18 times. I was in my teens and asked to house-sit for a family friend. They had *all* the adult cable channels, and at the time it was still the era of dial-up internet where I couldn't get a fucking picture to load in less than a minute.

I jacked off everywhere in their house. Bedroom, living room, dining room, hot tub, kitchen... By the end of it, sperm didn't even come out anymore. I just felt a numb ""rush"" like a heroin junkie snorting ibuprofin pills. My penis was scabbed and raw for a week or two.

"Single Mom groups can be vicious once the pack focuses on a single target.  Especially if you have your youngling with you.

Oof

"Trying to be totally transparent here as I feel like knee-jerk reaction is to vehemently deny any attention seeking behavior, but as a single girl, part of my motivation is to show off a little for guys. I work hard for my body and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm not getting some acknowledgement for that.

Some girls hate when guys look (or at least guys they aren‚Äôt attracted to), but I feel genuinely flattered when I notice a guy checking me out as long as it isn‚Äôt creepy stares that start to make me feel vulnerable. A quick glance or smile is a huge confidence booster and makes me feel good about myself."
You can change that in your life if you have good friends. My friends and I are open with one another. We talk about our feelings and offer each other support. 
"I once was going to sleep with a girl, and it somehow came up that her mom had her at 15. Thought, no big deal, shit happens. The mom was on BC, dude was wearing a dome, and he pulled out. I turned around and dropped her off, not dealing with that super fertility. "

Read an endless stream of dark/angsty books. Would lose her shit on me in short order, and small issues literally turned her physical on me (hit me in the face a few times, scratching/grabbing). Argued abouot everything, always wanted to be right and would be emotional to the point that even if she was dead wrong she'd get her way through tears/screaming. Her and her friends always talking shit on their own supposed best friends, bullying people, etc.

Yeah honestly she was (from what I understand) bad for a teenaged girl."

Also, how the fuck did y'all figure out a web browser but can't figure out the difference between YOUR and YOU'RE?"
It has to be a package deal.  Attractive without being an extrovert isn't worth that much.  Girls I wouldn't date crush on me but that does me no good.  Like right now I know of 5.  But being reserved and attractive means averagish girls assume your not interested and hot chicks still require you to talk them up and win them over.  My way less attractive friends date circles around me.  I also own a business and have the nice cars and house which is useless to me in the dating scene.  If I could trade some looks for being less reserved and self conscious it would go a long way.

Like in the 1970s in the Netherlands there was some discussion about whether all the suits for the politicians were really needed and they said ""Yes! you leave your individuality at home because the cabinet speaks with one voice and has no individuality!"" and okay, I can see that symbolism.

But then female members started joining and they were magically not held to that standard.

Like what is [this shit](https://cdn.prod.elseone.nl/uploads/2017/10/ANP-53902678-2048x1220.jpg?1) how can you even begin to justify this? All the males in the same exact black suit and tie and all the females practically walk in normal dayware. What is this supposed to symbolize and express? This is a country with unisex conscription, without gender registration on driver's licences and birth certificates and it's still this pathetic.

You either say that everyone can dress as they please or you put them all in the same identical uniform but this whatever this expresses is absurd."

Just make her feel wanted and seen. Talk to her. Ask her to to stop pushing you and tell her how pushing makes you feel. And then you start making actions out of your feelings. Touch her more, compliment her more, initiate. "

 I wish I was so inundated with attention on OkCupid that I didn't have the time to reply with something articulate and thoughtful. I wish dating felt like a buyer's market. I wish all it took to get validation in my ability to attract was for me to put myself in a girl's intercept trajectory.

Then again, there's a downside to all of those things... I'd probably be more vane if I always used my body for attention. And tons of attention from women would probably lead to a comfort mindset which would undermine my drive for self improvement. Being a dude has it's upsides. "
That's extreemly awkward. Imagine if the genders were reversed and some guy was trying to push his son on an attractive girl.

"I was put on birth control for too frequent periods around twelve years old. I found out 14 years later that no, I'm not naturally severely depressed and anxious. It was the birth control. No one ever told me that could happen, so I thought maybe no one has told you either. Birth control is great at some things, but it can have really hard to see side effects. "
"This is exactly me and my girlfriend.  

Back in 2010, she got a job where I worked.  We became friends and got really close.  Feelings grew for her and since I knew she had a boyfriend, I knew nothing could happen.  I didn't want to be the guy that wished her heartbreak so I could have a chance.  At the same time, it's hard for me to be friends with someone I'm really into...and I was really into her.  So, we had a falling out, I met someone new, and she eventually left our office for other reasons.  

As the years passed, I never really could get her out of my mind, even while I was dating this new girl, as shitty as that was to say.  We pretty much lost all contact for about 5 years.  The one thing that always stuck out to me was even though we hardly spoke after such a long time, when she changed her phone number, she gave out her new number to people she only wanted to keep in touch with...I was one of them.  

Sometime in 2016, we randomly reconnected on a random night out with mutual friends.  We caught up and kept in friendly contact...often.  My girlfriend and I ended up breaking up (for other reasons) and her and her boyfriend then were already pretty rocky and eventually broke up.  We were there for each other and after some time, things just kind of fell into place, and here we are today in a happy relationship.  We can't get enough of each other and this is the one relationship that I hope goes the distance.  

I'm glad we had that friendship base and already knew each other when we got into the relationship.  It just made things so much easier for us."

"Lol I think it's funny. She just doesn't apologize when she doesn't feel she owes an apology. She will apologize when she sees that she's in the wrong. I don't remember all the details of this incident, but for whatever reason she doesn't feel she owes him an apology and I'm inclined to trust her (though they both probably could have been much more tactful.)

As I said above, she is incredibly accomplished. Works closely with some of very powerful, very difficult people and it doesn't phase her at all. That uncompromising attitude she had as a teenager has translated into massive career success in a cutthroat industry.  "

* If you work in an open office or otherwise have people regularly passing your desk, always have an excel spreadsheet or word doc opened up so that you can quickly click to it to make it seem like you're doing important work. 
* keep a fake to-do list posted and occasionally cross some things off
* make sure you develop a good ""frustrated"" face because work is such a stresser
* find pdfs of interesting/educational books to read.  It gives the appearance of actual work on your screen and you actually do something that passes the time and perhaps provides a useful new skill
* don't keep a messy desk, but make sure you have stacks of important paperwork
* Not so much a cubicle hack, but always have one long term project you initiated that no one actually asked you to do but sounds like a good project that makes you seem like a self-starter. Whenever someone asks what you're up to, you can point to this project to seem busy all the time, and since no one asked for it, there is no deadline so it's always ongoing and actually can appear like a huge amount of work

"When I was a kid I liked my dad more than my mom, because my mom was always yelling at me and he wasn't.

Yeah.  Because he was never home and never interacted with me.  He would work late and come home and read the paper and watch tv and go to bed.

My mom was kind of a bitch but she actually bought me clothes and at least made sure there was food in the house even if I had to make it myself.  She fucked up a lot but she actually did some stuff.

When I got older I realized that I was focused on the fact that my dad was NOT pissing me off but not noticing it was because he WASN'T THERE.

Kids are dumb.  They'll just ASSUME that the parent that actually does some shit is just supposed to (which is actually true) but they think that means they can take it for granted and not be grateful.  Whereas the parent that is never there, if they do one fun thing, they think ""Wow that parent did something nice for me and they didn't have to!""

No, teens just have low expectations of their shitty or absentee parents.  Because they're dumb.

Hopefully they grow out of it.

Not all do."

I mean, gigantic. If you‚Äôre an asshole or an idiot, you‚Äôll still lose in the end. But you‚Äôll get far more chances at it. First date didn‚Äôt go great? Doesn‚Äôt matter, just be nice to her in text and she‚Äôll meet you again because you were ‚Äúprobably just nervous‚Äù or ‚Äúwe were both really tired‚Äù or any other rationale.

"Both. Some guys are terrified of displaying any weakness and of showing emotion. 

However, a lot of women are very honest about being absolutely disgusted by men who complain. So it's not like men don't have any reason to be careful about opening up. A man who is open about his emotions really has to own it. I've heard how women talk about men who are perceived to be complaining - it's not nice. 

My experience is also that people have a very hard time accepting that you can suffer hard times etc if you're a genuinely confident, assertive and fun guy. It's like the cognitive dissonance is too much sometimes. "
