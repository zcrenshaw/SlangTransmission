1,‚ÄúOk that‚Äôll be 50k‚Äù
2,"Had this happen the day my husband asked for a divorce. 

I was at work, he told me via text, but because I was helping customers, I hadn't read it. Next thing I knew, he was walking through the door and he sat his wedding ring down and said, ""I'm done"". Right in front of the customer. 

The customers response? ""Can't we keep the drama for at home?"" 

Like, okay, I get that it could have happened elsewhere, but I had zero control over it. "
3,"No. The kids parents did it to him. They knew about his epilepsy. they should have asked/looked it up before even starting to shop for vr stuff.

you are in no way to blame."
4,"""Those glasses look like they will suit me""

""What do you mean they're not the right prescription. Change them peasant!"""
5,"What about the one where the customer demanded a purse from last season, and the manager went into an employee's locker and sold hers, then claimed it was 'company property'. Or would that be most insane manager?

Edit: The tale was on Notalwaysright.com. Someone has posted the link below!"
6,That dude thought he could get a discount by taking the wording literally. He knew exactly what he was doing. 
7,At least she had the receipt? 
8,Well at least you'll be rich if it happens
9,"SEND ME MY SON'S HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS. I PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO SEND MY SON TO YOUR SCHOOL, AND IF I WANT TO DO HIS HOMEWORK FOR HIM, I WILL.

Something like that?"
10,She wanted honeycrisp apples for the price of gala.
11,In cash please.
12,"I was on the other side once. The cellphone of a cashier rang while she was helping me and she made a very difficult face.

Me: It's probably important, just answer it.  
Cashier: Y... Yeah, I should. Oh, God...

She answered, and I could see her heart breaking when she said ""please tell me she isn't dead"". The poor thing started bawling right there. It still makes me tear up when I remember her face. She was probably not thinking straight, because she walked around her till and hugged me, and I tried to comfort her even though I didn't know what was going on. 

Eventually, another crying coworker helped her walk to the breakroom, while her manager finished ringing me up and explained that her sister, who was friends with nearly everyone in the store, was in a car crash the day before. My heart sank. To this day, I can't go to that store without feeling down.

I'm so sorry for your loss, and if I was in your place or anywhere near that customer, I would punch her in the guts."
13,Oh that is terrible! I'm so sorry this happened! You would think that the customer would at least check if you were ok. Hopefully you are onto happier things now
14,Oh that texture must have awful ‚òπÔ∏è
15,The real satisfaction is no matter how hard they try to get your goat the nicer you get. Pissing on their camp fire with a smile.
16,I didn‚Äôt know rotary phones had email. 
17,"Ugh hate those types. ""I know how much you pay for this. So you must sell me at that price!"" That's not how this works."
18,"Had that happen to me. They tried to push out my (expensive transition) lenses before I took them back.

They got mad when I said that we didn't have my frame in store because I bought mine elsewhere and two years ago."
19,"It was grandparents...I'm guessing that the parents had no idea this was happening. Kinda like how grandparents like to ""test"" allergies because they ""didn't believe it was that bad!"""
20,"The power of the Internet is in your favor.  

If the owner gets upset, just say that you were thinking of their best interests.  They do *not* want a viral video of this awful person ranting being seen as accepted within their establishment.  If that was recorded you would be the one in the right and that is what they need."
21,"""I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle."""
22,"The answer is this.

""If you know how much I pay, and where I get it.  Just go buy it from them.""

Cust: I can't, they won't let me.

""Then buy it from me at the retail price."""
23,1996 was 22 years ago? I wish I wasn‚Äôt reminded of that. 
24,"In my 10 years experience in retail, I find that most customers don't think of you as a person with feelings and a life outside of the store. Of course, that doesn't go for everyone! "
25,I can't imagine holding onto and keeping up with a receipt that long. I wonder if she does this with everything and how cluttered her house may be. 
26,"Not your fault at all. If the kid had epilepsy, he's (and his caretakers) doubtlessly encountered the warning inside almost every video game box that warns about the potential side effects. If they didn't make the connection between the video games and the headset, that's their fault. It probably wouldn't have killed him, but there would have likely been a very scary ride to the ER for him and his family."
27,Tell him to try that logic with his loan payments.  I‚Äôm sure the bank wouldn‚Äôt see difference either.
28,"Fucking baskets, Karen!  Use one!"
29,I mean he probably thought it was hilarious and you brightened his day so I wouldn't worry :)
30,"I was the supervisor that received a phone call from the husband of one of my cashiers. He warned me ahead of time that he had to tell his wife that one of their dogs had passed violently and suddenly (hit by a car that didn‚Äôt even stop). My dog is my baby as well, so I completely understood. 

I brought the phone with me and apologized to the customers in her line that the lane was closed before I handed her the phone. I will never forget her wail. I had planned to take her to a back room to let her regain some of her composure before she took the call, but that didn‚Äôt happen. Obviously I told her to go home and take care of things, even though she protested she could stay. 

Her reaction on the phone was heartbreaking. She literally fell to her knees and sobbed and I took her work things and told her to go home. 

I don‚Äôt understand how customers can be so unsympathetic. We got lucky and no one threw a fit about her behavior. I would have ripped into them if they had. "
31,"Ah, but you're thinking like a normal, sane, person. Two qualities usually lacking in the customer species lol and what compounds their delusions is spineless managers, sorry to say."
32,Businesses exist to make a profit. Quite the revelation.
33,"Jeez I can't imagine that customer's thought process. It's like at a clothing store ""oh can I buy your underwear since the store doesn't have my size?"""
34,"""But what am I going to do with the other 999 units that I don't want?""

&amp;#x200B;

""I dunno, maybe open a store and sell them at cost price."""
35,I hope the return was denied for being a biohazard. 
36,"Don't see a reason why you would get in trouble. You did not bring the conversation to hand, you were polite and she kicked off and began yelling and hurling insults. Fully within your rights (and most shops would encourage) removing a disturbance."
37,[testing allergies you say?](http://archive.is/sgat4) TW: dead kid story
38,I would have been fired that day.
39,"The all-time favorite:

Customer brings up a $9.99 item.

""All right sir, it's going to be $10.69.""

*Genuinely angry* ""Woah woah woah there son...the tag on the shelf said $9.99!""

HOW THE HELL HAVE YOU SURVIVED TO MIDDLE AGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT TAXES ARE A THING?!?!

Edit: I know most other countries include tax on the listed price, but the fellow in question (I saw this a few times, but the first instance stuck out the most to me because I was taken aback by it) had a *very* strong regional accent (I was living in the US northeast at the time), so he had been in the area for a number of years at least "
40,"Thanks. Happened over 6 years ago and life has definitely improved. Unfortunately, still at the same job but thankfully never see that customer anymore. Haha."
41,I think you meant ü§¢
42,"Only 50k?  Hell, I'd be demanding at least twice that.  Going to need at least some to cover the cost of a new ring, and may as well set myself up with a nice little nest egg to invest for retirement while I'm at it."
43,"Aww, that's a good thing you did. "
44,"Pretty accurate, to be honest..."
45,She wanted to see the policy for why you wouldn't take another stores coupon? God people are out of there minds.
46,Not always right https://notalwaysright.com/getting-that-purse-was-a-steal/65547/
47,That really sucks and I‚Äôm so sorry those customers felt your family emergency was not important. I‚Äôm glad you did get to see her before she passed.
