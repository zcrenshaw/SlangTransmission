0,"Well, you are just a part of the store fixtures.  Not like you're an actual person or anything..."
1,People. What a bunch of bastards.
2,"Forgot the part where she tells her kids, ""come on, little Timmy. These mean people are why we can't do this thing I promised you!"""
3,"""That's all well and good sir but I'll need you to dig your own hole before I toss you in it"""
4,"You need to treat her like a regular customer.  

Custom order, they pay up front.  

If they want it delivered, there's a delivery fee.  

Order last minute?  There's a rush charge.  

Contract/Order agreements are a must.

If you want to be treated like a business, act like a business.

Disclaimer--&gt; Wife runs a wedding cake bakery and had started out 'at home' with family/friends.  She made mistakes early too.  Now, everyone is a customer."
5,"I mean it's really up to parents to control their children not you, unfortunately your paycheck doesn't cover childcare duties.

On damaging product at least she paid for it, it'll probably teach her to watch them more closely next time they're out shopping. People learn from mistakes not successes, so I think you did the right thing. "
6,"""Just because you're self-important, doesn't mean you're actually important. Also, poor planning on your part, doesn't constitute an emergency on my part.""

I love you."
7,I take being a robotic retail worker to a whole new level lol
8,"Later, the woman is audited. She says to the IRS agent, ""But there was a diamond ring in the box! The person who took my donation must have pocketed it."""
9,"In my experience, the cigarette customers are the worst. That being said, I'm not surprised but still disgusted, your managers at the time were awesome "
10,"If you had said something to the kids, she would have gone off on you. "
11,Do you feel the need to starting skipping and singing like dwaves from Snow White?
12,"Unexpected error occurred, please try again later

/s"
13,Am I the only one who thinks a bed that is so flammable it will catch fire if assembled with power tools is a horrifying safety hazard and probably deserves a negative review?
14,"This is literally how my workplace works, at any given day we can be managerless. No management in the building at all. Only same rank employees. If a customer gets snippy with us we kinda just play it up for the drama till the customer goes away. Usually both employees are in on it from the start however.

You're an awesome manager, look out for your employees and they'll look out for you. Doing a bad job makes them feel guilty as if they've let you down. Sometimes people liking you has more power than actual granted power. "
15,"At one of the libraries in the system I work for a patron had a medical event and passed out right in front of the circulation desk. One of the clerks on duty jumped over the counter to check if she needed CPR while another called 911. Right in the middle of it all the older woman in line behind the passed-out patron griped ""Well now who's going to check out my books?""

The guy who was attending to the unconscious woman said that incident was the closest he had ever come to just hauling off and slapping a patron."
16,"This is just the sweetest thing.

When my brother and I were little (he's 2 years older than I am), and he had a paper route, he would take down to the corner store where he got paid and he would buy me a freezie if it was summer or a warm bun if it was winter.

Brothers are truly wonderful."
17,Good job on standing your ground and not getting flustered.
18,She understood the difference between an eight dollar cushion and a twenty-five dollar cushion perfectly.
19,How *DARE* you not be able to predict the needs of this person you never saw before or again! I'd like to speak with your manager.
20,"As much of a waste of food that it is, safety should be the bottom line standard.

What really gets under my skin is walking around a grocery store and finding things left where they shouldn't be simply because someone was too lazy/stupid/uncaring to return it where they got it from, or give it to an employee and explain they've changed their mind.

It boggles my mind to find meat or fish in a canned good aisle, or produce in a freezer.  I would love to see those customers called out, or charged for the ruined product."
21,Love a positive story. That was incredibly nice of Sunglasses Giver
22,Next time just tell her she has to pay in advance
23,I‚Äôm a teacher and this year had a ‚Äúlittle Timmy‚Äù and his mom would‚Äôve said that and more.   Why do all Timmy‚Äôs have THAT mom?!?! üòÇüòÇ
24,Call your state/province labor board. They may be able to assist you with unsafe working conditions.
25,"When I worked retail, the first thing they told me was to lay the money on top of the drawer and don't leave it on the counter.

This serves two purposes: 1) makes it harder for the customer to grab it; and 2) you have proof of what the customer gave you when they question how much change they got.

As an example of #2: a customer buys a few small items and hands you a $10 bill, you give back $6.45 in change. The customer says ""I gave you a $50 bill"" -- you can now show him that it was just $10 and make him feel like an idiot.

Source: happened to me once"
26,"I worked in a bakery that had a cookie bar, and the number of parents that ended up buying 3-4 cookies because they weren't paying attention to their kids... "
27,I once asked a lady that was 43 for ID because she looked like 25...luckily she took it as a compliment 
28,You're absolutely right.
29,HOW DARE YOU TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY KIDS. I WANNA SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER 
30,"After the first non pickup of said item, i would have been asking for it to be paid in full upon ordering"
31,"They really are. I actually had a stroke at work a few years ago (and I'm only in my early 30s so that sucks lol) which is what caused my epilepsy so they've been there through my whole journey and seen how hard it's been. And yes I agree, most of the cigarette customers are pretty horrible, especially the ones going through withdrawal and want their patches!"
32,What posible gain did this batshit customer think they would get from that lie? Glad you have a supportive manager.
33,Did you see that ludicrous display last night?
34,Bahaha! I'm using this next time I have a seizure and people are trying to talk to me right after I come out of it lolol
35,"Bye ho. Bye ho.

It's off from work I go."
36,"I work in furniture, and get people asking if I'll buy their used furniture. I'm in the business of *selling* furniture."
37,Sounds like you need to take down the bulletin board and just watch her head explode. 
38,"I have a story that I‚Äôll comment here because I don‚Äôt know if a sub it will fit in...

I used to work as a plumber, and my crew was working in a gas station that was being built. 

The parking lot had just been poured, and the basic gas pumps had already been installed, but had no electronics or hoses. The two entrances were blocked off by barriers and caution tape. 

One of the guys got everyone‚Äôs attention, and I looked just as a woman stepped out of her car. She had worked her way past the barriers somehow, driven through the wet cement, and was staring at the pump trying to figure out what was wrong. She looked at her shoes, now caked with wet concrete, jumped back in the car, and booked it out the other entrance, leaving deep ruts the whole way... "
39,You know you're addicted when getting your drug is more important to you than a medical emergency.
40,"I was thinking about this book the whole way here, why don't you have it?"
41,I work in a busy public library that does a lot of programs for all ages. This encounter is so on-point I feel like I've lived it before.
42,"Right, Sir. I understand, Sir. Very Good, Sir. I'll see to it that the employee is taken out back d flogged.  Have a swell day, Sir."
43,"&gt;she needed done in a short time frame

""Short Time Frame"" should be the name of the new policy.  Ya know, because frames... Ok I'm done."
44,"My go to reply lately has been ""Sorry I ID anyone that looks under 30."" Most customers love it. "
45,"The parts counter at my local motorcycle shop got sick of people ordering things in and never picking them up (namely they would scattergun order them at multiple shops and pick up the first one that came in and leaving the others with parts they cannot get refunds on).  
  
When the pre-pay policy came in, i had been buying bits from them for years and there was never more than 5 days from being called and coming in.  
  
I lightly complained about it and the parts guy mentioned the above reason. I then admitted to him i must be too honest as that behavior never even entered my mind as a possibility. "
46,All I ever had to do was initial a card saying you donated something to us.  It was up to you to determine your stuffs value.  I now feel insanely lucky
