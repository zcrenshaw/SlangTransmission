0,"For those people I always tell them ""I have good news...""  Saying that you actually have good news usually causes them to be quiet so they can hear the good news you're about to give them"
1,"That's a smart operation, right there. Nice going :)"
2,LOL she fucked herself over
3,When I saw the title I thought this was going to go in a (ahem) gynecological direction
4,"If your explanation to her is always ""sorry we ordered it but you didn't pick it up and someone else bought it"" I think you could skip the step where you actually order the item.

The outcome would be the same.   "
5,He was trying to frame you.
6,"Wait a minute, you sold him a power saw that electrocuted him when he cuts through the cord? Are you TRYING to kill him!?"
7,"Bonus points if you say ""Good news, everybody!"" in a Professor Farnsworth voice. "
8,"At that point, you should have broken the news that perhaps her husband has been lying to her all these years ;)"
9,"They do it often in the UK. I used to work in a pub in a small town and we were one of 6 and all the landlords would message each other whenever they found out what was happening.   
One time my boss got the message and sure enough 10 minutes later in walks the teenager matching the description. Boss looked at him and said ""FUCK OFF"" and pointed to the door. He turned on his heels and walked out. "
10,"Ugh! My dressing room in a department store story is far worse. I was picking up a pile of clothing on the women's side and stuck my hand into something wet. It was some woman's used pad. I died a little that day. 

Seriously though, what sort of disgusting human being leaves a nasty used pad in ball of clothing? I didn't go to work prepared to worry about whatever blood borne diseases that trash human being felt like spreading to the greater populace."
11,"Pretty much.  There were ways to find the receipts even without her name, but it was one of those things that you could only do if you actually thought about how it worked instead of just blindly following procedure."
12,Imagine if some poor guy who looked similar walked in and experienced that 
13,With a customer like that I'm just gonna blindly follow procedure. 
14,I pocketed it and spent it.
15,Some poor kid who just turned 18 finally able to go out to a pub. Nervous as it their first time and immediately told to fuck off.
16,"She might have too many cents, but she's lacking in sense......."
17,"We have stupid customers like this as well.   Our PoS has a rewards system.  Customer earns cash back on certain products and can redeem against their next purchase.  

Had a customer contact us at head office and demand that we remove them from our database.  I emailed back and explained that if I did so, they would lose all their rewards (approx $75 on this account ) and did he want to use the money before I deleted it.  

Nope.  Account must be deleted immediately!  So I deleted him and confirmed it all back including that he understood his rewards balance was gone.  CC’d in his local store as well so they had a head up. 

Customer shows up in store 2 months later and is freaking out that he doesn’t exist in the system, he wants to redeem his cash.   Yada yada yada....

Poor casual staff member is practically in tears when I take her call. Luckily we do so few deletions that I remember him.    Got her to put him on the phone.  Confirms he was XYZ, and that he asked for his account to be deleted on date A. He agreed.  Got him to confirm he’d received the emails of the confirmation of deletion.    Yep he got them.   Then dropped the bomb.   His points were gone.  He knew and understood that at the time and there was nothing more we could do.    

He continued to rant and rave, but in the end he accepted it - cause he had to, he’d agreed to it - in writing.       

Moral of story.  CYA! 
"
18,"Does anyone remember when people just used to apologize for their mistakes and move on?

Something like this happened to me yesterday.  I went through the drive-thru of a chicken place I've never been to, ordered a two piece meal thinking it was baked (I was tired), my sides, drink, and everything, then noticed all the pictures were fried chicken.  So, I asked if it was baked, they said no they don't have baked chicken, I said ""okay, my bad"" and I pulled up and paid for my chicken.

I mean, you don't have to twist my arm to get me to eat fried chicken, but still...who complains that people in the service industry can't read their mind???"
19,People are nuts dude I say it ten times a week
20,"I like that you actually insisted she listen. The embarrassment will be good for her, rather than for her to go on the way she was."
21,That's a ton of gas stations for such a small town. My town of roughly 2500 has 1. 
22,"How can somebody be so dumb as to think somebody else's car is theirs.  I would know even if the two are identical.  I know what kind of tires I have, I know what stuff is inside my car.  I know the stain on my seat.  I wouldn't mistake another car for mine.  Crazy."
23,"one of those horrifying ""delivery"" cakes with high levels of body horror?"
24,[removed]
25,"Well duh. Obviously the store failed to do an IQ check on this guy before selling him power tools. 

100% OP’s fault for improper safety checks. "
26,"Omg, this reminded me... Many years ago I served breakfast at an airport. I live in a country where english isn't our language, but we learn it in school.

So one week a man from UK was staying, and every morning he'd order scrambled eggs. Every morning I made him fried eggs. And every morning he thanked me, politely and friendly.

Several days passed this way until I suddenly and horrendously realized what I'd done. That morning he finally got scrambled eggs, and was really happy.

People from the UK must be amazingly patient lol."
27,"This shows 2 things about you:

1) You care about people enough to provide help what I consider above and beyond to your customers at your job. 

2) You're a very caring person and I'm happy you shared this story with us random internet people. 

I'm a 38 year old guy who is married and never have been called a softie, but this story made my day. Thank you for what you did and for sharing. "
28,"Pretty much.  It was a fairly elaborate database with a POS system as the front-end, training was non-existent beyond the very basics, and because of these reasons almost no one I knew understood how it worked besides myself.  I had a reputation as being able to find almost anything in it, but I definitely didn't apply ""CSI detective"" (workplace joke) levels of effort for people who were like that.

Also, because almost no one knew how it worked, you could easily get away with saying you don't know how to do anything beyond the basics and not get in trouble, because chances were really high that the person who could get you in trouble wouldn't know how to do it either."
29,Honestly I think her embarrassment was a better reward than the $20.
30,"Just to play Devil's advocate: they are complaining about legitimate problems. If management had provided a decent quality replacement in a timely manner you wouldn't have had any complaints (about these issues at least, always going to be complaints). "
31,"If you buy XX.40 of food, you have to pay for XX.40 of food. And who does she think she is getting high and mighty over less than $20? Maybe if she'd just bought $20000 of food there might be a discount, but over less than $20 when she paid with a gift card that might not have even been purchased with her own money? That's nuts.... "
32,At this point in my retail career if someone cuts me off I just keep talking louder. It actually works pretty well.
33,"Y’know...if the cops are so strict that they’d actually punish someone for drinking *two hours* before they “officially” turn 21, then the issue is with the cops, not the stores, the cashiers, or the customers."
34,Probably wanted you guys to replace the car for her. How dare you have footage of her being an idiot?? 
35,[removed]
36,"&gt; We haven’t for maybe two years (I could be wrong. Probably longer).

It's been more like 5 or 6 I think. I've owned my shop for 4.5 years but I remember phasing out the penny when my shop was still under the previous ownership (and I was just an employee).

Never had someone get made at me for ""giving them too much change"" before though."
37,"This reminds me of a lady who bought a bag of expired nacho cheese by accident. When my co-worker had this brought to her attention, I offered to go grab another thing of nacho cheese for her. The customer was impatient and was like:

CL:""Don't grab another expired cheese! Check the date! Check date!""

Me: Don't worry ma'am, I will!

I go off, find the cheese and look for the freshest one to bring back to her. I bring it back to her and she's automatically like:

CL: Did you check the date? It better not be expired! I hope you know how to check an expiration date! It better not be expired!

Me: I do ma'am, I don't like grabbing expired products either!

CL: I don't believe you people (wtf?)! I'm gonna check myself!

She proceeds to check the package as if I'm some little child who just handed her something and she is examining it for something wrong. She then looks up at me.

CL: Are you sure this isn't the freshest? I want the freshest!

Me: I looked through all of them ma'am. This is the freshest...

By this point, her daughter who had been silent for most of the interaction, chimes in.

CLD: MOM, he works at a FUCKING grocery store. He knows how to check a fucking expiration date!

Finally the Cheese Lady shut up and finished the transaction while slightly red faced with embarrassment."
38,"Embarrassed she wasn't carrying any cash, doubled down with indignity instead of asking you to cancel one item."
39,"I was sure this was going to end with her demanding it for 30% off *instead* of 50% off, because ""50% off"" is clearly more expensive since 50 &gt; 30."
40,Yes. Never start “negative” as in “it’s actually” or “it was changed”. Start with good news as in “it’s cheaper now” or “it’s on sale more”
41,"I actually got into the wrong car once at the grocery store. Came out hit the unlock button on my key-fob, put my stuff in the backseat, put the cart away and got in. First thing I noticed was that it was very clean compared to my own, then the air freshener was different, there gloves in the car and I no longer had a bench seat. Quickly got out and looked around, after a couple seconds I saw mine a few cars down, grabbed my stuff got into my own. On the outside everything was like my car, same color, same factory rims. They just left it unlocked which if they hadn't it I would have realized what was going on."
