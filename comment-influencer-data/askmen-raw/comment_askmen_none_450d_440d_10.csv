0,"I work with kids in an elementary school.

One day I was standing in front of the lunch room, and I had to make the kids form a queue in order to enter the lunch room. In order to prevent the kids from rushing inside all at once, i usually play games with them to make them wait. Things like rock paper scissors, and other silly games.

That day I was acting like I was the bouncer of this very exclusive nightclub called : ""The Lunch Room"" and I asked each kid to bust a dance move for me in order to get in. Obviously, everyone could enter but they had to shake their body a little bit.

All the kids were playing along, making fortnite dances, and other popular moves like the dab, the nae nae, etc etc etc ... the most shy boys could do the robot, and the most shy girls could take my hand and i would make them spin like ballet dancers.

At one point it was the turn of this shy girl, who slowly walked toward me, looked at me in the eyes... Then cried.

She was absolutely terrified of doing this in front of the other kids and just cried. I tried to confort her a little, so I picked her up in my arms, and took her hand like we were dancing a waltz, then spinned our way into the lunchroom. 

Later that day she came to see me and asking me to dance with her again. I sure did. I taught her how to dance the waltz (the 3 step thing) and she had a blast.

I dont know if OP wanted a story about little girls because they cry a lot. But it was to cute not to share...

EDIT : Thank you for all your kind comments ! i'm sorry I cant respond to all of you but I love you guys and thanks for the sweet words !"
1,"I'll answer a general question with a generalized answer, because there will be exceptions. Women are convinced men like pursuing and making the first move. Many men actually hate it, and it's likely for the same exact reasons that many (most?) women hate it. Rejection sucks."
2,Vegetables expire alot faster when you're the one who pays for them
3,"Eat her out, foreplay is key"
4,"""Yeah you like that you fucking retard?"""
5,"I was too lazy to do the dishes so I took my box of cereal and gallon of milk.  

Took a handful of cereal, put it in my mouth, chugged milk. Ate the whole almost new box of cereal in one sitting.  "
6,"I think this is an unpopular opinion because I haven't asked any of my guy friends, but GOD do I hate long fake nails on a woman. They're just so ugly and tacky to me. Long finger nails is weird enough, but fake ones? They make girls look like witches, and they're super lame. Not even just long ones, fake nails in general.

It's not a deal breaker though. Just something at the back of my head I notice.

EDIT: First gold. Thanks bruh ✌🏾"
7,"I don't HATE my job.  It's actually really easy and I feel way overpaid.

But God.  The monotony of routine.  The same office.  Same fake ""Morning!"" greetings and ""Hey buddy (because I totally don't know your name still after a year), how was your weekend I don't give a shit about but just don't want to stand making coffee in silence?"",  5 days on, 2 days off, 5 days on, 2 days off, until you're dead basically.

Sure holidays are great, but they're 2 weeks away, what, two or three times a year?

Then back to sitting in traffic, getting up at the same time every day, same lunches, same leaving time, same daily reports, same same same same.  Trying something new feels great and lasts a while, but you inevitably sink back in to the norm.

It's soul-crushing.

[Edit] To quote Trent Reznor/Nine Inch Nails from Everyday Is Exactly The Same:

""I believe I can see the future.  'Cause I repeat the same routine."" "
8,"I wrote a letter to my father in law, thanking him for all the help he has given us over the last few years, and how grateful we were, not just for us but on behalf of our 2 year old daughter. He's getting on, and I wanted to let him know that his influence will be felt throughout my daughter's life.

I asked my wife to read it before I sent it, and I guess I made her cry through my incredibly correct grammar and syntax?"
9,"-If he opens the door for you to the passenger side of the car, reach over and open his door when he's going around the car to get in.

-Unless it's really extreme and becomes annoying, make sure to acknowledge that he's treating you well (IOW, if he holds open the door for you, say ""thank you"", don't just walk in).

-Don't act like his possession, act like his partner.  Example: you're clearly into the whole ""he's a Gentleman"" thing, and that's great.  Let's say you were at a bar, and some guy came over and started hitting on you when he was away.  Don't just sit there and wait for him to come over and ""deal with it"".  Tell the guy you're with someone and want him to leave you alone.

-Sort of going along with the 3rd point, don't put the onus on him to make all decisions, start all communications.  Text him and ask him out, call him because you want to talk to him, etc.

Everything else is just being a basic good human being.  Don't ghost him, don't lie to him, don't take advantage of his kindness, etc."
10,Don’t have any advice but be prepared to stop frequenting this place if it goes south
11,When she asked if she can get you anything else say “your number.”  And then do the finger guns.
12,"By sneezing in the audience of her flute recital... i didnt know her, but my sneeze distracted her and she messed up. Cue the waterworks."
13,"When I was in high school I was moving to a different city and my friend was moving to a different state as well. 
Everyday I would show up at her locker at some random part of the day and scare the piss out of her. On my last day of school before my move as per usual I scared her but this time she bust out crying. I felt bad thinking I scared her pretty bad but she had actually looked forward to me scaring her at her locker. She knew it was the last time I would do it again and it was, considering we never went to the same school again. 
We eventually did come back to the same town again and we’re still the best of friends. :)"
14,Heavy fondling of balls. Be gentle with that shit 
15,"M48 here. Not a strange rule, I don’t think, but Dad always forbade is from going through Mom’s purse for anything, tissue, gum, keys, whatever. My SO sometimes asks me to get something out of her purse, and I refused for about the past three years but am now getting better at it. It still feels like I’m doing something wrong, even though she’s asked me to get something."
16,Dealing with the fact that someone might be an asshole and they’ll still never get what’s coming to em
17,"Funny story about this. I couldn't receive my best friend's texts on my phone for months so we had to only text on snapchat. One day he gets so annoyed he grabs my phone with a long silence. Looks at me and says ""You have me blocked you fucking idiot."" I don't think I ever laughed so hard. "
18,"If we ordered food nobody could order the same thing as someone else. I still get a little weirded out when someone says ""That sounds good, I'll also have that""."
19,"Came in drunk with a pizza and a bottle of coke, spilled the coke all over the pizza, threw the whole mess in the bin.

Next morning, starving hungry, no food in the house, ate coke-soaked pizza from the bin, while absently mindedly brushing the ants off it. 

Edit: As this has gained traction let me just say:

1)The Bin was clean. I actually had the presence of mind to put a fresh bag in before I dumped the pizza in it. I'm not an animal.

2) I'm not in the least bit ashamed of this. Every man should experience bin-pizza at least once in their lives."
20,The fact that I have the power to just go out and do stuff without having to answer to anyone. No one can tell me “no” when I eat a whole pizza in the middle of the night from my bed
21,"Unless you are positive she's into you, absolutely not.  It puts her in a terrible position because her income is based on pleasant interaction with customers and most women would not include ""having to shut a dude down"" as a pleasant thing.  So if she's not interested, now she is in an awkward position of ""do I say no and probably get stiffed"", ""do I say yes, ghost him and hope he gets the hint"" or ""do I say yes, hope it's not terrible, and doesn't impact my future work.""  That's a shitty position to put someone in.

If you really do want to ask her, be patient and feel her out.  Go in on an off night/time when there's time to chat.  If she gives you a cute smile, makes a little small talk, and acts like a normal waitress, she is definitely not into you.  If every time she drops your drink off, she lingers for 10 minutes talking to you, then maybe consider it.  You need to view everything through the lens of *she is literally being paid to be nice to you.*  If you go in 3 times and every time she is clearly going out of her way to chat you up, then I would say you could just ask her if she wants grab a drink sometime.  If she hesitates, immediately drop it.  And in that scenario, the most important thing to do is to never bring it up again and do not make it awkward the next time you go back, just act like it didn't happen."
22,"Her: I'll wait for him to call me. Guys like a good chase. 

Me: Damn. She hasn't called or anything. She must not be interested. 

If you like someone, just let them know. We're not mind readers and we don't like chasing you. We're adults. Not high school students. "
23,"Start small. Something along the lines of, ""You get me so hard"".

If there seems to be a good response, gradually escalate it. Dirty talk covers a very, very wide range. 

I'm not comfortable typing out the furthest end of that spectrum, even as an anonymous internet person... I've heard some dark shit. "
24,"I came home to her place, drunk and sad. I started crying and so did she. When she asked me what was wrong I looked up at her and said ""I don't have a motorcycle and really want one"". 

She thought I was breaking up with her so I slept on the couch that night."
25,"Had a girlfriend for 6 months, everything was perfect. However she went to Japan to study and I went to Switzerland. When she asked what should we do I said it was better to end it there. She cried, I didn’t.

Last week I cried in my room because I realized how my current girlfriend isn’t as nearly as awesome, cheering and encouraging."
26,She can leave you alone and her life doesn’t revolve around you.

28,"My step dad used to yell at me all the time for ""walking too loud"" I wasn't big or rowdy or anything. I was just a teenage boy. They make some noise. But the only time he didn't yell was when I would walk on the front of my foot, almost like tip toeing. After a couple years it was habit. Now, even after I've been living way away from him for a couple years I still walk on the front of my foot when barefoot. If I walk ""normal"" it almost feels like I'm slapping the ground. In shoes it's okay. But when I have nothing or just socks then I will be on the front of my foot. "
29,I've never personally worried about it because sex doesn't have to end because I came. Sometimes I just need to fire off a round to decrease my sensitivity. No big deal. There's other fun to be had if I need some time to recover.
30,"When both of you have your own independent goals and aspirations but have a ""teamwork"" mentality towards achieving them. There's nothing quite like having your own badass personal cheerleader by your side as you tackle life's obstacles.

Speaking from past experience, if someone wants success only for themself and doesn't push you towards becoming the best you, that person is unlikely to be emotionally invested in the relationship through the hard times. "
31,It's kinda nice not being a fucking idiot anymore.
32,"Should be noted that anything you may have percieved as interest on her part can easily be misconstrued as, ""me being pleasant to you determines how much I get paid."" 

Good luck, thugger."
33,"A very beautiful girl in my class (9 years ago, 2nd or 3rd grade) openly said she was fat (she was not). I said she was not and we got into an argument and I ended up agreeing (because the argument was going nowhere) and said she was fat. She cried and I was made the villain...  To this day its one of the most important lessons I've learned in school"
34,"We went paintballing for a stag do, my little brother decided to wear a white hoodie which made him easy to spot so we all targeted him in the game because he was an idiot for wearing a white hoodie for running around the woods.

Unknown to us, a pre-teen girl who joined later in the session was also wearing a white hoodie. We all ended up targeting her and unsurprisingly, she got upset."
35,I wear long fake nails so that I look more like a witch. So I am happy to hear this. My boyfriend doesn't like them either but it is more important for me to be witch like. 
36,"The Delivered food that could feed a family, followed by the yell I make into the house to notify “the family” that suppers ready. 

There is no family, only me."
37,"Casually telling us about any previous sexual exploits. What the fuck, do you think this turns us on or something? "
38,[deleted]
39,No one is allowed to open their presents on Christmas Day until everyone is in the room and nobody can open a present when someone else is (unless my mum knew it was the same thing she’d bought for all three of us kids) the same happens now with my son and nephews and even my parents and siblings. We had to make sure we appreciated and thanked people for every gift which I don’t think is a bad rule :) Christmas morning takes forever though! We sometimes have to break it up with a walk as there are a lot of us!
40,I can barely get myself a girlfriend 
41,"A woman on bumble kept taking days to respond, she was very vague about wanting to meet.

Then i get a message from her saying ""are you just looking for a pen pal, i see no initiative from you""

And im like ""you can ask me out, give me your number make plans too, isn't that yhr point of bumble give women more power and control in dating""

To which she replied ""i dont ask guys out, sending the first message was already too much for me""

I gave her my number and said ""text me"" then she just gave me hers.

She seems stuck in the old mentality of men ask first and that's not my style in 2018. I tend to ask first when i feel ""if i dont ask fast ill lose my chance"" if im busy or have shit going on i wont ask. "
42,"The answers in these threads usually have a lot of overlap with the ones in askwomen about subjects they wish men shouldn't comment on.

Men say ""We don't like fashion trends X, Y, or Z, they look silly.""

and then there's a corresponding thread

Women say ""We're not wearing X, Y and Z for you, ok? We're wearing it for ourselves. Stop criticising."""
43,You fucking inconsiderate bastard. 
44,"Woman here. For me, nothing turns me on more than hearing how HE’S feeling as opposed to what he says about me and my body. 

“You are making me so hard...”
“I love when you kiss me here...”
“Watching you do (blank) is turning me on...”

Etc. 


I love when men are audible. Moaning is the sexiest thing to hear from a guy in bed. Let her know what feels good! Take her body in. When a guy looks at me with fire in his eyes while I’m going down on him, straddling him/etc. it makes me feel incredibly sexy. 

I’m not a huge “You want me to fuck you?” (Umm...obviously yes, that’s why I’m naked with you) or “You like my hard cock?” Kind of girl. That talk seems cheap to me, and overplayed. Really connecting with your body and expressing exactly how you feel is way more genuine and makes a better experience. 

I guess all women are different, you just gotta play around with what works! "
45,TIL my friends and I are the only ones still using ordinary texting as a primary means of communicating 
46,Fries that were supposed to be baked but I was too lazy to bake them so I just microwaved them. They were somehow soggy and dry at the same time and still cold in the middle.
47,"this isn't a sexist thing or a chauvinist thing but....

cook for me...

honestly, my wife won me (like, I've GOT to marry this girl)  the first night we had dinner at her place.  ""just come over, i'll take care of everything"". 
 
She's a very very good cook, but she went the extra mile and learned how to make an obscure dessert that I had mentioned, possibly a year earlier that i really liked.  

there is so much love and warmth you can express by cooking for someone.  

so, yeah, married 33 years now.  well fed every day.

"
48,"Not too strange, but I was always taught to refer to people older than me as “Mr./Mrs. _____”.
Now I’m an adult and my boyfriend’s parents insist on me calling them by their first names which makes me so uncomfortable.


Edit: I just realized this was posted in AskMen and I am not a Men. Oops."
49,"Because every time I do he fucks it up somehow. Dude is objectively handsome, good job, own place, and isn't a weirdo. Should be a slam dunk, but he always fumbles it. 

Seriously, the last girl asked me if he was autistic."
50,"Being kind, attentive, and not expecting to be treated like a princess from the start. A date shouldn't be the guy doing all the work, especially if he was the one to put himself out there by asking her out first. Being willing to pay for herself, offering date ideas (this can be stressful for a lot of guys), and contributing to conversation are all nice too."
51,I never run out of orange juice anymore. I really like orange juice and it is entirely within my power to ensure it’s always in my home. I take joy in that. 
52,"Whatever Cosmopolitan says will ""drive your man wild.""

No. Stop it."
53,"She’s comfortable with herself, and comfortable being without you.

Nothing worse than a tag along because she doesn’t have friends or doesn’t know how to be alone."
54,"Yup. Do something. You have to extend the session in a way that is easier to control, and foreplay is the way. "
55,Flap her arms like an angry ostrich 
56,"The best way to show that you're interested in someone is to be direct with them. If you're trying to give off clues that might seem obvious to you, they're probably going to go right over the guy's head. "
57,More like hard to want
58,1
59,"Calling me ""Daddy"". I have a daughter. That's fucking weird. Don't do it. "
60,Made a bloody Mary with vodka and spaghettios.  Wish I got to this thread earlier because I really think the shame is enough that it would have done well here.
61,She broke up with me and I said ok. Lol what was I gonna do? Try to convince her to love me? 
62,""" I do not worry about my career. And they said, ""Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you're making fun of the victims, and that's wrong."" But that's not what I'm doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever... No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, ""Hey, are we trending?"" No. This is who I'm making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: ""My thoughts and prayers..."" ""My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora."" ""My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston."" Do you know what that's worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, ""Don't forget about me today.""""

63,"I opened the fridge and only had beer (and condiments). I decided that if it has the calorie content of a meal, it's a meal. So I drank 6 Oatmeal Stouts and called it dinner."
64,I dunno it honestly sounds like he was just pampering you to an extreme extent.
65,"Dude, you have to make happiness in your week. Vary your lunches by week even you can't by day. Call a friend. Buy fancy ice cream on a whim. Spontaneously see a movie. Explore a street. If you do the same thing every day, yeah life can be soul crushing. "
66,Fruit too
67,"My family was super strict about hygiene. Twice a day I had to brush, floss, mouthwash, wash my face with a scrub, shampoo, condition, body wash, pumice, and moisturize. It was later in life that I found out doing all this twice a day every day is actually terrible for your hair and skin. I still can't go without showering twice a day cuz I feel super gross getting into bed and going out, but I've gotten better about not using product every single shower. On the plus side, 31 years and I've never had a cavity or crown.

Edit: my much more body friendly routine is now brush twice a day, floss and mouthwash once a day, and I shower on a two day rotation: morning 1 water only rinse, evening 1 body wash, morning 2 face wash, evening 2 shampoo and conditioner. I'm very oily so that's why I still shower twice a day, but definitely not necessary if you have dry skin."
68,"Considering that Snapchat deletes your text history each time you exit the app, I don't understand why anyone would even text through it in the first place. I'd send something, then later read their response, and I'll forget the context of the conversation."
69,Ily
70,"As a woman, I hate “can I ask you a personal question?”  I always assume it will be an awful turn off,  something like “what’s your bra size” or “how many people have you slept with”.  Option B is much better, if she is seeing someone she will just say so."
71,File for divorce.
72,“Playing hard to get”
73,"They're good people, but tend to need someone pretty specific.  Just because I have two single friends of appropriate sexual preference doesn't mean they'd be a good couple."
74,"When I was like 5 my little sister used to slap me really hard and then start crying saying ""Moooooooom, u/trigger93 hit me!!!"" Mom would hear the slap and the crying and I'd get in trouble.

All I had done was not listen to my bossy sister."
75,"This will probably get removed as an FAQ but I'm going to have a stab at it anyway. First, you're 27 - you'd be surprised how many men start to turn their lives around at that age. A lot of rock stars seemed to either die or get clean around that age. You haven't done nothing, there's still a perfectly good chance you can do well from here. 

- Social anxiety. This is the big demon you're going to have to face. [This is how.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GSf5cYCvE) You need to go out and find people to socialise with. A lot of guys make the mistake of only going where there are hot girls, burning out and the saying ""well I tried."" No, go anywhere and talk to anyone. I suggest you volunteer in your community, make your talents available for those who could use them. It will lead to more social opportunities that you might expect.

- Fitness is hard to get into, emotionally more than anything else. [Here's how I reccomend ] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/8bfuiy/how_to_gym_for_the_first_time/dx6dsnf/?context=3) that you approach it. Also, [autosuggestion] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNJTf2Sv3AY) can be a powerful tool in changing your self image - which is a major problem for you right now.

- The number of women you have slept with is irrelevant. We guys like the simplicity of numbers and scores, but it's hard to quantify things like intimacy, generosity and quality of sex. Quality over quantity is easy to say, but hard to believe in - especially when it comes to sex and women. If your self worth depends on fucking a large number of women, then you're doing it for the wrong reasons - validation will never plug the hole. If you just like the excitement of novel sex but don't feel depressed when you're not getting it, then casual sex is for you. Otherwise you should focus on building a relationship that's going to be high quality and reciprocal, by investing in someone with potential and working hard to build a good partnership that will give you the connected stability that you need to thrive.

- Your job is too isolating. Look into hot desking or shared office space, at least that way you'll be around other people while you work. I do that, and it's made a massive difference to my mental health, otherwise I'd be at home by myself lonely while working which isn't very stimulating. Hell if that's too costly then just write in Starbucks, they position themselves as a Third Place and you'll still be around people. I am much more productive around people, and I can still go home if I need some peace. You don't make enough money though, and I'm guessing that your writing doesn't really take more than 20 hours of actual work per week with a fair chunk of boredom and procrastinating inbetween. If you have IT skills, there are lots of things you could do to fill up the remaining hours in the week and make more money. You'll feel better for being busy.

So to summarise, you have no real goals, you are lonely and unmotivated and your career isn't fulfilling. Set S.M.A.R.T goals, get out of your house and practice socialising, find more work and really throw yourself into it and start taking better care of your health by starting simply with diet and workouts. 

I was earning not much more than you at 27, and I was nearly 300 lbs. I'm now 31, own a house, have a thriving small business and have lost well over 100 lbs and gained a lot of muscle. You can do this mate.

EDIT: Thanks to whoever gilded this, I'm glad you found it helpful. Though it's a bit disappointing that much of the discussion has revolved around bickering about Peterson. I just thought he put it well, he wasn't so controversial two years ago when I first saw it I guess."
76,Aight pops. 
77,"It was the general rule in my house, no looking into someone's purse, backpack or drawers. It involved everyone, my mom would never go through my stuff. I think it's awesome, but I'm a bit obsessive about my possessions because of that. I go absolutely bonkers if someone touches my stuff without asking."
78,"Yep, that’s what I do, make her come once or twice before so if you don’t perform so well it’s ok because she already came 😂 (I’m laughing but I’m sad) "
79,"Eugh, I see that all the time. Also amusing is when I ask girls if they ever make the first move, they generally say that they do it all the time. But when I ask them what move they make, they generally say that they did something vague like saying hello or striking up a conversation."
80,"He is pushing 400 pounds, is a complete slob, says shit like ""she's cute I'd dump a load on her face"" in front of women but can't understand why he doesn't attract women"
81,"The problem is ""curvy"" now means ""fat"""
82,"Money. If I want something - an appetizer with dinner, a new record, a concert ticket, whatever - oftentimes I can simply have it. Obviously there are limits, but until I started working full time I had a lot less freedom in this area. "
83,Trying to make men in relationships jealous.  Either your are interested in someone else and I am pissed or you are faking interest to get attention in a dysfunctional way.  Both are quite bad.

86,Don't try to save someone from themselves
87,"When I was younger I made my mom cry so hard.

I think I was 15 or 16 and went to Subway, got a large sub, I think it was meatball marinara, anyway. i took it home and saw my mom sitting on the kitchen as I made my way to my room. She looked sad and I asked her what was wrong. She said everything was fine and then I went to my room to eat my sandwich.

After I was done I went to the kitchen to throw away the paper and saw my mom crying. I asked why and she said ""Because you didn't bring me a sandwich!""

She was pregnant at the time..."

89,"Just because you treat someone the way you want to be treated doesn't mean they'll treat you back that same way,"
90,No shit. Nothing like losing a good place to eat 
91,"I can just buy Fudgsicles, I don't have to ask anyone's permission, the store will just sell them to me. "
92,"My ex-wife would cry every time I said ""No"" to her requests to go out to eat every night.

To be clear, I didn't say no every night - she would *ask* every night, even after we'd already talked about money being tight earlier in the same day.

Turns out she wasn't just emotionally manipulative (though she was definitely that), but genuinely couldn't understand money. She eventually opened a credit card in her name and added me as an authorized user, which she actually thought made me responsible for it. I let her keep thinking that until the divorce was finalized.

I know this probably isn't what you were looking for, but it sticks out in my memory the most. It sucks that now any time someone cries in front of me, there's a tiny part in the back of my brain that thinks they're trying to manipulate me. "
93,Fashion and hygiene isn’t gay.
94,"Right after my Ex left I rolled the fatest, longest Blunt I had ever made in my life. 

I took a couple of puffs and went for a shower, I took the jay with me.

After that I took are sharing bowl for popcorn and filled it with ceral - coco pops, krave, lion bar ceral, Coco shreddies and half a litre of Milk. It was diabetes in a bowl but it tasted real!

I watched 6 Disney films that night starting with the lion king and ending with frozen probably the best night of my life. 

My best mate heard the news came round to check on me. Joined me mid way through Lilo and Stitch stayed for the rest of the night. "
95,"you can't over-analyze this stuff. any of it will sound stupid if taken out of context. point is to say it with conviction and not to doubt yourself needlessly. you're just having fun. few of these things are said as dry, factual statements. it's like role playing. you're essentially creating a ""scene"", an atmosphere. ""you feel so good"" is a perfect thing to say, ""put that wet pussy on me"" can be OK as well. maybe just allow yourself not to judge what you're saying, but let your more passionate side take over and fuck what it sounds like after you're done. cause, like, who cares? she thinks it's hot and gets aroused. that's it. there's not more purpose to it, really. other than making her feel desirable, which is very valuable. so just see what works for her and if it works, maybe, who cares about what it sounds like afterwards?"

Finally she cornered me while I was smoking outside of my second job and demanded to know how I could be so lonely (I wasn't) and have so little sex (mostly true) and not want her?

So I told why. I told her every mean thought I'd had about her for four years, I vented a lot of unrelated frustration as well but dammit I wanted her gone and the police weren't an option.

Plus, I’ve dealt with the alternative, a man who took forever (two hours)to finish. I thought he wasn’t attracted to me or I was doing something wrong. That’s a far more frustrating. I was really tight (humble brag, but this also seems to contribute to my boyfriend finishing fairly quickly), and it hurts to have sex for a long period of time.

I was stunned.  In every respect it was a great night for both of us and a good morning.  I played everything over in my head and couldn’t think of one thing that she could have been mad about.  Finally I thought well, I guess she’s just crazy.

About a week later I get a long email telling me I’m not a man because a “man” would have pursued her to find out what was wrong, etc, etc.  she then again said to not contact her again.

And yet it doesn’t matter. 

Now of course, there are times I push through this with a smile  to help please my wife.  But it can almost feel like I’m lying because I am so physically disinterested for the first 10 minutes.

195,Top 10 Questions r/niceguys Still Can't Answer
196,"&gt;
I recommend the backpack test. Both of my children agreed to this, and it appears (so far) to have worked 
successfully for them.
&gt;
The basic idea is this: for a marriage to last, the partners need to recognize that there will be periods of intense stress, non-romantic moments (often lasting days or longer) when life gets tough. It could be illness, or lack of money, or just something serious going wrong. Maybe a flat tire. Maybe you arrive at midnight at the cabin you rented and you discover the key doesn’t work. How will you and your partner-to-be handle it? Will you work well together? Will your love continue despite the stress?
&gt;
Take a week-long backpack trip together. Or do something equivalent. I like backpacking because doing it, particularly in Yosemite or anywhere in the Sierras, is a wonderful exhilarating spiritual experience. But—and this is the key—it always has moments of stress. It may suddenly rain, and you get unexpectedly wet. Maybe it will be cold in the morning, and you (or your partner) will not want to get up to fetch and heat water. One time it snowed suddenly, and we couldn’t find a sheltered place to camp. Maybe one of you will develop a blister. Maybe one of you will feel that you would like to transfer some weight to the partner. Maybe you will get lost. Maybe a bear will steal your food. Maybe one or both of you will get very tired, and grumpy.
&gt;
Before you get married, you want to experience stress together, ideally over an extended time. A few days is minimal; a week is better; a two week trip is probably more than enough. I recall taking such a trip with my wife-to-be, and a good friend and his wife. I was appalled at the way he treated her. When her pack was uncomfortable, he told her to endure it until they got to a good rest spot. (My wife and I insisted we stop until her pack was comfortable!) He didn’t help her in the cooking. He just didn’t seem to care. After that trip, I could never again think of him as a good friend. And indeed, a few years later, he and his wife were divorced.
&gt;
Don’t go backpacking with casual friends you want to keep. You may grow to dislike them when you see them under stress, and then you will not even want to be casual friends with them. That was my experience in the trip I just described.
&gt;
It doesn’t count to go on a romantic vacation, staying at hotels that take care of all your needs. A day trip isn’t good enough. You’ve got to experience extended stress; even better if the stress is unexpected. My bride to be and I went on several backpack trips before and during marriage. Perhaps the most dramatic one was a two-week trip that had rain, snow, terrible blisters, discomfort, bears, and all sorts of stress. We came back from that trip loving each other much more than we had imagined possible

197,"Girls who think that men only want sex, play video games and want nothing else to do with them😒"

I've only ever seen him once without it. he shaved it on a dare never telling anybody he was planning to.


 I thought my uncle was visiting. "
199,"1. *Independence*. It's actually very reassuring for guys to know that we don't have to lead a woman like a lost puppy or that they don't need constant text updates. That being said, it's such a turnoff when it feels like a girl is being difficult or oppositional for no good reason. That's what makes guys walk away and only bother with a girl if she's a sure thing. 

2. *Being a loud and crazy party girl.* Most guys like a girl that likes to have fun or is outgoing. What we don't like is feeling that a girl is a massive attention whore or has ADD or where it's a struggle to hold her attention. It also makes us doubt whether a girl is relationship material if she's all about da club and getting dolled with her girlfriends to soak up male attention.  

3. *Using sex as a relationship tool.* To most guys, sex is an end in itself, not a means to an end. There's nothing that turns a guy off a girl faster when it feels like she's using sex as a carrot (and often stick as well). I've flat out turned down girls who were promising no-holes-barred sex because I knew it wasn't about the sex, it was about getting stuff (attention/a relationship usually). 

4. *""I don't know what do you want to do/wuu2""*. We guys get it. A lot of girls can't be bothered deciding where to go to dinner and it's nice to delegate those minor decisions to a guy. But it can get awful grating when a girl is just sitting there expecting the guy to lead all the fuckin time. Believe it or not, we don't mind girls expressing their likes and dislikes. We might not defer all the time (and you might not want us to) but it's nice to know that she's not always waiting for us to make up our minds. 

5. *Making us jealous.* A lot of girls seem to think this works with guys, or it's useful for getting our attention/making us act. With me at least, it's an instant turnoff. It's too obvious and manipulative and it makes me just want to pull up stakes. It doesn't make me come closer, it makes me pull away.  

Honorable Mention: sloppy gaggy blowjobs. I'm one of those guys who prefers the subtle approach and a deft tongue, not the ""she sounds like a duck and I'm worried she's gonna hurl all over my crotch"". "

214,"It’s mental how many guys think you have to go in and out with the fingers... doing that is going a really round about way to making a girl climax and is likely getting her red raw.

Hook those fingers at 90+ degrees, put them in up to the second knuckle, boom, should have the G-spot (feels rough and swells slightly when a girl is stimulated). Then play that shit like a DJ, i.e. lateral movement to start and get the blood/juices flowing, the G-spot can take some serious pressure and powerful stimulation if you get it warmed up properly. Then you start with the “come to me” beckoning movement. You finally move on to up/down and back/forth pulling (imagine South West to North East from side on) and increase force at a reasonable rate. Finally you can put your hand on the “mount” and might feel you fingers coming up, push down on that when climax is near. 

Note, the above is equally effective anally, just x3-4 the warm up phase. Anyway, good luck my friends."

He could speak and do tasks he was familiar with, but his thing was that everything was routine, he always did things according to a pattern, and if that pattern was broken, it was like skipping a line of code in a computer: ""Does not compute"".

One of the things that he always did was that every time I would leave the room to use the bathroom, he would ask me where I was going. Every time I had to leave the room, without fail, as if he was worried I was abandoning him. So I got in the habit of saying, whenever I was going to the bathroom, ""I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.""

Still to this day, if I'm with someone else and need to leave the room, I sometimes automatically say ""I'll be right back""."

223,"&gt;Y’know, and I feel like I was born in 1990 and I was sort of raised in America when it was a cult of self expression, and I was just taught, y’know, express myself and have things to say and everyone will care about them. And I think everyone was taught that, and most of us found out no-one gives a shit what we think.So we flock to performers by the thousands ‘cause we’re the few that have found an audience, and then I’m supposed to get up here and say follow your dreams - as if this is a meritocracy? It is not, okay? I had a privileged life, and I got lucky, and I’m unhappy.
&gt;
&gt;They say it’s like the ‘me’ generation. It’s not. The arrogance is taught, or it was cultivated. It’s self-conscious. That’s what it is. It’s conscious of self. Social media - it’s just the market’s answer to a generation that demanded to perform so the market said, here - perform. Perform everything to each other, all the time for no reason. It’s prison - its horrific. It’s performer and audience melded together. What do we want more than to lie in our bed at the end of the day and just watch our life as a satisfied audience member. I know very little about anything. But what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience, you should do it.

224,"My brother asked out a waitress by giving her a note with his number, directly, just as he was leaving the Cafe. The note had a message that was like ""Hey, I was too nervous to ask you in person, as I didn't want to put you on the spot, I would like to get to know you, my number is xxxx , hope you call"". They went out for a few months. She said the note was honest and endearing. Might work, might not work"

But, what I found that worked with various partners:

(I'll be translating from my language, so adjustments are needed to use in English)

In general, I find that women like to be dominated and see that a man is having a good time with them, that they are desirable: 

- oh my god, you're so beautiful
- oh, yeah, you like that?
- you're mine, all just mine... (and you're not going anywhere until I'm done with you)
- (grab her by the wrists and put her hands behind her head as she lies on her back) + again, ""you're not going anywhere, you're all just mine now...""
- whose girl are you? who do you belong to? ... that's right, just mine. ... just for my pleasure
- have you been a good girl? ... I guess I will have to punish you a little more
- god, I love your lips/thighs/...
- (with a cheeky tone)... oh yeah, you like that? would you like me to ..... ? (she nods) oh really? is this what good girls like? hmmm, I wasn't aware... is this good?

Point is to be playful and a bit over the top,, at least in my experience. If she's into that, combine with a little show of dominance, like light choking, spanking and such and it gets her going pretty good in my experience. But the main point is, check with her how she feels about it. But I wouldn't be too shy either. I think she'll let you know if it's too much.

I dated a girl who was more ""edgy"" and who enjoyed it if I called her my little slut and such, but for me, that actually isn't as pleasant after a while. Another thing I did with her was a kind of roleplay. Essentially, you describe a scenario, like she was into history, so I'd talk about a warlord conquering an opposing tribe and taking their princess as his trophy. And even though she despised him, she couldn't resist... etc. Like describing bits of really poorly written erotic literature. But it worked and was fun, so oh well. "
229,"I agree, when I first started working 9-5 I hated it and was ready to run far away, but then I realized that all I was doing outside of work was playing video games and sleeping. The weekends were basically the same thing.

It's a lot less soul crushing if you mix things up and actually do shit during the time you have off. Set some goals for yourself outside of work, travel, exercise, go see concerts and take weekend trips, learn to play an instrument, teach yourself a new language.

The reality is that 99% of people aren't going to ""love"" their jobs. The overwhelming majority isn't going to continue working if 10 billion dollars appeared in their bank account today. It becomes a lot more tolerable if you *make the effort* to create a meaningful life outside of work with the time that you have."

255,"I have ptsd from my ex wife kidnapping my kids to another country.  Legally there was nothing for me to do.  She had an affair while i was deployed and rather than own up to it and settle things amiably, she kidnapped my kids after having me charged through the military.  All charges got dropped but it’s been years and I’ve given up hope trying to find them.  Now girls just want to settle down and have kids with me and I can’t bring myself to trust her with driving my car.  Im in intense therapy for this and its even hard for me to have sex anymore because I miss my kids and my ex wife tried and failed to do rape charges (bc I was deployed when she said it happened and she refused rape kits).  

I did try to kill myself after a year and a half of the false charges and bc the military has so much documentation of how great of an officer and my ex kept getting caught lying to courts and police, I ended up with a full medical retirement at 38.  

I now spend most of my days gardening and praying that I can find my kids when they turn 18.   My live in gf knows everything and frequently holds my hand when I start throwing up or have a panic attack bc I see something that triggers memories of my kids or of the horrible things my ex accused me of."

* Shows up to my work on her days off and we spend my lunch break going on a walk.
* Sometimes she wears this dress I really like and a girls newsboy hat that I know she hates, but bought for her when we first started dating.
* She reaches out for hugs when I get up for the day. Every morning I get up, get back and hug, then get back up.
* Sometimes she makes me coffee on weekends. She sometimes fucks it up, but she tries.
* She demands hugs and kisses, all the time.
* She waits in the car for me to walk around because she knows I like helping her get out.
* Sometimes she makes dinner, like, once every other week, and acts like it's the most special thing in the world. Even though...I make her dinner all the time.
* Scratches my scalp while we're just sitting there.

I dunno, when she does something mundane she acts like it's the most special thing in the world and acts all high and mighty about it. It's adorable. ""*I* just made *you* dinner. Aren't I the best?"" She holds her head up high and I honestly don't think she's joking. It's nice to see her so happy to make me happy."

264,"I was seeing a guy who would pretty much exclusively text me via snap for the first two months I knew him even though he had my number and he would save literally every snap. One day I was like why tf do you save every snap and he said so he could see what he said and then we kinda fought about it and after that I told him he can text me if he wants to talk and we haven't used Snapchat since. 100% single guy with nothing to hide (we weren't together and definitely not exclusive). Didn't even sext ever, just normal ""hey wanna hang out"" texts.   

I'm just as confused as you are. "
265,"This is adorable. I’m so happy for you and jealous. 

Stuff I like:

Finger running through my hair, especially the back of my head and top of my neck. 
Touch my chest for the love of all that is holy. Softly raking fingernails on my back and a little butt grabbing go a long way. 
Also, it’s fun when you guide my hands where you want to be touched. 

When things are defiantly going downtown, I always prefer being teased a bit before, well, we get on the non-stop D train. Inner thighs, waist, also lots more body kissing. 

Also, ear nibbling and neck kissing. 

Tbh, if we’re making out and my hands are all over you, I’m already turned on. So just have fun and just let your own hands go where the want. As long as you don’t poke me in the eye, anywhere you touch will be an ‘erogenous’ zone
"
266,"How tired/exhausted I would be

How I can no longer sleep as soon as my head hits the pillow yet somehow magically wake up just after sunrise (no matter how tired I am or how much sleep debt I've accrued). 

Coming to the realisation that my choices are now mine and I have no safety net. I have the ultimate freedom and no guidance. 

Understanding that my relationship with my family will never get better no matter how successful I am. 

Understanding that the fantasies I had of being an adult, as a kid, isn't what it's really like. Also understanding that all the things I really wanted to do as a kid (travel, for example) is just not appealing to me anymore. 

Everyone around me fearing aging. ""if I get any older, I won't be able to find a partner, settle down..."" 

Other than that, being an adult pretty much rules. I have my own freedom and can do whatever I want. I can define myself. If something is shitty, I can find a way to leave the situation. Maybe I'm just the lucky few that really loves my adulthood and would never be a child again - not unless people I love were going to be tortured and killed if I didn't. "

I have never expected them to do so, I always kinda figured that was something that only happened in tv shows and movies, although in hindsight I suppose it happens sometimes. On one or two occasions I have jokingly suggested they should give it a try but I was never completely serious. 

If one of my friends did try to do that for me I’d appreciate the thought but I would probably be a bit anxious about it since it’s uncharted territory for me and I’m kinda bored of the dating process in general. "

312,"I think the idea of leaving your number when you pay the bill is the best most non confrontational way forward. I she decides not to text, just act like it didn't happen next time you are there. 

But this 'leave women alone' when they are working, at the gym, out with friends, alone, listening to music, walking down the street, at the club, at a bar, on the train... is ridiculous. If most men followed it, they would never date at all. If women were picking up the slack and doing a reasonable proportion of the asking and getting rejected too, guy's asking less would be an option. As it stands for most men, if you see someone that interests you, now is probably your only chance to take a risk and see if she will reciprocate. You don't have the luxury of waiting for a more opportune time. 

Without picking up any of the slack, women are asking if men will ask them out, do so at the right time, in the right place, in the right way and if they get it wrong they should be creep shamed.  

As long as you are respectful and considerate of her circumstances, I don't see anything wrong with starting small talk and gauging her response before trying to get a number or a date. I've met brilliant friends under all of those 'leave her alone' circumstances and taking offense at someone finding you interesting is immature. "

316,"nope, just really, *really* bad at picking up on hints"
317,"The two biggest ones are career success and sexual experience.

A man with an impressive job, like a medical doctor or a C-level executive or even just a reasonably skilled musician, is more attractive to women than he would normally be. It's not necessarily about the money he earns but that he is driven and successful. 

But this doesn't really work the other way around. A woman who works as a doctor isn't any more attractive than a nurse. Which makes sense: men aren't conducting job interviews on dates, so how impressive a woman's job is doesn't matter beyond establishing that she's not too unstable to hold down a job or get through school. 

The other one is similar. Women use preselection a lot, which is why you'll notice being more attractive to women when you're in a relationship. Generally if a guy is getting attention from a lot of women then he must be doing something right, so women will put in a disproportionate amount of effort fighting for the most desired men.

Men, generally speaking, don't see it that way. If other men are willing to have sex with a woman, then that means that she's probably alive but doesn't say much more beyond that. Besides, men have working eyes and we can see whether or not a woman is attractive for ourselves. A woman without much or any baggage in the form of previous partners and who we don't have to fight over is more appealing than the reverse."

He said he never had a slutty period in his life. He always struggled with self esteem issues and about 6 years ago he started working out and got in really good shape.

Here's another. No matter how much Cosmo, your best girlfriend or your best gay friend tells you, not all men enjoy having their prostate stimulated. Just like your clit, direct pressure can either be pleasurable or down right painful. While some men get off on anal stimulation, not all men do."
405,"Everything.

I hated being young.  My entire childhood comprised of being micromanaged by my parents and given choices rather than choosing my own things.  I lived in the middle of nowhere and far from my friends.  I had no money to go out and do things.

412,How expensive life is especially kids. Second I saw the hospital bill after my son was born I about had a stroke. I wish somebody told me when I was kid how much adulthood sucks because then I would’ve enjoyed it more instead of trying to grow up faster. When you’re a kid you think once you move out your life is gonna be full of parties and doing whatever you want. Reality is you’re usually so broke and overworked that you just come home and sleep.

I’m going to have to disagree with you. I’m not attracted to the job itself in most cases, but the job is a sign of many other things that are attractive: intelligence, determination, discipline, the drive to work toward their goals, etc. ETA: the ability to comfortably support one’s self, and financial experience. This is huge.

I don’t love your example because being a nurse is already a decent enough job to interest me, but I would still be more attracted to a doctor than a nurse based on what I explained."

I sit down and it's not 2 seconds she hits me again, so I pop up spin around and WHAM!  Right on the top of her head.  I swung HARD too.

I cocked my arm again and my friend, sitting next to me, grabbed it and was like ""She got the point"" but i look and she's grabbed her head and just starts balling her eyes out.  She never really talked to me much after that.  It wasn't until later that I realized she may have had a crush on Me as she would do a lot of stuff to get my attention and after the punch, she didn't have much to do with me."
443,"Working retail for years I can say the amount of people who misconstrue ""customer service"" for genuine interest is shockingly high.

452,"I'm not single a lot, but I agree with your comment. There are people who have very specific ideas of who they are looking for. I for one am aware of exactly 0 women I'd be interested in, who'd be in my close environment or whom my friends might know. I had to go beyond that, on my own, to find somebody who I enjoy dating. 

If somebody tried to set me up with these women, based on the assumption that I'd like them, since they have vaginas, I'd be actually pretty annoyed."
453,It cracks me up when I see “message me first” in the bio... I CAN’T! 
454,"Once my little brother and I had to split a ""Big Hunk"" candy bar. I, as the clever older brother, asked if he wanted a ""Big"" piece or a ""Hunk"" Piece. He of course said ""Big"" so I cut it between the words and took the ""Hunk"" piece for myself."
455,"Remember that men rarely get compliments, even from women they are in relationships with. We almost never compliment each other, and never get unprovoked compliments from women we don't know.

It allows men to easily have festering insecurities due to continued uncertainty.

Not many people take kindly here to the 'date x people to pick one after weeks of sorting', although by now there are people who do that.  Tbh I'm not a fan and I'd drop them if I found out they went to a romantic date with someone else in between two romantic dates with me.

Also, the  dating period isn't a thing here. You either are in a relationship or you aren't. Americans on reddit seem to treat commitment and exclusivity like a huge scary step, but it simply isn't.

Edit: realised I am on r/AskMen, have the wrong gender. Oops, sorry. "
462,"I agree. As long as you are polite and not creepy, I don't see what the problem is. Just say I'd love to take you to dinner some time, no pressure, this is my number (when you're done with your meal). Don't ask her if she's seeing someone, just ask her out."
