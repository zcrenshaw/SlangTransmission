1,"&gt;I’m talking about unplanned (or even unwanted) yet palpable sexual tension. The kind where you can’t think about anything except ripping their clothes off and doing it where you stand.

&gt;Is it more or less noticeable when it’s a reciprocal tension?

It is noticeable.

However, I notice it about 2-5 years after the incident in question."
2,"Probably a different take than most here. My GF didn't give me an ultimatum but did voice her concerns about a good female friend of mine. I told her she had nothing to worry about, that the friend is in a relationship with another friend and that firstly, I'm not interested in her like that, I don't cheat and I don't think the friend would either.

My GF came back saying she could tell by the friends body language, frequent looks, flirty jokes and the like that the friend was into me. I shot it down. You don't get to police my friends.

So my GF goes out of state for an awards ceremony for her work. I post I'll miss her on FB and that if anyone wants to hang out to hit me up. It's near Halloween and I'm chilling on the patio having a whiskey and a beer and who shows up? Female friend. She's in a pretty revealing costume but I'm like, whatever, it's almost Halloween. Pour her a drink and we're outside talking. 

After a while she excuses herself and goes inside, I figure to use the restroom. She calls after a couple of minutes to come inside so I head in to see what she needs and she's just in here underwear with her hand out like, come here.

I tell her to leave and go back out onto the patio to finish my drink. Haven't talked to her since.

Some women can tell what's up even when you can't.
"
3,"&gt;To boot I tend to ignore or refuse the advances for a while until I get to know them more as a person and feel comfortable being romantically open to them.

That's why. You let the spark die instead of fanning the flame. They show interest, you deny them, they lose interest.

If you really want a relationship don't snuff that spark, help it build into an inferno."

14,"It took me 5 years to figure out that it doesn't matter if you're right if no one will listen to you.  It's just as important to be liked and respected within your group as it is to have good ideas.  If nobody wants to work with you or listen to you because of your attitude then you won't accomplish anything.

I spent 5 years in the same job before I changed my attitude and started making an effort to engage and make friends with people regardless of their competence or if they appeared to be important.   In the next 5 years I was promoted 3 times.  I can't help but imagine where i'd be if I wasn't such  a punk when I was 25.

15,"Fun fact: The majority of Viagra prescriptions only get filled the first time, because people don't understand how it works. If you've got a circulation problem, it will help blood get to your penis. If you just don't want to fuck your wife anymore, it can't help with that."
16,"“I’m dating a model.” 


Except “model” often means some chick who poses in front of random shit to post on Instagram, or she did some hella sketchy photo shoot in lingerie where the background was a bedsheet slung over a bedroom door. 


Edit: it’s got the same social accolades to it. There’s something perceived to be exciting and high caliber about a model the same way people think about a guy in a band. It’s just that, most of the time, the model isn’t special and the band actually sucks."
17,"Depends on the personalities &amp; where you both are in life.

If you're both at different life stages, then it can be challenging to stick together through things.

20,"I called her as soon as the friend left. This sucked because she was three hours ahead of me and it was already late but I was like, ""You were right baby, friend made a move on me tonight and I had to asked her to leave"".

30,"If she has decoupled the idea of sex with her own self then she won't ever get it. If she sees sex as something other than herself that she gives to you when you're a good boy, like you borrowing her car, then she'll have a hard time understanding that sex is your way of expressing affection and bonding. 

The 5 love languages thing is pretty accurate in my experience, maybe you two have very different ones and perhaps that's worth exploring. She'll be up for sex if she feels appreciated and cherished, if you go about it in the way that she understands. "
31,"I'm sure there will be dozens of ""that never happens to me"" type answers but while I know it happens because I have been told so I have never been able to pick up on it. I can tell as an outisde observer when someone is attracted to someone else but have been able to pick up on it from ""inside.""

So my answer is not obvious at all"

34,"There's plenty of money advice in here already, which is all sensible.

I'll try to advise you on non-work matters. Live your life and let work support it. Dont let your life support your work because you'll never get the time back and no amount of money is ever enough. So long as work supports your current needs and goals then that is just fine.

Always try to be growing in some way. Always look to better yourself, learn something new, try something new, just do something that isn't sitting at home watching TV.

Don't compare yourself to others only try to be better than you were before.

Friendships require serious effort to maintain but at the same time if a friend isnt a positive influence on your life just stop giving them the time of day. "

Truth is, they're not. There are a lot of good girls out there. You'll find that 'home' feeling again because it's a quality you look for.

"
55,"This is the most important thing. If you can't think of a good thing to offer him, I would recommend getting him to take up boxing, jiu jitsu, MMA or something like that. Hell, you take it up too and it can be something the two of you do together, assuming you live in the same area as him. 

A martial arts gym will offer him a lot of the same things a gang: he'll be accepted and supported by a group of other guys, he'll have an outlet for aggression, he'll receive mentorship, and a sense of belonging, but the guys at the gym will be better role models for him. Plus if he really gets hooked on it, it will force him to cut back on the drinking and drug use because nothing's worse than catching a left hook while you're hungover."

69,"My ex. She looked the same as always, but her behavior started getting erratic 3 months in and by month 7, had just become exhausting and unpleasant.

The more often/severely she'd act out, the less interested in her company I became. And I need a certain level of connection to be interested in sex with someone....so, every time she'd act out, it would push me away.

She note the distance and respond by acting out harder...rinse and repeat.


By the time I had decided to break up with her, I was just done. I wasn't interested in spending time with her, talking to her, having sex with her, or being around her at all. 

The act of making physical contact with her at all was uncomfortable. Like...I would partly hoverhand touching her shoulder to get her attention....and would end up just dropping my hand and saying her name rather than touch her..it was a weird mix of finding her repulsive as a person and being concerned that she would take offense to the contact...the erratic behavior and mood swings made it not worth the risk.

I just did NOT want to touch her or for her to touch me. 

I wanted nothing to do with her sexually or otherwise."

She often had the upper hand in relationship stuff, did a lot of manipulation even if that wasn't her intention because she was playing the relationship game at a much higher level...always two moves ahead.

I think it is totally fine for you to date a 26 year old, but be on your toes about manipulation.

74,"I broke it down to my GF and said ""I you don't trust me, why are we doing this because in any relationship, this will just come up again and again?"" In her case, it wasn't easy, but she did decide to trust me and in return, I tell her everything, including small stuff like body language and their possible interpretations and how I feel about those situations.  Somehow that level of detail keeps her relaxed.

Over time, she is beginning to get less and less interested in that high level of detail and more comfortable with me being able to manage myself, even if a girl completely just throws herself at me sexually (which has happened maybe once in my entire life, i don't consider it to be a concern tbh (and even then, its simple math, I have a wonderful woman who wants me in every way versus transient fun), but that is her dooms day thought)

Getting to that point though, she wigged out on me a couple of times, realized she wigged out later, and profusely apologized.  She did that a few times until she realized that maybe she isn't looking at the situation factually.  I was patient though because I knew she would come around.  I think my calmness helped."
75,"Me too but I wasn't too surprised by her reaction. I told her what happened as soon as I could and told her that she had been correct in her assessment of that friend. Neither of us was guilty of anything except maybe me for not seeing it. I did marry her so I guess she sees through my faults, lol. "

That said, just have fun. There's nothing creepy about this age difference. Even if you just fool around and have a good time for a couple months, it's fine. You're young, try new things. That's the only way you grow.

Because you're acting like a friend. You said it yourself, you're ""just as happy"" doing pretty much anything. You're just hanging out, going with the flow. You have no desires, wants, passions of your own. You're making the guy do all the work. They either get exhausted keeping you entertained, or assume your complete lack of reciprocity means disinterest.

DO something! SAY something! Make a DECISION! without someone forcing you to first. You're too passive.

You gotta put some work in to get anything back. If you let life just happen, that's exactly what will happen. What makes a romantic relationship different from a friendship is that you put so much more into it, open yourself more, and get to know each other. A friend you can ignore for months if you don't want to see them. You can't do that with someone you want to (eventually) marry and spend your entire life with every day.

104,"Almost everyone here is saying that age gaps don't matter, but it does. Not because it makes people uncomfortable, they can all fuck off with their unfounded speculation, but ibecause of the potential power dynamic inbalance that comes with it.


The *potential* power dynamic inbalance can come about *unconsciously* through both partners. It usually stems from maturity, experience, and confidence levels. The older person usually has higher levels of those and can subtlety influence the younger inhibiting the growth of those attributes simply by virtue of age; defering to their decisions, seeking out their input for things that don't involve them directly, needing their affirmation to avoid mistakes/failure etc 

This can lead to a non-equal partnership where the 'stronger' persons input and opinion is valued more than the 'weaker' persons, which is unhealthy for *both* partners; the stronger person starts to take on a parental role rather than being a partner and can be put under a lot of pressure and strain to be stoic and disallow them to be emotionally open/vulnerable. The weaker will not develop their own systems and coping systems for dealing with their own issues and problems instead falling back the stronger. 

Unless the stronger person can reign themselves in and hold back. It takes a good level of introspection, self awareness, and self control to do that; any good partner wants to help when they see their SO struggling. My ex was 22, I was 27 when we got together, a seemingly normal age range but our power dynamic was HUGELY out in my favour because of our differing experience/confidence/maturity levels. The whole experience crushed us both into the ground through no malice from either of us.

There's also the type of man that preys on young women specifically because they *want* a relationship where the power dynamic is inbalance in there favour, but I don't think it's applicable here.

114,"For another perspective:

There is no way in hell I'd ditch my best friend who supported me through all hells and reciprocally, for just a girlfriend. So I stomached the ultimatum and was just dumped as was supposed to be.

But being dumped, I discovered not everything she thought was wrong. My best friend did have an interest. The problem with my girlfriend was she was accusing me, when I only had eyes and romantic feelings for her, which made accusations of otherwise, simple absurdity as far as I was concerned. She also accused us of doing things behind her back, which was complete fabrication. Had she told me she only thought that my best friend was interested, not me, if she just told that it was these untold feelings of hers that made her uncomfortable, not events she imagined and never happened... Well I'm not saying I would have believed her. But I would have listened to her with more understanding than by just being accused of stuff that aren't true. I wouldn't have fiercely denied stuff if I hadn't known fir certain they weren't true.

I would never have ditched my best friend. So it was not possible to date someone else in these circumstances. But I would have been much more compassionate if explained what are the clues for my best friend's feelings, rather than just being told I had feelings I didn't have."

129,"CRM admin. 

No college degree needed. 105 minute 60 question test for a certification. You only have to get 39 answers right. Cost $200 a test. You can take it as many times as you want and employers will never know. Answers are all posted online and you just memorize them. 

Prerequisite skill is Google searching. Daily skill is Google searching. Long term growth skills are coding, data science, and business. 

In my job search, my application to offer letter was 21 days. 0 years experience in that role from my previous career. I had a 4 year job history in a unrelated industry. My SAT score and GPA was laughable. My only saving grace was that I was not an ex convict and I would test negative for drugs if there was one. THIS WAS LAST MONTH. 

However, CRMs are only useful for industries that exchange goods and services for money or nonprofits where it is illegal to exchange goods and services for money. So everyone haha. 

Salary ceiling is about $150k after 8-10 years. You should only expect about $5k raise per year. After that, consider running your own firm.

I work about 60 hours a week with all the start up perks like free gym, coffee, snacks, and meals as well as stock options and bonuses. My employer also has open commission to any employee who brings in business but I have yet to take advantage of that (i doubt i ever will). 

Very little risk in responsibility. If anything happens, kick in the back ups and you’ll lose a about a days work. Just dont ever let it affect revenue. Thats the shit they can you for. You don’t have to manage anyone. Your supervisor wont know much about your job. So a lot of independence. "
130,"Not quite. The girlfriend was just a terrible person all around.

My former best friend however was maybe worse. She always needed to borrow money from me which I stupidly obliged. Until one day when she used her newborn child as an excuse for money to feed her unknown drug habit.

That was the last straw."

144,"I feel like a lot of it is just your own anxiety and insecurity causing you to ignore obvious signs.  If a girl is making signals toward your friend, it's easy to point them out because there's nothing at stake.  If a girl is making signals toward you, it's easy to ignore them because you naturally don't want to exit your comfort zone and face possible rejection."

There is probably a guy twice as charming and muscular as you are, who doesnt like dogs, but your dreamgirl and you like dogs. It's about compatibility, it's about the small things. When you found the person who enjoys all your little weird habbits and shares your views on this fucked up world, you'll stop looking for ""better"" because you have something better than just looks and meaningless words(you called it charm)."

159,"I hate that the older I get, the harder it is to find a genuine connection with people. When I was younger, I just wanted a girlfriend. Now, I have a much clearer picture of what I like and, equally important, what I need. I hate all the time and money I waste sorting through the mountains of “no’s”.

I hate even more how often it occurs that you meet someone amazing at the complete wrong time.

I can’t speak for everyone else, but I think the hardest quality to find is that balance between neediness and entitlement. I don’t want a woman who will compromise her core personality or values to be with me. I also don’t want a woman who wants me to compromise what’s important to me. I want an equal."

161,"That one is perfectly reasonable. It's one thing to be tolerant and supportive of how people choose to live, but sexual attraction is incredibly nuanced and personal. No one needs to explain or feel guilty about who they do or do not find attractive as a potential partner. As long as you're not a dick about it and make other people feel uncomfortable then it's nobody else's business."

You're fine. They reviewed the tape and found no issue. You also went to them and explained the situation.

She made a note in your file that everything is fine.

Thanks for the update, and I'm glad you took our advice ☺️"
164,"Well, we just separated 4 months ago but even after she became a mother I was still insanely attracted to her. More so because you see her go from a lover to a caring mother so it’s like a level up on attraction. You might say it kind of switches from more of lustful attraction to a more loved based attraction if that makes sense."

175,"Oh man, where do I start?

People must be inherently good, since we're coded to seek community and help one another. Then why are almost all children universally greedy, selfish assholes who have to be taught morals?

We are a product of the evironment we were raised in and our reactions to it, but we have the uncanny abilities to change our frames of mind in an instant.

We scoff at extremists, but in a way, if it weren't for their screaming, we'd never have looked up what some of the movements are actually about.

We want to act and talk like police violence is at an all time high (it might be idk) and that the police are the ""bad guys,"" but we still love cheering them on when they get someone else we label a ""bad guy.""

You should always apologize if you hurt someone's feelings, but never apologize for the way you feel or think.

I make small talk with most everyone, this girl in particular has an ice cream obsession so that's what we'd chat about

She came in a couple hours ago and waved me down (I was busy and didn't notice her immediately) to let me know my suggestion was good and off handily mentioned she had no plans all weekend. I was too much on autopilot working to notice the clear opening until about 30 minutes ago when I was rethinking the conversation

187,"She kept refusing my advances, putting them off at first, then stretching the time I should ask again out further and further into the future. We’d been married about five years then, and it’s been 12 years since. No point in asking anymore. Being constantly rejected isn’t attractive. "

189,"It's not difficult to tell if a woman is into you (or at least aspects of you,) the difficult part is figuring out whether she's open to doing anything about it. Even if they're not, most will still take any attention and validation you're willing to give her and it's no indication that ""I totally could have totally gotten in there."" So the only way to be absolutely sure is to ask."
190,"No, that's coincidence."
191,"Can't upvote this one enough.

*And* there are very few 'models' or 'bands' who actually get there..."
192,"Thanks for sharing a different perspective. In my opinion, if I trust my partner, it doesn't matter if his friend or even the hottest person on Earth is interested in him. All that matters is his feelings for me and how he'll respond to that temptation.

Personally, I think if I decide to cut a friend because my bf says so, then I'll regret it no matter what. Not even if later I find out that he had a good reason for that. I'll still regret it because he made me and it wasn't my own decision."

201,"Not a man, but as a woman, this is something I struggle with a little too! Probably not to the extent that your girlfriend does because I would never bring it up to my SO but it’s always a fear in the back of my mind. I was always told by my mom growing up that boys only liked girls for sex and every boys goal was to get me naked so that probably is where it stems from.  I think outside of that, society also pushes/values a woman’s beauty and sexuality more than men’s, pretty similar to how men feel pressured by society to be the money provider and that women like them for the stability they provide (I could definitely be wrong there though!). However, IMO, it’s unfair of her to accuse you of not actually caring for her and refusing to believe you if you’ve done nothing to make her think that!

That being said, my advice for the problem proposed: 
Maybe it would help her if after doing those sweet, romantic, things you make sure you don’t have sex with her for a while? Other than that the only thing I can think of is just staying with her and keep expressing love and complementing her on things other than her body and hope that she comes to realize that you love her for her, and sex is just a nice additional bonus!"

205,"My god the language in this thread ""gives it up"", ""puts out""; it's basically written as if only males enjoy sex or something and every opposite-sex sex act is some kind of semi-rape where the female party reluctantly just puts up with it and thinks of elegant and does her duties."
206,I’m not judging you for it because you can’t help not being attracted to saggy skin and deflation but this is really sad for her. 
207,"About 15 minutes.  I was young (about 21) and living with a roommate at the time who had previously smashed this 40 year old cougar that used to go to our local bar.  Having stopped by said local bar one night around closing time, I saw the cougar just hanging out by herself.  Knowing that she’s clearly an older woman that prays on younger men, I had a feeling that it would be a sure thing in my state of inebriation.  After talking to her for about 10-15 minutes, we were leaving the bar in her Jeep and heading back to her place.  Sure enough, as soon as we got to her place, clothes were ripped off and she freaking rocked my world.  Even better, in the morning she made me a nice breakfast before driving me home back to my house.  God bless cougars."
208,"Of course. Started of gently then after 6 months of it progressively getting worse just told her I wasn’t physically or sexually attracted to her anymore. She was mixed with being stressed and depressed and eventually said fuck it. Her new person is content with her physical appearance and now so is she, but as shitty as it sounds I was just disgusted by it. Constantly eating healthy, spending 5-6 days at the gym and then having a partner turn into a slob just sucks. No hard feelings tho. "
209,"I found crossing my legs at the ankles is  good compromise.

Look at the skeletons of men and women, specifically the angle of the femur to the pelvis. That's why men spread their legs more, not because we don't want women to be CEOs of companies. "
210,Huge turn off to me. Don't even want it around me. 
211,"I did, and my now wife isn’t crazy or obsessive or anything like that. We were long distance at the time and I had a history of drunken nights with this friend so I found her request justified.  It was a bummer losing a friend, but I think she understood the reason.  My wife has not made any more requests like this in the 12 years we have been together so I feel that I made the right decision.  She did throw a bit of a fit several years later to prevent us from traveling to the friends wedding, and that did bother me."
212,"Even when we fight, know that I'll still love you. 

That aspect of the relationship, as long as there is one, will be non-negotiable. It takes *a lot* for me to get to the point where I love someone and trust them unconditionally, so I'm never tossing that away in the heat of *any* fight unless you've done something that violates the core of what the relationship was built on. 

I may be angry with you for a time while we deal with the situation at hand, but I'll never not love you. "
213,"How old are you?

I ask because as I dated around and matured, I found that while the physical attraction element is still important, strong emotional and social compatibility is what has made me feel at home with a partner. I’ve learned to differentiate between infatuation and true long-term attraction."
214,"As a woman, it feels good to be reminded of a nice butt by your SO. Maybe you would see it more if you told her you missed it?"

Recently she was saying how her co-worker has the dedication to run every day no matter what. And she started arguing its different then motivation.

222,I didn’t believe in gay rights due to being in private school during my early years. I realized how wrong I was when I figured out I was gay during high school. 
223,"Not that what you do is wrong, but you definitely don’t live in a big city."
224,"Yeah. When a male friend cries or anything you don't say anything. You don't try to comfort them or tell them anything.

You just stand close and be there if they want you. Don't draw attention to it or bring it up. Let them decide what they want to do. If you want to cheer them up, don't make it clear it's because of the crying. Just pretend like you wanted to do it anyway. 

The fact that people think others need comfort or reassurance for perfectly normal reactions probably only makes them feel worse. Crying is fine, and if somebody's embarrassed about it, just don't draw any attention to it.

When it's clear that they don't want it to draw attention to it, DO NOT DRAW ATTENTION TO IT. "

233,"Well, shit man...strap in!

* got mad at me for going on a day-trip with a few mutual friends, because she worked on Saturdays at the time. 

* Threatened to *run away* when I asked her if she wanted to get together when I got back . Then got pissed at me when I said, ""Well, if you don't, I'd love to see you. If you do, be safe!"" Because who takes a 29 year old seriously when they threaten to run away?

* She claimed she didn't need me or anyone else. THEN, she asked me to go rafting with her. I made her aware that I can't swim and wouldn't go. She was undeterred by the fact that I can't swim and insisted I go. I help my ground. So then she downgraded to the swimming pool near me. Still can't swim, chlorine, in the amounts they used at the pool, fucks my skin all the way up. Told her to have fun in the pool and I'd hang out poolside, but I wasn't going in. She remained upset.

* She called me, mentioned how she had been feeling depressed. Had told me about self-harming as a teen. I asked if she had considered talking to a therapist. I grey up with a depressed parent. I've been to therapy. I know how serious depression is and how helpful therapy can be. She hung up on me. Then called back. 15 times over the subsequent hour. THEN came over, uninvited, when she didn't get ahold of me.

Those first 4 were all over about 36 hours :/

* Decided that I couldn't go to her house unless I was spending the night. She's a night-owl and late riser, has no car, lived across town, and worked erratic hours. I lived 10 minutes walking from work, am an early bed/early rise kinda guy, and work 9-5 M-F. Staying at her place during the week didn't make sense, and she worked weekends, so finding time then was hard.
As a result, I didn't go to her house often anymore. Which she then complained about :/

* got mad at me for having dinner with a mutual female friend. Accused me of cheating with her. They've known each other for longer than I've known either, but I had known this friend for at least 2 years. We had never been involved. Dropped such gems as ""You spend time alone with other women and expect me to feel nothing!!"", claimed that my dinner interfered with her ""plans to make plans with me"".

* Refused to initiate dates, but would complain that I wasn't doing it enough. Claimed it wasn't ""her natural role"", even though SHE had invited me out, had asked me if she could crash at my place when we hooked up, AND made the first move. But once we're dating, initiating isn't her natural role...Super bait and switch.

* Asked about my past relationships, then got mad at me over 2 women she knew that I had been with (she knew about one of them) 2-3 years before even *meeting* her. A month later, she asked for more info, and when I declined to discuss it, got upset that my past had ""closed doors that you get frustrated with me for knocking on""!

* related to above: This came out in a 3am nasty-gram she sent me. She had come over to collect some stuff at about 9pm (really just to give me the silent treatment) all dolled up with ""no idea what she was going to do that evening"". I'm pretty sure she was trying to make me jealous/insecure, but I had already gotten away from putting any emotional energy into her or the relationship, and figured just letting her leave in silence would be a better time than dealing with her behavior.

* Demanded I text her any time I was making social plans so she wouldn't be caught unaware. I said no, as I considered that controlling and invasive and don't need help with tracking my calendar.. She then downgraded to ""let's share a calendar, because my ex and I used to."" Still said ""no"", still wasn't interested in any dynamic that has anyone ""checking in"" with the other. Suggested she just ask me what I was up to if she wanted to hang out, like most people do. This wasn't acceptable to her.

* Once, I asked her if she'd like to get dinner. Her reply: ""I can't. I'm having dinner with Chris tonight!"". My reply: Oh, cool! Tell him I say ""hey!"".
Her reply: ""You're not worried?!""

* *Threw herself to the ground* when she tried to eat in my bed, I asked her to use the table, and wasn't willing to negotiate with her on how my property can be used.

* Knew I don't have any interest in cohabiting well before we dated. Tried to start the ""let's move in, or at least try staying at each other's homes for a week to see if cohabiting would work"" conversation 4 months in. Got upset when I was still uninterested in cohabiting.

* Knew I had had a vasectomy a decade before meeting her. Asked ""What happens when I decide I want a baby?"" Got upset at, ""Well, when that time comes, we'll need to break up so that you can find someone who is able and willing to create and parent children with you.

* Decided that the tone of my text messages (I used exclamation points liberally) was too positive, and was disrespectful of the difficulties she had experienced in life.

* Asked if I watch porn. Flipped her shit when I said ""yes"". Accused me of cheating on her, demanded I give up porn. I did ask, and our sex life was fine and she had encountered porn use in a relationship before....and this was her best foot forward on bringing her issue to me :/ This was the first time porn had been discussed.

There was a lot...but the general theme was her bursting into tears, screaming, or silence when something was up...instead of having a conversation. She had a lot of issues with jealousy and insecurity, and most of my friends are women...not a good situation for her.

There was also a pervasive element of hypocrisy. She was mad at me for having been with 3 women she knows before I met her. She had been with 5 dudes I knew when I met her and during our friendship. Me using porn was a huge issue, but when we had gotten together, it was open, and she had 3 other partners. That's cool, but watching some videos isn't. Earlie in the relationship, my facebook got shut down and I started a new one. She was going to write FB a letter about the issue, and I figured she'd fuck up and mention that I had a new account and get that one closed, so I asked her to hold off until we talked. She considered that controlling of me.

But later, when she demanded a say in how I masturbate/what I watch while I do so, that wasn't controlling.

This isn't even an exhaustive list or the most thoroughly detailed...but I think you see what I'm talking about. And this was all over 7 months. At first, with regards to her mental health, she mentioned having a ""mood disorder that makes me sad sometimes, but I have it in check."" 6 months in, she told me she had atypical-depression. After I broke up with her, she accused me of leaving her over her jealousy (YUP), refusal to initiate (YUP), and her *anxiety* (she had mentioned feeling anxious, but had never said ""I have an anxiety disorder"". Still hasn't. And, after she accused me of assault for dumping her, I think she has BPD too.

So, all in all, too many problems over too short a time and a WHOLE lot of them were more problems with her expectations and reactions than anything to do with real life. It also felt like she didn't love me, she just loved either the version of me she had created in her head, or the version of me she was trying to turn me into."

So I'm established, with a good job, 4 years after finishing my bachelor's, what would I have in common with someone who is just now (maybe) leaving the house, going to Uni, learning to live independently?

edit: Thanks for the support guys, it really does make me feel a bit better about myself having at least some redditors backup with this :) Just got in a breakup primarily due to my ex not really backing or supporting me with this situation. This situation wasn't going to be forever but I just felt that I had to step up and at least do this for the past few years to help my mother get through this hump since they were together over 30 years. So I guess really deep down, I do hope my future partner can stand by me with this situation and understand this. "

She got really angry and said ""it's the man's job to wait"". So I jokingly asked if she'd been intentionally being late every single time and she said yes she likes being waited for. That was super weird and j wasn't in love with her so I just broke it off. "

In east Asia, even back then, women were full members of society and could go out, work, talk to people who weren't their relatives, etc. Basically, they are and were considered human.  Same goes for Germany. 
 
When you are in Iraq or Afghanistan, you see that the women are little more than chattel, with less rights than cattle, and are locked away in compounds.  When you do see them they are always escorted by their male relatives and covered head to toe.  It's actually a bit freaky for an american because it seems like the entire civilization, as seen from the public spaces, is nothing but men.  

For many soldiers on deployment to the middle east, you don't even see a local woman from the time you set foot in country to the time you go home. This is probably the biggest reason.

I get called all varieties of authoritarian, old-fashioned, Tory (I'm a Labour party member), and other insults. It's stupid. If you want to take cannabis, you should be allowed to.

The big bold move is, you run your fingers lightly up the back of her upper arm.  It's one of those things that is really irritating or feels really good, depending on who is doing it.  Obviously you would only do this in certain contexts and if you already had some indication.  I did that once, as I leaned past her to get something from a shelf, and she gave a sharp intake of breath and went up onto her tiptoes, then she blushed and looked like she was struggling to regain her breath for a second.

But, I think what I'm really looking for is intimacy, who doesn't want to be wanted?  I think it's that feeling of physical intimacy that separates friendships and relationships. I REALLY want this to be the girl, but at the same time I think I want it more than I feel it (not to say she doesn't feel the same).

I've never had this problem with the partners I've had who saw sex as something *they* enjoyed and did for themselves as well as sharing. I have to wonder how much OP's gf really enjoys it - which is no indictment on OP, some just aren't in emotional control of their enjoyment enough so it easily becomes a chore.

She even told me that her ideal husband would be a man who understood this and that she would be completely open to him having sex with prostitutes but NOT with other women.

I also dated a woman who always wanted me to perform oral sex then would roll over and go to sleep without any reciprocation.

408,"Think in the abstract.

You are hiring for the ""boyfriend"" position. It might have a lot of overlap with the ""friend"" class spec, but there are unique things you are looking for.  Things like wants kids, career aspirations, an ass that you can bounce quarters on.

You get a resume for Jeff. Looks solid on paper, might be a little ""light"" in the height department, but passes the minimum qualifications. He has excellent references(you best friend Jan saw him in a speedo at the pool). He also has not worked for your competition (that bitch Sharon who stole your other crush Tom), Great! So you bring him for an interview.

Are you going to have the same interview questions as you do when you are hiring a friend? HELL NO, you are going to want to ask deep, probing questions to find out if he is going to be a good fit for this executive, exclusive, position.

You know YOU are hiring for boyfriend, you also want to know if HE is hiring for the same position. He might be hiring for a temp position that only lasts for 6 months.   Your interview questions should be designed in such a way that you learn both of these things over the course of the interview process(multiple dates). You ask in a way that allows you to learn more about how he will fit with your organization while also checking if he is constantly jumping to different jobs(sending you home in the morning after making pancakes).

Now at the end, you might realize that he doesn't pass the boyfriend interview, but he definitely passes the ""fuck buddy"" interview(see previous Jan comments) and so you adjust accordingly.

The overall point is that he is also doing the same thing for you.  If everything you do makes him think he is in a friend interview? Well he is going to assume as such, especially if he is treated the same as your male friends.

Edit: If he is hiring for the GF position and you rebuke him? They might push you to the second interview if you have an awesome pair of qualifications, but that will only take you so far before they say ""Thanks, but we are going to look for a different candidate"""

Meta-analytic research shows its test-retest reliability to be far below significant and it is highly sensitive to changes in mood and recent context (basically it measures more your moods and opinions in the moment than it's intent of measuring a stable personality ""type"").

I still watch it occasionally, but...it gets old REALLY quick because almost every anime series feels exactly the same.

The melodrama, the long exposition explaining what is literally happening on-screen, the flashbacks, the overused animation tropes (crying streams of tears, falling down when someone says something dumb, etc.), these clichés are used in like 90% of all anime.

One day we were in bed about to sleep and she asked if we were ever going to have sex again. I told her I wasn’t attracted to her at this weight and asked if she was ever going to lose the weight. She said no because she didn’t care about being fit anymore. She walked out the next day.

It might have been my relative sobriety, but it felt a lot more grimy and I've been trying to avoid it ever since. When you meet someone in a bar/club you can have an evening before you get there.

475,"When we first got together, she was 25, and I was 21. Because she had more experience being an adult in general, I was sort of like her pet at first. I didn't have as much agency or independence as she did, and there wasn't as much give and take as there should have been. She got the benefit of getting the most control, and I got the benefit of not having the most responsibility. In hindsight, that was not a very healthy dynamic, and if we'd stayed together without growing out of that attitude, that would've been a recipe for disaster. Thankfully once my first daughter came along just a few years later, the 2 of us really needed to apply ourselves a lot more, and there wasn't much room for me to relax as much. I thankfully stepped up, and in doing so, I got a lot of my own agency, and our relationship got a lot more balanced. 

she's way different than she was when we first met, because people just grow and change in general, but being a mother wasn't as much of a change for me, compared to how it might've been for other people. The idea that she was the nurturer, who provided stability, was not a new concept. Only now, it's thankfully in a more appropriate context. "

EDIT: Some more thoughts. Popular culture has totally distorted what young people expect from a relationship. If it isn't a picturesque beginning that could be milked into a three part movie trilogy and clothing line (especially if you're in a big city)...NEXT! There isn't enough popular culture actually promoting and idealizing the day to day mundanity and pleasantries of an actual, healthy relationship. "

It doesn't happen to every gay man, but I myself had some major issues with being gay and didn't start having sex until 25. My teenage years weren't mine to live. I'm 28 now and am still figuring things out. 

On the bright side, I feel less of a rush to settle down, since it seems like most gay men don't rush to get married. Being single in your late 20s or early 30s isn't as bad, because there is still a fairly large dating pool of single men to choose from.

Went with a friend to some art exhibition, was bored out of my mind because I thought it was pretty trash and very 'art for the sake of art'. So I went outside for some fresh air (it was actually at a really nice location), saw a woman sitting outside, smoking, also clearly bored to tears. 

Shot the shit with her for a little bit, basically ripping on the whole art exhibition. I say ""I'm bored, wanna go do something else?"" She's like ""Sure, wanna come back to my place?"" I message my friend (who was annoyed that I didn't think it was as great as she'd hyped it, also low-key flirting with the artist for the art exhibition who I thought was a bit of a pompous git and full of himself) that I was heading out. 

So I go to the woman's place, and on the way there she makes her intentions *very* know, like sitting right next to me in the cab and sliding my hand onto her lap and stuff. As soon as I set foot into her apartment and the door closed, clothes were just flying off. 

I think my mindset was more:

    Processing.
    Processing..
    Processing...

488,"Nothing is bad about it, that being said don't use it as a tool to try and keep him interested. If you both want it, go for it. It is what it should be, just some fun.  Also the other bad thing is the risk of being ""chucked n fucked"" if you are looking for something serious, holding off for long can weed out the fuckboys but if your down for potentially just a hookup then go with it. in this usually a relationship is unfixable if you sleep and he ghosts, because now you are seeing his true intentions. 

Some see it as slutty, really though it's fucking 2018. We need to lose this attitude of labelling sex as a bad thing. As for the guys who are going to judge you for sleeping on the first date, ask yourself do you really want to be with someone like that? Someone who probably sleeps around a lot but criticises you for doing so? You aren't gonna be approved by everyone in life,  so don't try. Life is short so make the most of it. "
489,"One step at a time. As soon as the honeymoon phase is over though you have to start planning to close the gap and be in the same location permanently whether that means one of you moved to the other, or you both move somewhere new.

Generally we are oblivious."
507,"So my ex cheated on me, left me heartbroken. The worst part was that we were engaged and we'd been together for about 5 years at this point. For the next year I was an alcoholic, drank myself to sleep every night and spent every night curled up in a ball around my pillow screaming into it. Didn't remember falling asleep for an entire year. I'd discovered if I drank my emotions out at night and cried everything out I could function normally during the day.

Eventually my close friends began to notice that my smile never touched my eyes.

I was severely depressed.

I bought a rope.

One night at a fraternity party I drank in excess. I didn't care about myself, I planned on killing myself the next day, so fuck it. If I died from alcohol poisoning it'd be an easier way out anyway. My subconscious cared more about me than I did and went and told my brothers that I planned on offing myself. I've been told that I spent 4 hours crying into a bunch of guys arms in the upstairs of the house, guests were turned away from the stairs for the first time. The next day I woke up in a dorm I didn't recognize half blind missing a contact, and still hammered drunk. Someone had pillaged my room and taken all my booze, and rope....

Over the course of the next 6 months I spent my time crying into my brothers arms. Every girl that discovered I was depressed walked away from me. My brothers made me burn pictures of her, made me give them my soon-to-be wedding ring that I had taken to wearing, and went above and beyond to help me, never letting me drink a drop of booze. (Except one time when I stole some and started chugging, it was a bad day and I recall having a finger down my throat in the bathroom puking it all up and bawling)

---------------------------

So eventually I started to get better. At the tail end of it (half a year after blackout) when I was finally starting to get better I wanted to prove that I was over that bitch. So I took a chance and went after this big boobed chick.

Big boobs didn't like me. Introduced her little (sorority thing) to me to get me the fuck away. Little (also petite and short so the name works) started stalking me. She fell for me quickly since I listened to her problems (friend (and former boyfriend)'s suicide) so we were both a bit fucked up at the time.

Well... She really started stalking me when she found out I was depressed. She was the first girl to care and she went a little overboard when she found out about my thwarted suicide attempt. She saw me as someone to desperately help.

She got to know my schedule. I refused to turn her down when she was sad cause I knew what it was like. She followed me everywhere. She kept asking me to hang. I kept denying her. This went on for a while. Finally she asked what I was doing and I stupidly said ""nothing"" so she conned me into watching a movie with her. Before I went my roommate gave me a condom and told me to, ""be safe.""

When the movie finished Little kissed me and felt said condom in my pocket, asked what it was, I told her my stupid roommate gave it to me and said to ""be safe."" She asked if i wanted to ""Be safe."" And... Well... I'm only a man.

Some... time... passes, and I go to Big Boobs to ask for her permission to potentially pursue Little. She tells me ""Fine just don't have sex with her."" Uh... yeah. I agree. ^^^wink

A week later I'm sick in another state and she's the only one that cares. In a fever haze I realize I love her.

One year after our first date at a state park I propose to her, she says yes. A year and a half goes by and suddenly we're at an alter. 11 months ago we said ""I do."" and had a massive wedding with my redneck giant family, my fraternity, and her sorority and tiny family.

--------------------

She's.... an Aspie. She's not the best at picking up on subtlety and nuance and I didn't know this at the time. I thought it was hella creepy that she stalked me then too, but after discovering her inability to read social cues it started to make sense. Learning that she was always honest and basically incapable of lying... helped. A lot. She's a great person.

She's a goof and she means well. I love her with all my heart."
508,That's exactly what someone with internalized subliminal patriarchy would say.
509,"I would call my friends and say, ""Later Virgins"" "
510,Well I smoke weed so I prefer a girl I can get silly and naked with. 
511,"I have equal amount of respect for all people, whatever their age, race, gender, (etc ...) and I do know that western society isn't  perfect and I kind won the lottery by being a cis-het white man but boy do I hate the ""woe is me"" mindset that is fairly pervasive among my fellow millenials.

Like we get it, life is shit and unfair but I feel most of those professional complainers are hardly the lead character in their own life but rather a supporting character.

I hang in a few SJW-esque places on the interweb, both out of curiosity and because I do subscribe to the high-level ideals, but sometimes it's a circlejerk of grievances and prone to mob-like dumb stuff. So much for being progressive I guess."
512,no don't make him self conscious. just be a bro and reach out and zip it up for him.
513,"We both got old. While I might not be super attracted to her right after sex like I used to be, after 2-3 days of no sex, she gets much more attractive."
514,Checking in because I am white and my last name is knight:  most women are reluctant to admit they love wedding stuff but they do. 
515,I feel you brotha.
516,"It gives people a false sense of superiority/security. I deleted my dating profiles and am trying to do everything irl now, but I'm completing with 20+ guys she's matched with just today. "
517,"It's not necessarily that you need to be more ""feminine,"" it just seems like you maybe need to re-prioritize your goals a bit or accept that you're not in a place to be in a relationship right now. Relationships take some sacrifice on both sides. You'll have to give up something if you want to truly dedicate yourself to someone, and they'll have to do the same."
518,"[Dendrocnide moroides, also known as the **stinging brush, mulberry-leaved stinger, gympie gympie, gympie, gympie stinger, stinger, the suicide plant, or moonlighter**, is common to rainforest areas in the north east of Australia. It is best known for stinging hairs that cover the whole plant and deliver a potent neurotoxin when touched. It is the most toxic of the Australian species of stinging trees. The fruit is edible if the stinging hairs that cover it are removed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrocnide_moroides)

Who the fuck wants to chance getting stung to eat the fruit? "
519,Did you end up going home with the lucky bastard?
520,This guy gets the tip 
521,I believe that all countries should be democratic even though my whole life (not just the last two years) has made it abundantly clear that many people are too stupid to vote and the world would be better off with a benevolent dictatorship.
522,Doing it belly up usually helps too
523,"In regards to when this happened with me and my ex.....   
Her appearance was phenomenal, she was slender with a pretty face and ample assets. But her attitude was awful. Everything was a fight, a struggle, a big deal. If you've ever heard the phrase ""pick your battles"", with her almost everything was a battle. After about a year it didn't matter that she was ridiculously beautiful, because I just wasn't that interested anymore. Anytime I would look at her all I could hear were the words of the previous argument, all I could see was the next one coming.   
I tried to explain that I wanted to argue less and would be willing to work on it  together. Anyone who has been with someone like this knows exactly how this talk goes over with king/queen drama.   
Didn't work out. I walked away in the end.    "

"
525,Dating a horse girl. 
526,And you listened to them saying “dont bring anyone home”?
527,Don't make a big deal of it. He would probably feel more embarrassed if you did that. Maybe just a reach and subtle hand-grab or leg pat would do it. 
528,6×9 = ayylmao
529,"The myth that they're always clean and prim, and never messy.

Bitch please, you make me look organized."
530,"Yeah. I once convinced a girlfriend that evolution is a real phenomenon. I figured it was because of how she was raised and not because she was stupid. It took *years.* I think it only actually worked because she was also a premed student and the dots started to connect. 

For a while she agreed that evolution was real on the cellular level, and then that all other animals evolved but not humans. It was gradual, but in the end I think she saw the truth. 

I’ll never do that again. "
531,"""When men hang out, we insult each other but we don't really mean it. When women hang out, they compliment each other, but they don't really mean it either."""
532,Kilometres of dick. 
533,Your testosterone is probably elevated. Now would be a good time to go for some new PRs in the gym. It's the body's way of motivating you to get with her.
534,"She was like 4’11 and had no idea how to kiss, or do anything sexual. I felt like I was having sex with a 13 year old, She was 22. Lost erection and just left. Felt like I was doing something fucking illegal. "
535,"""Oh alright"" and then I left to find someone else to talk to."
536,"Lunchables

The Capri Sun in it takes me back to 1986. My inner child can never die. "
537,"If she is still breastfeeding, keep in mind that her body is producing a hormone that practically kills the production in estrogen. This means a sex drive is all but negated. It would be similar to if sex never crossed your mind and you absolutely had zero erections for a year. Sex just wouldn't even cross your mind.  
  
This may not be your situation, but once I read that my wife's lack of sex drive while breastfeeding was hormonal (completely out of her control) then I was more understanding, and it was easier to accept."
538,I want Medicare for all.  I know the administration will suck and I know it will be terribly abused.  I think there must be some co-pay to keep people more honest.    Radiolab did a story about how rehab scams after Obamacare were a billion dollar business that were using the addicted as cash cows.  Totally bilking the system.   
539,"I think the NFL players should stand for the anthem, out of respect. But now that they’re being mandated to, makes me support their kneeling. "
540,How can you be *sure* though...?
541,"Interested in sex, yes. Interested in a relationship? Only if they're really desperate."
542,"Here's their two favorite positions:

The starfish: Lay on your back spread out and do nothing. 

The coffee table: Do your very best table impression. Remember, tables don't move. "
543,"When she fucking told me so.

Flirting is fun, but if she isn't willing to state her feelings then she will be trouble down the line."
544,"Hammock.

I was having shoulder an and back pain, and started to really dislike my temperpedic bed. Switching to a Brazilian hammock solved these problems. Super comfortable, hated traveling and being forced to sleep in a box spring bed.

I ended up going back to a box spring after about ten years due to a shoulder injury where the physical therapist was concerned that the hammock would aggravate the injury. 

I'd still be using a hammock otherwise.
