February 28th 2017. 6:43pm. My husband called out to me from our bedroom where he had walked into in order to get our 14 month old daughter up from a late nap so I could feed her. I remember rolling my eyes and thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs just poop‚Äù as he called for me to ‚Äúcome help me for a min‚Äù since I assumed she has experienced a diaper blow out that he didn‚Äôt want to deal with so he could get back to our older daughter. 

In fact, due to a blood clot that blocked her portal vein, she‚Äôd developed a condition called esophageal varices-thinned out bubbles on the small veins of her throat caused by the increased pressure in those veins-pressure created because the blood clot prevented blood from flowing into her liver. 

What my husband had actually found was the aftermath of those bubbles popping causing her lose between 1/3 and 1/2 of her blood volume.   I walked in saw it. Snapped pics as I called 911. 

She ultimately spent 42 days in the hospital including two other major ruptures, and one 8 hour open abdomen corrective surgery.  During those days she spent about five total in medically induced comas, had to be retaught to walk twice since she had just learned before this happened. 

This pic is an overview of her crib from that night.   Def boarderlinw NSFL

Edit to add: the munchkin is doing amazing now. She is a dino loving terrorist who enjoys being a daredevil and giving us all heart attacks bc ‚ÄúJesus Christ we did not fight to keep you alive to have you die jumping off the back of the sofa!!!‚ÄùüòÇ wonder Wendy is her nickname and she really lives up to it!

Second edit; I put together a second album of pics. The very last one is her today!
