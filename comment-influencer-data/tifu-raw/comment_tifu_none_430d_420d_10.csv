1,"&gt; 15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally. I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue. 

Please don't hesitate; doctors literally aren't going to care and have heard just about everything. I am really troubled to hear it still hurts and you've lived this long with it--don't wait any longer! "
2,"I feel like no, but there is really no way to know without a true peer reviewed study. We will need multiple children, and some very questionable consent forms. "
3,Lame ass company to work for. It went to a vote. You shouldnt have been singled out for it. You only cast one vote (if any) plus they had a great turnout which would be a positive thing for the meeting.

17,"NONONONONO!

YOU, The Company, gave us the option to suggest restaurants, so I did.

YOU, The Company, decided to put those suggestions into a democratic vote.

YOU, The Company, failed to screen the choices or look into the restaurant chosen as the winner

YOU, The Company, continued to fail to look into the venue as you organized your event, and several managers OK'd all these decisions.

So don't come blame ME, the lowly employee, because YOU were neglectful an undiligent in your duties of planning this event.

EDIT: This is a fucking joke, you dolts! In no way would I speak like this to an employer because I know I'd be seeing the door the next second. Please stop taking Reddit so seriously, otherwise you'll have a bad time"

20,"They should've known what each and every suggestion was... I mean, if someone had suggested a $100/plate restaurant, and that was chosen, it'd also be a huge issue. 

Sounds like the person whose as should've been on the chopping block did a lot of finger pointing. What idiot agrees and schedules a company meeting at a place they don't even google? If I had to schedule my companies IT all hands meeting, I'd even go and eat lunch at the chosen resturant the day before, as my boss, his boss, and all the directors would know I set it up!

Wow."
24,"Minus the threesome sounds like a story about my wife‚Äôs ant and uncle.  He has a fake leg and she is   schizophrenic. When they get mad at each other she hides his leg and he hides her meds.  But they have been together for probably 40 years so... whatever works.  

A few years ago they were driving on a road trip and she starts having an episode.  She forgets who his is, thinks she is being kidnapped and started yelling at truckers on the highway about it.  She starts to open the door at 70 MPH so he slows down and pulls over truckers do so also and she runs out of the car to the truckers asking them to save her.  One of the truckers pulls a gun and her uncle puts his hands up.  Through an intense couple of mins, he tried to explain the situation. They of course don‚Äôt believe him. Then he finally asks the truckers to ask her what her husbands name is.  She tells them and then he asks the truckers to pull out his wallet and look at his license.  

Turns out the name she gave was his so things started to chill out a little.  Ya know, the trucker puts down the gun.  But still a pretty interesting series of  events.  "

He's got a map and flares *but he doesn't fucking have other gear like a radio?* And why did they not turn around when it started to get cold and it was clear OP's date wasn't dressed for the elements? 

I mean, I know guys who volunteer in SAR and they've told stories of some dumber-than-a-sack-of-bricks kind of people that needed their asses saved, and OP sounds like he might be one of them and just got insanely lucky that he didn't need saving.

&gt;I've been curious about hamster lactation for the purposes of making cheese. There's a huge lack of literature on hamster lactation cycles and I'm beginning to wonder if this project is possible. This is a serious project.

&gt;1) how much milk can a healthy hamster produce per day

&gt;2) what species produces the most milk

&gt;3) is hamster milk suitable for making cheese

&gt;4) what kind of equipment (if any) is suitable for milking hamsters

&gt;5) will hamsters keep lactating after they've finished rearing

OP's comments are even better.

&gt;What are you planning on doing with hamster cheese?

&gt;**Eating some, selling the rest.**

&gt;**Can't afford enough hamsters without being sure I can make enough cheese to turn a profit tbh**

142,"\[Warning: gross\]

I can sympathize--that's pretty much exactly what happened to me early in grad school. I was spending the summer in Seattle with my girlfriend (away from campus in Chicago), and wasn't 100&amp;#37; sure how my crappy student health care would transfer, so I didn't get that nasty infected ingrown armpit hair looked at. Right before we left to drive back home, I had these reddish-white streaks up my neck and extending down my arm, and it was oozing a little, so I finally went in to the local university clinic. They freaked out, put me on an IV antibiotic drip immediately. 

The fun part was how they dealt with the infected armpit abscess, which went in pretty deep. The doctor basically had me lie down and raise my arm, and then they put on goggles, put one thumb on either side of the hole and just put their whole weight on the infected armpit. It geysered blood and pus. It hurt so much, I cannot even. They told me I couldn't leave until the infection reduced, and if the wound closed the abscess would reinfect, so they stuffed the infected hole with a wick-like gauze that stuck out of my armpit to keep it from closing.  Every day, they'd pull it out and pack in new armpit wick, as the inside healed.

The thing is, we had to get back, so my girlfriend was shown how to do it, and on the road trip home, she'd pack my nasty armpit hole with gauze while I screamed/whimpered. (If that isn't true love, I don't know what is.)"

This isn't OP's fault and I think his employers understand this, but this has a huge potential to bite them in the ass down the road. It just takes one unhappy female employee to sue for this meeting to be brought up and discussed. 

Also, could you imagine what the public reaction would be to hearing this on the news? ""Oh they held a CORPORATE MEETING at twinpeaks... of course the person suing must be in the right. This Company is sexist."" so on and so forth"

182,"I'm guessing that OP sometimes uses prosthetics and sometimes uses a wheelchair, and he forgot that he didn't have any prosthetics attached."
183,"I came here to write this. I‚Äôm a girl with guns who tries to get my girl friends also into guns. After the second time I took my friends out shooting and someone ended up with some toasted titties, I started bringing extra crew neck t-shirts. "
184,"""*Box of Pringles""*

185,Who the hell sends a text about a cat with only ‚Äúneed help‚Äù and doesnt add any info in the SAME message. 
186,Reading a book? Wtf. Thats some terrible management dont go back to that pool
187,I thought it was the fuckin TV show.
188,I don't know if Im that skilled.
189,you can just draw over her face
190,"Or if someone put in a restaurant that couldn't fit everyone. So many ways for this to go wrong. OP doesn't deserve a write-up, whoever organized this does."
191,"It's selfless of you to be worried about that the most, but with the state of America right now I would be really concerned about people thinking you were a threat and shooting you or something insane. Glad you all got home safe in the end"
192,"No judgment from me. I had a little 22 cal, 9-shot that I would practice with sometimes. One day I thought I had counted 9 but I had only shot 8. I gave it a little Clint Eastwood twirl before holstering it and Blam! Was VERY lucky that I didn't shoot myself. Everybody has brain farts. It's just extra dangerous to have one when there are firearms involved. "
193,The doctor was stumped.
194,Good thing your dad didn't try to force you to have a cigarette after
195,"&gt; something we call pus here

Must be from down the street"
196,Really these jokes are just crippling.
197,"I worked ten years at an emergency room. Human bites *always* get infected, and usually with multiple strains of bacteria at once. Don't wait too long to get to a doctor.

Once it starts to turn red, or swell, or feel warm to the touch, then the infection has already set in and you need to go immediately. It's easier to take care of before it reaches that point."
198,"I doubt OP uses prosthetics. I'm no expert but I don't think they have enough leg to fit a functional prosthetic to. 2"" of femur wouldn't really extend past your balls..."
199,The worst thing I did when I was seven was climb a waterfall. Not stick shit up my dick hole. 
200,The best part is that OP thinks his date ‚Äúlooks back on it fondly‚Äù even though she promptly unfriended him on Facebook and never spoke to him again.

Playing this version would just make things more awkward "
202,"TIL: Humans can ceviche themselves!

Thanks for this great write-up, i love drinking tropical stuff on the beach and would never have thought about this. I'm glad you were able to get to the bottom of it! "
203,OP tried wayyyyyy too hard
204,"It was cute, but when you havent been laid in over a month. Dammit, it sucks."
205,Congratulations on accidentally evading putting your dick in crazy. 
206,"That's a pretty monumental FU. Imagine being the owner and finding the door to your livelihood unlocked and the fucking safe open as well! You're lucky they didn't completely lose their shit.

Protip: When you lock a door, test it. Then test it again, while looking at the door and thinking very clearly ""this door is locked and I checked it"". Do this every single time, without exception.

Now when you get home and think ""oh shit did I lock the door?"" you'll know for certain that you did.

Do this on the safe door as well, obviously."
