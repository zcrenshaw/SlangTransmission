Work: ‚ÄúMaybe I better take the day off. This insurance situation isn‚Äôt gonna take care of itself.‚Äù"
1,Least the grasshopper had the good decency to hang round and share in the blame. Hope you didn't immediately swat him with the wiper blades. 
2,"Hey, at least you know your daughter can defend herself, now all you have to worry about are your sons lol."
3,Ooh why didn‚Äôt I think of wiper blades OMG
4,"&gt;maid costume comes off

You're no fun."
5,"You look at her, wide-eyed, hands outstretched in a shrug and say:

""Honey. Let me eggsplain."""
6,"One could say you were given a second wind.

Seriously though, wish you a speedy recovery!"
7,"""...and that's the story about how I soft killed an F-15 fighter plane when I was fresh out of engineering school. Woah girls, one at a time!"" -you, I hope."
8,"&gt; I managed to successfully guess her grandmothers favorite flower (yellow rose), the fact that her grandmother often knit her mittens for Christmas (pretty common among grandmothers), the fact that her grandmother had an assortment of flower-painted china-ware. You know, typical grandma stuff.

I don't know how to tell you this, but you're a medium."
9,"""*We'll call said girl Norman*""

Plz, no."
10,Why did you call her NORMAN? 
11,"If it makes you feel any better, I've had my dick burnt twice now, and I was sober.

I'm just a fucking moron."
12,"""I was born spicy""

- your child"
13,Nope! He was laughing too hard
14,"so the next role play is the ""Visit by the tooth fairy,"" right? you have the prop for it now."
15,"Well, first time I was smoking a cig while on the toilet, and vastly over estimated the space available to ash in and inadvertently flicked a hot ember onto the tip of my dick. 

I got a LOT of sympathy head from the gf for that. 

Second time, we were all waiting for a movie to begin and got bored. My buddy (named Dicky funnily enough) had sparklers with him for some reason, and we all agreed that seeing my crotch ""sparkle"" would be high-larious. 

My jeans caught fire, and Dicky quite literally beat the ever loving fuck out of my flaming crotch in an attempt to put out the fire. 

I watched the midnight showing of Snakes on a Plane with a giant hole in my pants, a burnt dick, and bruised ego.

Unfortunately, Dicky did not give me any sympathy head.

Bastard. "
16,Yep! They‚Äôve all been taught self defense skills to some degree. I guess she just paid attention 
17,I decided this was a cat collar. I gifted this to Norman.
18,literally had pain in my dick from reading that 
19,"RIP boiling water, you will be mist. "
20,"Not all the way off, sorry for the confusion, just the necessary parts if you're catchin my direction. "
21,I don't have one now either LOL
22,But did he write you a ticket??
23,The fact you put on sunglasses while they were yelling at you from their car had me dying
24,Upvoted for continuing like a boss
25,Putting on sunglasses to avoid hearing them yelling was the most logical thing to do
26,"I did this. My family has never let me forget it. It was 2am, I woke up hungry, put the eggs on and for some reason went back to bed. The smell hung around for weeks üòÇ oops"
27,"I like the subtitles (i.e. Part IV: The Chase). They add a little spice to the story. Btw, it sounds like your town is small enough for you to run into them again. Best of luck."
28,Priorities right there
29,"/r/shittylifeprotips After teaching your children self defense techniques, occasionally jump them to make sure they paid attention!"
30,"As I recall, we did have to register with the airport tower that we were a radar emitter in their area. So they knew who we were and where we were. The Air Force also knew we had a contract to develop this gizmo. So there was no way we could hide."
31,One of my coworkers at the time had flown 105‚Äôs in Vietnam. He called it ‚Äúpucker factor‚Äù. His favorite statement was ‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt hammer a mosquito‚Äôs nose up my ass with a sledgehammer‚Äù.
32,Go to the local news with the story. You can get the police file of your incident and the file of the burglary that took place after.
33,"The path the dick leads is a rough one, I‚Äôll tell you that."
34,"[""Phimosis""](http://www.chennaicircumcisionclinic.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/phimosis-circumcision-treatment-640x320.jpg) you say?"
35,"This was great!!!
How did they find you?"
36,Sally sounds just awful 
37,Some times it's just better to honestly admit you were doing something stupid than try and come up with a silly excuse or get defensive. More often than not honesty goes a long way in these interactions. 
38,"If the company didn't include important information in the schematic and also is leaving you to train yourself, then only they can be to blame for the mistake. 
You're an intern, someone who needs supervision and training. The only thing you could have done is ask for help so it's not entirely your fault."
39,They look very similar when you set them on fire.
40,"Made me think of an inmate I knew when I was working security at a maximum security prison. This guy was in the disciplinary unit, so every time he left his cell, he had to be handcuffed behind his back. He didn‚Äôt care; as soon as he got the opportunity, he would swing his arms up and over his head to the front. Absolutely the most double jointed person I‚Äôve ever met. It was damned impressive to watch. Fortunately he was really laid back too; I think he was in disciplinary for breaking rules, but not for any kind of violence. "
41,Nooo!
42,There's no such thing as an implied component in a schematic.  If it's not on the schematic then it's incomplete.  Otherwise there's no point in  even making out a schematic.  Don't feel bad.  That was a trap just waiting for someone to fall into it.
43,How? I too am a moron and now fear dick burns.
44,Drift
45,"This story was hilarious, 10/10 would recommend again. "
46,"‚ÄúOh so that‚Äôs how you use their momentum to make them kick their own ass, thanks dad!‚Äù
~ Daughter probably"
47,I can understand the reaction. That pilot's heart probably nearly jumped out of his chest. 
48,"What kind of car was it? Tbh, your mechanic friend wouldn't have known what it was unless the issue was being duplicated in front lf him. "
49,The lengths people go to just to watch Cars 2 in Cinemas. 
50,"No, I caught his direction. He's going down South."
51,"Heh... I was already married, sorry. We‚Äôve been married now over 35 years, three kids..."
52,"Yikes, this was a rough first reading"
53,"I can't believe you just had the urge to pretend to be a medium and back out of it like ""Ok haha"""
54,ULPT: Keep a bag of dead grasshoppers with you to avoid speeding tickets.
55,Nv
56,"Same, and I don‚Äôt even have one xd"
57,"All three because of that one day.

-cbelt3, probably"
58,"Fianc√©e's response: ""Just for that, I want a divorce."""
59,Norman Bates would def spike a dates drink 
60,"Tomorrow we're going to see a ""TIFU by leaving my passport at home... AGAIN."""
61,"This x100. You'll get a lot more interest from the police department once you make them look bad on the news, especially if it goes viral. "
62,So it‚Äôs a real spice girl.
63,I had a similar experience but I got real lucky I somehow managed to get control of the bike. It was the scariest moment of my life. I've never tried going fast in small lanes henceforth. 
64,"Ass. You start with him slapping your ASS, people. "
65,"At that age he antagonized the shit out of her all the time and, at least once daily I told him that she‚Äôs going to snap one of those days and I wouldn‚Äôt stop it. She did,  and I felt guilty so I stopped it. "
66,Molar? I hardly know her. 
67,"Holy shit 

Poor random guy he must be freaked out "
68,"&gt;Norman

&gt;She

&gt;Can't get it in.

That fucked with me for a bit. 
"
69,"Well, yeah. I think the contract was cancelled though. "
70,"Another fellow sufferer of Phimosis. Just practice loosening your foreskin by regular tugging, that's what my doctor advised and it works. My sausage peels smooth as a butter now."
71,A Grand Am looks *nothing* like an Eclipse...
72,At least they now were sure it worked fine ;)
73,Best riskyclick so far today.

76,"That's what my doctor called it, but Google apparently confuses it with the Pediatric Assessment Triangle, which is completely different.

 I guess officially it's just called the tripod position: [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod\_position**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod_position)**.**

When healthy people do it, it's typically because they've just exercised a whole lot, and they stand up with their hands on their knees. When I do it, I'm sitting cross-legged on the bed with my hands on my knees rocking back and forth trying to batch my breath. Until my doctor gave it a name I didn't even realize that I instinctively did it when my breathing goes south."
77,That sounds like a separate TIFU
78,"&gt;...she's on top, and I go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and *bend her over top of me*...

Huh? I need a diagram. Is she facing you or facing away? Is she perpendicular to you or bent over? Are you trying to bring her in close or roll her over? What is your vector of attack?

Please use standard ASCII characters to portray this."
79,"LPT: boil the water, put the eggs in, turn off burner, put on lid, remove from heat, wait 15 minutes for perfectly hard boiled egg (or you can wait as long as you‚Äôd like or even forget without exploding eggs). "
80,I think some anger management classes or another form of counseling would be beneficial for you 
81,You really screwed yourself there mate. 
82,"""raised by it. You merely adopted the spice."""
83,You don't recover from copd. Its a living hell. I work with copd patients among other things and I couldn't begin to imagine life feeling short of breath always.
84,"I read this and put it in my pocket. But I guess my pocket had ""nv"" to say =|"
85,What's the Triangle of respiratory distress? I googled it but only got charts / graphs. 
86,[deleted]
87,At least you were wearing a bra. No lasting damage done. Burn the dress. It will lift the curse.
88,You opened your frank instead of your beans!
89,A natural response.
90,How long have you been waiting to say those exact words
91,"Good. Do not repeat my mistake.

And always wear a helmet. "
92,Reflecting the haters
93,"Never ever ignore the smell of fuel coming from your car. NEVER!!!! That shit is literally created to combust and catch fire extremely efficiently and not with much heat.

You‚Äôre lucky. "
94,"..... I could populate this entire sub with my idiocy.

And a good portion of it would involve me setting myself on fire in various ways.

I should not be allowed near open flames."
95,There are several stages to gun radars. Search. (Find target) Concentric Scan (refine target). Firing (tracks the target AND the cloud of cannon shells and moves the turret to bring them together). They are different signals to a radar detector.
96,"For a nurses aide coarse, our instructor had us replicate what would be similar to living with COPD. She had us tape up one end of a straw and poke just a few holes in the tape with a tack and try to walk up the hallway breathing through just that straw, most of us felt faint and light-headed just a quarter of the way up, so I definitely have empathy for people whom have to live with that kind of suffering on a day to day basis.  This lesson taught us all patience and understanding for those we cared for with this disease so that we would be more tolerant and understanding when they required some extra time with ADLs and such. "
97,"That legendary save, who just lights someones fence on fire lol"

100,"Turned out to be a part of her handbag so all in all, 10/10 gift"
101,My old roommate did this to me.  Got to an airport an hour away from the house and realized he‚Äôd left his passport.  Called me and had me bring it to him.  Bastard still owes me a dinner at Ruth Chris for saving his bacon.  I broke dozen of road laws getting that thing to him.
102,"Block number.
"
103,"What quadcopter is it? Most have RTH (Return To Home, as in point where you powered it up from). It‚Äôll fly home if you switch the RTH switch 

EDIT: will also do this on signal loss, battery power critical, even (and I shit you not) GPS failure (mine had its GPS fail and flew home. Must‚Äôve mapped out the route home as it was flying out before it failed, crazy shit) 


EDIT: drones are for the military people! Hs civilians use quadcopters or tricopters, or... you get the idea. "
104,"I know, right? Be could've at least dropped the second  N to make it Norma."
105,"Just got to say, I appreciate the story being short, sweet, and to the point. Most stories on here would give you eighteen pages of description of your hand movement between the beans and the stabbing. "
106,"Your girlfriend, OP, is a keeper."
107,"Yeah, you should have asked, but letting someone with no training handle something so expensive with no supervision is dumb."
108,You ate your 9 month pregnant wife? Wtf man
109,[deleted]
110,"I went to high school with a girl who could do that. She could link her fingers together behind her back and swing them all the way around to the front in a smooth motion. If she stopped halfway, you could see the way her shoulders contorted to let it happen.  Or she‚Äôd go back and forth across that ‚Äòdislocating‚Äô point, and they‚Äôd *pop-pop-pop* between normal and freak looking. Gross but pretty cool. "
111,Did this happen in Florida by chance? A drone randomly landed from out of the sky last weekend at my job site
112,"Wrong title.

TIFU by dating Sally"
113,"I'm 42, and no one can tell me how I got COPD so bad so young. It's most likely something genetic, but it's not CF and it's not A1A deficiency, so they're stumped.

And yes, the testing was to make sure I qualified for a transplant and to help figure out where to put me on the list. Over the course of 4 days I had 11 tests and 7 consultations, which is in addition to all the tests they do to pre-qualify you. The good news is, if there was **anything** wrong with me, someone would have found it by now."
114,thank you!
115,[deleted]
116,I know it's not really my fault but I still feel bad about not asking for help since it was something I didn't understand. I took my best guess at the problem when I probably should have asked.
117,"No kidding. On one hand, I feel like it's not really my fault, but on the other hand, I still feel like a giant, gaping asshole."
118,If your eggs have embryos and innards in them....you need to find a new source of eggs.
119,This sounds like something out of a Three Stooges skit
120,Did snoop dog start playing as you put on your glasses and the word Thug Life appears above your head
121,Very true. Shoulda charged them 
122,I'm pretty sure any reading that is believed is a good reading. Your only mistake was bailing out.
123,But we aren't even married yet. 
124,Happy Father's day
125,"Plot twist: the ""tooth fairy"" is really just your Mom sneaking into your room at night after she thinks you've fallen asleep.

126,"The comedian Gabriel Iglesias has a [few](https://youtu.be/a77Dw3tNv8o) [stories](https://youtu.be/mtk5Ej-xLsM) like this. If you can make the cop laugh, there's a chance you'll get off easier.

Edit: I messed up the links. Fixed it."
127,"My girlfriend likes kinky stuff in the same vein. Scratching, ass slapping, light choking, etc.

One day during sex, trying to play into her kinks, I ask her if she wants me to punish her. She looks at me like I'm a monster, so I take that as a no.

Afterwards I tried to explain myself, we talk about this for a few minutes and then she realizes I said 'punish'.
She thought I was asking her if she wanted me to punch her.."
128,Holy shit a story on reddit without a fucking family tree of background attached that didn't use the entire Thesaurus and 60 euphemisms for genitals? You're my fucking hero dude.

130,"*Reads TL;DR*

131,Upvoted for the tldr
132,"no man, my dick is in bandages."
133,"This happened to me when I was 9 and home alone (it was the 80's) I read my book and the eggs exploded all over the kitchen. I panicked,took the pan, went to the bathroom, I burned my hand on the way. I put the hot pan on top of the bathroom closet. There was a lot of smoke. I put my hand under the tap, I turned and saw the pan had MELTED the bathroom closet. My parents weren't happy at all. I never got to stay home alone again."
134,To the land down under?
135,Oof... V4... 
136,"This.

If something needs fixed at the production line or it will fail massively and instantly then it wasn't fit for production in the first place.

Just because you have a guy who knows how to fix it doesn't meant the original plans don't need updating. "
137,That would mean there's 7000 like her
138,"You had set up tent. Why hadn't anyone buried the poor thing by then? How long did you plan to leave the body to rot before burying it? 

Too much that doesn't add up here. "
139,Why not it‚Äôs not like your gonna get laid. They are Mormon after all you‚Äôll have to marry one before you get any action 
140,"I get the feeling that you posted here because you feel bad and are hoping that people will tell you it's not so bad, etc. Except you should feel bad, you were an asshole for absolutely no reason and hurt three people in the process. All that guilt and regret means jack shit unless you do something about it. Calling yourself an evil monster is a cop out. 

Make amends (it won't be easy) instead of blaming your actions on a temper or  'evilness' which is just an easy way to blame something beyond your control. "
141,"thank you, kind sir. 10/10 would recommend YOU ;)"
142,I'm upvoting because of the edits. 
143,"Well that sucks. Sounds like you've got a case of ""shitty police"".

Become a modern-day superhero"
144,"&gt;And then beamed signals for 'gun fire'.

this is confusing to me. I get how you could detect an enemy radar trying to find you, and even how you could detect ""lock on"", but why on earth would an enemy weapon system send out a signal that says ""I'm now shooting at you""? "
145,Close one!
146,"You're a white guy named Chip, aren't you?"
147,"His $2,500 mistake could possibly open their eyes about how to train people to save them from someone else later fucking up $250,000 equipment. They should learn their lesson and move on."
148,"Are these battery of tests in preparation for your lung transplant?

153,This is interesting because we were actively discouraged from doing this when running track/ athletics. They said it made it harder to breathe and was better to stand up with your hands over your head because it expanded the chest cavity.
154,"I'm not saying she doesn't have the right to feel a little jealousy or insecurity, but to go to that extent as to saying you can't even talk to an old friend because you once slept together is insane.

155,"Oh I know, one in a million. "
156,Just get them back. Send text and tell them you worship the mighty Cthulhu and ask them to join your church. Either they stop contacting you or they join the cult. It's a win-win situation.

159,"Kind the Same. Played football from 8 years old until I was 22. Herniated a disk in my back, neck problems, knee problems, concussions. Now I‚Äôm starting to think my anger problems could be linked to all the blows I took over 14 years. 

I love football and even coached it. But I‚Äôm starting to think the damage it does to your body may not be worth it in the long run."

162,"I was approached by two asians in Helsinki, Finland. They asked me if I have ever heard of ""The Holy Mother"" and if I'm interested in hearing about it. I was like, ""sure why not"". So they pulled out an iPad and show me a video that tells about the Holy Mother. There was nothing funny in the video, but somehow I just burst in laughter. And I couldn't stop. The asians looked offended, packed their tablet and left to search for another person in need of holy purification. No shame."
